Fortunately, you don’t need a lot of “book training” to understand where this thing is moving ... Obviously, poverty cashes Universal’s great success at Wolfman (which was made just a year ago), it always finds - you can observe George Zucco in one of his patented “insane doctor” roles as a brilliant, revenge-seeking scientist Lorenzo Cameron. Cameron, who founded a store in the marshy lands, which I suppose is the Gulf of Louis, is preparing revenge on his four former peers, who at the same time humiliated him and forced him to leave his previous job. You see, they laughed at his claims that he could mix man with the beast to create an unstoppable army of wolf creatures that would be useful during the war. Fortunately, Cameron found the perfect test subject for his blood injections of a wolf - a cumbersome, childlike imbecile named Peter (Glenn Strange). Peter does not know at all what is happening, he does not ask too many questions and allows the doctor to tie him to the table and shoot him with what appears in his syringe. This leads to a slow change of a person turning into a werewolf. Cameron lets him out of the mansion using a secret passage, so you basically get a big guy (Strange was 6'5 ") dressed in a jumpsuit with a thick beard, hairy paws and a set of huge plastic teeth running around. part of the time. After witnesses see the beast and kill the little girl, the locals grab their rifles and organize a squad to track him down. Dr. Cameron, who can control the beast with a whip and also has a convenient antidote to reverse the effect, also drags Peter to the big city to try to find the professors who ridiculed his original theories and destroyed his reputation in the process. Cameron Lenore's daughter (Anne Nagel) is also hanging around the house, as well as a curious reporter guy Lenora Tom (Johnny Downs), whose first the desire lies in the fact that they are dealing with a prehistoric creature that runs vertically, (!) <br /> <br /> Although this is a typical click of the PRC in many ways, with inexpressive sets, cinematography and Ghosts, as well as a rather soft performing actor composition, it remains watchable thanks gistrionike stars George Zucchi. I have no idea why Downs got a higher score; he appears in half an hour and really has nothing in common, nor is he doing this so impressively. This is Zukko’s show, and he ravages and ravages wonderfully, talking to himself, fantasizing that he is talking to his peers (“I’m not interested in your silly utterances!”) And temporarily falls into common sense. It seems strange that his performance in the role of a cheerful, naive and sluggish midfield village bug around all the work of Lon Cheney Jr., starting with Lenny in the film “Mice and Men”, before his performance in the role of the above-mentioned MAN-WOLF. In any case, Strange and Zucco do a good job with each other. My favorite part is when Zucco calls him his “guinea pig” in front of a colleague, and Peter sits and smiles, staring at the door handle. Some of the foggy marsh scenes are also quite atmospheric.
