The film was pretty bad. This is not so much a script problem. It's just that the film is really boring in terms of rhythm. It seems that the film unfolds slowly and painfully. The story in San Franpsiho is that there is a serial killer at large who kills morally corrupt people (maybe I read too much, but apparently my nature) after San Franpsiho kills a couple of people under the Golden Gate Bridge we introduced one of the main characters of the film: Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's brother) as a crook named Bill Culp. Currently, Bill is trying to track down the killer (seriously, he has no name, he is just “The Killer”), and he is trying to get a local news reporter named Rita to help him in his investigation, Bill is a stereotypical journalist. A clipped policeman, and he threatens Rita to throw her in jail for obstructing justice. In any case, several scenes pass, and suddenly Rita finds a letter left by a psychopath (he is a cold-blooded psychopath!), And she changes her mind, tells Bill and his partner Joe about it and helps them in the investigation. <Br /> <br /> The film tries to be a tough killer thriller, but fails in some way. This is very similar to the Black Dahlia film, it is trying to be tense, but it’s just incredible from the point of view of that. The film is trying to be serious in everything, but there are scenes like where The Killer is masturbating (obviously gore blood fan, with lines like: "ooo blood on her" or something like that) and Joe Estevez hit the table Going : “He’s a cold-blooded killer! I confess that I laughed at the film more than once, although I’m sure it was a deadly serious film. <br /> <br /> One of the positive things that the film has is the fact that I didn't pay the money to see it (Huzzah Netflix). And that's sad because I could see the good in their movies e The Damned viewing. Of course, the film had its flaws, but it was nice. Unfortunately, San Franpsiho does nothing for this. Of course, he has a good script, nothing special, but it could be interesting. Instead , you get a murder thriller that isn’t thrilled or even dimly pleasant to death.Also, in other reviews it’s stated that I’ve watched another movie in “a great twist that shocks” I realized what was going to happen. The ending did not shock me. I would continue to insult this film crash, but I do not think I will. In short, this film is a boring boring thriller (I use this term loosely), in which there is no “Hitchcock's thrill,” which another reviewer claims has a predictable end, soft deaths that work with all the emotions of wood planks. and a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I’m sure that others will try to protect it with the usual: it was a film with a low budget, they did everything they could, with such a low budget, and all that other nonsense. But when you came to this, there was very little that they could really spend this budget for, there were very few special effects, the soundtrack sounds like it was reworked from the Hood of the Living Dead or The Damned and it’s the same damn team of these two films. This film really reminds me of another low-budget film that was useless, and it was called “Mr. Jingles”, they are about the same quality, they are not capable of delivering something close to pleasure and should quickly disappear into obscurity.
