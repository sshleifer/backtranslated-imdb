Listen, I practically lost all hope for Nickelodeon after watching their new “hit,” The Naked Brothers Band show, and “ICarly” is no exception! If you have not noticed, iCarly is now the best hit sitcom on television! Hearing this, I decided to watch several episodes to find out what kind of deception it was! I have one word to describe this show as a whole ... "FOR FREE !!!" I CAN'T RETURN THAT DAN SCHNIDER WAS DOING IT LOW AND SOMETHING SOMETHING TO DO THIS FIXTURE !!! IT'S HORRIBLE!!! Let me tell you more ... <br /> <br /> The ICarly cast begins with a girl named Carly Shea, played by Miranda Cosgrove! In Carly, unfortunately, throughout all the episodes, in fact, there is no person, which you can say so! I guess she should be an ordinary girl on the show! (Because MANY people have army veterans for dad, artist for brother and popular teen web shows taped and made with thousands of dollars of equipment!) And to say the most about Miranda, its action is pathetic !!! She sounds like a three-year-old girl with Tourette syndrome at the sugar level in half the time! <br /> <br /> Next we have Sam Pukett (good GOD, where did they get these names!?) performed by Jennet McCardy! Sam - CO-HOST Carly's Web Show! (Wait a minute, if Sam leads the show with Carly, isn’t it possible to call the show “ICarly and Sam?” Sam has to be a hooligan in the cast! (Yes, because EVERY bully girl wears girlish tight shirts and pants with blonde hair!) Also, I think it should be a tomboy too. I would consider it a bit ridiculous, but it is her cliche that destroys it !!! "Give me a bucket of fried chicken", the pun is used too much TOO !!! !!! GIVE THIS GIRL SCENARIO !! !! and give her coffee, because, don't get me wrong, Jennett's acting is in order ke, but for half the episode, she looks like she is ready to fall asleep !!! <br /> <br /> Next we have Freddie Benson, played by Nathan Kress. Freddy is the technical producer of the Carly and Sam show! There is nothing special about Freddie say, besides, that he is a techno fan and enjoys Carly, that never works! HERE WE ARE AGAIN WITH CLICH !!! THIS WILL NOT STOP !!!? Nathan's acting is also good, but sometimes it seems excessive! He is too boring !!! <br /> <br /> Finally, and my most beloved, we have Spencer Shay, played by Jerry Traynor! Let me make it perfectly clear; IF IT WASN'T IT, THIS DIRTY SHOW SHOW WILL BE A DIRT !!! Spencer - the one who supports the show! Spencer is Carly's older brother! If you had a little five year old boy with a high level of caffeine and constipation, this character stacks up! Spencer also makes money as an artist! (Hmmm ... interesting ...) You might think that a professional artist would make promising sculptures ... yes, I just love sarcasm! HIS ART IS REALLY VERY WING !!!! I mean, what is the name of the sculpture "MERRY SNIFFMUS !!?" WHAT KIND!!? THIS IS MANY CREATIVITY AS A PERFORMANCE BY HILLARY CLINTON ON MEDICINES !!!! THIS IS STUPID!!!! <br /> <br /> INSTALLATIONS AND MORAL BAGS - EFFICIENT SAFETY BAGS !!!! These shows now tell children that stealing, lying, and being an asshole to their parents is a GOOD thing !!! IF THESE ARE TERRIBLE TYPES, SHOWING THEM THEY WILL FIGHT AT CHILDREN, I DO NOT WANT TO TAKE PART IN THE WATCH OF ANY OF THEM !!!! THIS IS THE BIGGEST PART OF CREP, EVER I LOOKED ON TV! BAR NO !!! NICKELEDON: “I am with you through you !!!!” THE END OF HISTORY !!!! 1/10
