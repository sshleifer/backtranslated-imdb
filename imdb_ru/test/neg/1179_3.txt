This film was really bad. At first they did not even follow the facts for this. Half of the film was composed, and it was more about the deputy, whose mother was one of the victims of Ed Heine. The game was terrible, except for the guy playing Ed Hayn, but itâ€™s not difficult to spoil the game of the strange guy, although I think it was terrible, I gave him three, because they started it with real crime photos. it was the best part of the movie. As soon as the film was finished, the film went down. The author of this film tried to revive him, but this was not required. The story of Ed Hein is quite interesting without falsifying information.
