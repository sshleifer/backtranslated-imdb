I was really excited to see Cold Mountain. Alas, like most films, which I am very happy to see, it was a disappointment! If it were not for this wonderful invention called DVD, I think I would have stuck my head in the monitor, I would be so bored! <br /> <br /> I carefully watched Kidman and Lowe when they met, because their characters were supposedly “meant” for each other. However, Lo had something on her face besides insane love, while Kidman seemed to count seconds before she could return to her trailer! Zellweger's character is Clampett's pure grandmother (as if we don’t understand this, a banjo with cornball balls marks her every entry), and so it was all I could not laugh about! Ironically, her statement underscores how rigid the hooks are. <br /> <br /> Ada almost starves because she freed her slaves; we will never know why. Even more puzzling is why none of them stayed, since Ada and her father were unusually benevolent, and (as shown in one scene) it was a very dangerous time for the blacks (as they are politely called here). Why didn't the neighbors teach her to milk a cow or grow a crop? Hell, why didn't she just sell the farm and go home? And despite Ruby’s practicality, when she sends Ada’s “evil” rooster, they don’t care that they have more chickens! <br /> <br /> By the time her lover finally returns, Ada does not need him or anyone else - this is a big joke! In fact, she may be physically close to Inman, but her real closeness is related to Ruby, who turned Ada into her version of Uber-Detka. Has anyone else noticed how they came down from the hill, holding hands, happy, like two drops of water in a pod, when they left Inman behind? <br /> <br /> I doubt that Minghella found out about this, since he was too busy doing antisun Bush film. Inman tells us that he "is like every fool sent to fight with a flag and a lie," and Ada's father says: "I imagine that God is tired of being called upon both sides of the dispute." These “observations” are historically inaccurate and offensive. While slavery was the basis of the economy of the South, the causes of the war were more complex. It was inconceivable for a soldier to think that the reason was a “lie” (in fact, most of the rank and file were indifferent to her). For filmmakers, capturing their views on a period when such views were alien to those who lived at the time is not just disgusting. <br /> <br /> Structurally, the film is intermittent and episodic. Lowe and Kidman are wrong and have no chemistry! The script is a little more than an unfinished dialogue, and a glaring heap of cliches and platitudes. "Little moments like a bag of diamonds?" Ugh!
