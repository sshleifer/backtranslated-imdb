Before you win international acclaim for The Silence of the Lambs, director Jonathan Demme cut his teeth creating freaky comedies. It was one of them, and, as I could mention, he, like many other American comedies that won an Oscar, has an excellent concept, a good pace, great performances, a complicated novel. but it's just not very funny. Pfeiffer is the widow of a mafia who moves to city waters after her husband (Baldwin) is killed. The criminal boss who killed him (Stockwell) adores Pfeiffer, his wife (Reil) is furious and complicates the situation. Pfeiffer also falls in love with a police officer who pursues her. All this was supposed to laugh a minute. Pfeiffer, a hefty sports wig, is excellent as a widow, as is hyperactive Ruehl, and Modin is also good as a good cop. But the script is simply devoid of single-line, wit, humor or raisin verbal or physical nature, which are required for this type of film. As a result, he evokes smiles at best than laughter. It exudes charm, but tedious little humor.
