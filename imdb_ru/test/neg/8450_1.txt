Like the aforementioned poster, I caught fire from the title, thinking that I was getting another Piranha ... This film is all that said poster, and worse ... <br /> <br /> Poor camera, lousy game and just terrible storyline ... <br /> <br /> There was very little that was worth watching ... As this film even came out, I could not do it. <br /> <br /> Make sure you buy exactly the movie you need ... not this one. <br /> <br /> The movie I bought was labeled Piranha, not Piranha Piranha. ! That actually is ... This is the only way they even sold this film. <br /> <br /> Peace Out.
