First, I am critical of this film because I really had high hopes, and instead this film sucked. <br /> <br /> * possible spoilers * (if you haven’t yet seen the show) Where to start? ? Well, let's start with quality. The film was slightly better than the original series, and the two battle scenes were very well handled. However, the CGI was terrible. <br /> <br /> Then there are holes in the plot and questions that still remain after the whole movie is all said and done. This film does not end with the successful completion of a very wide universe, known as FMA, and returns only to expand the universe even more before we have only our imagination left to decipher what happens in the future. <br /> <br /> And here is the biggest fault in the stories. Adding World War II and Hitler ... WHY? The series was perfect ... and did not need Hitler. He doesn't even need Germany. <br /> <br /> In general, the entire film wobbled about what a real FMA film could be, and if I were a director, I would refuse CoS and make a new, more “ending” ending.
