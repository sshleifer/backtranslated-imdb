I saw this movie some time ago, and I was looking forward to it. My biggest problem was to see the trailer, I was expecting a very stylish film about the marshal of the arts with a lot of action and maybe a little story to think about. I was very disappointed, as it may seem that after seeing the trailer, nothing else is worth watching (if you expect what is described above). My girlfriend at that time gave up halfway, and while I continued to look in the hope that something interesting might happen ... nothing happened. I found no attachment, no real interest in any of the characters. I would say, just don’t worry if you don’t have a few hours of your life that you don’t really care about losing.
