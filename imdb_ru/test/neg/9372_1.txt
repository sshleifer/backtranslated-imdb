Eliza Dushku is a very talented and beautiful actress. She manages to be a steady center for "Tru Calling", but this is not enough to save her show from mediocrity. It is a real shame that a woman as attractive and talented as Dushku should go from the meaty role of supporting “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” to this jerk. <br /> <br /> “Furious and desperately trying to be fashionable”, “Tru Calling” cannot excite at any level above the hormonal level. The heroine of the same name spends a lot of time running back and forth along some very small town to prevent the death of the beautiful corpses she had already met in the morgue where she works. Despite all the runs she does, she always appears as if she just came out of an air-conditioned portable locker room. <br /> <br /> In each episode, Eliza Dushku and the rest of the actors struggle to breathe life into serene scenarios, but this is a meaningless exercise. "Tru Calling" just lies on the stove, looking lifelessly at the ceiling.
