On the positive side, it contains interesting information on a wide range of topics, especially those related to Himmler, the SS and their research department. He also has good piano music, interesting shots and excellent camera work. <br /> <br /> However, this is a very bad historical work. He does not have a clear goal, and everything can be summarized as follows. <br /> <br /> Himmler created a department in the SS to investigate the origin of the German race. They went around the world. They did some things and launched expeditions to all places ... (None of these ways was investigated, the results were not shown, and the arguments were barely refuted). They wanted to prove that the Aryan race and the German people were the same way of historical evidence. They found none. The members of this research group were leading professors, members of the SS and, therefore, were associated with the Holocaust, after the war they were considered normal and continued to lead German institutions. <br /> <br /> These facts are fascinating in themselves, but they are never explored in detail, and there are no consistent arguments in the program that either condemn these people or justify them. Also this is not the goal of the program, the goal of the program is unclear, it jumps from topic to topic. The witnesses, though presented as trustworthy, are few and do not support them. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this program does not know where it goes and why, and does not make any impression. The topics are exciting, but this program tries to cover a huge area of ​​research and, therefore, seems to not know what is happening. I would have avoided it. <br /> <br /> Also, the “Holy Grail” is a German lineage that has nothing to do with the Holy Grail of Christian mythology, except in passing. The references to the search for the Christian Holy Grail are made, but never performed. The title is misleading, and the content of this documentary is unconvincing and incomplete.
