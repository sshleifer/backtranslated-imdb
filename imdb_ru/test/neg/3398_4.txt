The incomparable Paul of Spain, the icon of the movie of the horrors of Spain, lends its talents to this fascinating, if not skattershot film. What begins as an action ends with a terrible story. All I can say is to just sit back and enjoy the ride. <br /> <br /> Our Paul is playing a cold-blooded killer hired by some dubious Japanese diamond-hunters (one of which is his flame that carries his child). ) strike a diamond cache from a belgian businessman. When it is done, the charm of diamonds is too tempting for Paul to reject him, so he kills his Japanese cohorts. His girlfriend, whose brother Paul killed, vows to take revenge and stalk Paul through the forest, shooting him and leaving him to die. However, Paul was found an egghead with two lustful daughters and taken to his estate for recovery. <br /> <br /> In the estate, two daughters, Silvia Aguilar and Azucena Hernandez, are fighting for Paul in his weakened state, with busty Silvia Aguilar decided not to lose to sweet and prim Azucena. But Mr. Nashi’s affairs begin to get worried, and he begins to see the ghost of his long-dead mother’s daughter on the estate’s territory. Connect it with a Japanese girl who wants to finish the murder of Paul, and he is attracted from both sides. <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (The story follows different paths and does not fully satisfy. The scenario creates a battle for Paul between daughters, but Sylvia, whose character seems energetic and unstable, simply allows Azuchene to win our Paul Lottery, arranging fights. Personally, I would prefer a ghostly appearance story to avenge a Japanese woman. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (You get a gunfight, a blasted kid and pigs who eat some poor smack alive. Dogs The mountain will not be disappointed with this click Nasi). <br /> <br /> ACTION: $$$ (Our Floor is, as always, interesting to watch, but he spends too much time in bed recovering from wounds. With him again plays juicy Silvia Aguilar and the beautiful Azuchena Hernandez, who teamed up with Mr. Nashi in the little pearl “Traction.” Both girls do an excellent job). <br /> <br /> Nudity: $$$ (You get very brief glimpses of both Aguilar and Hernandez, but they are strategically positioned while keeping zero bits. Full nudity is provided by two less attractive actresses: a Japanese woman stalking Paul, and an African maid who works for Sylvia and Azuchenu).
