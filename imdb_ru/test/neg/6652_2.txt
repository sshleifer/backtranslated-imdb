I can not believe that I watched this whole movie. Another Ishtar, in which I continued to wait until it was better, which never happened. The sound is terrible, moving from too low to hear conversations, to a loud sound in a matter of seconds. The plot is absolutely implausible, the actions are mediocre, although Keaton copes with his usual mental work, although participation in this role can certainly be considered negative. The director knows absolutely nothing about hospitals, drugs, science, or anything technical. "Sociopath" ???? I wonder how they came with this diagnosis? There are so many mistakes, nonsense, and other things in this film that if someone listed them all, he would probably set a record. Demerol as a general anesthetic? Motorcyclist on the highway, wearing an off-road helmet without DOT / Snell. San Francisco??? Paper walls move when tapped, helmets just appear from the air, guns point in one direction, but hit things in another, lighting appears and disappears, and there is practically no scene in the movement that does not contain any error. My wife, who works in the oncology department, finally left the room until the end of the film, so upset because of medical errors. I gave him 2 only because of Keatonâ€™s action, otherwise he certainly would have received 1.
