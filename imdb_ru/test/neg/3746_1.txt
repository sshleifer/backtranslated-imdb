I left the cinema, transferring this film after 30 minutes. I left two friends, pressed by a big fat guy, to bear the rest. <br /> <br /> As soon as the initial sequence of the film unfolded, I felt that something was wrong, and I soon stopped. I'm from hiding under my seat, shrinking in confusion. I'm not one of those who come out of films, no matter how bad they are, because they usually have some peculiarity, but they suffer from a bad director's catalog, a bad game (the “Bruno” character and the immaculate Jean Rochefort - in my opinion friends), terrible editing (in terms of theme and meaning), terrible soundtrack and image correlation, which seemed to create art, putting the wrong world of music in the image and scene at the wrong time. The worst crime was his complete lethargy and improbability (the result of the above-mentioned atrocities). Why was it so terrible? I do not want to spend more time explaining. I would say, go and see for yourself, but I do not want to fill the chests of this project more than necessary. Oh, the show had one useful feature: my friend bent over the rows of seats in silhouette with an umbrella hooked on his hand when he tried to calm down - more pathos, tension and entertainment in those few moments than 125 minutes is a sad hard effort.
