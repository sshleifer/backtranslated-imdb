I took this DVD for 3.99 on Roger's video to score enough points to get the best movie for free. In fact, I never planned to watch this, but he began to pull at my curiosity, and I finally decided to include a DVD player in it. The effects in this movie are terrible and cheap. Some of the dialogues in this film sound as if they were written by an oath happy 12-year-old boy. In some parts the acting is really stupid, and the action scenes are ridiculous. You will laugh at some points that were positive for me, because it was a little fun for me. The plot: some girl has a curse that makes her vomit, so some shaman should take her to Los Angeles, there are also two girls who are trying to smuggle drugs there, and several other people who do not matter conspiracy, not that there really is a plot at all. Do not expect anything from this film and do not listen to the cover, there are no 100 passengers and 3000 vipers, there are 10 passengers and 20 random snakes. <br /> <br /> As for the DVD, there is a trailer that is almost as ridiculous as the movie, the movie with the same actor trying to say “train”, and the deleted scenes are really meaningless if It was. Not enough to stay in this film, they must be very bad. There is also a very bad job at creating a featurette, which really shows nothing, except that the people involved in this film were idiots. I can't recommend it unless you want a really bad movie that you can laugh at with your friends. I give him 2 kittens out of 5.
