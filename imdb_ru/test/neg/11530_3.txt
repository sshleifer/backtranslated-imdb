Poorly shot, poorly edited, awkward dialogue, flat characters, unsuccessful adaptation of the novel. It really does not get much worse. Worthy acting and good popcorn saved me from an hour and a half - it felt more like three hours from boredom. Sometimes good good replicas. <br /> <br /> David is a stupid young man who never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. He believes in Chinese philosophy, although it does not seem to help him much in real life. David is a member of the gang of debt collectors, where each member of IQ below sea level. The lack of a script, as well as non-creative shooting and even worse editing, turn what might be quite funny into unsuccessful debt collection cases, like an amateur home reality show. <br /> <br /> David is renting an apartment in elementary school, teacher Haraldur, who, having rejected a couple of offers of his importance, convinces David that he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in Iceland. A badly missing script offers David nothing to base his opinion on. A couple of scenes showing that Haraldur was doing something that David could misinterpret would do the job. The potential of the film as a media, in contrast to the text of the book on which this film is based, is not used. <br /> <br /> At first, David’s connection with Haraldur raises his status in the gang of debt collectors, but the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world makes David show what his loyalty is. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is good, but then it is based on the book. It could be a much better movie. A good screenwriter could make something from this stuff. Unfortunately, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The game is generally good. Petur Johann is superb and trustworthy as David. Eggert Torleifsson doesn’t work too hard, but he does his best using the little material he has. Ingvar Sigurdsson and Michael Imperoli (in a tiny role) do well. <br /> <br /> The general opinion: what could be quite a funny and entertaining film about a stupid antihero in a gang of debt collectors becomes a boring, poorly processed film made after a bad manuscript. Looking at your fingers for an hour and a half would be more pleasant.
