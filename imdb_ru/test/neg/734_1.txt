From time to time, the film appears by chance, which causes you to doubt your sanity. We have just finished studying the novel “Northanger Abbey” at school and decided to refresh our memory of this uninteresting piece of humor with the help of the BBC adaptation. <br /> <br /> The funny thing about Northanger Abbey is that it actually makes you want to kill yourself. The film DOES NOT look like a book, for example, subtly evil characters seem to have become transparent stereotypes. John Thorpe looks like a dwarf on acid, and Isabella plays the role of a whore. Catherine, the main character, is the most depressingly stupid and annoying actress on God's land (she looks like a coffee addict, her eyes are like basketball) while Mr. Tilney looks and acts like a retired understudy porn. The plot derails at certain moments of the film, I don’t know what the hell the director was thinking when, for no reason, a 7-year-old black guy we’ve never seen before shoots the main character out of the abbey and starts to travel in front of her . Yes, that's right, the wheel. Such nonsense is sometimes interrupted by Catherine's "fantasies" in which she is robbed around the cathedral. <br /> <br /> Northanger Abbey is visual euthanasia, so if you want to kill your boss or something like that, BBC has discovered a new way to kill someone. Northanger is almost a ridiculous bad movie. Do not watch it if you are not in a soft camera.
