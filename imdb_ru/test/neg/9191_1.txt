This is actually an exercise to extract excesses. Dressed in tribute to firefighters, he contains silly scenes of “we are just a bunch of wacky guys” in the midst of “My God, this can be very dangerous.” Basically it's just dumb. You could not believe for a minute that real firefighters behave like this. It is so terrible that I could not look sometimes. If my daughter did not rent it, and then insisted on bringing it to the end, I would have no choice but to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The fact is that I am a fan of John Travolta. Each of his interviews that I saw only enhances my opinion of him. I think it was one strictly for the money. I am sure that he will be happy when this is forgotten.
