Bubbing under Showtime is a good idea. In fact, it’s more like two or three ideas that are constantly fighting for time on the screen. This film not only has its own cake, but also has it; he has a whole bakery. <br /> <br /> Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) interrupted a press release with drugs, interrupted by the media, and a cocky police actor named Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy). When partner Preston was shot, he angrily shoots the camera from the hands of a pesky journalist, and because of this he starts a new reality show created by Chase Renzi (René Rousseau). In the first of many mistakes and oddities in the film, this injured partner was never heard of again and was not referred to during the remainder of the film. <br /> <br /> De Niro's best idea is his speech in the class of students. Children to open up a picture of how television cops do not behave like real cops. It's funny that as the film develops, his character and Murphy begin to look more and more like the clichés they allegedly run into. In the smarter diatribe film, De Niro could play an ironic commentary; here it only shows how truly lame the movie is. Although the parody of the real police show may seem funny, the team of writers and director Tom Day (who made an excellent Shanghai noon a few years ago; watched this movie instead) seems to be unsure of himself and instead of clapping In the TV industry they do allow glow (the harshest thing they can say about network administrators is that they like to play ping pong at work). In the character of Rousseau glimpses of devilish delight, but her dialogue and actions rarely correspond to the enthusiasm of the actress. <br /> <br /> With a small amount of screen to hold my attention, my mind began to wander, and this is dangerous in a movie with so many holes in the plot. For example; If Showtime (the name given to the police show) is such a popular hit, why would nobody recognize De Niro and Murphy when they are at work? In this regard, if their investigation into the smugglers and all the mean-spirited Vargas guys is televised, why the hell did someone tell him that they were on his trail? Again, given the actions of this villain, perhaps I should not be surprised; is this the prankster who is very angry at the helper for using his new supergun without approval, jeopardizing the deal, and then sending it as? Of course, using about a dozen super-guns to level the whole house! It is like putting out a fire with a big fire. <br /> <br /> Sometimes Showtime laughs, but the film’s length is almost two hours long. Worse, the really smart jokers suggest that this film really could play something if they added a few more drafts of the script. Murphy is spinning and talking as fast as he can, with minimal results, and De Niro looks bored because of most of this. After a completely unnecessary fight between policemen and gangsters (which does not remarkably lead to injuries and arrests), Rousseau's character shouts: “This is great television!” Perhaps this is excellent television, but this is not a great movie.
