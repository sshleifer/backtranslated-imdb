I just watched this "latest" version of Macbeth and was pleasantly surprised by the solid action and the obvious efforts that were to turn a low-budget historical play into a full-fledged film to watch. <br /> <br /> However, one note music was very lame and did not add anything to the intensity of the film and sounded like someone with a keyboard and a bunch of samplers, unlike a full orchestral score. I think Paul Farrer should collect his act !!!
