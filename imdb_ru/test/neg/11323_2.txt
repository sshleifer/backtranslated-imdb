Trite and tedious, the one-liners almost made me cry. My 4-year-old boy left the room and finished doing the riddle. I do not know for what age group it was written, but the author himself did not even want a loan. As for the song, it is slightly funny. At least it was ten years ago. There are a lot of Christmas movies to watch. Although I have seen many times, they are still pleasant. Whenever this happens, I try to encourage my child to see something else. One positive thing that allowed to vote 2 instead of 1 is that it encourages good moral values. It would be encouraging if someone watched.
