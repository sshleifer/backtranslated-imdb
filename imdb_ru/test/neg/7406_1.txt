I can not believe how bad this "movie". To begin with, the film tells about the legend of Big Foot and about a group of people who are closely acquainted with the creature. The premise is interesting, and Lans Henriksen in the cast (The Strangers) gave Untold a promising perspective. Unfortunately, it is as interesting as it turns out. This is like a direct DVD release ... or so, I think. This is basically an unproductive romance with probably the worst montage (with a constant “disappearing to black” between every scene !!!) I've seen in my life, and actions that will surely make you cringe. Why Lance Henriksen chose this, completely bottomless. And the film takes cues from almost any other genre film, from "Blair Witch Project" (Video scene) and "Predator", to "Alive". Supposedly, this is based on real events, but the only truth that can be found in this document is how bad the film is. I usually am not a sharp critic and, believe me, I tried to get pleasure from this garbage, but in the end I did not. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this DVD. <br /> <br /> I will try to say softly: this film is NET garbage, and it made me want to take my gun and shoot my neighbors ... or ask BLOCKBUSTER to return the money !!! <br /> <br /> And Lance, shame on you! 1 * of 10 *
