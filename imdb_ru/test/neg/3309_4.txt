Like many other people, I heard about “more” and wanted to watch it because of the music written by Pink Floyd. I must say that I was really disappointed not because of the music, but because of the film itself. This is a boring tasteless film that lacks rhythm. Where does this frustration come from? For me, from different things. First of all, the theme of the film, drugs are badly connected with the idle sunny atmosphere of the film. This should have happened in the dirty areas of Paris and should have led to a dark and helpless climate, for example. Moreover, he must describe a descent into hell, but this descent is softened and barely outlined. Barbet Schroeder insists not enough on the dramatic side of the story. You could wish for a little more madness, cutting. On the other hand, Schroeder is not able to get the emotions and commitment of the audience to the suffering of the two main characters. You look carelessly at your drug tests. Considering that the two main actors are completely inexpressive and hardly develop during the film, especially Mimsey Farmer. In the end, you save only the beauty of the Mediterranean landscapes, flooded with sunlight. The film made a huge sensation when it was released in 1969. Currently it seems outdated. Hippie culture is nothing more than a distant memory.
