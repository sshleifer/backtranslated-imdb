I actually belong to the demographic Zoey 101, specifically trying to aim, so I see that, despite the fact that she is trying to be correlated with people of my age, the premise is simply too ridiculous for an ordinary person. The show revolves around the richest existing boarding school and the beautiful, incredibly tanned, attractive gang of one-sided characters who inhabit it. Traditionally, among children's networks, the cast is a lot of skinny white children, with a black guy, of course. <br /> <br /> All storylines revolve around Zoe and her group of friends, stumbling or creating some small dilemma, for example, reluctance to attend classes in the gym, as a result of which Zoe developed a scheme to save the day for all her friends As a rule, this is a B-line, revolving around a one-sided guest character or placing support characters in completely unrealistic situations, such as the presence of wasps hive in a dorm room, and no one notices. These plots often reproduce stereotypes, such as any character who gets good grades in math, by default must completely lack social skills. Most episodes have a continuous and excessive will - they will not - they dynamically pursue Zoe. <br /> <br /> All characters, unfortunately, are incredibly one-sided; there is Zoe, the perfect girlfriend with literally everything, Chase, constantly loving as before, but pretty charming best friend, Michael, a symbolic black guy (thanks to Christopher Massey for controlling some really funny players), Lola, theatrical chick (which means she dies from hairstyles, and 75% of her talk is about her dreams of fame, despite the fact that she never does anything in a real theater), Logan, a narcissist womanizer, Dustin, a spasmodic younger brother and Quinn Geek A few words that I spent on each of these characters summarize each character entirely. <br /> <br /> Zoe 101 sometimes manages to entertain, but the serious flaws in the value system she promotes are a major turn. Zoe, who is set up as an obvious role model and quasi-feminist crusader and who is depicted as flawless on the surface, still controls the main character flaws. For example, when Lola was first introduced, she was considered a Gothic girl. Zoe tried to use this as an excuse to kick her out of the dorm common room for being “fancy”. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it’s clear that Jamie Lynn Spears got this role because of her name, and not because of her talent. Although she has definitely improved over time, it is clear that she is not a born actress, which greatly affects the quality of the show, since most of the plot lines revolve around her character. Supporting composition is surprisingly good, especially considering the material with which they have to work. They bring a lot of good single-line texts for comic relief, if the plot has not yet decided on obscurity. <br /> <br /> In general, Zoe 101 is a mistaken view of life in high school, and anyone in the past. Their limited years should not expect much from this.
