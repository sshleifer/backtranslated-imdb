Do you know what farmers spray in the fields? That's right - dung, so when the BBC decided to make a widely promoted thriller about the GMO and farming plot, what we got was one of the most unpleasant manure that BBC inflicted on its audience <br /> <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> “GOLD ZONES” are opened by a group of masked scientists in a laboratory, where a woman scientist (according to the right to a fashionable BBC all female scientists) announces “A new wheat variety” that will save the third world from hunger ", then the story switches to a different, equally soft scene. If you are going to do any type of thriller, shouldn't you open the hook that captures the audience? The doctor who was brilliant in this, like X-FILES, while 28 days later opened with a hook that took place in the laboratory. I think that someone on the BBC is not Died that this thriller needed a hook, because the viewers had trailers in the throat for several weeks. <br /> <br /> As the (not very exciting) story continues, a couple of journalists (One of them is a drunk man whose morality is lower than with Bill Clinton and Doubie Bush, at the same time another journalist, full of virtue, who investigates patients in the county hospital who can be beaten up by the “Murder of Mercy”. It is at this point that things start to get confused, as the journalist is threatened with incitement of MI5, and the first episode ends with the murder of the main ward MI5. <br /> <br /> The second episode shows that patients in the district hospital were actually dying due to infection with the supervag VRSA. This is when things go completely with hay. Throughout the GOLD FIELDS, the audience was inclined to believe that intelligence services and the company shown in the introductory sequence were behind the deaths - But they are not. It turns out that the bad guy is an organic farmer who produced the superbug VRSA in his bedroom, and the story ends with the help of camera shooting THE MATRIX, in which a drunk male journalist sets fire to the field that VRSA drives, thereby spreading superbug across the land <br /> <br /> I can not say anything good about the fields of gold. During his broadcast, I was a member of the Scottish Green Party and Greenpeace. Since then, I have abandoned my time in the environmental movement, but even now I am somewhat offended by the way environmentalists are portrayed here, and that the bad guy is spreading a deadly genetic engineering virus as a warning about the dangers of genetically modified organisms, this is very stupid. This is similar to how a member of the CND launches nuclear weapons in London to warn of the danger of nuclear war. I was also a little offended because the male characters were written like bastards, while all the women were very clever and morally superior to the men. There are also other issues with the script, especially regarding VRSA. If, unlike the screenwriters, you spend time and energy researching VRSA, you will find that it is completely different from what is seen here. Oh, and if you set fire to diesel, it will not explode like napalm. Perhaps the worst criticism of the script is that it resembles the JEEPERS CREEPERS structure, in which the last ten minutes contradict most of what it was before. While JEEPERS CREEPERS lasted only about 90 minutes, the “Fields of Gold” lasted twice as long, so it is doubly annoying and illogical. <br /> <br /> Footnote never makes a good theme for a thriller (Does anyone remember these films by Steven Seagal?) and it's time for TV and film producers to understand this
