(Attention: several spoilers) <br /> <br /> Sometime, somewhere, a post-apocalyptic film will be made that will not stink. Unfortunately, POSTMAN is not the movie, although I have to give him credit for trying. <br /> <br /> Kevin Costner plays someone credited only as "The Postman." In fact, he is not a postman, but simply a wanderer with a mule across the desert territory of Western America, devastated by some unidentified catastrophe. He trades with isolated villages, performing Shakespeare. Suddenly, a bunch of gangsters called golnits, the self-proclaimed field commanders of the West, descend to the village visited by Costner, and their evil leader, General Bethlehem (Will Patton) sends Costner. After long sufferings and numerous attempts to break the costter of Costner, he escaped, putting an end to a long fragment of the film, which could be described better in a three-minute retrospective frame. <br /> <br /> Now we finally reached the main prerequisite: Kostner, who escaped, finds an abandoned postal truck and delivers letters to the nearest town, hoping to get food under the pretext that he is a postman. Many villagers led by a young Ford (Larenz Tate) want to take part in this act of a postman who doesn’t fit well with Bethlehem and his gangsters, and Costner considers himself the unwitting and unwitting leader of the group of postmen in the war. with golnisty. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​“Postmen vs. bad guys” is not as funny as it seems. Holinists make a living by the fact that the villages they hunt are isolated from each other; Hollenists can destroy any village, but they cannot withstand all their combined victims. In order to unite, villages must communicate with each other, and thus a functioning postal system would be a big step towards disabling golnists. So it really makes a lot of sense that Bethlehem will become medieval on our heroic postmen. Unfortunately, the possible defeat of Bethlehem is not the result of the unification of the villages against him, but instead your old backup cliché, one-on-one fights between him and Costner. There is not even a real attempt by communities to use mail for collaboration to solve their problems; All mail seems to be the standard “Hello, Aunt Debbie” material, played for maximum sentimental value. <br /> <br /> “POSTMAN” is one of the most predictable films shot behind the scenes I've ever seen. Now I specifically do not try to spoil the films for myself, trying to understand what will happen next. But here we are talking about such predictability, which does not require effort; I just knew what would happen next, if I wanted to know. After the lion eats people in a prominent place, the gangster thug who is looking for Costner who escaped is sent to the bushes after the noise, and then we are “shocked” when the lion eats him. A group of dishonest villagers is surrounded and shot by a squad shot, and one of the villagers says “Last known words” right before they are shot, to my great lack of surprise. The covered statue shows what everyone knew was supposed to be there: Costner bends down to take the letter from the sweet child we saw earlier in the film. The man says to Bethlehem that no, sir, you cannot just take my wife; Bethlehem misses unsuspecting crap, although he is the only person in the theater who doesn't suspect anything. <br /> <br /> But it is precisely the rank, hiding sentimentality that really destroys POSTMAN. Olivia Williams, who plays Costner Abby's lover, is the worst served. She puts her heart into the material and tries hard to make it sound natural and sincere. She tries so hard, it's heartbreaking. But no one could ever make the words "I have a gift for you, Postman ... You give hope that it is a candy in your pocket" sound like all that they are. Another example is the scene where the cavalry costner boomed past the little boy, ignoring his proposed letter, only to turn around, stare at him, it seems, for five minutes, and then crash back to pick up the letter. Why didn't Costner take it for the first time? There is no real reason; it's just an invention that tries and does not give us a sense of delight, breaking the hopes of the child and then restoring them. <br /> <br /> Schmalz and predictability unite at the end when the Postman statue is revealed. I sat thinking, “Please don't tell me that they will show the statue, and then return to the scene with a cute child. Of course, this is too saccharino, too obvious even for this film. ” Then, alas, the music was swollen, and we really cut a scary little boy smiling when his letter to his aunt-girl was taken away, and I held my head in my hands and thought: "Somebody will shoot me." It seemed to me that thirty pounds of apple pie was rammed into my throat. <br /> <br /> Life. Bethlehem is a more humane villain than usual. Your standard post-apocalyptic villain is the most mean and harsh SO. in the valley. It is shown that Bethlehem is nothing more than a person inside who tries to make himself feel important by beating others. Although there is a certain threat sacrificed, Bethlehem is trustworthy, as are most of the villains. Unfortunately, Will Patton replays. And although we were told early that Bethlehem completely destroyed its last challenger in five seconds of hand-to-hand combat, the actual fighting skills of Bethlehem shown at the end of the film are absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is pretty good. Costner did better, but his Razzie was an overreaction. As already mentioned, Olivia Williams is very impressive. Larenz Tate as Ford does a sincere and trustworthy job. The rating of James Newton Howard is quite worthy, although it does not meet the epic standards to which the film aspired. But this is not enough to save this film. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 of ****.
