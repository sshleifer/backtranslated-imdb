Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. However, Mr. Scoutmaster is not one of his best. His patented trickster role seems forced and even unpleasant, not amusing. The film itself is filled with grim sentimentality. In addition, the viewer is presented with numerous unceremonious references to the religious faith and patriotism of the United States, which are more reverent than genuine. Clifton Webb does his best with a bad script. Edmund Gwenn plays another cheerful priest and he has nothing to do. In childhood, the main role is played by a talentless child who demonstrates a flat effect throughout the entire film. His only demand for fame as a performer, obviously, is a low voice, like a frog, unusual for a man of his age. However, as soon as you heard it, you heard it, and you do not need to hear it again. Unfortunately, he is in most scenes of the film. I find this child so annoying that I run forward when he appears. Since he has many scenes in this film, this means that I rewound most of the film. There were so many talented child actors; It is a pity that in this film they are not. However, Clifton Webb in a traditional wide-brimmed hat and shorts is an attraction worth seeing.
