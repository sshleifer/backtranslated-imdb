It is difficult to evaluate the first efforts of a writer / director. In the end, this is another movie that I wrote or shot. James Hunter wrote a story that was interesting, but suffered from an uneven flow. <br /> <br /> In the end, the idea that a man (Ja Rule) has to choose between the life of a thug and a direct act is common, and even falling in love with the daughter (Tatiana Ali) of the person you killed has already been done . To do it again, you need something original, and the originality in this film is not enough. <br /> <br /> I was drawn by so many favorites: Tia Carrere (Truth Lies, World Wayne), Pam Grier (Jackie Brown), Frank Langella (Dracula, Good Night and Good Luck) and Wing Rames (Rosewood, Daybreak of the Dead ). They did not disappoint in their speeches, but they had little to work with. <br /> <br /> Direct access to the video is becoming more common, but this does not mean that it is a waste of time. Perhaps the second occupation of the Hunter will be more enjoyable.
