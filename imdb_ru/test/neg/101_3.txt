I gave it 3 of a possible 10 stars. <br /> <br /> If you don’t like to waste your time watching anorexia, in this movie it's Carly Pope, who behaves like a harlot, do not worry. /> <br /> Carly Pope plays Sarah Novak, a young college student who is intrigued by the puzzle game that leads her to the subway tunnels under the city — a dangerous thing for even a well-armed person to go alone. <br /> <br /> There are various intrigues in the film - a strange classmate who seems to be pursuing Sarah, a cynical shopkeeper who runs an unusual place with a hole in the wall that seems to be in a back alley in the ghetto , a dumb moron who hangs around a cynic store, and a woman named Emily Gray, who is again in prison. <br /> <br /> Sarah’s father is a lawyer who handles Emily Gray's case. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, Emily Gray tried to drown a 12-year-old boy. Emily was placed in a psychiatric hospital for 5 years, and for some silly reason she was released again, although it is obvious that she is still dangerously abnormal. <br /> <br /> The only explanation that Emily ever gave her is the crime: I never sinned. <br /> <br /> It's all part of the plan. <br /> <br /> Well, my friend, do not expect ever better explanation than this, because you will not be.
