Stars Carol Lombard in this transitional film. This film is a typical example of a very early "walkie-talkie" (The first practical sound film was "Jazz Singer", 1927). Overall, the action in this film tends to be extremely broad and very melodramatic. <br /> <br /> The viewer can easily notice that the actors are still “playing” for a silent film, and this, combined with an overly pronounced, overly serious dialogue (it seems that, most likely, the trainer on narration and dramaturgy is widely was used to teach “silent” actors to speak in turns), creates several rather comical scenes that should not have been comical at all. br /> Carol Lombard's late great acting ability is almost unrecognizable by all his broad gestures, melodrama and energetic seriousness. <br /> <br /> Mainly interesting as the historical curiosity of that period, since it is completely unintended cost of the camp.
