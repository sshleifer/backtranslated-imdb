This film is the shameful result of what happens when: <br /> <br /> A) It is written, shot and filmed by an idiot. and / or B) It was rushed to production to saturate the Stu Ungar poker / hobby. <br /> <br /> The story is uneven from the start. Widmer spends too much time on Ungar’s childhood and not enough on some of the legendary stories — such as counting cards, escaping blackjack, throwing money as an identity card. He also misses references to other great poker players such as Chip Reese, Brunson, etc. The film is a complete mess from start to finish. <br /> <br /> If you need a more complete and accurate report, read the book "One of a Kind". If you think that the film is good, read the book and change your mind.
