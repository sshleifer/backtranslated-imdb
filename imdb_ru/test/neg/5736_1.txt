I know that many people will call certain films "the worst of all time," but I think Redneck claims this prize. The combination of the rather terrible act of Mark Lester and Telly Savales and the development of the plot, defying faith. <br /> <br /> On Telli Savels: was he drunk when he acted in this? He seems to be playing a frowning, laughing madman without a sense of conviction. Maybe he mixed the medicine with his whiskey, I don't know. <br /> <br /> About Mark Lester: A view that is more wooden than in a carpenterâ€™s workshop. His trimmed British tones do not belong to this film; and his transformation from a protected teenager into a gangster disciple in 24 hours is insane. And the striptease scene with Mosquito has nothing to do with the plot at all; perhaps the director likes things like that. <br /> <br /> Logic of the plot: when Memphis and Moskito first ambush the car, why does Mark Lester's mother not do or say anything to get her son out of the car before the psychos chase him away? She just lets them go without saying a word !! On the other hand, you need to see Redneck - you will not believe how bad it is otherwise!
