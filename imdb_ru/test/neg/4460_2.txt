Veteran British television director Alan Gibson "Dracula AD 1972" qualifies as one of the least appetizing entries on the Hammer Studios series about the immortal bloodsucker Bram Stoker. In fact, this was the first time since Terence Fisher’s (1958) memorable “Terror of Dracula”, when Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing battled each other like mortal enemies. They would repeat the same roles a few years later in the final Dracula's Hammer: “The Satanic Rites of Dracula.” In addition, it was the second Dracula for Hammer, in which Lee acted as a notorious canine. For reference, "AD Dracula 1972" was the seventh Dracula Hammer. <br /> <br /> The exciting prologue of 1872 prepares you for something completely different than what the rest of this frustrating horror film gives. Eternal rivals, Count Dracula and his sworn enemy, Professor Lawrence Van Helsing, are literally holding each other's throats in a hopeless carriage in London's Hyde Park behind an energetic opening scene that makes everything else look relatively anti-climatic. The pram falls, and Dracula appears, hugging half a wooden wheel with broken needles embedded in his chest. Of course, Christopher Lee must press this broken wheel to his body, but the images are striking in their own way to get tested. The period of validity of the graph expires, as well as his opponent Van Helsing. However, one of Dracula's disciples grabs the ring of the count and takes out a portion of the vampire's ashes into the vial for preservation. <br /> <br /> Don Houghton’s script hampers movement ahead, one hundred years later, for the buildup of London in 1972. Meet a smart young man, Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neem from "No Blade of Grass"), who likes to raise hell with a group of hippies who organize parties and drive British police with their antics. Alucard is a descendant of one of Dracula’s servants. Now Alukar has a ring of earls and a test tube with his dehydrated blood. Alucard chooses the form of a defiled church to arrange a black mass. He invites his fashionable friends, including Laura (super sexy Karolina Munro from “The Spy Who Loved Me”), Geiner (Marsha Hunt) and Jessica Van Helsing (Stephanie Bicham) to visit this black mass because she offers them that something different. No wonder they resurrect the count, and the evil bloodsucker looks at Jessica. In the meantime, after Laura's body was found drained of blood, Scotland Yard inspector Murray (Michael Coles from Doctor Who and Dalkes) called for help from the modern brainchild of Van Helsing Lorrimar (Peter Cushing). Dracula wants revenge on Van Helsing, taking the last granddaughter for the bride. Lorrimar tracks down Alucar; they fight in his apartment in Chelsea, and the young vampire is drowning in a bath of water. Remember, running water is as deadly to vampires as sunlight and crucifixion. Van Helsing finds Dracula in an abandoned church with his daughter in anticipation of the count. Van Helsing and Dracula tangle. Van Helsing throws Holy Water into Dracula’s face. The vampire falls into an open grave with a stake waiting for him, and he decomposes again. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the “Dracula of our era of 1972” is that we lack Lee as a graph, although we I get significantly more Cushing than Van Helsing. In addition, screenwriter Don Houghton keeps Dracula locked up in a dilapidated church and never lets a vampire go out into the city. Despite the small budget, “A.D. Dracula 1972 could be much better. The scene where modern Van Helsing has to record Alucard and write it backwards to get Dracula seems almost ridiculous. You would think that he would learn about this reverse spelling. If you are not afraid of horror movies, this one will make you yawn. From time to time, Gibson presents us a great close-up of Dracula with his bare fangs and bloodshot eyes, but this is about as scary as this chiller, and it says little.
