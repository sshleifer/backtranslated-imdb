The gargoyle begins late in the evening in “Romania 1532”, when a peasant woman (Daniela Nané) travels on her horse and cart, thinking about her own business, when from moonlit clouds above a living gargoyle dives and attacks her, she manages to escape from the gargoyle and happens in the castle of some description, where an angry mob of locals and a priest can do away with the Gargoyle, or so they think ... Cut down to today Bucharest, where two CIA agents Tai Griffin (Michael Pare) & Jennifer Wells (Sandra Hess) are going to contract tsya on the safe return of the son of a wealthy American ambassador from his captors. In pursuit of one of the kidnappers, Griffin loses him on the roof of a building, but finds a large pool of blood and no visible signs of what happened to him. Meanwhile, Dr. Christina Durant (Kate Orsini) and her colleague Richard Barrier (Jason Rohrer) are repairing the church, when church worker Gregor (Mihai Bisserikanu) informs Richard that he has found some ancient relic, they both explore and find a cave with many mucous cocoons. and one very angry and very lively gargoyle, which does not waste time killing them both. Griffin and Wells are in the business when they are reported missing and soon realize that the local legends about monstrous gargoyles are true when a local priest named Father Soren (Fintan McCown) plans to flood the world with them ... <br /> <br /> Co-author, co-producer and director Jim Vinorsky under his usual pseudonym Jay Andrews Gargoils is another masterpiece that Vinsky can add to his merit rather than. The screenplay by Vinorsky, Iona Ionescu, A.G. Lawrence, and Bill Munroe is shit uninteresting, boring, and as simple as you can imagine. For starters, I would like to know if there is one gargoyle left that laid all these eggs, because I’m almost sure that she couldn’t get pregnant. How did he survive this hole for 500 years? What does this have? How did the priest find out that it was there? Why no one has figured it out yet? Why did the priest want to flood the world with them? To rule it? Gargoyles are unlikely to take over the world, and then let some priest rule them like a king, and if they do what remains to rule? Just like the guys who wrote the Gargoyle, I don't think he thought about it so well, did he? No matter how I look at it, no matter how I approach it, from whatever angle I try to figure out, no matter how many times I try to align a circle, the gargoyles simply have no meaning, and this story has huge holes in the plot. , errors in logic and not so good to start with in any case. The character is boring and cliché, the action is repetitive and uninteresting, while the film as a whole is a real boring job. People do illogical things, and everything that happens is very convenient, for example, when a priest tries to convince Griffin that the Gargoyle exists, and someone suddenly appears and attacks them. The cave, full of cocoons, is such a robbery of the Aliens (1986), it is embarrassing, and the end was lame. A bunch of big ferris wheels at the fair was funny when a guy scoffed at the fear of heights above the boys and made him take it. <br /> <br /> Directed by Winsky cuts costs and steals footage from other films, in Actually, the best scene from the Gargoyle is a car chase through Bucharest, but it was taken from action movie Jean-Claude Van Damme “Maximum Risk” (1996) . There are no shocks, panic or atmosphere. The special effects are terrible, CGI Gargoyle looks like it belongs to a computer game and almost does not interact with live actors, there are many scenes when people look at the sky and try to look like scars. There is not even worthy blood to make this thing watchable, there is one terrible beheading and that's it. <br /> <br /> Technically, the special effects are terrible, but otherwise it's tolerable, the Romanian locations look like Romanian, respectively. The gargoyle went straight to the video, and it shows with a rather cheap look at it. The acting is not too complicated, the victim of circumventing the personality of Michael Pare is the most boring of boring heroes. <br /> <br /> “The Gargoyle” is a crappy film, in which there is nothing that a decent character would strive for. As far as I can tell, this is a waste of 90 minutes to be avoided.
