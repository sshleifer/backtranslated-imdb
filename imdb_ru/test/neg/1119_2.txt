The only reason to watch this movie is Sun Hee Lee, the amazing model / actress from Korea who plays “Lac mica flour” (give me a break) in this shitty movie. <br /> <br /> She is given a fairly significant role in this film, and she seems to be coping well with it, although none of the parts are really interesting or well written. Even for the National Lampoon movie, it's really stupid. Stupid humor is one thing, just stupidity is another. Perhaps I once laughed, and this is probably only because I was polite. <br /> <br /> Warning: watching this movie can be detrimental to your health for two reasons: 1) It seems to suck. 2) Sun Hi, Lee is so damn gorgeous that at first glance she could just blow your brains out. <br /> <br /> So do not say that I did not warn you ...
