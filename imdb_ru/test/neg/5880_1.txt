I saw * the star * of this film in the Daily Show and thought that I could tune in (the movie premiered at Comedy Central, then I went to the cinema). Oh, Wei! <br /> <br /> This makes "Shakes the Clown" look like "Citizen Kane"! Avoid, avoid, avoid at all costs. No laughter, not even a smile. This film will make your face appear in pimples, and your eyes will flash like the last remnants of Raiders. I can't even think about the worst movie, be it Manos or Ishtar. As called pythons, run away, run away! Why did someone get fired up when he didnâ€™t use his own money? The horror is that NOT ONE is a good line, NOT ONE is a good joke, and only ONE bad thing ... making this film. <br /> <br /> I feel that if done correctly, it would be fun. Like this, I need a new pancreas in order to tear so loud. Damn anyone involved in this parody.
