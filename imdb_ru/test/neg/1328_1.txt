Horror. The film about the Nazis - the Germans. Killers of babies, rapists of young girls ... What are they sorry for? What do they want to do thousands of miles from Germany? Did it occur to you? Fascists are now good Samaritans? Think, killed, tortured 27 million people. No, of course, they do not want. They were forced to Hitler, he gave each of them, and forced to kill: every fourth civilian of Belarus, all Jews, Roma ... Kill the Slavs. Facts: at the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, when they were captured by the fascists (Germans), they were impudent and arrogant. We are killing you all and so on. Since 1943, when they were taken prisoner, they suddenly became anti-fascists and peaceful peasants, who were forced both by Hitler and personally. For such films you need to put in prison for life for the glorification of fascism. <br /> <br /> If you want to see what they have done, still going to Stalingrad, then watch the film Come and See (1985).
