This script was slightly original when it was written in 1935, but the poor performance and inconsistent quality level do not allow recommending it. Some of the vignettes are absolutely terrible, and dialogue is never natural. Some of the plot twists were creative, but I was very surprised to see it so highly appreciated here in IMDB. Several scenes deserve attention, it's like a movie that can not fully entertain. If you like this kind of montage, run, do not go and get “Manhattan Tales” (1942) an amazing film that tells about the life and times of the coat.
