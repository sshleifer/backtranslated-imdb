Mr. Kennedy should stop the EXPERIMENT with bad movie scenarios. What was he thinking about? This is a film that should not have passed the “hey, I have an idea, let's do a sequel” stage. If there was a zero rating, I would give it, but I suppose I agree to a generous 1. Nowadays it seems that if there is something to do, the filmmakers will dig out the old hit and launch it. a number of authors and see what happens. (Hi, I said: “Run and run!” Kinda describes how I felt when this film ended!) Like this piece of garbage, the light of the day has ever seen me outside. It is filled with unpleasant humor, strange animations and jokes that do not lead anywhere, except in a state of confusion. If you are dragged into this film and someone pays for you ... well ... but it will still be more painful than a brick in the forehead. However, if you plan to pay your hard-earned money, find a better alternative.
