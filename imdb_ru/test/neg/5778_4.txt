(There are Spoilers) An ordinary slasher film with a story taking place inside and around this abandoned mine of God outside the almost deserted city of Satteril. After receiving a letter-card and a gold nugget from her brother Jared, Shadrach Smith, Claire, and her husband Nick Breman, Carrie Bredak and Shaun Hines, go to the village with four other friends and gold miners Arks and Tory, Steve Vastell and Sangie, and Hayden & Rox Ann, Rick Majeske & Elina, to make their claims. <br /> <br /> It later emerged that the fact that Jared had disturbed a long-forgotten gold mine led to the return to life of the ghost of notorious Jeremiah Stone Vernon Wells, and this resumed his kingdom of terror. Stone, or 49er, is one of the most mocking killers / killers in film history. The stone looks as if it had been buried for years under several tons of coal, and this hook cut people in half. After going through almost the whole act of the act, local hermit Aunt Nelly (Karen Black), daughter of Eve (Alexander Ford), who was also one of Stone’s victims, said alive that if they did not return the gold back to the stone mine, the crazy miner would never rest until he kills all those who still have it. <br /> <br /> Aunt Nelly gets enough time to tell her story before she turns into a human torch with a Stone and eventually jumps into a nearby stream. the film continues indefinitely when the killer miner rages and looks as if he is as scary as a burnt toast, and just as dark. Even those who were in the film did not seem to show real fear of him. In one scene, when he broke into Aunt Nellie’s house, everyone inside attacked, instead of fleeing, he made the ghost miner lose his right hand; Stone spent the rest of the movie with a miner's pick attached to his stump. <br /> <br /> In addition to actress Karen Black, veteran actors John Philip Low and Richard Lynch also play the role of sheriff Murphy and old Pritchard in the movie Miners' Massacre. Passable things, but nothing special, the film has a predictable ending, when the whole gold mine lights up. The audience hints to the creators of the Miners' Massacre that there’s no end to this insane madness, and it may well surface in the near future in a possible continuation, God help us all!
