**** Spitfire (1934) John Cromwell ~ Katherine Hepburn, Ralph Bellamy, Robert Young <br /> <br /> Mountain hut Katherine Hepburn (as Trigger Hicks) is a religious woman from the laundry. "Going on 18", she begins to attract male attention, and responds by throwing stones. The arrival of the dam construction team evokes romantic dreams in Romana Hepburn. She quickly attracts the attention of a courteous engineer Robert Young (as John Stafford), who coquettishly hides his marital status. Chief engineer Ralph Bellamy (like George Fleetwood) is also interested in Hepburn, but for various reasons; Mr. Bellamy wants to know more about Jesus Christ, whom Hepburn worships. <br /> <br /> After Hepburn uses the power of prayer to heal a child, others suspect that she is a witch. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't so serious, “Spitfire” could be more fun; This is an atypical and wildly unsuitable car for its star, which is completely unconvincing. Mr. Bellamy plays the best. However, the best feature is written by Sarah Hayden (as Etta Dawson), which appeared in the stage version of George Cukor, along with Louis Mason (as Bill Grayson). Will Gere (as West Fry), the “grandfather of Walton” in the 1970s, plays a small role. Unexpected ending helps.
