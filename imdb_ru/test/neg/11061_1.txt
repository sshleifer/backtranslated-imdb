If you are a little masochist and like to waste time, try this. I spent enough time watching it, so I won’t waste time explaining why it was so terrible. Keep in mind!!! Oh, I see that I have to fill 10 or more lines. That's all: every year or so, some people think it's funny to start making a low-budget film about scary monsters of the underground, which I hope will be a kind of hit. The cave is one of those. I didn’t have high expectations about this, but the game was so bad, and the production was so bad that I was seriously considering asking for a refund. Fufu ... another line on a useless movie ... Oh, I finished.
