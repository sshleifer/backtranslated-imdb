This film is to some extent based on Rob Halford’s exit from Judas Priest from the British Metal Gods and how the group replaced him with Ripper Owens, who previously played the role of the Priest tribute band. Originally titled Metal God, this movie could be something great. Instead, someone in an office somewhere who knows almost nothing about metal music decided to flood it. This film plays poorly, from the change of the name Metal God to the “safe” middle of the road “Rock Star” and the settling soundtrack. Having spent most of my life in a professional metal band, I was really looking forward to it, I was very disappointed with a few moments of the film. The soundtrack is NOT very metallic for one, and the end of the film is also lame. The film does have some bright spots in the writing and action, but on the whole it fails in the end because ... 1) A film based on a metal band must have a metal soundtrack. 2) THERE IS NO ANYTHING metal about Mark Mark or Jennifer Aniston. If Bon Jovi, Warrant, Def Leppard and Poison are your ideas about "heavy metal", then watch this movie. If Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Dio & Black Sabbath are your ideas for metal, watch this movie for a good laugh.
