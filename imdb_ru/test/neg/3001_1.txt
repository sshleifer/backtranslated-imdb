Northfork is what's wrong with indie movies. Despite the fact that their harsh comments and attacks on large themed studios will not be, this is a sacrifice that we make. For almost two hours I was tortured and suffering the film, which begins with the fact that I wandered, as a blind, in a new place, and ends without any new reason and, fortunately, dies. <br /> <br /> There are parallel stories of this detail of a dying city and a dying boy. Two men dressed in black (one of them, James Woods) must force the remaining residents of Northforka to leave before the dam opens and floods the city. In another story, the boy returned to the priest (Nick Nolte), who gave it to his parents. He dies and is visited by angels. Among them are Anthony Edwards in fancy glasses and Daryl Hannah in a fancy costume that reminds me of a pirate shirt from Seinfeld. <br /> <br /> Although this is the “plot”, this is not what the film is about. The film is about nothing. He does nothing, says nothing, does not go anywhere, and he has nothing to show. Perhaps, according to the plan, most likely due to the effect of the pretentious, surrealist, imitator of David Lynch - we are an important ornate film, don't you see - the direction style. The whole film is permeated with a gray, gloomy background, which, I believe, corresponds to the film about death. Instead, it just makes it hard to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie about people in black, watch the films “People in Black”, not too impressive, but compared to “Nortfork”. they are raised to Citizen Kane status. If you want to watch a movie about a boy dying, check out Lorenzo's Oil. If you want to watch a movie about the destruction of the city by water, see “Brother, where are you?” If you want to watch a movie better than Northfork, there are hundreds of them. If you want to watch a movie that is worse, there are only a few. 0 * of ****
