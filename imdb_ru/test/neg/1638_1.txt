The filmmakers have come for the Sandy Frank crosslinking job, which was made to turn this film into Cave dwellers for reprint. Now that everything is clear ... oh! Excruciating pain in the eyes. The Blademaster shamelessly jumps onto a van with a sword and witchcraft, started by Conan's clicks ... except that the van has not left the garage. So this Italian film is a stupid attempt to thwart the box office with predictable results. However, this would give too little respect to the director and the authors, who make no effort to maintain a consistent plot, continuity, any semblance of continuity in an era. Miles O'Keefe is not the lead man, neither now nor forever (Tarzan the Monkey Man proved this if Ator did not). Just an incredible picture and routine to watch.
