I don't know about the real Cobb, but I got the clear impression that the directors' goal was to try to soften his uneven edges and reputation, and not give us a true portrait of the man himself. In the film, in addition to several racist statements, he is shown as another stubborn, cantacker old bald one (he is so full of life!) With a heart of gold (more or less). This is also the worst act I have seen with T.L.Jones (he does not bring anything new or subtle into his stereotypical character). He just doesnâ€™t reveal Cobb in a way that draws me into a movie. Not for one minute did I forget that on the screen was Tommy Lee Jones, pretending to be Ti Cobb. Robert Woole was also not impressed. The "comedic" elements in this film were simply distracting and did not sound at all believable. Bloody waste of time it's
