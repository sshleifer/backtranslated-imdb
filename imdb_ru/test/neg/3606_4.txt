The return of the actors of the NEW EMPIRE GROUP for Disney Pictures is being performed, but this time Kronk (voiced by Patrick Warburton), who is no longer Ismâ€™s minion (Erty Kitt), is in the spotlight. Kronk started a new life and is very pleased with his role as a chef of his own restaurant. Things are fun, until Kronk finds out that his dad (John Mahoney) is visiting. Kronk is worried because he knows that his life will not impress his Papi. The one thing he always wanted and never received was the thumbs up from his father. A flurry of misses and a giant blast of cheese in the restaurant leaves our handsome hero very much in trouble and anxiety. To save the day, you need a little help from his friends. <br /> <br /> Other voices: Tracy Ullman, David Spade, John Goodman, Wendy Malik, April Winchell and Gatlin Green.
