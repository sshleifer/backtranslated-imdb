Hellraiser: Bloodline is just a so-so movie. I believe that this is the fourth issue in the series “Hellraiser”. <br /> <br /> I missed the beginning, and all I remember was a few topless and boxed-shaped women on a computer screen. But, using my wit and intelligence (and the “Information” button), I soon learned that the villain (Pinhead) was released from Pandora’s box, which, I believe, is the gateway to hell. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Pinhead somehow goes out of the box and terrorizes the Toymaker family. And it's all. Yes, and not to mention the random torture of various people who meet on his way. Yawn. <br /> <br /> In this film, what happens is that Pinhead captures the child, then brings the dog to his wife, and then kills a random person. Then comes the husband, blah, blah, blah. What's the difference? Why it fails because Hellraiser: Bloodline is too banal to be scary. Look at the pinhead minion creatures: a crappy dog ​​that looks like it has been turned inside out, two people whose heads and bodies are connected to each other (Siamese twins in a horror movie?) And some kind of person who should be a princess Sort. (I have not seen previous films.) Now look at the main villain. His name is Pinhead. Isn't that the name you call someone when they are stupid? He has pins in his head and hooks coming out of his fingers, and he has blue skin. I believe he would have made a worthy villain if he had not had such a banal name and a banal speech. Somewhere in the film, two policemen approach him and say: “Do not make us hurt you!” Pinhead responds, “Pain? How dare you use this word! I AM pain ??” blah, blah, blah, blah blah. It sounds a little cliche if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Don't forget the last part of the movie. Characters (and spectators) experience more torture when Pinhead attacks some kind of futuristic shelter. Someone whom we don’t recognize (he may have been in previous films. I don’t remember him at the beginning of the film.) This scene, in fact, repeats itself again and again: <br /> <br /> The security guard goes to inspect the mysterious noise . <br /> <br /> Another guard: “Oh, no! He is late. I'll go check it myself! ”<br /> <br /> After he dies, the same thing happens again. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS) That's what I didn't get. In the film, Pinhead allegedly goes to Oblivion at the end. So how did he come back for four more films? Are these prequels? Why he did not die in the previous ones? Geez. Manufacturers should come up with an idea for another series. (END OF SPOILERS) Hellraiser: The pedigree is bloody and full of scenes of torture, but it has little thrill or fear. Just forget it. Bad special effects with bad - everything else makes it more fun than good horror. <br /> <br /> Good: well, some people may first enjoy topless women. Plus, Pinhead's voice is pretty cool. I guess if you like ultra-violence, you might like it too. <br /> <br /> Bad: none of the above reasons make this film very good. Roots and repeatability are pretty bad. And who calls them a Pinhead villain? <br /> <br /> Feel free to send me a personal message regarding this comment.
