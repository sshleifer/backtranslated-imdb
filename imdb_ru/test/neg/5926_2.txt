I have to say, this is not very good. Polly Bergen is good at this movie. The rest is so-so. I am gay and, frankly, in history this time there are so many cliches that it is just sad. We started watching it, then we turned it off and decided that it would be fun to laugh at the rest of the movie. But as they say, the main idea of ​​the film is good. If he was rewritten with less fanciful lines and acted better, he could be really good. In general, I would not recommend it. In addition to this, it's cool, the thinking line is so lame. In addition, the fight in the hairdresser is ridiculous because it is so bad. The lesbian sister in the room with them, while they try to put it on, it is so strange, it is sad.
