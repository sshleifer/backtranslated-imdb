“Wagons East” is widely known as the last John Candy film since he died on the set. This is what makes him so sad: not only that Candy had a fatal heart attack, but also that it was on the set of such a disgusting film. Seriously, I do not know what they thought when they came up with this piece of shit, but the film does not have redemptive qualities. As if they took every unused script for stupid westerns, they just mixed them up and took them off. No wonder John Candy did not want to make a film; perhaps his participation in the contract was what he was doing. <br /> <br /> In any case, the fact is that Candy has worked much better throughout her career. To be sure, he has already completed the “Canadian Bacon” by Michael Moore, in which the United States declares war on Canada. Just stick with it, and you can say that Candy ended her career with dignity. As for Richard Lewis - who previously starred in the lead role with Candy in the absurd, but funny “Once upon a Time” by Eugene Levy, - he replenished this piece of shit, often visiting him at “Countdown with Keith Olberman” in the following years.
