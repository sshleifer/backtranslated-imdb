Before talking about my material, I would like to clarify a few things: 1) I am a chicken who doesn’t like movies about tiptoes (“Kate and Leopold” and “Someone like you” - EXTREMELY exceptions - Hugh Jackman’s ass). 2) I just picked up this one because I'm a Fichtner fan who was looking forward to see him in the bathroom. 3) I'm not a fan of Demi, although I think her performances in "Immortals" and "Some Good Men" were exalted and earned places in my VID library - also I think she's a little crazy (by no means everything still sleeping with Brucie). <br /> <br /> If this is a study of the character of an unrealized woman who lives the double lives of independence and happiness, then I would say that we have a narcoleptic melodrama. Marty: literary agent. Makes a 6-digit salary. He lives in a prestigious penthouse Manhattan. It is easy for her to read a few hundred manuscripts and fall asleep at the table to recommend a night escape. Or maybe go through the intersectoral portal? She has a career, looks, cool car, a great tablet, now where are the man and the children? Steps our boy Aaron - some real escape. Who are the architects? They are artists who can do math, dreamers who make real money. Aaron gives Marty a dream of security and fills a void where she obviously does not have confidence in herself. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the medal there is Mary, still living with her fantasies schoolgirls, while she is entangled in motherhood, Her children are her career and life. But what about Marie, does she exist only through her children? Waltz William, a Parisian stranger who helps her focus on one thing she lost touch with: herself. <br /> <br /> The presumed path of self-discovery and late maturity, thrown into some with longing and fear. a bit of a grudge against Marty / Marie’s own mother. It gets 3/10. All I can say is to thank God for the BPL multimedia division, I would not spend my $ 2.99 on it in Blockbuster, and on the title Harlequin Blaze.
