There was nothing funny about this movie. He makes fun of various sports films and clich√©s, but there is nothing funny about it. Most of the films that they parody, do not even fit into the film and in fact only them, so they can be in it. Non Chief Actor was well played, but this is the only good thing in this film. Also, the various cameos in it were pretty cool, but I have no idea why they would waste their time on this piece of garbage. Thank God, I spent only 4 dollars on it, because it is not worth spending money on it. ONLY watch if you have absolutely nothing to do or you just want to spend an hour and 30 minutes.
