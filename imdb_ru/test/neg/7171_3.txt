Willys starts late in the evening, as brothers Josh (Joshua Miller) and Kyle (Jason Horst) are relaxing in nature with their cousin Michael (Sean Astin), they decide to spend time telling scary stories ... <br /> <br /> At first, this is Michael with a story called “Bad Apples”, in which the school mocks a boy named Danny Hollister (Ian Fried), but the sinister new janitor Mr. Jenkins (James Karen) decides to help him ... <br /> <br /> Next comes Kyle, who tells a strange story called “Flyba,” in which an overweight bully with a disturbing fascination with dead flies gets what he deserves in a terrible perverted way ... <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Brian Peck. Willy has done little for me, and I doubt that this is also a lot for you. The script is strange from the point of view of episodic anthologies, instead of the usual three or four stories there are only two main stories and a few fancy mini-scenes like “urban myth” at the beginning, they consist of a person who orders food from. a dead rat in its chicken, a man who dies of a heart attack during the trip, and a man who tries to dry the poodle in the microwave just to explode. I have no idea what the purpose of these scenes is, but they add nothing to the film, because for the two main stories they are both weak. To begin with, they are too long, which is a huge mistake in films of this type, usually in anthologies the stories are short, sharp and quick with a nice twist at the end, usually involving people who get what they deserve. However, in Willys, the stories last for the most part 40 minutes each, which is longer than the average television episode, and I must admit that both stories were very boring, very interesting, and seem to be aimed at children. The first story is better to watch as a whole, but, as far as I can see, it does not end with a turn, while the second has a pleasant ending "just deserts", but the preparation for it is weak and prolonged for no good reason. , I really like horror movies with an anthology, so "Willis" is disappointing, frankly, brings the genre. <br /> <br /> Director Peck obviously worked on a small budget, and on the whole “Willy” is rather hard to survive, there are many continuity errors, and this is poorly done. There is no atmosphere, no fear, no blood, special effects are bad, and unnecessary pictures of the dirty toilet are shown several times. Overall, this is a rather unattractive film to watch through. <br /> <br /> Technically, The Willies at the edges is coarse, to say the least, the effects are far from special, and it looks extremely dim and grainy. Acting is bad, no one will receive any awards, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> Willie is a bad movie, it's not scary, it's not fun, it's not interesting, and there are only two long stories in it. Definitely not recommended.
