This film is not so bad. It is not even bad. It's terrible. You know that you have problems when Charo appears in a movie. She must have had a day off from the Boat of Love. George Kennedy, at least he is a gamer - he tries there. Actually, he's fine. And it's nice to see Martha Ray. Jimmy Walker is fine. There is a little better than at the airport in '75, but which movie is no better than at the airport in '75? What I liked about this film is that it had more plot than many other disaster films. At least they made an attempt at the sites. What really hurts this film is the special effects - ugh! Not too special if you ask me. This is a film that is very, very funny at 2 am if you have fun with your buddies and are looking for laughter.
