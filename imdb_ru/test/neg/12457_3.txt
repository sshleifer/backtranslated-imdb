“Pie” is a pitiful attempt to make a film that wanders among the Manhattan teens who explore all the usual things for teens: sex, drugs and classical music almost entirely without history, focus or purpose. Griffith in the film about 2 minutes, while Swain meekly moves through another in his long list of films. Nothing in this film works, and Wayne should think about real work. No one is recommended. PU! Ugh! (D)
