Jackie Chan's films are typical examples of how supply is more than demand. Well, frankly, what is the demand? In this Jackie Chan, what is his name, I doubt that he even knows, and he is some kind of race driver. Well, he drives at 10 miles per hour, and then the footage accelerates, so that I can do all the tricks myself. During the grand finale in which Jackie Chan wants to arrest the bad guy, beating him in the race we will finally see how shoddy this production is. The fights of Chan, especially at the casino scene, are decent, but when we talk about special effects, dear lord. And everyone should break in this race? Stupid. And here it is really unsafe for drivers, in the vicinity there is not even a concrete wall. And don't start telling me what a terrible story it is, I mean, this is Hong Kong, it was probably written behind a gun The viewpoint of eight-year-olds, but still, what a mess. I like Chen as much as the next guy, perhaps more, since I saw Rush Hour, but his backward cousin really should choose their projects better.
