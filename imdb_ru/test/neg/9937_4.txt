The first thing you need to know about Zipperface is that it was captured on video, so it has that special “home-video-ish” look that distracts you terribly and prevents you from taking it seriously as a “real” movie. And “Zipperface” really looks like a bunch of lovers got together to try a “real” serial killer thriller. This is not entirely true, but not as bad as it seems. The participation of a woman as one of two detectives in the case leads to the promotion of the genre of exploitation. Dona Adams gives an attractive amateur role in the role - her apparent inexperience in front of the camera somehow works for her. In addition, at the end she arranges a BIG battle with the killer. At first, red herrings seem ridiculous, but in the end they work - I guessed the killer wrong. And you have to wonder, maybe Tarantino saw the Zipperface guy when he came up with the idea of ​​"Gimp" for "Pulp Fiction." (* 1/2)
