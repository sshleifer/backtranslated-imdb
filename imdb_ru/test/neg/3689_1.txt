There are good films, and there are bad films, and then there is Moscow Zero, the film is so bad that it makes it possible to spend a month alone with an insurance vendor as an attractive entertainment alternative. <br /> <br /> With an incomprehensible story about the gates of hell opening in the maze of tunnels under Moscow, the film is a mess of repeated and meaningless pictures of a little girl running through tunnels floating around red lights and strange shadows on the walls of which can not increase fear or tension, but instead causes the viewer a reaction "here they go again with the girl (or lights)." <br /> <br /> Directed by Maria Lydon, which, for reasons that I can do only as a shame, was the film's Stars - the Moon. Vince Gallo acts in the role of Owen, an American priest who goes to Moscow in search of Sergei (Rade Serbedziya), a friend and colleague who went missing in the tunnels. He enlists the support of a number of local residents, who, with the exception of Oksana Akinshina, are all depicted by Spanish actors trying to depict Russian accents with limited success. <br /> <br /> On the way they cross with members of some underground religious mafia with leather upholstery, headed by a magnificent Val Kilmer, whose career seems to be in such a free fall that he resorts to appearing in such horror, and the minion Sage Stallone (son of Sly), who seems to have been thrown just so the name Stallone can be included in the tent of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition to watching the troupe, try to go through the tunnels with the help of a comically drawn map and repeat their repeating frames. or slipping away from a pale young girl, nothing else happens everywhere. The dialogue usually switches between English and Russian, with the actors often replacing each other in each language, and whole conversations are spoken half in half and in the other with the only obvious reason they feel that way, adding a frustrating dimension to the viewer, compared to with and above, trying to figure out the insanely folded story. <br /> <br /> The only thing that Moscow Zero is entitled to, however, is its name, which could give a more accurate description of this film, if the word Moscow was omitted.
