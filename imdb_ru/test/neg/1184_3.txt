I just don't get these reviews! I can't help but think that they are written by a LOG fan who will worship everything they ever do without wondering if this is really good. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the program, but I thought this movie was a meaningless project. I could forgive a ridiculous conspiracy if I left the cinema, laughing more than twice. At some point, I thought that it could only be me, before I realized that there was almost no laughter from the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> I didn’t expect a big plot (very few television comedies can take 90 minutes), but I thought that a strange part of the classic dialogue of the magazine or the visual joke (as at the beginning of each program) would carry the film. After 5 minutes of the plot of the 17th century, I begged him to finish (I knew very little that this would continue until the end of the film). It was just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I was just very disappointed and I don’t see the story being too kind to her, even if a few dedicated fans write enthusiastic reviews.
