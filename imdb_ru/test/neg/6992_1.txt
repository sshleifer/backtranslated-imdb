Everyone loves to watch a really bad movie someday. You watch it, laugh and forget about it in the next half hour. But this is not one of them. This is the worst thing that may appear before your eyes for a while. <br /> <br /> I would like someone to take responsibility for Dante - he really is the most stupid villain you can imagine: leather pants that speak with a voice and laugh at victory like Dracula 50s. How can someone come up with this guy ?? And the hero ... "Dragon" or something else ... my box of cereal has better acting skills than he (perhaps, than all of them), this is incredible. But the worst is the fighting scenes where you might think that there is something in it. They are so lame, it is beyond any description. There is nothing shameful, I just can not believe how this film was allowed by any studio. But I'm just thrilled. Watching this is a hurt for yourself. See this only if you are in a movie about the search for pain, in which case this winner will be the right one.
