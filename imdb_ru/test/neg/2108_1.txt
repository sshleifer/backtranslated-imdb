Seriously, I thought it was a fake when I saw her at the box office, but I realized that it was just shit, I can't even believe that I didnâ€™t turn it off because we all know that these snakes were not rattling, they were pythons and Gardner, the acting was lame, and I still can't believe that the ending is loll, if you watch it, just watch it to the end, it was really priceless better than the 6th sense, I don't even know Are the filmmakers really? I thought this headline would fly, the only time it works. it flies when I throw it in the trash ... just look at it to laugh, it was funny, stupid of all, do not buy just a rent.
