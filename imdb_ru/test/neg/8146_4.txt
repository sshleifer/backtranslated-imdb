Froggy is upset that he never has a big party like all other children. Spanky and the gang try to fix it by arranging a surprise party. Not knowing that all the scenery and preparations for him, Froggy sabotages everything, only to find it too late to know what the party is for him. Bits work, but I don't think it really works as a whole. Part of the problem is that we all know where it goes, and since most of the humor has to have some form of surprise for everything to work, everything collapses. In a strange way, I think the film just skips. What they really thought could be more than a flash in the pan. Worth trying if you lower your expectations
