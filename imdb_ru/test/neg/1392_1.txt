What do minority comedians feel today like to slander their minority and expect them to get away with it? <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is not George Lopez. There is a difference. When I look at comedian Carlos Mencius, I think he hates his people. And what's more, I think he was forced to present his show as the "Latin American / Spanish" version of Dave Chappell's show. What a terrible mistake. (Note to Mensia: Please do not make the movie "Block Party". As much as I would like to see Santana, Tierra, El Chicano, Christina Agularia, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira and the reunification of the cast of "Xica da Silva" at one stage - no .) <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia loves to use the word "beaners" just as Dave Chappell likes the word "n". Neither is funny or acceptable, even if it is from “its people”. Carol Mencia also likes to say: "If you are offended, it is also bad." This is not an insult, it is a defense because it says and asks to be accepted. <br /> <br /> Carol Mencia goes further - he does not respect everyone for what he considers a comedy. This is not a comedy, this is not funny. The ability to look at oneself and make others laugh at a comedy, and not laugh at imposing stereotypes that other races believed at first, is a trick. <br /> <br /> Mind of Mencia needs polishing because Carlos Mencia needs polishing. Find out what's funny, not something that drives more prejudice, and then do it. Before this show, Mind of Mencia is a pass.
