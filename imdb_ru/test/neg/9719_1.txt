Well ... before I even start a more or less constructive criticism of the film, I would like to say a few words that come from the heart ... THIS IS A MOVIE WELL !!!! DON'T GO TO SEE THAT YOU DO NOT REALLY LIKE SOFT BOYS AND WOODEN, NOT PLAYSTANTS. So let's move on to why I think the film is so bad: 1. There is no storyline. There is no plot. The director tried to create a mystery, but this feeling just did not exist. 2. It all looks like a big, hour and a half promotion for some gothic group "BSB", but all the guys at the school have a great press, there are no fat or ugly young people ... in the film there is not a single beautiful girl, not one. The main character is either wet in the pool, or all sweaty in his bed ... poor guy. It must be terrible to go on a date, sweat like that. 3. Can these guys do something good with their abilities? Something good? For example, extinguish the fire in this old barn or help your friend who has had an accident, instead of just breaking things and showing up in front of each other. 4. Wooden acting game. The main character has only two facial expressions. Expression number one: sad. Expression number two: trying to look seductive, but it still seems sad ... In this group of boys there are 4 guys: the main character, his best friend who was in an accident, the blond one and the fourth ... what was the name of the fourth? I think he only spoke twice throughout the film: once at the beginning (he said that jumping from a cliff using “force” would not kill them), and a second time at the end when he and Blondie lost a girl ... .. the film could have been made without him, and no one would have noticed this ... In any case, my verdict: 1 is the ideal rating for this film. Guys - do not go look at it. There is very little action, no waiting, no hot girls. Girls - at least the actors look good ... I would advise you, people, to get the soundtrack of this film - this is the only thing I liked about it.
