... ever! (I always wanted to write it :) Many years ago (in 1993, as I recall), one of my former classmates convinced me to see what he called an "epic masterpiece." To this day, he stands out to me as the worst film I've ever seen. Acting, history, effects - everything is bad. If you're not one of those people who just love to value garbage, you should pass it on. However, it is likely that, as you are reading this, you have already seen it. <br /> <br /> Of the nearly 500 films, this is the only short film I have given 1/10. <br /> <br /> I have not seen other low-cost Asian warriors, so I think something else is worse! Scary ... <br /> <br />: P
