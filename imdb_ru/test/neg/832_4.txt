Well, yes, I know that I am a Philistine, and I have neither the knowledge nor the love of opera. I readily admit that I could feel differently about this film if I did. But I'm not. So for those of you like me, skip this one if you don't want to look at pretty (sometimes naked) girls. Whatever it took, I thought that the first segment with Teresa Russell (which I did not recognize) was the best of all.
