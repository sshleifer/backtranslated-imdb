We need to say something about the state of our nation, that this program is one of the most popular ones currently being demonstrated. <br /> <br /> “Kvadrat” is inhabited by such a pitiful, unreliable, amoral, evil, relentlessly harsh group of characters that you can imagine. Everyone strikes someone in the back, everyone tries to commit adultery, everyone tries to deceive someone. This, or they were stabbed, stabbed or deceived. No one is cheerful. No one laughs. No one has dazzling luck or a really good day. This is hell, with accents on Cockney. <br /> <br /> I suspect that this program should be sponsored by the Samaritans. This is the perfect viewing for the depressed. It does not elevate the mood; what he does is represent a whole community of such hopelessly sad donkeys, that the audience comes to the conclusion that their fate can really be worse - they can live in “Albert Square”. <br /> <br /> Beyond the above; as a representation of the eastern edge of London, it is pure hokum. Software developers have obviously never been to the city. The first thing you will see at Mile End Road is a colossal mosque. And it pretty well defines the racial majority of the population. White British Londoners are a scattered and rapidly declining minority. The big ad, which is now near the Bow Road flyover and is sponsored by Tower Hamlets Health Care, says: “Eight out of ten community members can now visit their doctor more quickly.” Ten healthy smiling faces confirm the rays. Eight of them with dark skin ... <br /> <br /> Moreover, I worked with a bunch of Anglo-Saxons - I dare say “pukka” - cockney a few years ago. And I can tell you that I never had a more unpleasant racist experience. Every day was like a rally of Oswald Mosley. They could not walk for 5 minutes without demeaning any race or nationality other than their own, and in terms that were repulsive and obscene. "Fackin" Pakis "and" Fackin "Maceroons" - a small change in conversation. In fact, their entire (and extremely limited) stock of adjectives is focused on the genitals and their application. Alf Garnett was a model of liberal virtue compared to him. <br /> <br /> Any program that allegedly represented Londoners from the eastern edge of London in their true nature would be completely unsuitable for broadcast - even after the 9-hour watershed, Imagine the Ku Klux Klan script written by Quentin Tarantino, and you will find yourself somewhere near the brand. But when they were not avid fanatics, they were, at least, extremely cheerful. <br /> <br /> I don’t know how such a soap opera appeared. This imaginary island of white suffering has absolutely nothing to do with real culture. And if you are a relatively calm character, this will quickly lead you to tears of grief. Relatively ordinary actors pretending to be relatively ordinary chronically depressed with cockney accents - what's the point of that? <br /> <br /> Sad, dreary, relentlessly frustrating and ethnically absurd. The most popular program is clearly a sick and dying nation. <br /> <br /> Avoid her like the plague.
