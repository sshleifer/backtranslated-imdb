After watching the film, I feel that the father and mother are reasonable people, although not perfect. On the contrary, I do not like the author and his two sisters. <br /> <br /> Is the diary of a person an exact portrait of himself? Not. Most people write problems only in her diary, because she wants to solve the problem. Thus, a journal is always the more negative side of a person. In this film, the author judges the life of his mother from her diary. Not a wise choice. <br /> <br /> The author’s older sister is so ugly, external and internal. First, she said that her father’s second marriage is “unjust” for her mother. Then she said she did not love his mother. It means that she does not love both father and mother. I doubt that she loves anyone in the world. Her face is so ugly, just a reflection of her heart. Throughout the film, I feel that the author and his sisters lack love and respect for their parents. However, I feel that my father loves his children very much, even the author tries to portray them as a cold, deceitful person.
