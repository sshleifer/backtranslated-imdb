This is one of the worst films ever. There is a scene where they should be under water, they literally walk on the ground, and they add bubbles! Shark is a boring and just silly thing with a big slow computer. Antonio Sabato is terrible, I mean even worse than usual. How does this guy work? Directing is the worst, and in all the films there is nothing redeemable. I love shark movies, and that is just disappointing. Iâ€™ve seen the films of this studio before, and everything they do has some kind of star on the way to poor performance. I would prefer to see an unknown actor who cares about making a good story.
