This is seriously the worst film I've ever seen, right from the start the film goes straight down the slope with its stupid music, bad play and total absence or real story or plot. Even for movie B, it's terribly bad. After reading some good reviews, I thought that I would be open and watch this. But all the bad reviews were so correct. I absolutely can not understand how someone could enjoy it. I am a big fan of science fiction, and it was much more than I could swallow. Definitely do yourself a favor, go to another movie. They are many other best films that deal with this subject. YOU WERE WARNED.
