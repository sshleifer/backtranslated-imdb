Ugh. There are so many incredible plot tricks in this movie that they turned what could have been a good movie into a disgusting mess. The story is halfway decent, but the holes in the plot make the execution literally ridiculous. In fact, we must believe that the Secret Service would go against all common sense and would allow the President of the United States to be in immense danger. If this testifies to the type of thinking that justifies the common sense of the defenders of the President, then we all have problems. Roy Shader, as president, does a good job with his job, but unfortunately this is compensated for by the really disgusting game of Patrick Muldoan (who somehow continues to get a job in Hollywood, based solely on his appearance and extraordinary agility to grin at every regardless of whether the script causes a smirk). Maybe someone will see it and be inspired to make a good movie from this premise - or maybe someone will see it and say, “Hey, if they can make such a bad movie, maybe I will too!”
