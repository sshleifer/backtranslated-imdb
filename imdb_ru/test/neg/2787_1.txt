Some teenagers go to an old abandoned farmhouse, left to one of them by their dead grandfather, not knowing that there were several murders a decade earlier, because their grandfather signed a pact with the devil for a good harvest - the guy could not come up with something better sell your soul? The grandson of this man and his friends should be the next victim for reasons that are never explained. The stereotypical teenage son and his girlfriend, a black guy with a white girlfriend and two lesbians have to fight three frightening killers - but don't be deceived like me, it's not as fun as it seems, Basically it's just chatter about kicking the ball, oh how to smoke drugs, and the lead actor complains that he never knows his parents. The film work is terrible and shaky, maybe in some scenes it can be done on a video camera, which is probably good, because the scarecrow looks like they just came from a kid's birthday party, and, obviously, they could only hire two people to play three stuffed animals! One of the best films I've ever seen were these low-budget, independent horror films, but this one is just pathetic. The cast and crew seemed to have just been composed of a group of people who knew each other, had never played before and were not going to play again, and they had several thousand dollars (I can't believe that this film was worth $ 130,000 for make) and weekend free time in their hands - even the skinny scene of lesbians is lame. <br /> <br /> I think it is also funny that at the time of this writing, there is a continuation of this film, which does not even have someone worried about adding to IMDb. <br /> <br /> * is out of ****, and I rate him very highly only because of the thin diving scene, no matter how lame it is.
