Is it just me, or is it a horrible movie? I'll go with this HORRIBLE movie ... <br /> <br /> Well knowing that this is a guy's movie (usually defined as car chase, crash, shootout, explosions, etc.), I still expect a small degree trust. If I can't somehow believe the premise, the film DOES NOT WORK. Thus, we come to the problem with the "Attack on the 13th plot." <br /> <br /> Not for spoilers, I never give details of the plot. However, I will make an exception here, because the plot is so meaningless. The bad guy is imprisoned. 13. The friends of the bad guy want to ruin him. Surprise. The friends of the bad guys are actually corrupt cops. Pensive, restless, but heroic young policeman saves the day, romance the girl. Ugh. Yes, it really is SO simple, and it is stupid. <br /> <br /> “Plot Assault 13” takes place in Detroit. A good environment for crime and corruption (I spent 3 months there at the end of 2004, so I know what I'm talking about). Despite this, it is incredibly cruel and insulting to the police and the citizens of Detroit. I spent a lot of time in downtown Detroit, but I can't imagine the final chase ending in downtown Detroit Forest. I must have missed it ... <br /> <br /> There are NO refunds for watching bad movies. Save your money. In 2005 there were too many good films to spend on them three and a half dollars. <br /> <br /> FINAL RATING: 1 <br /> <br /> (just because I've seen the worst movies).
