Let me first state that I REALLY REALLY wanted this film. For the most part, the actors and actresses looked their roles and coped pretty well in their roles, but there was no real plot in the film. It seemed that he was so confused that he looked "stupid" that no interesting story ever shone through. In addition, working with the camera was often sloppy, she tried to work as a lever camera and failed miserably. Most of the time, the shots that were supposed to look cool ended up confusing. Maybe something was lost during the translation, but some characters were just ... stupid. Crazy cute boy who sniffs people like a dog? Uhhhhhhh. OK. Overall fat stinks 1/10. Not worth your time.
