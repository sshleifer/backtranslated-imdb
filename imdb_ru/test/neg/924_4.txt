When they announced this movie for TNT, I was excited. “Parody” from “Enough” by Donald Westlake was one of my favorite stories. After I watched it, I was not thrilled. I recently had the opportunity to watch him a second time with my aunt, and again I was disappointed (she didn’t like it either, and she never read a book). In this film, they managed to collect all the charm of the book and turn it into a dull mess. Most of the problem was William H. Macy. I like him in other films, but he played (Terry / Carey) Thorpe as a stuttering, incompetent yutz. In the book, Thorp takes a lot of Valium for his nerves, but almost always remains collected externally, which is part of the fun. Spoilers follow: They also missed most of the story (except for a 2 second look at the embassy), where Thorpe decides not 1, but 4 murders for the police. This is important not only because it is fun, but also because it helps establish the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the film, Fred's betrayal is, after all, not so much affected, because they don't seem so close. In the book, they become pretty good friends, especially on Fred's side, which makes him even more ironic, because he is the one who makes Thorpe's fall. Fred also suffered a bit from the casting, I love Adam Arkin, but he wasn’t fun, happy to be a lively upbeat detective, character trait that Fred’s book possesses, making it more obvious outside of his character to get involved with the evidence more shocking, Patricia and Edgarson were very close to the book, and James Cromwell was great, even though he did not look like Martin Balsam. The whole scene of the boring house on the boat, which was completely added to the film, was much less interesting than the police who discovered Edgarson's body after Thorpe sent him to Seattle and blamed the mob for death. Keith was fine, although she was mostly rewritten, and it would be nice to see her die because she was a little annoying. I do not mind the changes in the books to create films, I know that they are necessary because of the duration and complexity, but it would be nice if some of the changes in this film were funnier or smarter and not boring.
