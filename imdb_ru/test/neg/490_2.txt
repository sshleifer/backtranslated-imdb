Firstly, the genre of this film is not a comedy, it is rather a drama. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations from the film, and they still fell short of them. As some of the other reviews point out, there is pleasant music in the film. But if you want to listen to good music, I advise you to spend time on a live recording with Bon Jovi or Motley Crue, it will be better time. <br /> <br /> And the last thing, if you want to watch a GOOD movie in the rock and roll genre, I recommend Almost Famous.
