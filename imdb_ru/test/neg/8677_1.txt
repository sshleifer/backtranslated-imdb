I doubt that the one who wrote this script ever read Mansfield Park ... or, if they have, it was not very good. None of the characters are who they should be: Fanny is alive and aware of her mistreatment, while Sir Thomas, who treated her very well, seems to have accidentally fallen into Aunt Norris. In addition, the story from the first person from Fanny is completely inappropriate for both the story and its character. Fanny is not an entertaining heroine, and I would say that she is not meant for that. In addition, in the movie version, Fanny shamelessly flirts with Edmund from the very beginning, when they grew up like a brother and sister! Fanny Austin could shrink from some kind of flirting, and the novel paints a couple Fanny / Edmund in a very uncomfortable ... as it should be. Unlike some other Jane Austen novels (P & P, Emma), Mansfield Park does not rely on the strength of its protagonist. This is a completely different affair than others; it does not mean that it is a love story. I watched this movie because Iâ€™ve just finished reading Mansfield Park, and I'm completely scared of what I see; Miss Austin is rolling in the grave.
