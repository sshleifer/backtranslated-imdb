TANDEM is a strange bit of the Japanese pink genre, because it has the necessary sex scenes and a misanthropic tone that is almost necessary for these types of films, but it also adds the incoherent drama / dark comedy storyline that looks like another type of film. <br /> <br /> The film begins with two lonely guys in a restaurant, each of whom dreams of a previous sexual encounter. One is a mutual grope in the subway, the other is a rather typical (for this type of film) rape scenario. Two perverts meet and start talking after one gives a cigarette to another. They hang out in the evening and talk a little about their sex life. The film is intertwined with scenes of memories of male interaction with women who play a central role in their lives. These two men have a quarrel, and the film ends in a strange but predictable note ... <br /> <br /> I really do not know what to do with TANDEM. It looks like a weird pair anti-fancy film, but doesn't really explore the subject to any degree. There is also no particular typical extreme sloppiness that is so common in these types of films, so I cannot understand what the essence is. I also cannot say for sure if the film should be funny, depressing, or both. I think TANDEM might have some potential as a more serious drama film with a dark comedy edge, but as a soft-core sex movie that tries to be too smart for its own good — it just doesn’t work. I can not say that I hated it, but I can not say that there is something remarkable about it. 4/10
