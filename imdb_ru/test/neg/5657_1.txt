First of all, I would like to say that I am a teenager, so all this is sold to me, and I can safely say that iCarly is very poor programming, and the fact that it is accepted among both sexes confuses me. It contains some of the worst comedy attempts I have ever seen with a mediocre game to download. The supposed humor in the show is based on the repetition of someoneâ€™s lines with bad sarcasm, bad sarcasm, bad one-liners, and, well, in general, you understand. In addition, I have to say that I still watch Spongebob, who, as I know, will get a negative reaction, but this is quality programming with some really funny moments, but we forget about what iCarly is missing; Wit The show is about a young girl, Carly, who arranges a web show with her friends, which, no doubt, is a more enjoyable version of the Internet. It's good, but the show is just ... well, not at all funny, as mentioned earlier. If this is what children's programs have come to today, parents, show them something that is really funny; SpongeBob or Rocco Modern Life fit. <br /> <br /> Also, compared to his sister show, Drake and Josh, this is terrible what was meant. Seriously, please look for something worthwhile. Even for a children's show, this is bad.
