In 1990, I personally saw Katie Ireland - I was at UNT in Denton during the filming of the film “Necessary Rudeness”. Ironically, the voice she uses in this film is not too far from her real speaking voice. <br /> <br /> In any case, the plot is as follows: Katie receives a letter stating that her father had fallen into a bottomless pit in Africa. She goes and investigates the place of her father's death, only to plunge into the underworld, which is part of an anti-utopian nightmare, partly not inspiring fantasy, and inhabited by rejections from Plasmatics. This film really wastes the talent of Linda Kerridge, who, in my opinion, could have been someone if she had received that big role that was right for her. Anyway, the protagonist of this story, Gus, is a very lame Mark Jackon. The original is annoying enough from the start, but this guy is really a torture to watch. In the end, Wanda, who had worn a bikini and a sarong at the end, emerged from her shell. If you are going to take Katy Ireland in a film in skimpy clothes, it would be better if it was a bikini. In any case, the film was just bad and rightfully shot MST3K. <br /> <br /> Avoid this if possible.
