Three young students, Simona (Iva Krainz), Ala (Tanya Potochnik) and Zana (Pia Zemlic), go on a canoe trip on the Kolpa River, separating Slovenia from neighboring Croatia, in this 2002 Slovenian film Maya Weiss. What could have been the Eastern European version of the famous and exciting "Liberation" of 1972 turned out to be completely boring for me with flat characters that denied sympathetic identification with the characters. <br /> <br /> Alya and Zan are not at all convincing as a student, although Alya expresses a desire to be a writer, and both use what seemed to me to be an excessively bad language. Ala misses her boyfriend and seems to be just drifting in life. Zana, even less educated, is an adventurous adventurer who attracts other women. I had some sympathy with the relatively innocent Simone, conservative and stellar eyes. The very idea of ​​these three traveling together just does not work for me. The contempt that Zana and Ala show to Simone does not make any sense - why did they choose her as a travel companion, since they probably should know her behavior and relationships? <br /> <br /> All three start a carefree trip down the river in two canoes, not afraid of the news about the disappearance of a woman along the river. Everything becomes darker with a mysterious appearance, sometimes real, and sometimes, possibly, hallucinatory, rabid, conservative fisherman policy (Jonas Znidarsic). <br /> <br /> I really liked the scenes along the river and the small villages that the trio attended. This may be due to a lack of cultural understanding, but the film did not touch me. I was surprised to see that the film won several awards.
