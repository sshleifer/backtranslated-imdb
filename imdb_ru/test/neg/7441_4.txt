After which the advertised update goes and shoots through the head. Most likely, given the deplorable state of this film, the continuation of the film, in which it is clearly not needed. <br /> <br /> What is really annoying about Robocop 2 is that the creators clearly did not understand why the original was so good in the first place. Robocop (7) was a witty, bright satire of bad militants. Robocop 2 is just a bad fighter. <br /> <br /> Subtle dialogue, especially with regard to the tedious finale, it does not cause interest and does not possess the energy and spirit of the original. Fake advertisements, now a bit tasteless (“Warning: continued use will cause skin cancer”) seem just an afterthought. And calling the new designer drug “Nuke” is not so subtle or funny as the original board game “Nuke ?? em! ”<br /> <br /> Animation“ Stop motion ”?? the weakest element of the original is used more widely, while this sequel without humor does not include a sequence of credits, which makes it look even cheaper and hasty. Ah, without humor? You might say. But what about the funny mayor or how Robo is reprogrammed to put the banality out? Yes, these are attempts of easy relief, since Robo is tightened with a screwdriver (“we are just people”) for the highlight of the film, but none of them will cause laughter. Like the rest of the film, they are balanced and frantic attempts to have fun. <br /> <br /> In the third and final film of the series (with the original title “Robocop 3; 5”), Peter Weller left, replaced by Robert John Burke, who succeeds in an undemanding role. With muffled language and violence, this was an obvious request for the children's market, a robo-action figure strongly involved everywhere. Due to the fact that his public consciousness is too exaggerated, and the recently found nozzles on his hands and jetpack have become too stupid, the final film was never intended for a masterpiece. Nevertheless, the smooth direction of Fred Decker and the smooth pace make this viewing pleasant and carefree. <br /> <br /> Robocop is the movie. Robocop 3 is a sequel that you could see if there was nothing better. That leaves the second film, hanging in the middle, an imperceptible trace of the picture. A car with a franchise, which has nothing to say, except for the pound signs, which rang. Irwin Kershner is not Paul Verhoeven, just as comic artist Frank Miller and his partner Walon Green are not the writers who were Edward Neumayer and Michael Meiner. The tragic waste of a good, albeit limited, concept. 4/10.
