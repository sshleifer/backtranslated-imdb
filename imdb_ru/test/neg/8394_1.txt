When my friend and I went to see this movie, we didn’t know what to expect, but she assured me that he had good reviews. So I agreed with that. We entered the cinema, bought tickets and went to the screen. After a while, sitting there, waiting for the film to start, no one else entered the door. I was very suspicious, as you usually attract at least a couple of people to watch any movie. The film began eventually, and we sat there. After a while of very little dialogue and very dark scenes like “art”, I began to understand why we were the only people there. It was not related to the occasional clippings from the main story for the kids at the skate park, a story that in itself had no meaning. The child had to commit a crime when he did not, and if he did, then writing the letter is not the answer to anyone, and you should not feel innocent just because you wrote this letter, he had to be punished. There was no point in this film at all. I have no idea why we didn't go and got our money back throughout the entire movie. I tried to give it a chance, I think. There were few ideas in this film, and the performance was shameful. The writer, director and almost everyone who made this film should have understood what they were doing and stopped. This is an hour plus that I will never return. Sorry everyone who liked this movie, but ... it's so terrible, I mean, really, very, very bad. Well, at least I will never have to undergo this again.
