This film is a complete and complete waste of time, one of the worst films I have ever seen. And from me, it definitely says something. In fact, I would like to give him negative stars instead of simply evaluating him as a pitiful one terrible star. <br /> <br /> When I shot this film, I had an unbiased look. I find the legend of the Chupacabra interesting, and I like funny horror movies. But I draw the line in this. <br /> <br /> Act performing The lead man gives one of the worst performances in the history, looks and sounds unnatural when he says his poorly written lines. The main woman gives a slightly more pleasant view, but it really does not take much. <br /> <br /> Chupacabra ... well, considering how budgetary this film should have been, the creature was tolerant. However, he looks exactly like a masked man and a body. The mask is quite detailed and may seem cool personally, but not on the screen. <br /> <br /> Talking about the screen, you might think that they at least used the best camera. Looks like it was filmed by a video camera for a loud scream. Also not very good. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the one who wrote this abomination was thinking about. The dialogue sucks and just ... I can not describe how I feel about this. At least, no problem with the site. <br /> <br /> My advice? Avoid this at all costs. It's just not worth it. If he appears on TV and you have nothing more to do or watch, then * find * something else to do or watch. Read a book, listen to music, whatever. Just don't expose yourself to this. If you do, you cannot say that you were not warned. And for the sake of the Lord and the lady, do not give up this sucker. This is not worth it, even if you have the opportunity to rent it for fifty cents. Believe me, I know.
