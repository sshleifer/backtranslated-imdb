I first watched this show in the hope of a little laugh, a good game and a good storyline. Unfortunately, I did not get any of this. <br /> <br /> Firstly, this show is completely unrealistic. How can someone go to boarding school, where there are super hips, great location and almost no rules? Plus a sushi bar. Sushi bar. No school has a sushi bar. And what happened to the huge, ultra cool, ultra fashionable rooms in general? This is not happening in boarding schools! Everything in this show seems perfect. Zoe, looks great, has wonderful friends, should never do homework and is very popular. For me, this is more like a villain! I hate how they use so many clicks in this show, Example: Dana, a skate chick. She is completely ignorant and wears "sharp" clothes. Jokes are old, sooooo old too! I would not watch this show in your place, this is one of the most horrific shows I've ever seen, and I hope it will be canceled soon! Rating: 1/10
