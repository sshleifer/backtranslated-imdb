Less than the redemptive junk junk, which, fortunately, is free from the destructive actions of competence. Some northern idiots come to the deep south in search of confederative rifles, hidden on the legendary mount Whiskey. They are threatened by terrible mounds, widely bowed to "Liberation"; but it turns out that the fever is opposed to the bully of the northern marijuana trade. It is revealed so early that it is not even considered a turn. Women are locked up and raped in catatonia; instead of saving them, the guys run to the city for a sheriff who is lazy and does not believe them. I think that if my girl were raped, I would still take the shortest path to the shelter. This is normal, because as soon as they appear, in order to soften the villains, girls become more and more cheerful and jump around, if only the trauma were in real life. Also with a wilderness guy with a beard who giggles a lot. Not quite bursting at the seams of ideas.
