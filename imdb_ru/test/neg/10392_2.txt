This film was probably one of the worst films I have seen in a very long time. My friend grabbed it from the shelf in a video rental store and almost made me watch it — an action that we both deeply regret. Ehh ... where to start? Inscription, acting, quality? It all sucks. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly some of the worst works ever shown in the film. The dialogue was worse than I ever thought in a movie. A frank dialogue, such as “how are you?” If not written horribly, planned and obvious. The general plot of the film, the script and the way it works is HORRIBLE. As if the authors could not think of anything better, how to write a bunch of crappy dialogues and add as many sex scenes and naked people as possible. Only an almost good sex scene (between a preacher and a tattooed & peirced girl) was shot with such low quality that it looked more like cheap porn than a feature film. Oh yeah, and they never did a deal. <br /> <br /> Game? Horrible. x100. I think the only good actor was a short Spanish guy who played Miguel Del Zamora. And its part was written terribly. Worst actor? Perhaps Paul Cappellas, whose play combined with crappy music, a pistol and a semi-naked bluish-white girl running through the forest, made the film almost unbearable to watch. He even messed up his own death scene, which should have been easily nailed. Most of the others, though, were terrible too. <br /> <br /> The absence of characters also added to the overall film level. There were enough characters, so almost half of the characters died, as many people became obsessed at one moment, and then the remaining characters could not be counted on one side. Like ... 50 thumbs down. <br /> <br /> P.S. What is it with the culmination of films about exorcism occurring in the stable?
