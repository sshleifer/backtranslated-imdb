Watching this movie is easier if you consider it as a screenplay created by Starfleet Lt. Reginald Barclay during his dependence on the holoder. (Barclay is the returning Star Trek character played by Dwight Schultz.) <br /> <br /> Dwight Schultz is mistakenly considered to be Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer's character is poorly written, so we never see the depth and breadth of his knowledge. Instead, we see a shallow two-dimensional figure from a soap opera. Paul Newman is also mistakenly considered to be General Leslie Groves, but the problems of this film go beyond the fact that the wrong actors are involved in the wrong roles. <br /> <br /> The factual mistakes and great freedoms taken (with the chronology of events) so that the political program of the advanced screenwriter Bruce Robinson makes this film awkward to watch. Perhaps that is why this film found a house on the so-called historical channel. <br /> <br /> “Fat Man and Little Boy” combine bad science, bad history, bad script and mediocre work, creating a film that should not be watched by sensible high school students or students who know nothing about the Manhattan project. ,
