I am alarmed that people are not so critical of work that deserves criticism. There is much in common, both structurally and literally, with Amadeus, with the exception of Beethoven’s Copy, deliberately chooses the easy way, putting the audience in front of art. And therefore we deprive the world of insightful, intelligent and creative work. <br /> <br /> Now think about the following: is it not possible that the real history of the creation of the ninth symphony is really an exciting and powerful story itself? and equally so dramatic? Was Beethoven completely deaf, writing a symphony? isn't it more interesting? How was the symphony? Wouldn't it be great to know? So, ask yourself, what could be the motivation of a director to present a woman as a copyist? If there was a copyist, he would surely be a man. What was his story? (please try to be a little more critical here, even if you like the invention of a female composer). <br /> <br /> Fantasy should be much MORE than distorting reality in order to serve the purpose of the writer. For those who compare and justify Anna Holtz’s invention with the invention of Salieri’s statement about the murder of Mozart in Amadeus, consider that he confesses to the priesthood in a lunatic asylum (Schaffer uses this device to make a big impact on the film). "Beethoven's copying" could have worked if Anna were the fruit of Ludwig's inflamed imagination. But we must believe that it is “possible” ... Yes, and that Strauss was helped by aliens. <br /> <br /> Most of the positive reviews I read here are often an expression of the DESIRE the film should be good; almost deliberate amnesia. Remembering the film about how you want it to be, and not about what it is. <br /> <br /> For those who believe that fantasy justifies the means, think that you not only accept a low interpretation of real events, but also donate truth for the sake of banality. <br /> <br /> Finally, a short article about acting, which may surprise some of you. Ed Harris is NOT good as Ludwig van Beethoven. Does it shock you? He looks awkward throughout the film, very much like an actor dressed, but behind the scenes, and standing at a table of catering. Most of his lines are pronounced as cues, not as answers to Anna Holtz’s lines (that is, he does not listen to the actor). It is absolutely clear that the actor is disguised as his character, and NOT FORMED for him. <br /> <br /> Indeed, how many times should Beethoven throw his grave before we do it right? Ask yourself if Ludwig will approve?
