In fact, this is a terrible movie with several features that may or may not buy it back for you, depending on how much you want them. In the “discovery” of the “Red Green Show” for the big screen, the filmmakers rejected the rustic charm, carefully honing the decades around the episodes taking place around and around the Opossum house, in favor of the photographed thoroughly photographed “road film” with a scary fake-Hollywood “big” musical score and the deeply boring storyline, which is not embellished with enough good jokes to make it as interesting as even the most mediocre episode of the series. <br /> <br /> Having come up with a storyline that keeps most Possum Lodge members behind the scenes for most of the film and demands that almost everyone concerned be contemptuously mean to sweet Harold (who is the hero of the film; in this incarnation, the usually pretty crisp Red is reduced to nothing more than the role of Harold the offender), the only performers who really get the shine are Patrick McKenna and Peter Kelegan in the role of Harold and Ranger Gord who provide satisfactory large s versions of their little characters.
