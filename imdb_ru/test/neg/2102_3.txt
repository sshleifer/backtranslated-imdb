Snakes on the train start when a Mexican couple, Bruggio (A.J. Castro) and Alma (Julia Ruiz) cross the border in the US, then they illegally board a seventeen-hour train to Los Angeles. However, Alma's family did not approve of their relationship with Brucho and imposed on her an ancient black magic curse that turns all her insides into snakes, don't you damn life? When the snakes come out of Alma’s mouth and slide into other parts of the train, they begin to infect other passengers with the same unusual disease ... <br /> <br /> Edited and directed by the Mallachi brothers (although IMDb claims that this is just one guy who uses a pseudonym, Peter Mervis. I must say that I thought “Snake on the train" is shit, it's as simple as it really is. It seems that the whole movie was created and made in order to make money on the cult film Samuel L. Jackson's Snakes on a Plane (2006) by all the least-loved film producers Asylum, which specializes in looting large budget Hollywood films, this style of money and filmmaking is no more obvious than that of Snakes on the Train, when the film is shot just because the title rhymes with a more successful film, which is not a good starting point. Erik Forsberg’s script is nonsense, for a start, “Snakes on an airplane” was a lot of fun, while Snakes on a train is much more serious, and when you actually break it and look at it, it should have been much more frivolous. In fact, it probably would have worked better, as a substitution of the type Scary Movie (2000). You know something, I struggle to find one positive thing to say about Snakes in the Train, this is so bad. For a start, the heroine is rubbish, and one cannot be imitated with someone, the story is absolutely terrible and does not make sense (if people throw out all these little snakes, where did the huge ones come from? Why did Alma turn into a giant snake to the end? Why did Buzho kill the engine driver? How did he was he going to stop the train when he reached Los Angeles? Where did this typhoon come from at the end?), he takes himself too seriously, the first seventy-odd minutes are so boring and without incident that I am surprised that I didn’t sleep, and this is very, very a bad movie on almost every level. <br /> <br /> Director Mervis has only a few sets of carriages that look something like this, the film becomes very repetitive and boring to watch. There is almost no blood or blood, there are some snakes borrowing under the skin of several people, they will shoot someone, and that’s all. Special effects are also rubbish, the giant snake CGI at the end is really terrible and the less said about it, the better. It's not scary, there is zero atmosphere, and it's a bit boring from beginning to end. Real live snakes are also a problem, they are so obedient and not threatening. If you look at any scene where the real snake and the actor are depicted, the snakes never move towards them and do not act aggressively, but in fact always want to slip away in the opposite direction. <br /> <br /> Filmed in California, technically, the film is clearly low-budget, and this show, basically it looks cheap, because it is. Acting is not too good, given that the actors are given some material to work with. <br /> <br /> “Snakes on the train” are rubbish, sorry, but I feel this way and don’t really know how else to describe it. I really do not see what anyone gets from watching "Snakes on the train," it's really that bad.
