Square pigs as a way to efficiently use cargo space is the only and only smart moment in Space Truckers. Believe it or not, Dennis Hopper did worse, see The American Way, but this film goes far up the cream of shit. I think that the best way to describe the viewing experience is that Space Truckers will not please anyone. Too animated, to be taken seriously, the almost complete lack of humor and poor character development, almost guarantee frustration. A crowd of beer and popcorn could tolerate one viewing, but everyone else was warned to avoid the “Space Truckers” for all the above reasons. - MERK
