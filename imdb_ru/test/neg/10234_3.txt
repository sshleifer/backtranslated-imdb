Wow, this version of THE RACKETEER was hard to watch! Although no other review mentioned this, the public domain version I was looking at was seriously mistaken. The sound track was turned off for about 10 seconds, that is, dialogue and action were never close to coincidence. Thus, you will hear that something is happening long before you saw it - a very confusing sentence! The worst thing is that you hear a shot from a pistol, and only later does the guy get hit and drops to death in a taxi. <br /> <br /> Although it seriously hurt the film, it also made it easier to concentrate on the dialogue â€” and revealed serious flaws in it. The dialogue was simply terrible - often delivered almost without inflection or feeling. As stated in one review, it was like watching a play in high school. In part, this is understandable, since the sound was a new medium, but the dialogue of this film was bad even in comparison with other films of 1929 - really bad. And, like many of these early sound films, the film was too talkative - with a juicy and over-melodramatic language and simply not very active. And you THINK with a name like "Racketeer" that there will be some kind of action !! However, this is a really juicy romance - with very little action. <br /> <br /> In the movie Carol, the Lombard sits with an alcoholic musician. She herself ends up stealing to try to take care of him - and the crook, Robert Armstrong, comes to her rescue. When Armstrong catches her for fraud in cards, he covers her, and then helps her drunken brother to stand up - and, naturally, he falls in love with her. The problem is that as soon as drunk and sober, he also wants a Lombard, and she needs to choose between them. Wow ... recovering drunk or thug ... talk about a couple of great prospects! Overall, it's hard to gauge, given the lousy print I saw. However, even if you ignore this, the film will have many problems due to its poor use of dialogue and an excessively talkative nature. And ... it was too sentimental.
