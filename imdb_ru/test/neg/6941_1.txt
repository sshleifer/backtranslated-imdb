This film mainly uses marital rape as one of the main comedy techniques. Now I turned it off at the moment when he literally ties her to the bed and rapes her, but I cannot imagine how this eventually turned into something sweet and funny. This film not only squandered a wonderful cast and was invariably unfunny, but in reality it was rather cruel and misogynistic. How many people seem to find it, a cute family movie is beyond me. “I certainly enjoyed preserving these apricots last night” - this is not a funny joke when you know that this means that you are forcing an unwilling virgin to have sex with you in the hope that she will eventually learn to love him. Watching a spying scum is not family fun. I, frankly, feel worse because I looked half of this terrible "comedy", and I am completely baffled by these positive reviews.
