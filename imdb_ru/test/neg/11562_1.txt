The Mystery Science Theater 3000 could not bring any redeeming quality to the display of this “gemstone”. <br /> <br /> This one looks like a pirated copy of 80-porn cheese you could buy on VHS from the arcade on the 42nd level. before Disney bought the whole crushing blow and shut them all down. <br /> <br /> But wait - all the sex scenes were cut. I urge anyone to find the worst movie. This film can replace the landing on the water as a humane method of interrogation. <br /> <br /> No, I take it back - I would prefer landing on the water. <br /> <br /> The only credit this film can bring, in addition to being the worst film ever made, is to threaten the Middle East to solve its problems on pain of having to watch this film.
