Why Laurie Petty was filmed by a dancer, I will never know. Her acting is impeccable. Her voice is annoying. I almost cannot put into words how bad this film is. <br /> <br /> There are several references to “modern pop” in the film, which seemed very strange to me, considering that the film was supposed to take place in the distant future. It would not be difficult to make this premise interesting. Some better writing would have helped a lot. <br /> <br /> Naomi Watts appears in her as a techie with soft manners. I think they should switch roles. <br /> <br /> I will never know why anyone would like this film, unless it was a small fan. <br /> <br /> Try not to watch this movie. A complete waste of time.
