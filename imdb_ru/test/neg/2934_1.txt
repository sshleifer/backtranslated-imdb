In & Out made me want to vomit. I have never seen such a shameless movie! He seriously wanted to say that being gay is something beautiful and joyful, but does not know how to say it. For me, this is not a comedy, if only cruel, sick jokes laugh at something when the victim falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> From what I saw, there were four (4) major flaws in this film, starting with (A) Matt Dillion character, when he announces to the world that the former teacher, Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) gay Never mind how incredible that Matt Dillion's character won an Oscar for what looked like a serious role on the verge of collapse. But why should he say that? In the end, it was never a problem with Howard’s students, with his friends, with his family, or with his finances. No one. So why should he say something like that when it's not true? Moreover, why the film does not give us an answer to the question, why did he say that? The reason is that the answer is NO, but for the convenience of the plot nothing is provided. The second (B) flaw is related to the fact that the film seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is - attractiveness and sexual relations with people of the same sex. In this film, being gay is based on the sympathies of Barbara Streisand and musicals and a passion for literature. All this is based on stereotypes! <br /> <br /> Both of these shortcomings again occur at the graduation ceremony. Matt Dillion finds out about the excitement going on in this small town, and the film looks ready to let us know what made him say such a thing. When he arrives at the ceremony, he says nothing, and I wonder why in the world he then appeared at all there. He decided nothing. Then, when all the viewers announced that they were gay, I was so excited that I wanted to snatch me! These people stood in defense of Howard, being gay, making fun of all these stereotypes. What the film forgot, is that he used these stereotypes to show why Howard was gay. They are filmmakers just shot in the leg! But wait, that's not all! <br /> <br /> During the ceremony (C), Howard went on trial to lose his teacher’s job because people believed he would affect his students to become gay. The film tried to say that homosexuals NEVER recruited, and that it will not affect their students. But didn’t we see how Tom Selleck’s character endlessly puts pressure on Howard again and again, even to the extent that he unexpectedly kisses him to leave the closet when, in my opinion, there was no exit from the closet? From this film it is clear that homosexuals can be recruited. Then the film shoots itself again. <br /> <br /> And (D), when Howard came out of the closet, did anyone notice how the script silenced him to the end of the movie? I counted only three lines that he had afterwards: “Aha!” To his parents: “Hello!” student, and are you ready? Tom Selleku before the last gag scene. I may be one down, but the fact is that he is not allowed to tell us what made him decide that he is gay. I wanted to know what was in his head, because I never believed that he was gay. <br /> <br /> As a bonus, the film also includes some truly offensive scenes. The one in which Howard asks the priest in confession to give advice on what to do for a friend (his) who is engaged and has not had sex with his fiancé. "Does that make him gay?" he is asking. The priest replied, "Oh yes, he is definitely gay." Yeah. Or what about the scene when all the older women gather around and tell Howard's mother that she doesn’t need to be sad about her son’s deep, dark secret, because, well ... everyone has them. Then one lady admitted that she had never seen Madison County Bridges. Funny? Not! Since the film shows that it is insensitive and does not know how destructive for a family can be the announcement that one of its members is gay. I know. I have a few gay friends, and none of their families have taken it well. It was a bad way to dispel the whole situation. <br /> <br /> The last straw for me was the last scene in which they seemed to be getting married when Tom and Kevin got married. The camera turned very slowly to the front of the church when ... It was not what you thought! At this point, I was disgusted, and I could never forgive this sick joke. I have nothing against movies about being gay or homosexual. "Philadelphia" and "Longtime Companion" were very honest and truthful in what they had to say. “In & Out” simply shouts about political correctness, but has no idea about corruption in its essence. What I understand from the film is that if you are 99% straightforward and 1% gay, that is, if you have a slight doubt, you are definitely gay. As if gay is becoming a dominant feature in genetics. In fact, if you were told again and again that you were useless and stupid, you would end up believing too, right? This is what happened to Howard Brackett that he is gay. I left the theater sad and angry. Angry whole weekend, really. It was a seriously ill and cruel film, MIR 1997.
