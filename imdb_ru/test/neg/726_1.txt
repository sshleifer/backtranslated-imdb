I decided to watch this show and try it, but it seemed to me that it was boring and, more importantly, boring ..... Stupid. <br /> <br /> Too much sarcasm, and all the characters are boring, too much talk, and the character Lorelai ... just continues to speak and continue, and again ... In the second glance there is suffocation of characters, the banter does not work, and all love and romance simply destroys what is already a shitty show ... I can't believe that this show survived the pilot .... This seems to be a show that makes the line "Listen to your parents" .... There is no real drama .... <br /> <br /> The pilot should have remained ... and one pilot ...
