How many monstrous tree movies can you see in your entire life? Well, I'll go out on a limb and say one thing. This film is better to watch late at night, with 12 packets of beer turned off the sound, and you and your friends are preparing a dialogue. <br /> <br /> On a Pacific island, a young man was sentenced to death for talking to "evil Americans." (It seems his loving wife was sleeping with a sorcerer, and they put him on die to dock so that he could become king). Well, he vows to come back and take revenge. <br /> <br /> Before you can shake the stick, stupid natives run to the hut of American scientists shouting “Tobang has come!” <br /> <br /> It looks like a young corpse did the same thing as Tobang, walking monster Yes, his revenge is terrible (like this film). It seems that these natives cannot escape from a clumsy tree, so he throws them into quicksand, rolls them down hills, etc. Very soon the new king wants to exchange his woman or kingdom for an ax or chainsaw. <br /> <br /> Common problems with this film are numerous. The comedy relief is a hideous woman with a Cockney accent (as this film needs comedy). You want her to die when she first appears. The leading lady is crying. Leading man - ham. Acting - wooden (pun intended). The dialogue is hard and clumsy. Aboriginal accents in Brooklyn. Monster costume - pure giggle. <br /> <br /> Although this is a bad film, it’s still interesting to watch. He gets 3 for unintended laughter alone. . Your dog may rate it a little higher, but only if the tree was not mobile.
