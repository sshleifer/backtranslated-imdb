I went to look at it because of the snipers / statham, but to be honest, Chaos is terrible. Absolutely nothing fits this film - it shouldn't have been done. <br /> <br /> Do not read this review if you do not want to read spoilers, because I am going to refer to many Plots here. <br /> <br /> First of all - the opening scene. This is a big big event that caused the two semi-leading characters (Statham and Snipes) to become crooked. But it is boring and mundane. Only at the very end we will see what really happened, and by that time you will not care. In addition, this is the whole event, when one bad guy and his hostage are killed, hardly big enough news to fill hundreds of newspaper articles, as indicated in the film. <br /> <br /> Then the work of the bank is not so. do not leave the earth for a second. The bank robber makes some unnecessary references to chaos theory (by the way, this has NOTHING to do with the whole story). The way Statham is called is very complex, but more boring. Then what is happening in the bank is strange and meaningless. - What's with the safe. It seems that there is a plot unfolding, but it is not. -Why there are problems with the arrangement of two people when it does not lead to anything? It requires a lot of preparation and is completely free to use! -Why the special forces leader does not listen to the officer in charge when he tells them to resign? <br /> <br /> And this is only the first 10 minutes. Worse and worse. <br /> <br /> - The whole romantic novel / story of love interest (with the remark “he was not just the best cop, but the best man” to end it) is painful to watch. It is simply meaningless - why should the Statham hero indicate a change in the position of the camera on the footage taken by the bank. In fact, this leads to the search for a "virus" that will bring him all the money. -Why you need to fake the signature of some guys and kill him, but then DO NOT kill the guy who can identify you. <br /> <br /> I could go on for ages (true), but it looks like this film ... is meaningless. The whole script is a mess. “Smart” references to chaos theory are really funny and rather pitiful. The “twists and turns” of the plot are visible for many miles, and the main characters seem to constantly make mistakes. It is very painful to watch such a film, where the public is taken for granted, as stupid crispy popcorn, the director hopes that they will not see all the holes in the plot and the whole funny script. The “scene explanation” at the end only adds insults. This is a really bad movie. Anyway. <br /> <br /> People who come to see an action movie don't get what they come for. People who come to watch a movie about the police do not understand this. People who come to the clever thriller do not understand this. In fact, everyone gets the same thing - a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and skip this.
