I think South Park is fun, and I have no problem taking pictures of people on the left, but you would think that after you shot a whole film to attack celebrities for risking their career, entering into an illegal war, and then being a GASP, they will have sense to start giving w. and the bastards are ruining the country with a shot or two. It seems that Bush is getting free rein from these guys for being stupid and spoiled. <br /> <br /> Mountain is an honest game, but please, what do Republicans need to do, how bad are they to take care of the country before these guys finally start acting like they might not be just trying to do everything they can, and that they did something really spoiled ... or maybe they just went in a hurry, limbo ... hes a good goal ... or even just laugh over the teeth of the condolysis.
