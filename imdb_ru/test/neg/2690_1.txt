For a long time I tried to understand why people like Shakespeare so much, and every few years I give him another chance. I was hoping that this play / film (my 6th play of Shakespeare) would open a happy casket and lead me to the wealth of this literary demigod. Bach, I obviously chose the wrong key. <br /> <br /> After the phrase “pound of flesh” was uttered 10 minutes after the beginning of the film, the main parts of the plot were transparent, which looked like a sluggish script. and lifeless game. At every step, the plot is exposed two scenes in advance. The notion that a dying aristocrat will convince his daughter to choose her future husband through a lottery is incredible. No wonder who wins the matrimonial jackpot because Bassanio is the main character in the play .... and he is the third person to try ... and there are three boxes to choose from ... and his friend risks his life to pay for the dowry. The only real surprise that I watched for this film is that it did not end immediately after the resolution of the court case. However, as soon as the betrayal of the ring began, it immediately became clear what would happen. <br /> <br /> Good, so I know that millions of you love Shakespeare not for the surprise in famous stories, but for the depth and passion of the characters. But I did not feel anything about the characters. Instead of being caught up in the tension and admiration on the court scene, I enthusiastically sat there, hoping that it would end soon, please. <br /> <br /> One day I could just find a Shakespeare play that does something other than boring to me.
