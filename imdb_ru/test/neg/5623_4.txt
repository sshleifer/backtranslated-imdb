Quentin Tarantino’s crime partner Roger Avari (co-author of "Pulp Fiction") solves it himself (this time QT goes exec. Prod. Prod) for this rapid French thriller. <br /> <br /> Eric Stolz Zed, an extraordinary safe cracker who flew to France from the United States at the request of an old friend. There he teams up with a motley team of hippie addicts who, almost without planning at all, think they can knock down a bank vault full of gold bars during a French national holiday. <br /> <br /> Avari reworked The robbery didn’t go so well that Tarantino developed so well in Reservoir Dog that only Killing Zoe was not good enough to survive thanks to this power alone, so Avari threw in pretty abstraction. Julie Delpy is Zoe, a call student who entertains Zed on arrival in Paris. She, of course, a terrific distraction, but no more. <br /> <br /> I think that our director wanted to add a different angle to this basic theme, but unfortunately this step did not help add the depth of his shallow plot so desperately needed. In this idea there has never been a story that would be nothing but an idea. Even a surrealistic journey into the terrible immersion of Paris is boring. I believe that it must be admitted that there has not been a large number of gangster films shooting at each other due to inept jewelry robbery, that is, until you add confusing characters and lively dialogues. The Mad Dogs had it, the Killing Zoe had it not. <br /> <br /> Stolz’s strong interpretation of the dubious Zed and Jean Hughes-Anglad’s insane image of the possessed ring leader do nothing to lift the process. In short, Avari unsuccessfully tried to create entertainment out of nothing. <br /> <br /> Friday, September 15, 1995 - Astor Theater
