**** Contains spoilers **** <br /> <br /> As a fan of Rachel Lee Cook, I watched this show finally appear so that I could see it. I recorded it on tape to watch it several times, and in this series there is something that really bothers me! <br /> <br /> I understand that it was a film for television. Not only that, but it was made for Lifetime, a channel that I despise. Since this was done for television, I can ignore the huge holes in the plot. I can ignore the enormous lack of character development in the character of Ellie Sheedy. I can lose sight of the fact that George S. Scott and Rachel Lee Cook, both of whom are very talented actors, have definitely not achieved their best abilities. I can forget the fact that the character of Don Diamont was so cliche that you knew when you saw him, he was a villain. I can even miss the obvious error on the timeline (she was raped during the winter holidays, and a year later she gave birth to a child). <br /> <br /> The main thing that I can not get more than that: there are two tests for child custody. In the first trial, custody is awarded to the father of the child because he is “better educated, has a public college diploma and works full-time.” In the second trial, the decision is reversed because the judge believes that there is no evidence that Emma (the RLC character) is an unfit mother, and that guardianship should not be taken from the principal caretaker and transferred to someone who has not previously had interaction with child. <br /> <br /> The problem is that nowhere in the course of these tests was there a fact that a thirty-year-old man raped a 15-year-old girl and took her pregnancy into account! Whether it was rape or not, he had sex with a minor! Will it not be taken into account when the judge chooses him in custody because he is a “mature adult”? Mature adults do not have sex with minors! <br /> <br /> This is not the worst cable movie you've ever seen, but this is not a very good show. ** outside ****
