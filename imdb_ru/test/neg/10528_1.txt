This film is sometimes a wild comedy about sex from a college of the 1980s, others are a sweet romantic ... Then there are moments of serious drama and then blotches of science fiction traits ... It's so uneven that it is almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But I’d hardly call it one of the worst films I’ve ever seen, except, of course, for the fact that Peter O'Toole was shot in them. <br /> <br /> He has absolutely nothing to work with here. Bad communication, bad performance, bad everything ... And yet he is fantastic ... There is nothing good in his role, and yet he makes him work, if only on pure charisma. <br /> <br /> The fact that he was able to achieve so much with so little sheds light on how badly everyone else in this film failed, which makes it even worse than I actually think. .. <br /> <br /> If there was some other actor in the role of O'Toole, I would have forgotten this movie as shit and would have never thought about it again, but Peter O'Toole’s good performance, despite all the difficulties ensures that I will remember this film for a long time The time has come ... If only a film that could possibly be good, if someone participated in it, almost half of the program is as good as Peter O'Toole.
