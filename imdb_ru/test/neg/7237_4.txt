I hated the first film, really boring, and we only see the Octopus at the end. <br /> <br /> The plot The corpses are found in New York harbor. The police have no clues and suspects until Nick and his colleague realize that the killer is a giant octopus. Everyone, especially the police captain, refuses to believe the story of Nick, and soon the harbor will be filled with boats to celebrate July 4th ... <br /> <br /> In this film we will see more of the Giant Octopus and The special effects for this film are really good for their time . <br /> <br /> The acting role in this film is not bad, but not too good, but good, and you can watch it. <br /> <br /> There are some really cheese scenes in the movie, but if you can get through this, you should enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> 5/10
