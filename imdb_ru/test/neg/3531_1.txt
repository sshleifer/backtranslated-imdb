I saw this movie at Temple University. I can't imagine anyone ever see this film in the theater (projected on the film). The acting is similar to “Saved by a Bell” (TV show). The plot is simple and unimaginable. The sound recorder likes the sound of the wind, and the DP needs an exposure meter. Vampires, Vampires, Vampires. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money.
