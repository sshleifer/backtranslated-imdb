**** MIL SPOILERS _ BUT YOU LIKELY KNOW THE PLOT **** <br /> <br /> A woman is raped and decides to deal with all of humanity. Oh, did I mention that the rape victim was dumb? This is the problem of MS 45. Tana, the victim of rape, decides that she is going to kill men, but is there a logical explanation for this? Of course, the whole film would have been better if Tana had voiced why she confronts any man she encounters? This plot is not enough development <br /> <br /> As you would expect from a film of Ferrara, this is not a waste of time. it is much better than I spit on your grave, and the pseudo-intellectuals will have a field day pointing to the irony of the woman holding the knife, like a penis, when Tan finally starts to kill. But the script is somewhat stupid and underdeveloped and interferes with any serious commentary that could make a movie.
