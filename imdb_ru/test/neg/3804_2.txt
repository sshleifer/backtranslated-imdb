... but beyond that, there is almost no redemptive social value in this sequel to the original Poseidon Adventure. Where the hell are all the people from the original, including the rescue team?

Slim Pickens just confuses the stereotypical Texas, and, as a rule, you are just wondering: "Why are they worried?"
