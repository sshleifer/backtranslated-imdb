I watched all three Mad Max films a few days ago and was bitterly disappointed with the third installment. it destroys the beautiful work of the first two films with a weak and gentle action and storyline that turns the apocalyptic Australian wastelands into a comic sand pit that could be seen in a children's adventure film. Max's character is unrecognizable from his dark and cynical personality, seen in previous films, and turned into a predictable uninteresting savior who left me in treachery. If you have not seen this movie, just do not watch. Let the story end with the road warrior and save himself from the tormenting hour and a half. (spoiler warning) Another serious problem I encountered in this film that really left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth was a flying man. we have already seen him in the road warrior, where he helped Max, and yet, when he reappears in a thunderstorm, it seems that they have never met. I do not know whether he should be another character or a relative of the road warrior of a gyroscopic man. however, this was not explained and is a weak element in this general weak film. 2 out of 10. do not get 1/10 due to a thunderstorm fight.
