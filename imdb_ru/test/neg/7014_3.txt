Some good set designer. Good songs, although, as the other guy said, they are not performed with great energy. Bea Arthur, trying her best to do something with the material, accidentally shared a good friend in the role of Mom's girlfriend, Vera, and helped promote the song "Busty Friends." Besides this, there is nothing here that would be worth your time. Slow tempo, incredibly bad cinematography, not very good singing (except for Robert Preston), terrible script, bad game (except Bee) and terrible lead actress. Who thought Lucile Ball would be good, like a cool, life-loving mom? Warner Bros.’s head was no doubt insane when they decided not to use Angela Lansbury, who did it so well on Broadway, and use Ball, which by then was not as funny as it was 20 years ago. he could not play the part “in the right direction” at all and used painful caws as an excuse for singing. Even if (perhaps because) making the film was painful for her, and even if she financed it, she is simply not a mother. Aunt Mom is such a great movie, and the soundtrack of the Broadway musical from Lansbury sounds great. For the most part, there is nothing remarkable, interesting or interesting. Forget about it, unless you're a big fan of Lucy, who thinks she can't do anything wrong. I hope, having seen it, you will understand that she was just a man.
