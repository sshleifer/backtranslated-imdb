Who really wants to see it? Disgusting violence, disgusting sex, for such a long time. I don’t want it, but I always stayed true to my philosophy to watch any film as bad as possible. It was the most difficult (right after the “next Friday”). <br /> <br /> This is just crap. How can you call it something else? The history of the Roman emperor as an excuse for blood and T & A. Yes, yes, "Hey, this is real, they were such." Good, but why bother? I don't care if this was the case (and there are many scenes where I really doubt it). The thing is, why does anyone want to see it? The problem is that there is only one reason you might like the film, namely that you like violence. This is nothing special, only cruelty. You can say "Cool!" as you would say in a spray-slash movie. But horror movies with violence, at least, can cause you chills and excitement, perhaps characters that excite you. But here everything is dark, dull and boring. Every character is mad. "The story of the emperor, who can not cope with his strength." What kind? In the very first scene, he runs naked through the forest with his sister! I have no problem saying that we saw a madman for two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> But maybe it turns you on when Helen Mirren is pregnant and dancing. Or 5 minutes of hardcore scenes that some people see as the film’s message. Or castration, yes, it was fun! Real birth scenes, how fun! People, animals, who cares, let's just treat them like toys. <br /> <br /> I don’t care what anybody says, this is not a film, this is just 2.5 hours of blood and sex, degrading and disgusting. Go watch a porn movie if you want sex or watch a horror movie if you want violence. At least, these films do not claim to be an artistic masterpiece. And they are shorter. <br /> <br /> [0/10] [6 (1+ - 6-)] [0/4]
