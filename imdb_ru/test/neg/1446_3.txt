It seems that Dee Snyder ran out of ideas in the middle of the script. The second half of the film is just a rehash of the first, which makes the film very boring. To sum up: the policeman’s daughter is drawn into a party via chat, where she is sexually harassed / tortured by a psychopath (played by Snyder). A policeman saves her, a psychopath is placed in therapy / prison. The psychopath is released four years later, and it all plays out again. Inside all of this is a lot of inexplicable plot elements: why was the psycho "Captain Howdy" in the first place? What with a one-time detour of the person to the biblical fighter? How did he kidnap all the adults and manage to silence them without a fight? And, perhaps, the biggest unsolved mystery of all ... how 6'2 "man with pink hair completely hides behind 5'6" of average build? Here are just some of the questions that I had while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that Snyder tried to make some commentary on: a) the “dangers” of online chat rooms, b) the hypocrisy of Christians has sexual morals, and c) the influence that our distorted Puritan society has on us personalities. If so, he failed. The film is too poorly made to entertain, not to mention the transfer of social messages. The scenes of torture are stupid and boring, bordering on stupidity (especially when Snyder enters one of his monologues of pain and death), and everything else is just silly. The "call tracking" scene is really inconclusive ... when will the cops get a caller ID and * 69? The young partner of the main policeman is especially terrible ... he does not have to work as an actor, mostly. And the sound in the final autopsy scene is really bad. I suppose they could not afford two boom microphones? <br /> <br /> The rest of the game is not terrible, but not good either. The policeman is one note, and his quality is not entirely believable. Dee Snyder is actually not so bad, but he growls and mocks too much. Robert Englund (who deserves the best) puts on a somewhat amusing performance of a hypocritical hustler. If you are a big fan of Robert Englund, the film is probably worth seeing just for him. Everything else you can forget. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, we saw how all these plot elements were made earlier and made better, in films like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HELLRAISER and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. I suggest you rent one of them instead of watching this turkey. 3/10. <br /> <br />
