I was not very excited when I saw this film, but a group of us decided to watch it at the premiere. I wanted to get up and go out and try to get my money back 20 minutes back to this movie. I felt that the film was very boring, uninteresting and did not match many aspects, including the “games”. I tried my best not to fall asleep during the film, as I watched one of the worst horror films I've ever seen. The scary movie was worse than this movie. A sad attempt to draw a gothic girl, an overworked business man, a 15-year-old geek and some random guy into a video game that kills you is a bad plot to begin with. Then they try to create a very horrible love scene where the main character kisses another girl after saving her 10 minutes after the murder of his girlfriend. The theater was crowded when the film began towards the end, just over half of the people left before it was finished. If you feel the need to spend just 1 hour and 16 minutes of your time watching this movie ... get ready to feel deceived.
