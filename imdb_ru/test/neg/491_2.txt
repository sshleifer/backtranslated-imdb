The slimy (glam) rock of the 80s is similar to the house music of the 90s or current boy bands: it's boring and has no ideas or ideals. The only thing that makes him a little "cult" nowadays is that this is a long time ago, so we can laugh at his stupidity. It is a pity that “Rock Star” does not laugh at all, because this is probably one of the most boring films of recent years. <br /> <br /> Chris (Mark Wahlberg) is the singer of the Steel Dragon tribute band. When he was kicked out of the band at the same time that the real singer Steel Dragon was kicked out of, he became the next vocalist. You already know how this will end at the time when Chris lost it because of sex, drugs, etc. He forgot about his long-time girlfriend / manager, Emily (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> There is a way of too much (boring) music in this standard formula, justified for the film, and should be avoided at all costs. Watch the (overvalued, but even more fascinating) film “Almost Famous” or, even better, a film about real people playing real music and experiencing real emotions, that's what you do. <br /> <br /> What an abomination. 2/10.
