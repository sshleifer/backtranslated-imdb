I don't mind some adult humor, but this feature was just dirty. The first 10 minutes were that Pryor swore at some guy who took pictures, following my even bigger expletives. I don't know what happened between that time and the last 5 minutes, because I went out. Seeing this, I never looked at Richard Pryor the same way. And to think that he actually made a baby show. <br /> <br /> If profanity and tasteless dirty jokes make you laugh, then you will probably like it. But if you are an “old-fashioned” type, then do not worry.
