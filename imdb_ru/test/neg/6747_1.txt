Only in the Hollywood world of audiovisual fiction, anyone, including FBI agents, can be so incredibly stupid. The good guys are so stupid that they can collect everything they are interested in, answer phone calls, climb stairs, all in search of a demolition expert who wants to find everyone. Oh yes, and then we get the Hollywood SUPERVILLEIN. He can be shot, even if he is wearing a vest, and then falls on a long flight of stairs, and then still defeats his stupid pursuers. All the clich√©s you can come up with in films with obscurity have been used. I only watched it because Yuki Amami was so hot. Oh, yes, but yes, it's nice to see how morally better this FBI agent is when she is almost sure that there is a bomb in the Opera House, and she does not sound the alarm. Who writes these scripts ????????????
