I kept waiting for the film to excite me, to inspire me, to shock me, to somehow upset me, but this did not cause any of my emotions. It just wandered to the end. None of the characters seemed very unique or complex, they just seemed like actors repeating their lines. I think the film could be better if the characters expressed more emotions. The only one who made and was credible was a veteran, and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could. It was a waste of talent, the film, their time and mine. If there is a message, a meaning or a genius in this story, it is certainly well hidden, or I am very dense, which I doubt.
