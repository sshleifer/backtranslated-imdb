Where do I start with this movie. All I know is that this is a mess. Whether script, story or actors. First of all, this film is very disappointing to Salman Khan, who gave us the fun of Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge and Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega before. The second Rani gets really annoying, appearing in every stupid film since Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (glad that Saatia stopped this nonsense). The story is stolen from The Wedding Singer, but pulls down a funny movie. There are no dialogs. Perhaps I laughed here and there, but amused myself? NOT !!! Salman Khan was tolerant in the aforementioned films, but here he is insane. His character is poorly written. In one minute he is poor, and in the next minute you are surprised at how poor he is. Rani Mukherjee looks like an ordinary jinka and does not put any effort. Fortunately, she bought her career from Saatia, because at that time her career was in full swing. Pooja Batra has added a bit of charm to her appearance, but this is still not enough. Jackie Shroff wasted. The beauty and acting of Kashmir Shah ran away from her because she chose such a horrible script. Raveena Tandon looks beautiful, but works a little. Mohnish Behl receives an award for Worst (Supporting) Actor (they need Razzia, because there were horrible films in India). He speaks silly dialogues, dances terribly, looks strange and not in his usual form. Just to tell you, there are still actors who are terrible too. If it were not for Ravina's amazing beauty in Aa Meri Life Bana De, I would not give the film a point. Otherwise, Salman's dances were terrible. Pooja Batra danced like the wind in Savaria, otherwise I would like the costumes to be remade and the rest of the cast (and their monkey dances) to be blown away. The good song of the album was “O Priya O Priya”, in which there is not enough good visualization. The same goes for a half decent title song. Otherwise, this film (and other songs) is not for everyone.
