This is complete nonsense, do not look, as the main character is so concerned that the doctor's bomb shelter is not large enough for everyone, so he claims that the doctor plays God, saying who lives and who dies all during his 13itching, he kills people without thinking twice and beating people to death, the protagonist is a little selfish, because because of him the doctor died, who made the shelter, and his friend died. he also killed several nameless cops, the main character is just a stupid, stupid man who has no idea about greater good, this film has no meaning. Tell me why a comet can cause seismic activity? (if you say gravity, I will definitely rape you, because the comet is smaller than the moon, and you will not see that the moon causes volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and avalanches). <br /> <br /> why does a comet cause atmospheric discharges (red lightning, and also why is it red?), besides, if you donâ€™t know, THE LUKE OF ROYAL COLLECTIONS were struck with THOUSAND TIMES COMETS !!! That is why there are royal craters everywhere on the moon. the size of the object necessary to break the moon into fragments, as depicted in the film, will require a comet the size of the moon itself. <br /> <br /> it takes a huge amount of KE to make the satellite explode like this. <br /> <br /> In this film, the folly is that a nuclear explosion in space led to the formation of a disk-shaped shock wave. this is not true, since an explosion in space was supposed to create a spherical shock wave. this inaccuracy is also evident when the comet hits the moon. <br /> <br /> Someone will tell me why the commander (the man who was driving the big, old, broken plane) suddenly felt the need to die? I mean, he just goes with them to the shelter, then stops and greets the main character. <br /> <br /> WTF?!? !!??? the main character is also an ugly hole @ $$, he has a huge forehead and thinning hair. disgusting. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie!
