Until now, I did not feel the need to add a review of this site, but after watching the film, I felt the need to warn parents who might think about showing it to their children. Please do not! This is not a Disney movie. This film tells us that “life is cruel,” and if you show it to your children, then, in my opinion, you too. <br /> <br /> Videobox describes the movie as “enjoyment for all ages”, and the draft of IMDb describes the “family movie”. I just needed to find the definition of a “family film,” and I came across the following: “These films, usually consisting of comedies or adventures, are often based on children's literature and can include any number of useful animals, friendly supernatural creatures and fantastic worlds. aimed at stimulating and appeal to the imagination. Regardless of the situation, offensive materials are few or not, and the lesson is usually learned. ” An inappropriate description of Tarka The Otter, which contains some completely unpleasant scenes, completely unsuitable for young children, and a finale that qualifies the film as a film “I feel bad.” Lesson learned? As I said: life is cruel. Family fun? I do not think so. Unless you hate your family. <br /> <br /> Another review, more illustrative, but worth reading, can be found by clicking on the link "external reviews".
