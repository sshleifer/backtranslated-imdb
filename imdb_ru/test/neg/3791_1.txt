Awful writing, directing and acting! The author / director portrayed Southerners, especially southern law enforcement, as ignorant, deaf, homophobic and racist (a very popular, but ignorant stereotype that the film industry likes to perpetuate). Acting (or replaying) and an essay looked like an amateur and low-budget one. The storyline is the same old, stale Hollywood story about mean racists and homophobic goons that are ultimately defeated by enlightened people from New York City. <br /> <br /> I grew up in a small town in Louisiana. where this film was shot and was looking forward to it, but was immediately disappointed in the first few minutes of the film. The beginning of the film depicts a gay bar, located in the "swamps" of Louisiana. How ridiculous that is! There are many gay and gay bars in southern Louisiana, but there are no gay bars in the “swamps” or small towns of Louisiana. Then we get to know the sheriff, who uses the phrases “homuh-sex'l” in the worst southern and over-performing. Then there is a scene where local police watch porn on duty at the police station. I could continue to talk about the terrible stupid game, about outdated stereotypes or ridiculous scenes. <br /> <br /> This director and his team were invited to this small friendly town and showed true southern hospitality. The citizens of Lake Arthur and the state of Louisiana should have been insulted and humiliated in the final editing. Good people on Lake Arthur were thrilled and delighted that Hollywood was in the city, not knowing that in the end they would be portrayed as ignorant, racist and homophobic village goats in a low-cost amateur film that went straight to DVD. My advice: skip this one or watch it late at night Cinemax if it ever makes them spin.
