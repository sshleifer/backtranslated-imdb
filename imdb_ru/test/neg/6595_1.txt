This is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. I hope that the REAL family and other characters depicted have lawyers who, hell, sue VH1 for what they portray. The game is terrible, the spelling is worse, and the image of the characters is terrible. It must be a drama, but for me it was a comedy, you have no choice but to laugh at a bad game. I usually like it when Flex Alexander is playing, but this time he completely missed the mark. <br /> <br /> It can be argued that he himself took this role for a couple of laughs, because it was so terrible. If you really want a dramatic movie for the night, DO NOT CHOOSE THIS ONE. But if you want to laugh at a bad game and a silly composition, tune in. In addition, do not waste your time.
