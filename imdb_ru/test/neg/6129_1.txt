Oh, boy, oh boy. This film is something for lovers of "real" cinematic art. It really makes no sense at all. It's completely boring, especially because of the "anti-climax." All people behave more than strange and unreal. Sometimes it seems that you are sitting in a theater, because in the dialogue the actors tend to look at each other in front of the camera (and, therefore, in front of the audience). As I said earlier, if you want to watch these more tricky films shown in Cannes - do it. If not, better leave this film alone, because you will be more than disappointed and eventually find out that you have wasted your time - like me. Two thumbs down ...: - (((
