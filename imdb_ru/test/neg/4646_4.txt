Well, I first read the book and thought: wow, that would be great to see in the film, then I started searching and found that the film was already made from this ... I bought the movie a week ago on DVD and watched it .. they did it terribly wrong! first, this child of Hapi, who is not any character in the book, then a mixture of two books (“river god” and “seventh scroll”) than Nicholas, who needs money, while in the book he himself is the sponsor. the whole thing in the Hyksos is also wrong ... It is assumed that Tayla invented a lightweight chariot ... the whole thing in the tomb is also very wrong ... there must be a channel with some kind of vacuum. suction around it ... the tomb itself was made in a maze with the ability to pass only if someone knows the rules of the ancient boa game. There was nothing in the film that Nicholas was English, and Royan was a Coptic Christian in a book, not a Muslim. This list is endless. There were only a few good moments in the film, the actors of which played Royan, Naenti Taita, Boris, Mick and Tessey were chosen well, the rest were just parodies of the characters in the book, Rasfer was the worst, he didn’t even come close to the character that was in my head while I was writing a book .. It's such a shame that such a great book is disfigured in such a bad reproduction ... I wonder why Wilber Smith ever gave his permission to do so ...
