“COMMITTED” is more of a study of character, rather than cinema, another fascination with relationships with accessories specially created for a young target audience. The direction seems very simple, with obvious dramatic irony and a classic case of a loser loser against perfect ignorance. From time to time it is possible to observe COMMITTED, and Lisa Kruger has a sense of originality. <br /> <br /> COMMITTED is completely aimless for the first twenty minutes. We get to know Jolene, but the film begins when her husband disappears. Jolene goes in search of him. <br /> <br /> Some parts are strange. In other cases, the film stretches. The second half is more humorous, as we see that Jolene’s spiritual antics are replaced by more intense ones. Annoying guitar music is terrible, but perhaps a necessary evil, since COMMITTED offers very little in any case. The average film, which is hampered by some completely senseless moments, the only active COMMITTED - Heather Graham and Patricia Velasquez.
