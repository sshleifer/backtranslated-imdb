I have to say that I have seen the worst originals of the Sci Fi Channel, but this Yonsey Wayne Nu Image shonker was still a serious obstacle. The big problem with this is that it is simply not convincing, not just its creation, but the action, the letter, and any attempts at drama. There is no feature in this direction, and the script of Boaz Davidson and Danny Lernerov never works, is predictable, often ridiculous, while he gives fewer roarsmen than quite a few of these types of films in which he never offers anything, what could attract or raise a pulse. The actors do their best, but with such material their work effort is the result. Matthew Reilly Burke - a polite watchable hero, Meredith Morton looks like a clumsy watchable love interest. In fact, she was a little less convincing, but at least she was easy to look into the eyes. The film, at least, has the dignity to skate at a reasonable pace, but its biggest plus is that the octopus is not fully visualized by CGI. So even though it doesn't look good, at least there are some legitimate scenes of characters insanely exciting with rubber tentacles. I also laughed at the differences between the different images of the octopus, the cgi images of the creature as a whole change as the film progresses, they also differ not only in size but also in appearance from its practical snapshots, and there are scenes where the action of the tentacle suggests that the creators refused to pretend to make a film about an octopus, and simply presented their being as a bunch of different tentacles. The scenes of the creature's attack on people are aging rather quickly, but there are several funny scenes in which it takes on other things, such as a boat and a crane. Yes, these scenes are bad, but they made me laugh. An undeniable moment is the fun sequence in which the octopus takes on the New York landmark, the scene may take no more than a minute, but it really inspires and is worth watching on YouTube. In addition, things do not inspire everywhere (lack of blood or vileness at the PG level prevents it from even coping with big troubles in good times), the film eventually turns into a semi-exciting territory of the disaster film, but I can't do justice because the best the shots in the last few scenes were selected from the daylight from the Stallone film (which, according to my recollection, is pretty good). All in all, it was quite trash stuff, and I would not recommend it to anyone except hard characters. Better than poking a stick in the eye, but not by much.
