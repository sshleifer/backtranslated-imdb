Unforgiven - the last tribute to Clint Eastwood once great West. But although I thought it would be good and would raise the bar for future westerns, I was sadly mistaken. Unforgiven, albeit simple in plot, it does not match the characters and emotions, and I would, of course, say that Unforgiven is Eastwood's worst film to date. Eastwood himself seems to be too old to play the role of acting and directing, which also adds a nuance to the overall look of the film. <br /> <br /> All the characters seem hurried and torn around the edges, especially the character of Eastwoods. The game does not seem to flow and contributes to how the characters feel. The direction is badly misled by unusual shots. So overall, Unforgiven is not the best Eastwood, and certainly one of the worst westerns.
