I no longer respect IMDb ratings. I think a handful of Mormons flooded the site and voted for it. This is not a feature film, this is Mormon propaganda. There is nothing wrong with that, but the plot plan and the way it is described is completely misleading. If you are a Biblical Christian or Mormon, watch this movie, you will like it and you think that it is truly amazing. For everyone else, do not worry, the story is so contrived, random things happen that really do not follow in a consistent manner. This guy is trying to commit suicide because he is sleeping with his neighbor. You are joking? What a pussy! In any case, this is a terrible movie.
