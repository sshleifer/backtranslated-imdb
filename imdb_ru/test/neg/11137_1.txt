It was obviously the worst film ever made ... ketchup was the main role in this film and was the only claimant to the award ... because the plot, the actors and everything connected with this farce was absolutely horrible and ridiculous . I could have done the best horror movie in my backyard for two hours with a hand-held camera that used mannequins filled with grass as actors, at least the game would have been better! Do not waste your time or money on it ... it is very stupid and terrible !!
