I can only assume that the previous posts came from the leaders of the production company ... <br /> <br /> I attended the British premiere last night. Zane and Brooke were present (they probably knew I would be there) and, no doubt, the stars, but what a turkey movie. I felt sorry for them from time to time when the audience burst out laughing at the serious "thriller" scenes. <br /> <br /> But maybe I missed the point. Perhaps the element of ridicule was conceived. If so, pure genius. If not, then career genocide. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Zayn always shines, and Brooke can act a little. As the other half said (when we ran out of the cinema by breaking our ribs), they can be forgiven for this film, since they both seem like good people! The screenwriter, however, must be left.
