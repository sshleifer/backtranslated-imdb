Where to start is one of the most disappointing films I've seen, because it makes a lot of sense in terms of substance, but it sounds seriously stupid. The film about the ghostly habitable bed ?? The first 2 minutes of the film show a black-and-white recollection of a strange-looking fat guy playing a dominant position on Fabienne from the winner of the Pulp Fiction double contest and strangling her with his tie. This should establish how bed affects history. However, if you wanted people to get interested or send them off early, strangulation is the way to do it. Fast forward to the present, when a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and starts unpacking their belongings until everything is fine. Then, one night, doing hippies on one mattress, they realize that they need a bed frame. Here things get muddy, why didn’t they bring and buy the goddamn bed frame before they got there? We learn that the door leading to the attic, where the first 2 minutes passed, does not open, but then, when the couple realizes that they need a bed frame, the door magically opens. They go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to pull it down, and their love days remain ... or so they thought. The rest of the film centers around them both, pursued by a bed frame. The woman is an artist, so she begins to paint the monstrous images she dreams of, and the man is a photographer, so he starts making his models behave as if they were tortured or tied up (one of which has gray hair and appears over 50 years old, disgusting ) The woman is becoming increasingly frightened, and she discovers the house in which she lives, was once a paradise for serial killings and murders that put an end to the film. They find a murdered friendly host (which does not make sense, since ghosts must take on a human form in order to kill) and decide to escape from hell. Collecting things, her husband weakly rises to the attic, where he is obsessed with a crazy fat dude, and the female batters his skull before police appear and takes her to a psychiatric hospital, where she kills some guy who is trying to hit her. <br /> <br /> Well, if you read this far, you have to think about one thing ....... WHY HELL IS NOT THEY JUST CHOOSE A BED FROM A WINDOW ???? Seriously, they never said anything about a house that was haunting, just about a bed ... so why not get rid of this damn thing and move on? That's why the film is so frustrating, because in fact it is a good storyline, and the actors follow his example accordingly, but there are more holes in it than in Sonny Corleone in the pay booth booth. The couple tried to leave the city, unlike any other film that uses the “Oh, let's give this place a chance, dear” scheme, so let's get to that. However, me and my buddy, who watched the movie, kept talking every 5 minutes ... why didn't they just throw out the bed? Especially when they found out that they were chasing a good time to set it on fire or something. <br /> <br /> Everything in all its closest watchable movie with a lot of porn, like a bed of scenes and a believable plot (to some extent), but the solution is so simple that you scratch your head towards the end of the movie, wondering how stupid maybe a married couple? The highlight of the film is when a husband tells a 50-year-old model to spread his legs, and his assistant tells him that he cannot shoot her like that. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (I would like to have low budget solo shows)
