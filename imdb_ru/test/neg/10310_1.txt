Oh, man! Oh, man! On the cover of a worn VHS there is an image of Sandra Bullock and her name is written on top. I think the only reason they had a chance to sell the film in the nineties was because of the name of Sandra Bullock. Bullock fans should not be disappointed. Sandra is the only thing you can see in this film, and her performance is the only thing you can call acting skills. The rest of the movie ?? It’s interesting to watch the first fifteen minutes because it’s bad, but after that it gets worse. Much worse. Directing is terrible. Act terribly. The script is terrible. The dialogue is terrible. The action is terrible. The music is pretty good indeed. A typical estimate for the eighties militants. This film is so bad that it comes close to everything that Andy Sidaris has ever shot. This is so bad that there is no suitable word to describe this unsuccessful attempt to become a film. But still there was Sandra Bullock. And super cool (sarcasm) Jake Lamotta, who tried to be Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> I think they can now release the film on DVD. It can be awesome! And they should write on the cover: THE WINNER OF THE ACADEMY SANDRA BULLOK IN HANGMEN <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
