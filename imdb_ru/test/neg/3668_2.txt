Wrong, erroneous, gloomy, endless madness, resulting from the high gloss of the A-budget. Kate Hepburn plays the bride, who suspects that her rich, handsome husband (Robert Taylor) is not a dream boat, on which she got married, but a psychotic killer. MGM’s attempt to create a Hitchcock thriller from the very beginning is doomed to a rude, tangled, ridiculous scenario and Hepburn’s idiotic role as a woman who is in danger and fears for her life (who could imagine that Hepburn is afraid of something?) Louis B. Meyer forgot to tell Vincent Minnelli that he directed the thriller, not the musical. Taylor is confused. Only Robert Mitchum, also a good opponent who plays the role of the enemy, maintains his dignity in a quiet, restrained performance. The delightful cinematography of Karl Freund creates images of eerie beauty - and was wasted on the wrong movie. The end result: the Parnell metro station of the 1940s.
