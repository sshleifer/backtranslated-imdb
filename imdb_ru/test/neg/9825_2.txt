Despite the fact that the trailer and poster of this film imply that Sally Hemmings was an important character, I could not have been so shocked to find that she was just a minor (and I mean minor) character, if in this the film said that Sally herself tells the family! I mean, if you are going to tell the story of a member of your family who was ignored by the story, would you really tell the person who put it into obscurity with the main character? Is his other lover (who turns out to be white) as an actual love interest? I know I won't! I am as pale as they are, and, as a rule, a big fan of Ivory Mercenta films, but I could not digest this film about poor Sally Hemmings.
