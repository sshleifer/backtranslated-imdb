I think it was one of those films the director of which did not read the book on which it is based, if not for the fact that they are just a bit similar. Of course, a great film may be “based” very poorly on a book, and this, of course, is the last, but not the first. <br /> <br /> There were a number of flaws. One of them was that he tried to be too much like the Railway Children, probably because adults were expecting this from one author. The other is that it also sought to be too much like Harry Potter, right down to the music and in reassessing the setting. I have nothing against JK Rowling or films, but the book just doesn’t look like the Harry Potter books. I thought that Psammead, although very well voiced by Eddie Izzard and in character, was almost gratuitously in a completely inappropriate environment. Perhaps I missed something here, since comments made about one of the character’s own books could indicate an inaccuracy of adaptation. There was also no need for additional characters, and modern special effects could easily be used to tell the story as it was written, but this is not so. <br /> <br /> I saw this film with two children, one of whom knows the book, and the other does not. He who knows this, thought it was all right, but was not as enthusiastic as he who does not know. I'm not sure what that means.
