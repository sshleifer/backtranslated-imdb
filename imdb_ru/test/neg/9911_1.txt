In this film, something terrible. I laughed all the time. I was forced to stop in some scenes, because my mom thought it was not polite to laugh when people die, but in this film even death looks ridiculous. Especially when Tommy's Tornado gets pulled into one tornado. <br /> <br /> The explosions of cars thrown on buildings by the wind are reminiscent of the explosions in an old school scrolling game called R-Type. The dialogues are very bad, and I wonder how they managed to convince some of the actors to play in this film. It's amazing how such a bad movie can get on TV. <br /> <br /> The only real reason to watch this movie is to have some fun with nonsense and absurdity.
