Another attempt, another miss. France may be doomed to the inability to make a good horror movie. I mean ... the least they could do was shoot a movie in the Broc√©liande Forest, but even the forest is fake! It was filmed near Paris! The theme is useless, the actors are really insignificant, and the text makes you want you to be deaf. Nothing can save him. <br /> <br /> Poor ... to the bone. I have not been warned. I want my money back.
