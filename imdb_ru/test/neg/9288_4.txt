Often, celebrities are faced with the notorious "wake-up call." And, if they survive this event, they will come to a deeper understanding and appreciation of their particular luck. However, in the case of comedians, they are rarely so funny after their insights, as they were before him. This is the case with Martin Lawrence. Honestly, I pay little attention to celebrities, since I have more important things to do than spend them on watching others. So, I didn’t know what Lawrence had experienced before this movie. It was interesting, but, unfortunately, all for the general. I got the impression that this guy’s acting was not very funny. Save big life messages for the book, just be funny on stage. If you want to see funny Martin Lawrence, rent the old Def Def jams that he took. Do not rent Rundeldat.
