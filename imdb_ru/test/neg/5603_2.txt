Enough <br /> <br /> Beautiful actresses and actors. Pretty bad script. Quite frequent scenes "let's get undressed to our panties." Fairly honest F / X. Fairly harsh decisions about location (the room in the college dorm is like a high-class hotel room, probably because it was shot at the hotel). Pretty soft plot. Pretty awful dialogue. Beautiful places. Pretty annoying editing if you donâ€™t like the style of a flash clip for a music video. <br /> <br /> This is not a feeling of guilt, but rather an awkward one. If you need to watch it, choose a good dance / techno album and turn off the sound in the film - you will see nice people in their beautiful black shorts and you will probably understand the story perfectly. <br /> <br /> The cast may be able to act - I doubt anyone could look qualified, given the lines / plot they had to deal with.
