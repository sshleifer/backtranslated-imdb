I saw the Grande Ecole at its world premiere at the Rotterdam Film Festival. I had no idea what I was entering, and if I had an idea, I would not have entered. This is the most pretentious film that I saw a long time. He tries to be provocative, but at the same time deep, with his full frontal homosexual scenes - he fails! This is nothing but another bad excuse for showing naked people on the big screen. 4/10
