D'Amato’s hardcore / hardcore hybrid doesn’t really match its unusual name and intriguing assumption, in which various pompous modern types are attacked by a monster on an atoll previously used for nuclear experiments, but for the most part the film is very slow acting so boring and the cast is so clearly repels from having to have sex with each other, that the film becomes a chore to watch. <br /> <br /> It is a pity because the film has a promising idea; a group of scientists was brought to the atoll by a naval officer on a small ship. Scientists ?? three women and two men ?? an intriguing cross section of sexual types, suffering in varying degrees from nymphomania, interdependence, and frigidity; there is even an intriguing foray into the world of female sex tourism, where one of the women stops at a brothel to serve her two hired Caribbean studs for hire. The creature itself ?? a disfigured native of the island with a horribly wounded face and an incredibly long pizlom ?? has some similarities with the old Creature from the Black Lagoon and is a kind of nuclear nightmare that hung over postmodern man after the start of the Cold War, despite the fact that those of us who are in the West retreated into hedonism and relativistic science. br /> Porno-scaffolding of course, this is a film that shows, after the sexual revolution in the West, having met their mirror reflection in a nuclear monster, but the lethargy with which it unfolds does allow the ferocity of the idea downward. There is a promising interaction of action shots with POV shots that suggest that a monster (who watches / pursues, as horrible monsters usually do from their POV position) is akin to a voyeur in an audience who likes sex between "beautiful people." The sight of a monster that forces a gorgeous young woman to suck on her oversized member certainly throws in his eyes the ugly fantasies of the target audience. But D'Amato developed similar ideas better in other films, and Porno-Scallop is a potentially violent idea of ​​letting down the performance (even D'Amat’s usual cinematic skills let him down with a big dull camera job).
