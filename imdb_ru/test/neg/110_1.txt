I just finished watching this movie and was disappointed that I didn't like it a bit. It is so slow, slow and uninteresting. This Harry Potter guy plays a shy teenager with a rude mother, and then one day the rude mother tells the child to find work so that they can arrange an old guy who obviously has no place to live, started living with his family so the child goes to work an old lady. And this old woman who lives alone, teaches his girls driving a car and life! I could not understand how the 18-year-old boy likes to spend time with a terrible woman in her 80s. Sorry if my comments on this film disturbed people who might have liked it, I could be wrong, because I am not British and cannot understand the social and family structure and lifestyle. Basically, the film was made for a British audience.
