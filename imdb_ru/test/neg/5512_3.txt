This film is a desperate attempt to saddle the success of Star Wars. The film uses recycled footage from Battle of Sars, which is another sci-fi film by Roger Corman, but at least this film is better than Battle for the Stars - there is no real action in this film (but this is Roger Korman film - What did you expect?)) Again the whole soundtrack was made on the keyboard / synthesizer, sound effects were reworked from "Battlestar Galactica" - there are no special effects, because they were reworked / rearranged space scenes from another film, the costumes look like something then straight from salvation The 1981 Salvation Society. - ironically, the little boy in this film gives one damn game, and he pops up again to star in Sylvester Stallone's film “Above” - I give this movie 3 stars out of 10
