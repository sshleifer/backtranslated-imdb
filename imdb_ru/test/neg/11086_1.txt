So, you have a warning about the spoiler - but I would say that you can not spoil something that is already rotten. I assume that they changed the name to "Cave" in case it was preceded by the reputation of "WIthIn". <br /> <br /> After paying for the rental of the cable for this film, I thought about saving household junk for a month and sending it by mail to a writer / director. His garbage was brought to my home, so I thought it would be fair to return the favor to me. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the assumption that the scene is in the desert of Kazakhstan. I'm not sure why they chose Kazakhstan; Maybe the writer is a fan of Ali G.â€™s show. But they were supposed to start inside the cave, because the outside is clearly not Kazakhstan. It was the first clue that I was going to hate the movie. <br /> <br /> The film has no expiatory qualities, except one: it is consistent. Everything is terrible Script, direction, acting, cinematography - all aspects of this film are just bad. And I like bad movies, stupid movies, horror movies. but it was just bad. And stupid. And beaten. And predictably. And boring. <br /> <br /> To feel the film, go to your laundry with five friends and turn off the lights. Place the flashlight (included) in your dryer and start falling. Now you all start screaming and screaming at the top of your lungs. That's all. <br /> <br /> For a complete renovation, let 5 out of 6 people in the laundry play floor on the floor. Toss on them Karo syrup. Turn on the light again (stop the dryer). Ask the guy in the gorilla costume to enter the room and rape the last man standing. <br /> <br /> FIN <br /> <br /> ADDITION: After reading the other comments, many people believe that this film was wonderful. made on a low budget. This is not great. Making a shitty movie on a HUGE budget is wonderful (Waterworld). Wonderful making a good movie with a small budget (like Blair Witch, for example, I really enjoyed it). Making a shitty budget movie with a small budget comes as no surprise, and you can expect more from it if these people are still making movies, because I can't imagine anyone giving them a ton of money after watching it. <br /> Low budget - an excuse for a horrible movie? No, and, of course, there is no reason to watch it. Would you eat a dung sandwich just because it was cheap to make? <br /> <br /> Over time, it will be interesting to see the IMDb rating for this movie. The trend should be reduced, but only if the number of unsuspecting innocent viewers can outrun the ability of filmmakers to beg their personal friends to give him 10 stars.
