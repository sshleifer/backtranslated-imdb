This film was a dark attempt to recreate a crucial time in English history. The version of the film about Cromwell’s growing participation in the war is slightly accurate, but the overall historical accuracy of this film was far away. This film implies that the war began because of religious differences, but the Civil War was in no way Catholic and Protestant: both sides were Protestants. Cromwell was never present at the Battle of Edgehill and never "saved the day." Royalists did not win, the battle ended in a draw. <br /> <br /> As another reviewer noted, Cromwell was certainly not one of the “five members” who should have been taken out of the house and arrested. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was worthy. The producers tried their best and it turned out not so great. <br /> <br /> definitely could be better.
