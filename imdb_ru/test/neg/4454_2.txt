Many books by Alistair Maclean were on the big screen. Some of them (“Guns of Navaron”, “Fear is the key”, “Where the eagles dare”) are translated quite well; some ("Breakthrough of the Heart", "Ice Station Zebra", "Secret Paths") were quite passable; some (the River of Death, Bear Island, the Path to the Dusty Death) were rather rotten. Caravan To Vaccares is another movie based on one of MacLean’s most popular bestsellers, but alas, it’s another movie worth adding to the “rotten” list. Populated by uninteresting characters who fall into uninteresting situations and shoots, Caravan To Vaccares is an absolute failure, both in the thriller and in the entertainment program. His only semi-liberal qualities are: a) the fact that he is shooting in very attractive places of Provence, and: b) Charlotte Rampling looks absolutely amazing (with fully exposed scenes for download) as the main character. <br /> <br /> Disillusioned American drifter Neil Bowman (David Byrney) travels aimlessly through France when he meets British photographer Lila (Charlotte Rampling). They decide to accompany each other and during their travels they become acquainted with the mysterious noble duke de Kreuter (Michel Lonsdale). The duke convinces the couple to help him defend and accompany the Hungarian scientist Zuger (Michael Bryant), who is being sought by various shady parties because of some of the information he carries in his head. The secret of Bowman and Leela is kept secret in that Zuger discovered the secret formula for using solar energy as a cheap and economical energy. Hungarian desperately needs to deliver his formula to New York, but guns were put on its trail to catch it ?? presumably so that he could be returned to some ruthless criminal lord and tortured to uncover his priceless secret, which they can then sell for the highest price. Bowman and Leela find themselves and their frightened fugitive on the run in a French village from their mortal opponents. <br /> <br /> The film seems terribly cheap and amateur, almost like an ultra-budget independent film, shot not by a professional cast and film crew. Nevertheless, a considerable amount of money was spent on the film, and all those involved in it at different points in their career did a much better job. Therefore, it must be assumed that the film is bad simply because it was written, filmed and starred with a clear lack of concern and interest. The walk is deadly slow, and the plot plots become so time consuming that the viewer has to make too many unexpected efforts to keep up with the plot. Byrne's performance is inappropriate, and Rampling causes a sensation only because of her naked scenes ?? the character itself is an absolute bore, and the actress looks bored by her. For those who manage to stick to the movie to the very end, there is an unusual scene with the participation of deadly rodeo clowns and a ferocious bull (!), Which, although not particularly exciting or well executed, is at least different from the norm. Caravan To Vaccares is a very disappointing film in many ways, and once again the prolific author's strong romance suffered during his transition to the screen.
