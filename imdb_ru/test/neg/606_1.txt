In this comedy film there is not a single character with such qualities. All of them are self-centered, nasty, or two-dimensional. My husband watches this, claiming that there is nothing more on him, but I would prefer not to look at anything. <br /> <br /> The only comedy I can think of was worse: â€œYes, dear. At least that was 9 seasons. <br /> <br /> Overweight does not make a comic genius, and Kevin James does not have the talent of John Goodman, Jackie Gleason or John Belushi. Leah Remini may have a talent, but if so, she is wasted on a sly wife. Jerry Stiller is convincing as an annoying old man. Maybe there is a reason for this. <br /> <br /> This is a great example of why sitcoms are ridiculed.
