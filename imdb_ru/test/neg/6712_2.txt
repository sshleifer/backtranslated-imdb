Why on earth would the five US keep repeating this? the title actually speaks for itself: the plot is as clear as a book read in a language you have never heard of, and does not resemble anything. <br /> <br /> You will see ninety minutes of changing places, most of which will be blown up later in the film. At the very beginning, you see a pretty little farmhouse typical of Berry, which in the film is moved not far from Paris, but then it does not survive the “transport” to France island very well: it explodes after 1 minute. There are also two gangsters who do not have languages, as if it would make sense in the world of SMS and the Internet, not to mention pencil and paper. <br /> <br /> It’s just like that, there’s nothing to do with the story. My only credit goes to the operator, the camera is excellent.
