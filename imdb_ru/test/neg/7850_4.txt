“Kiss the Bandit” was the third and final film with which Frank Sinatra and Catherine Grayson starred in MGM. The first two were Anchors Aweigh and It happened in Brooklyn. And in Sinatra courted and lost Grayson. Probably the third time is the charm. <br /> <br /> Perhaps for romance, but definitely not for the image on the screen. Sinatra in his forties films again plays a cute little puppy only this time in the bullfighter's pants. Being engaged in the territory of the Tyroneic Power, designated in the Mark Zorro, Sinatra plays the son of a man who owned a hotel during the day, and at night the Kissing Gangster. He left and left California for training and returned ready to take his father’s place, but only in the hotel business. And where he studies hotel business, Boston. <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the former members of the gang of the pope, who are a little older and energetic, led by J. Carroll Nash, want him to again lead the gang. But Frank is simply not meant to live outside the law. But he makes a good impression on the governor’s daughter, Catherine Grayson. <br /> <br /> Someone had to force Sinatra at MGM to play it after the bad reviews he received in The Miracle of Bells. Frank in the part that was more suitable for Red Skelton. But since it was a musical, I believe that MGM's brain confidence believed that Catherine Grayson should have a singing partner. <br /> <br /> In fact, the best number in the film for her is “Love is where you are.” Find it. Also Ricardo Montalban, Ann Miller and Sid Charisse make a dance specialty that is good. Frank's songs are good, but nothing spectacular. <br /> <br /> In the following years, Sinatra would have shuddered at the mention of The Kiss of the Bandit and for good reason.
