Where do I begin? The plot of the film, which tells about the love between two schoolchildren during the war, when one is a living weapon, and their struggle to preserve this love is a very good plot. It is based on Shin Takahashi’s manga, which was also turned into anime in 2002, and I haven’t read or seen anything else yet. <br /> <br /> However, this review focuses on this adaptation live. Unfortunately, this honest thing was a terrible movie. It is not as if someone could identify some aspects and, for example, say that the budget is guilty or the culprit is to blame. This, unfortunately, is a series of disappointing and ineffective elements that bring this film to life. <br /> <br /> The game is bad. This is not to say that Aki Maeda and Shunsuke Kubozuk are bad actors, but there wasn’t much work with them, and they seemed to me wrong. It seemed that none of them had a physical range to attract the viewer in the plot, and he was too old for his parts to be a distraction. <br /> <br /> The script was weak, the leads act unrealistic and behave irrationally. The film also plays for the most sincere feelings, but ultimately it turns out to be predictable, while not convincing and not sufficiently developing the characters. There are also problems with cardiac pacing. <br /> <br /> Visually this is not noticeable. The film uses the green screen intensely and unnecessarily in too many scenes. Other special effects also look cheap, especially where minimalist practical effects can be used. There is also no visual sense, as if there were no cinematographer or art designer who would give the scenes a coherent and stimulating effect. <br /> <br /> The music and sound effects were good, but unremarkable. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is not without fun, and fans of the series should not despair to watch it at least once for the sake of completion. For people unfamiliar with Saikano, this is probably not a place where you can jump, as this is not a very good film or romance. This is not a film or a mistake of actors and film crews, it just does not inspire, and this is what kills him.
