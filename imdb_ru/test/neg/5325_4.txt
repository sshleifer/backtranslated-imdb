Unfortunately, Kunz seems doomed to die, not seeing a decent adaptation of his work. Whispers is very attentive to the original book, apparently, until the manufacturing company has enough money. All sets in the first half of the film were carefully recreated from the book - which was lacking in many other films of Kunz. Despite the other (numerous) failures, I continued to look in anticipation of some truly magnificent landscapes. Wrong. By the time the detectives appear in the burglar's apartment (in the book), the film has no money, and one of the most disturbing scenes from the book is destroyed. Where the book offers a terrible discovery, searching and chasing guys around the apartment, the movie offers the back seat of the guys car. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - Kunz writes, without thinking about the budget, because the imagination is free. If Kunz's novel ever turns into a decent film, no one will go and see it, because it has already been let down many, many, many times. That's why Frankenstein Dina Kunz is now just Frankensten - if you saw how your work killed so many times, you would come out earlier, if it looked like again!
