Very poor quality and acting skills are equally bad. This film is a vivid example of modern England and mentality. In this film there is no mention of Jesus, and in this film there is no such type of Christianity as most know. <br /> <br /> I'm also very surprised, because this film is a BBC program, and the BBC is quite famous for their quality programming, but it looks like the BBCâ€™s attempt to compete with Hollywood psycho-dramatic films completely fail, <br /> <br /> Bad game, bad plot, bad culture, which seems to be without religion. I would not even buy it; instead, it is better to try to rent it or buy it when it goes to the bin for $ 2.
