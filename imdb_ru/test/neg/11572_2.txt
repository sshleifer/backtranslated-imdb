Jim Wynorsky's mind must slip off his mind when he wrote the script for this. I donâ€™t mind when the animal scenes are almost identical, but when the actors repeat lines from other films, it goes too far. I really enjoyed seeing Jay Richardson and Glory Ann Gilbert being eaten. Gloria brings nothing to the movies, except her boobs (the feelings of my husband). Jerry Manti has to stay on the island of survival, her game is tough, incredible, and she is just cad. Liked the scene when the cobra comes out of the ocean, eats the guy, then for additional flavor destroys the dirty. At the very least, we know that in the next conspiracy, a giant snake kills a chest of drawers before becoming a dad in a nest of eggs. Jerry would be great like mother cobra. mess around with 6 pact or a pair of joints. it will ease the pain.
