I had the dubious opportunity to watch this movie on TV. This is a great example of how to take a horrible script and turn it into one of the worst films ever made. Not only is bad behavior and horrible effects, the film has more logical holes than ten pounds of imported Swiss cheese. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film as an example of how NOT to make a film which director does not use in any of yours. <br /> <br /> I turned off the TV for the last ten disgusting minutes of the show. Calling it "miserable" is a gross understatement.
