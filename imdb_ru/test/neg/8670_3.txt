Why bother ITV? Admittedly, “Mansfield Park” is the most difficult of all the “novels” that you can “get”, and Fanny is certainly the most difficult to please, but ... If someone is going to take it, then take courage and risk being true to the book and this is a rather complicated spirit. And for the sake of all that is holy, have the courage to play out Fanny, as she wrote: Freaky, kindhearted, sweetish, whiner! Mrs. Norris was not as terrible as she should have been. And what the hell happened to Portsmouth? The contrast between the rather dubious Fanny family and the family home and the magnificence of Mansfield is a key, well, in many ways, aspect of Fanny’s refusal from Henry, the rejection of her uncle, the close transformation of Henry into a good person, etc., etc., etc. novel why they bothered? It is outside of me ...
