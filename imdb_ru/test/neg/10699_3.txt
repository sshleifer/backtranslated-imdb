For the most part, I considered this film unworthy of comments, but the last 10 minutes led me to write it. You see, it is then that we will find out (SPOILERS ... if you can call them that) that the emissary of the devil has no chance of properly preparing domination over his master, because he is not experienced in the martial arts! "Prosatanos" for centuries lay in a hole, expecting that "human greed" would free him, but he would be defeated in a simple duel with 54-year-old former karate champion Chuck Norris! Imagine what would happen to him if he accepted Jackie Chan ... (* 1/2)
