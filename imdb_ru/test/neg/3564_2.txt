A depressed creepy teen does a lot of bad things to a socially active elderly woman who doesn't like to use curtains or drapes in her windows. He steals various things from her, looks at her, plays calls and plays various unpleasant tricks on her. Oddly enough, he does not keep any of this secret from her. At first, she didn’t seem to care about her. Then she seems to begin to respect him for his cruel, feverish activities. <br /> <br /> There are several illogical points that are worth paying attention to. First, the guy looks into the night through the glass from the more brightly lit side. In real life this would not have happened. The more brightly lit side of the glass acts as a mirror. He can see absolutely nothing. In addition, every night will be able to look at him, sitting in a well-lit room. <br /> <br /> Another illogical thing is that the creepy teenager works as a milkman, and he and It seems that the only client every morning is the woman he chooses. Easy work if you can get it. <br /> <br /> I saw a short love film at a public show. By the end there were no open eyes in the house. A short love film is a foreign language film for those who don’t like to read subtitles. Not only that the film says very few words, but most of the film is silent. A certain peace in the world.
