Nightmarish. I hope I can save two hours of your life by warning you about it. I just finished watching a movie, by the way. <br /> <br /> I love good cross-genre films. This is not one of them. Show me a sci-fi musical, a dramatic farce or a film about religious activities, I will watch them all <br /> <br /> I love philosophical films. This is not one of them. Anyone who is amazed at the depth of intelligence in this film has not read a good book lately. Or ever. A thought-provoking dialogue is banal at best. Perhaps something was lost in the translation. <br /> <br /> I like a good horror comedy. This is not one of them. Laugh! I thought I would never start! Wriggle? Only when trying to come up with a polite way to express your feedback about the film to a friend who recommended it. <br /> <br /> Rupert is incredibly good at this movie, but even he cannot resurrect it. I only wish he would shoot the director, if not for the zombies. <br /> <br /> To shame, the land that spawned Inferno should also have spawned it. Dante will rotate in his grave.
