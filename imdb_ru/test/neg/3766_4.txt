I first saw it when he went out in the theater. Although at the time I was only 13 years old, I was an avid reader of science fiction stories about "hard science." Technical oversights of the film burned in my memory. <br /> <br /> Some of the following may have serious spoilers. <br /> <br /> As a child, I knew that the package was stupid. The rocket takes off for the lunar mission, in space, where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew (although free objects float like in zero gravity), and because of this, the "cabin" (area with controls, regardless of what they called it) was gyrostabilized to maintain the “correct” orientation (so that when they landed, why did they not land on their heads?) and where, at least in near-Earth space, rocket engines had to constantly work - when burning fuel without an oxidizer . When the engines stopped working, the rocket stopped in space and could not start moving until the PhD chemist determined that it was necessary, with a small amount of oxidizer. This time, the rocket recalled that it had an impulse, and the next time our heroes learned that they were near Mars (even a 13-year-old botanist knew that such a journey with minimal energy would take more than 200 days). <br /> <They land, discovering that the air was breathable (although at the time scientific data showed that the pressure, even if there were pure oxygen in the atmosphere, would be too low to be of any use). They decide to camp near the ship and even make a fire. They come armed, although they allegedly go to the moon, where firearms are not needed. <br /> <br /> They see a ruined civilization, encounter homeless Martians who look like humans, develop an anti-nuclear war philosophy, and those who survive, try to return to their home planet and die when they try to fall to Earth! It would take such a long orbital period, they would starve long before they approached their destination. <br /> <br /> In the film “Purpose of the Moon”, which it preceded, real science was used most effectively (even if their “Salvation” with an oxygen balloon forgot about the moment when the hand from the center of gravity of the tank to the exit nozzle). This film showed the sad ignorance of even the most fundamental science. Only the most technologically illiterate should think of him as a sci-fi film: he, along with the old Flash Gordon series, where their rocket ships took off from their stomachs and spiraling up, and the engines were always on. <br /> <The story about this seemed trivial to me, and I can only recommend it as a film that will be shown to students to select technical errors.
