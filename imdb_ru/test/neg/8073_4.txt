I remember resting in Florida when they showed this film. I set up my VCR to record it. Waiting was killing me. I have known about the film since it was announced about six months ago. We returned from Florida 4 days after the release of the film, and I immediately watched it. I tried my best to please, but I did not. <br /> <br /> I am a HUGE fan of 3 puppets. And so I know a little about them. So I did not expect to learn anything from the film, and I did not. I was more interested in imaging and observing how accurate their information was. There were a lot of things wrong with this film. Actors, script, reconstruction, EVERYTHING could be much better. <br /> <br /> Paul Ben-Victor is an extremely talented actor. But let's face it, Mo Howard was WAY beyond his reach. He does not look like him, he does not look like him, and therefore he cannot behave like him. Michael Chiklis is also very talented, but his Curly image did not quite hit me, although when Curly fell ill, he succeeded in this. Jem Kassir's image of Schempe could be better rehearsed. It was rather a bad impression than an image. The worst was Joe Besser. They made him thin and more annoying than he really was. It was just laziness. I don't like Joe's shorts, because, as the film shows, he almost never gets hit. But he was not so annoying, and DEFINITELY was not so thin. The best performance belongs to Evan Handler. He had the most accurate image of the puppet. The problem with the character of Larry, his hair is too curly and too red. I know that this is too technical, so I will not put it on my list of why I didn’t like this movie. <br /> <br /> Back to Schempe, who turned out to be my favorite puppet. It is written as nagging, fluttering, chicken. True, he had many phobias, but he is not so bad. Initially, he did not leave the group because he was afraid of Ted Healey, although he did not like him, Shemp left because he received an offer from another studio, which he simply could not refuse. Instead of the truth, this film chooses him to wet the bed, no less than Larry, ran into the closet and shamefully bowed from the group. Another problem is that Scamp made almost as many Columbia shorts as Curley did than the puppet, but only one, Fright Night, was shown, which was his first short circuit. His career was almost completely ignored. Plus, lousy editing caused a terrible and unforgivable mistake. Shemp was born in early 1895 and died in late 1955. What will make him die? Well, here's a hint, that's not 59, as the film says. <br /> <br /> Now for the script, which I think was wrong only because this film was shot. Some of the lines are stupid and can be designed and / or introduced much better than they were. The only line that really attracted me was at the very end of the film, when Mo shows the promoter how the peephole is made. <br /> <br /> “This is how we do it, we come into contact with the eyebrow bone, not the eye, although it looks real on the film.” This line was poorly written and poorly placed in the film. This should be one of the lines that make the audience say Oh! In amazement, and I’m sure that this happened to some people, but at the very end of the film there’s no place for this line. sound effects machine. I know that at first there was no sound for the eyepiece, but Moe, for example, could say : “How about this?” And the eyes curly or Larry. Jules White then says: “Are you okay?” Or “How did you do it?” There were many inappropriate lines in this film, which is a clear sign that the script was The other is related to the origin of the name “Shemp”, although it’s not so bad, and therefore I will let this slide. <br /> <br /> What makes this film good? It illustrates how the puppets were screwed up by Colombia were I'm not sure that Moe was an errand boy, but it was the type of drama that should make the viewer sympathize with them. I know that this film was staged. I know that not everything will be clear, clean and absolutely perfect. However, some of the things they did, and the real things they ignored, were in serious conflict with each other. For example, a Curly stroke does not even look like how it happened in real life. I know, I know, a dramatization, but the purpose of a dramatization is to make real events more dramatic. Curly's stroke in real life is more dramatic than in the film. That's what really happened. Curley was sitting in a chair behind the screen while they were shooting the stage, he was called to the final stage with the pies, but there was no answer. Mo went after him and found that his younger brother's head was wilted, half paralyzed, unable to speak, and tears were streaming down his face. Mo then said "Baby?" and tried to help him get up from his chair. Poor Curly falls to his knees. Then an ambulance was called. <br /> <br /> In general, this film was not terrible, but it was definitely not good or even normal. This film helplessly and inaccurately depicts puppets, and sometimes dramatizes. This film has a very, VERY long list of inaccuracies. If you don't believe me, check out the list of guys called Rog on the threestooges.com news forum. This is about one and a half pages. Some things in the movie I can skip. But others were inexcusable. The Three Puppets were geniuses, and many of today's comedies are based on what they did. You do not trust me? Check out the Simpsons, and especially Ren and Stimpy. But this film cannot capture their genius. Moreover, it does not accurately reflect their difficulties, which is important, but if the title of the film is “Three Puppets”, it must portray their ingenuity and originality more than anything else.
