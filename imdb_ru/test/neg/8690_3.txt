I rented this film after hearing Chris Gore say something like “five stars!”. on this show Attack show. Well, when I flipped the DVD and it showed 3 stages of hell, well, I had to buy it. Just to see the spectacle, when the mother shouts to her son to throw his other son into a burning pit. <br /> <br /> I didn’t expect EKV or CZW for an hour and eighteen minutes, but I expected at least a brief version of what seemed to be the main highlight of this film. Well, unfortunately, there was nothing like this. The 3 stages of death occur from the very beginning, and this largely goes down. Nothing really happens in this documentary. It was rather damp, bare and impartial. Not bad, but there is a narrator in it. You expect him to have opinions on the subject of this documentary, but he does not. What would be nice to have a message or a reason for this document. There was no real reason to have a narrator, there should have been only text explaining some of the less obvious scenes. <br /> <br /> This does not really explain the lives of these fighters. This shows a few moments of some dramatic scenes that sound interesting, but the reality is not as great as it seems. For example, a mother watching her son fight for the first time with light bulbs and nails in a public park. instead of seeing her reaction to the fight, they show how she responds to the camera, instead of speaking up for an interview later, or just in fact watching her reaction. <br /> <br /> Legitamit wise document, this is not. The starting material was fragile to begin with. Nothing really deep or interesting really happens. There is no conclusion for some of the more interesting stories. There is no real meaning or final thought about the struggle in the backyard, badly edited together, and this is, in general, a cheap, unsuccessful disruption "Beyond the Mat". <br /> <br /> Wrestling wisely, this is pretty boring. better strikes at the beginning, and gradually become less surprising and shocking. If you have seen Japanese wrestling, indie wrestling, or even yard wrestling on DVD, then this will not shock you or shake you. If you want to wrestle, do not make the same mistake that I made, and you will see this Instead, take a few CZW ECW or XPW DVD. <br /> <br /> The only thing I got from this documentary is how stupid people can be. Not to support self-harming or performing dangerous stunts, but to explain the reasons for these actions. Backyards seem silly to fight. Most of them are unemployed and probably have several problems in their heads, and the struggle is one of the types of therapy for them. What supporters seem even more idiotic. Mothers basically take everything “if you can't defeat them, join them” to cope with the fact that their sons mostly kill themselves. The school administration representatives support their students in their dangerous stunts, because this is an alternative to joining gangs and, to a lesser extent, drug use, which is quite funny, since this segment took place in a rural town where people live 20 miles apart. People are stupid. This is what I extracted from this documentary. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the reasoning and thoughts of someone who behaves brutally in the fight, and basically what the back of this DVD promises, get UNSCARRED: Nick Mondo's life. It is more surprising and interesting than in the backyard, and much more interesting. Oh, and this is really good.
