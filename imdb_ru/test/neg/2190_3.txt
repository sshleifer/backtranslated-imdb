Los Angeles physician Tom Reid (Vincent Ventreska) survived a tragic car accident, but ended up in prison in the high desert of California. When his time is up, he lands in a small, windy city called Purgatory. His first stop is a bar where he quickly slams beer and gets a job as a bartender. So much for the former cons, which is difficult to find a job. This is the first of a long series of absurdities that make up the plot of the foolish attempt by the writer / director Harris Dond in a modern, desert film. Noir <br /> <br /> On her first night at work, Tom meets a sexy femme fatale named Sunny (Alexandra Holden) who hangs out with a family of bad boys: Mecchins, consisting of Uncle Dean (Gregg Henry) and his two nephews, a drug addict Owen (Kevin Alejandro), who is Sunny's husband, and AWOL Randy soldiers ("90210" Brian Austin Greer). After his shift, shooting begins, and Dr. Tom just turns out to be nearby. He agrees to treat one of the wounded and, most importantly, not to tell the cops. I'm not sure that this is a good move for a beginner, but this scenario (in collaboration with Dian Fine) has little to do with logic. <br /> <br /> Tom makes a series of bad decisions that make him more and more entangled in the criminal tendencies of the Mecklin Boys, including the theft of medicines and jumping into Sunny's bag. Everyone in the theater shouts: “Don't do it! Go away, but Tom still does it. <br /> <br /> In a classic film noir, such as Body Heat or Double Insurance, for which we cheer and empathize with William Hurt and Fred McMurray when they are pulled into the web of bright, sexy, treacherous femme fatales, such as Kathleen Turner and Barbara Stenwick. It is not their fault. Perhaps we will be seduced by all this money or this particular lady. But Dr. Tom’s weakness seems to stem from stupidity more than circumstances. Sunny is a sexy but not very convincing character, and there is no money to seduce him. You wonder if he attended the same medical school as Dr. Nick Riveria of the Simpsons. <br /> <br /> A stupid script would make you believe that in the village house of the redo there is almost everything you need for a shot in the stomach, and the one who was so injured could easily hope for attention and effectively participate in the fist scramble This gives us an incredible car chase with one of those "Club" things that are attached to the steering wheel. Oh, that oil tanker that just exploded - no one noticed. <br /> <br /> I wonder how such a ridiculous scenario ever got the green light? Perhaps Brian Austin Greer has more juice than I expected. Obviously, he took on Randy's relatively small role - hot-headed murder - to show producers that he had a wider range of action than he showed on "90210". <br /> <br /> It’s also sad to see Nicholas Turturro playing a stereotypical Hispanic drug dealer. He deserves better than that. <br /> <br /> If you have an IQ of more than 50, then in “Purgatory Apartments” you will shake your head in disbelief. I will give her 3 stars for unintentional laughter and scenes with sexy Miss Holden running in red panties.
