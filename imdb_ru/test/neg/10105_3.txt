Okay, the box looks interesting, at the opening there is great music and a kind of original, besides, everything is fine. But when the movie began ... well, this is not my first movie about video-video, I watched Ghost Lake, and it is very similar to this movie, except that everything is worse. At first, the story seemed interesting, but the whole film looked like a film made by a group of university students, with a special effect that makes me laugh, the blood looks like a mixture of red and white paint, the effect of fire on the demon's face looks like it was done with the help of I could buy at my local computer store. The whole film was shot daily (very good for the film, which should be horror), and there is no blood (only 1 scene looks so homemade and not defiant) and there is almost no blood (this can be considered a big thing considering the kind of bloody show ) and 1 demon for the entire movie. The story is not going anywhere, it seems that it never starts, so many useless scenes are done only to give the film an average duration (when a demon searches for a guy in a dog for about 4 minutes ...) Too many slow things. Well, let's just say that this film is a Z-series and very bad. All the cool ideas have lost themselves, and you get a cheesy movie. I'm bored for all this for a long time, and I'm not the guy who is very bored with a horror movie, man, I even like the house of the dead and loneliness in the dark by Uwe Boll, and you probably know the name of one of the worst directors, but here itâ€™s too much on some guys wanting to make a movie for fun. Plus, for us who speak French (although I understand English, I prefer to watch movies in my own language), there is the usual poor translation of videos. In an ordinary film, you can barely see that this is not an actor speaking (you should check your lips, etc.). Here you just have to listen to him and you know it. Very cheesy
