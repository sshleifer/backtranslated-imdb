I grew up in the 90s; therefore, you must understand that I have personally seen the prime ministers of the greatest DCOMs. I was there when Brink! Zeno, Halloweentown, Johnny Tsunami and others have appeared. These films make up my childhood. When these films appeared, not only I, but also the one with whom I watched them, at 1:30, were delighted, talked about it during the week and caught again the following weekend. I don't think words can express the excitement that Zoog Disney brought. <br /> <br /> Even when I watch them now, the dialogue does not seem so bad (so effective that I actually remember parts of the conversations literally word by word from films that I saw more than ten years ago), Characters believable, funny, slightly stereotypical, but this is exactly what Disney's charm does ... <br /> <br /> I sat my younger brother in front of the Disney channel to try to convey and make him understand my feelings for DCOM. Enter Stuck in the Suburbs ... my brother looked at me slightly puzzled, asking me if I was always gay. Now I feel more disappointed and devoted, than with what can I compare it? When Han Solo found out that Lando sold him to Vader ... <br /> <br /> Half of the film, and I'm not exaggerating, is a memory. These young actors have no talent (some of which are older than me). The plot is funny; it felt as if a bunch of old rotting corporate people in Disney were sitting at the table and asking themselves: “How can we seem fashionable to these young people?” Well, maybe all the DCOMs were like that, but at least they made a little effort, not to let us know that they think that we are complete idiots. <br /> <br /> And apparently, this type of film works ... Trapped in the Moscow region is estimated almost the same as Zeno or the Airborne Forces. How is this possible? DCOM has become even nicer, and people now prefer them? (although, apparently, the lack of curses is enough for some people to have 10 minutes) Christ, this is a completely different generation.
