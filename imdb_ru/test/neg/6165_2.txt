Sorry, guys, everyone who thought that this film could be something great, I'm afraid you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The standard that the film wanted to install was completely destroyed by some very simple plot. So simple that the film does not develop to the end. I asked myself whether the plot was not about action, but about the main character (played by Mickey Rourke), but I found that the character was inconsistent - either he was a professional killer or some brother who was following the blame. But both do not go together, because the child he is trying to send puts him in dangerous situations that no professional killer will fall into. Now Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a handsome actor, but he played his character a bit unnatural. I did not believe in his game, it seems that the director was trying to get some personality out of him that he could not provide. And he didnâ€™t have to do that, because his less crazy behavior was creepy enough. The only one whose game was great was Diane Lane. If it were not for her, I would give this movie 1 star. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I expected to see some well-played film and some interesting plot. And I totally messed it up with my high expectations.
