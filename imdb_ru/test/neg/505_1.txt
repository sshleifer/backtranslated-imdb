Now the notorious West, which was (at one time) the biggest budget disaster in Hollywood history. I was lucky to see the full 220-minute version in the theater in 1990. It was really stunning, like a BAD film! <br /> <br /> They had a great cast, a story based on a real incident (the struggle between foreigners and Americans in the 1800s), great landscapes ... so what went wrong? Three words - directed by Mikhail Cimino. After “The Deer Hunter,” he was so full of himself that he went out and made this god a terrible western. He is not entirely to blame. His previous film The Deer Hunter was considered a masterpiece, and United Artists gave him the freedom to do whatever he wanted. They left him alone ... and everything went wrong. The cost went out of control, and Cimino insisted on repeating the sequences over and over until they were perfect. <br /> <br /> First, the sound is terrible. Pass entire sequences, and you can not make out the word that the characters utter. For example, the character Jeff Bridges is presented during the dance sequence, but I still have no idea who he was! The dialogue in his opening scene is incomprehensible! This is the director's fault - he had to make sure that the dialogue was heard. Some scenes are shot with so much dust that you can barely make out what is happening. The storyline doesn't make much sense, and Cimino took it upon himself with the facts — in the real story only one person was killed — Cimino turns him into a slaughterhouse. Here there is, admittedly, beautiful sequences completely destroyed by a lack of history and an incomprehensible dialogue. Also, the bad sound was not the fault of the theater - all the prints sound that way. <br /> <br /> This rubbish actually shut down United Artists and was the end of Cimino’s career. The textbook is an example of such a full director that he does not understand what he is doing. Jeff Bridges said that this is the worst film he has ever done. This is from the guy who made Tron! Be sure to skip. <br /> <br /> There is a pretty good book called “The Final Version”, which tells in detail about the entire disaster. It gets 1. I would like IMDb to have negative numbers - it deserves it!
