Making a comedy is like walking along a thin narrow rope. This is either working or not. Grandma's boy is one of those movies that don't work. It may have some very funny parts, but for most it’s just a terribly unfunny comedy from the usual minor characters in Adam Sandler’s films (without Sandler himself, he’s just a producer). <br /> <br /> Alex (Allen Covert) - game tester. He is 35 years old and he is the best tester and player in his workplace. He ends up getting his apartment and his belongings taken from him for not paying the bills (as it turned out, his roommate had just spent the rent on Filipino prostitutes and not paying the landlord). In desperation, he moves in with his grandmother Lilly (Doris Roberts of Everybody Loves Raymond) and her two roommates. <br /> <br /> This is the main plot of the film, which features stories about a hot new girl named Samantha (Linda Cardelli, unrecognizable from Velma’s time in Scooby-Doo), trying to get testers to complete the new game as quickly as possible, a robot-like game that creates the wunderkind JP (Joel Moore), who works with Alex and wears most of the same clothes as Neo in The Matrix, and, of course, all sorts of jokes about sex and drugs. That's all. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film, besides the fact that the real conflict in the film arises and is resolved during the last fifteen minutes of the film, is that it is simply not funny. It is completely boring and just ridiculous. In fact, nothing happens. No emotions, no real sense of direction and a whole ton of intense curses. You may be laughing at a few funny jokes the actors make, but otherwise you’ll sit in complete boredom, wanting you not to even bother to work on the film. How this movie was green and how Fox thought he could make money will always remain a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> It’s just not fun to do. None of the actors really put on good performances, they just behave like idiots in front of the camera and hope for the best. The Stoner comedy was made several times before, and sometimes it really works (Harold and Kumar come to mind, go to the White Castle, and "Stunned and Confused"). Here it just makes the film even less funny than it is. The accidental inclusion of a monkey and a pair of naked breasts does not really make the film any better either. <br /> <br /> In addition to a few funny plot lines, this film is simply not to be missed. It's not very funny, the whole plot is stupid, boring, and it just makes for one terrible movie. Avoid this like the plague. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
