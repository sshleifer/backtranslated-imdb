South of Hell Mountain, an absolutely incomprehensible western, in which shots taken in an insane asylum were filmed, the film “South of Hell” was one of the first films made by Scottish masters in the film “Cannon”. The film, shot under the direction of William Sachs, who would later put in favor of fans such as The Incredible Melting Man and Galaxina, tells a very boring story about a trio of gold thieves who stumble upon a cabin occupied by two women who hide some secrets should not be revealed Actors ( most of whom have never acted in another film) try their best, but the script prevents them, which, as a rule, does not make sense. Asylum scenes are edited with little effect and interspersed with ridiculous sound effects and tape loops. Ultimately, this is a lot of talk and little else.
