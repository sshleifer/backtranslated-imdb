"Don't be greedy" sums up the depth of this film. All the rest is a big budget showcase. The film rotates, hiding the ball annoyingly and revealing too much. None of the potentially interesting tangential plot has been developed, but the banal hashed and paraphrased to excesses. <br /> <br /> The charm of DD, as others have noted, was in the device of schizophrenia, humor is woven into the fabric of the film, and most importantly, acting. There is enough wood in the “Box” to attract a gigantic pile of Martian termites. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the suspension of disbelief during this mess is the glaring question: “Why would a technologically superior force be able to seize power? Does the government even need to conduct any tests? The terrible failure of the film.
