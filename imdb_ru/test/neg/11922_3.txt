Laugh. <br /> <br /> Clichéd. <br /> <br /> Overdose in style to compensate for bad writing. <br /> <br /> Remember when MTV actually used to broadcast music videos and other shows besides the reality show? Aeon Flux (2005) is based on one such show ?? cartoon from the mid 90s ?? with the image of a superhuman female hero in black latex clothing. Aeon, played by the beautiful Charlize Theron in this adaptation, is a cold detached rebel, as dexterous as a line dancer, and deadly as a serpent viper. It should be if she hopes to kick ass of a totalitarian government. <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but I hate the sudden influx of unfinished futuristic films with dystopian technologies, such as Island (2005). ) and Equilibrium (2002) (heap bottom). Aeon Flux has all the problems that are present in these films, but are intensified. That is, there is nothing original to show, so they compensate for this with a sleek style that Matrix catalyzed (1999). Therefore, the special effects are sensational in Aeon Flux, which brings him a few points, but scratches the surface, and there is literally nothing. <br /> <br /> What's worse, all the performances in this movie are terrible, and some actually hurt me to see. Charlize Theron's character Aeon Flux is entwined with the most disgusting guy, and director Karin Kusama can't decide where to go next ?? Should she make her more distant or more emotional? She does not know! Let's go both ways! Imagine that you take a shotgun, load it with a crowded event of a different kind, and end up in a random mess. This is the character of Aeon Flux. <br /> <br /> The Aeon Flux film puts forward all the “required” ideas in a dystopian society — individual versus society, nature versus science, emotions versus cold mind, etc. You have seen it all before, and it’s better to do it. Go read Orwell, Bradbury or Huxley, or even watch Logan's Run (1976) or Blade Runner (1982) ... whatever! Avoid this evil unattractive cheese feast for as long as possible. <br /> <br /> 3/10
