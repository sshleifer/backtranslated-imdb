First, a warning. “How to Marry a Millionaire” is apparently accompanied by the occasional five-minute orchestral performance of the Street Scene, a Gershwin-layt play, processed with complete pomp and ceremony, well, in general, Gershwin. Sitting through it requires some patience. If you have a DVD, be sure you can skip it. You do not miss anything. <br /> <br /> The film itself is one of the eternal disappointments of the 50s of Hollywood, a film supported by a big star power, a luxurious setting and an ideal concept of failure seems unthinkable. The name itself is perfect. Generation after generation, however, are forced to ask themselves - how is it so exhausted? The script is an albatross about the neck of the production, a dead, smelling thing that stifles everything and everyone before they can really ignite. There are no comic situations, only a few moments that play for fun. When there is a threat to the development of a real comedic scene, the film quickly moves on to other, less interesting things. An example is the scene where each of the three leading girls brings a date to the same trendy restaurant. One of them, myopic, from vanity refuses to wear glasses. One of the dates is married. A classic Hollywood farce, of course, full of mistaken personality, an angry wife and, perhaps, someone's pie in the face? Well no. Instead, we cross three dates, because the ladies "comically" react to what their partners say. Hit the zest and move on to the next lame joke. If in doubt, let Marilyn enter the wall. Where is Billy Wilder when you need him? <br /> <br /> Three stars - an almost perfect diagram of the life cycle of the classical goddess on Hollywood screens. It was one of Marilyn Monroe’s breakthrough films, and the camera simply devours her, although the script gives her nothing to do. She is so glowing that it seems she just hatched. Lauren Bacall, on the other hand, has been a major star for almost a decade, and she knows how to dominate the screen even in the frame with Monroe. She gets the only thing that can pass for a real role, and with a cynical grip passes a few good lines - given the correct material, she could bring this thing to life. She is a surprisingly ageless actress — when she lies about her age in a film and claims that she is forty years old, it’s not at once funny — and much less girlish than her colleagues, which gives her convincing authority. Betty Grable was far from eternal and spent eight good years with her colleagues, which put an end to her Hollywood career. From time to time despair appears in the air, stuck on the screen without a smile of toothpaste and a few pieces of comic time, unable to play its real age, but not to deceive anyone as a contemporary of this new, more acute generation of actresses which served her throughout her career (for those who doubt Marilyn, the fact that these two contacts in this film help to throw Monroe's subtlety and — yes — intelligence in sharp relief). She is also crammed with dead wood from the point of view of male colleagues (although all men — even the great William Powell — are to blame for lazy notions); she cannot erase comic sparks from them. It is better to give your role to the little-used Monroe, which itself can be funny, and leave Grable with Mr. Magu's recurring routine. <br /> <br /> That film is as enjoyable as it can be reduced to a juicy Hollywood production that makes even such frivolous “Shining Silver Moon” visible. But somewhere, hidden under flabby jokes and professionalism, lies the rough contour of a sharp, cynical comedy about the marriage business that Bacall could sing - and new generations of viewers of the film will sit down with How to Marry and again be disappointed.
