Renee Zellweger shines, but the rest of this film just doesn't work. It's like a hamburger salad with jelly and mold - an interesting idea, but who ever thought it would really work in a movie? I like the two previous films directed by Labuta - they were ruthlessly honest and frighteningly funny. This film can only be merciless and frightening - with huge false remarks. (As a high concept, think: perhaps the movie “Doris Day-Rock Hudson”, created by Sam Pekingp, now reduce your expectations to fit the current, massively produced state of Hollywood.) , Vince And Jenny ALMOST makes their scenes come to life - this is evidence of their tremendous talent rising above the material, which simply does not touch. I would consider Freeman’s banal speech about well-being at the end of the movie funny (in Lincheysky), if it weren’t for the sore suspicion that this unconvincingly caught morality should be taken seriously
