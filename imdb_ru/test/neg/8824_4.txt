It looks like a thrilling perspective, a modern Othello dress with Christopher Eccleston, who was so frighteningly good at Shallow Grave and (especially) Jude, and Imonn Walker, who brought such intensity and introspection into his main role on "Oz." One would think that they are both natural Shakespeare, but both performers are desecrated: Walker's Othello is a rather sharp biscuit from the side, with a whisper delivery that does not have much effect; and Eccleston so terribly calls as Iago, winking into the camera almost in an outrageous parody of the role. Most likely, he was called by his director, whose flowery approach could work better with Elizabethan, but which seems to be a harsh, pretentious choice for this modernized script. And the script itself is less disappointing in being modern than in being obvious ?? as if Andrew Davis sketched a famous plot, and then simply wrote a dialogue that first appeared to him in his head. In general, failure. 4 out of 10
