This is a really bad movie. This may seem like a simplification. A volatile childish replica, comparable to a petty unreasonable insult. The truth is, I can’t say enough about confusing meaningless conspiracy, really harsh play (I’m talking here, nasty people) or random images of violence against women who make up a chaotic mixture of radically horrible films - mistakes that promote it , insult all good and dignified in the world of cinema, no, human culture. Please take my word, do not look ... never. I'm serious. Stop. You will thank me for it later.
