To be honest, I'm amazed to see that this film gets relatively good reviews. I will be completely honest and say that the only reason I experienced it is because of Ryan Philippe, and not for reasons, especially related to his actor abilities, although I think that in recent years he has proved himself to be the best actor than his leading roles in the late 1990s. <br /> <br /> As far as action films and unknown films are concerned, this film fails in almost every respect. I think that everything is in order, but the script is absolutely terrible and does not make any sense. The directors are trying to hide this fact by adding absurd references to the theory of Chaos, as if he had convinced someone that the film is actually “smart” - but again, judging by other reviews, some were. Don't be fooled: the script is a boring, derivative mess, and no other element of the film compensates for this. Wesley Snipes probably never played a less interesting role in the film, and Statham is a completely boring actor. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
