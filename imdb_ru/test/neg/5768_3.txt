The storyline is a jumper with a tick, making a deal with the devil to find the gold, and has to defend it forever. A group of friends finds gold and talks to an old miner, and they are forced to blow the gold to smithereens in order to send him back to hell. <br /> <br /> I mean seriously ... how did it happen? This film did not win the Oscar for the film of the year? What a convincing storyline of the last 20 years, running from the jumper with claims right from the 1800s. I like the fact that in other films you cannot kill a monster, but they can knock him off track ... in this film they write the monster as completely indestructible. <br /> <br /> Opening the film clearly breaks the Nightmare on Elm Street, part 4, but, damn, not that this movie was a 5-star classic. cities, never learned to read or write .... yet speaks excellent English, smokes hot and wears the latest fashion. How did Oscar miss IT? <br /> <br /> Well, I ended up with bad jokes, this film is just crap, and watch it only if you have nothing better, and all the spices on the spice rack are in alphabetical order. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
