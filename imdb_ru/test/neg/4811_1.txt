Nynas Mal is not a film, it is a bad episode of a crappy, ill-designed soap opera. <br /> <br /> The scene from the series is not much better than soap operas. I think the writer and director have seen too many Mexican TV shows and cannot imagine anything remote. <br /> <br /> Come on, go back to your soap operas so that you have an audience. <br /> <br /> Stop wasting our time and money and talking ill of the once respectable Mexican film industry. <br /> <br /> This is NOT OK or a good movie, this is a mediocre soap opera!
