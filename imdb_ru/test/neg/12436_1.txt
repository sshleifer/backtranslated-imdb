Listen, don't get me wrong, I love independent films, but come! I could barely sit through it, not wanting to kill myself. the director had absolutely no talent, and he turned something that could be alright into a wild nightmare. I myself am an enthusiastic punk and even the music sucks. acting was shit. <br /> <br /> I tend to have a weeping heart for these low-budget films, but this one, this one didn’t even try. Please do not waste your precious time and money. I'm sorry to be so sharp, but come on! it dragged on and on and on. Remember when the kids got to a party with weird cupcakes and watermelon martini? how did they just merge? It made me upset how they could just go anywhere, get in trouble, have sex and “meaningful conversation” with whomever they wanted. I know that I am chatting, but my mind just buzzes with everything that I hated in this film.
