WEBS is a rather strange film, albeit a little watchable. Richard Greco plays an electrician who is being pulled down by a parallel Earth overrun by mutant spiders, or something like that. The film itself was shot with a modest budget, which explains the limited locales and the somewhat tedious scenario that manages to do very little with a rather interesting premise. Basically this is a 90-minute episode of the TV show "Sliders", and nothing more. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> and reviews of other films in the genre)
