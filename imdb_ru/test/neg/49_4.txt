Frightmare starts with a horror film badge that kills the director and then his servant before he is buried. This icon, which has some of the qualities of Christopher Lee, then continues to haunt others when a group of students of a horror film society steals its corpse from the mausoleum in which it is located. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes are well shot, good writing and great potential for murderous lawlessness. But the film stretches in the middle (although, fortunately, not so much as “House of Death”) and never returns that initial burst of energy. <br /> <br /> Many deaths are confusing because they seem to let people just get scared of fear when they see a floating coffin or other strange things. Twice we see poison gas being used. But the box promises that this horror star will be the embodiment of all the monsters in which he played. Boy, this is a false advertisement, unless he has spent his career playing boring old people who are sleeping and watching Matlock. <br /> <br /> The general principle of a decent movie: children of a horror society steal a dead icon from a dead body. A modern equivalent (digging up Vincent Price or Peter Cushing) would make a great movie. Maybe a remake is fine, if it is not too disrespectful. Sometimes the theory is not so well suited for application, and this film offers such an example. <br /> <br /> The only quality of this film (besides the very beginning) is the short appearance of a very young Jeffrey Combs. I saw him and thought “this is Jeffrey Combs,” but I felt that I was mistaken because the box never mentioned it. But, of course, Combs attended. (Note to the creators of this film: mention Combs on the cover of the DVD, you will sell more copies if you deceive customers.) If you are a die-hard Jeffrey Combs, watch this early role, Otherwise, I can't offer this as a great choice for a film marathon horror Let me suggest Intruder or Popcorn, as they are pretty decent and will stand the test of time.
