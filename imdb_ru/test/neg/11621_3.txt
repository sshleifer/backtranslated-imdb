I really enjoyed BG Seasons 1-3 and really could not understand those who did not like it. But I can not protect this nonsense. Spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> The first problem is that the characters now regularly do inexplicably stupid things: <br /> <br /> So if Starbuck thinks she knows where the Earth is, why not send it ? in a predator? Will the admiral accept the resignation of his third experienced officer? Will the Quorum elect its new member, not elected by Adam the Younger? He has about three weeks of political experience behind him, and he is the son of a man they do not trust. Will Adam send Gaeta and Halo along with Starbuck, leaving himself without senior officers? Would Adam make a man have sexual intercourse with the prisoners in charge of the fleet? <br /> <br /> I just don’t buy any of this. <br /> <br /> Secondly, while I accept. Until the end of the third season there were miracles and mentions of God, but now it’s all on top. I started watching BG because I thought it was Sci Fi, and not some biblical epic. I expected the characters to continue to behave rationally, and wanted to get some satisfactory explanations regarding some of the strange events in the series. <br /> <br /> Baltar was the best character in the series, but now he seems completely insane. It is not illogical if you consider what he went through, but very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> All the characters seem to be just puppets dancing to the rank of an unknown third person (some kind of godlike entity). This is not a good drama, it is annoying and gives a cop. <br /> <br /> OK, so what's so good about that? Good battle at the beginning of 4.1. Some good dramatic scenes (well played), when viewed in isolation. A good final scene, a nice curved curve of events. <br /> <br /> But this is not Sci Fi, but turned into Fantasy. I can't imagine how authors can repair it.
