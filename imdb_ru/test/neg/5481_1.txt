This is the most unpleasant and disappointing game I've ever encountered. Each time you turn around, the game takes control of your character or creates invisible walls that you cannot pass through. Directorial scenes allow you to control the character's movements, but only to a small extent. In addition, you should play the game for about 2 hours to complete the introductory / training courses. It's horrible! I'm afraid that if I continue to play this game, I will break something. This game sucks. The graphics are good, but nothing special, the game is really awful. To say that I hate this game would be a huge understatement. I got it on sale, but I want my $ 20 back. What a waste!
