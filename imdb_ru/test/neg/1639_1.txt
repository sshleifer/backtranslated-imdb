This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although this is not the worst - Manos Hands of Destiny holds this honor. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of problems. To begin with, this entire film is a cheap rip-off of films about Conan. This is a baby in a skimpy dress with a hood, a quiet Asian warrior, a bad guy, a liverworm, almost meaningless soldiers and so on. There are many succession mistakes in this movie. Some of the most stupid mistakes I've ever seen in this movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, when I watched this movie, I saw the version of MST3K. Joel and the bots make the movie watchable, otherwise I would probably turn it off after five minutes.
