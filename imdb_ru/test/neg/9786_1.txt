Nine out of nine people who watched it declared themselves mentally ill for life. No one should ever see this abomination. English is poorly adapted to express how terrible and terrible this “film” is. It really is not worth the plastic from which it is made. The human race has not committed a greater crime in the whole history of creation; there can never be anything worse. <br /> <br /> It was unanimously decided that the scene with Tommy’s wrinkled head and the young girl’s blouse was incredibly sick and distorted; in fact, many of us have not yet recovered from the ordeals and are now sitting in the corner of the room, swaying, sucking their fingers and whimpering. <br /> <br /> However, the main question on everyone’s lips is: “Why ???”. How can someone create such a monster and then expose it to so many innocent people? After watching the trailer, we thought that this film could be a laugh: how wrong we were. <br /> <br /> Please sign the petition to rid the world of “Squeezed Heads” so that other poor civilians are not exposed to its impact. Please, for the benefit of humanity
