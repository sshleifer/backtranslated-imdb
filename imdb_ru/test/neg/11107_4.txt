First of all, let me say that there’s nothing spectacular about this movie. The cast is similar to saving the bell from reuniting, the monster is a guy in bad clothes and as always; military useless. It would seem that the more training you have and the more gun you have, the greater the likelihood that you will die if you fall into a stupid low-budget horror film. Apparently, people in the movie business have little respect for fur seals, marines and ninjas who are at their worst. The plot is thin, a cryptozoologist with a mental origin named Dr. Peña catches a chupacabra. He then smuggles him aboard a cruise ship, where two crew members release him. You can do taxes and watch this movie and not miss a second. The most remarkable part, which really makes it all worthwhile, revolves around the captain's daughter. In the end, she sends all the martial arts to the monster and kicks his ass. Let me get this straight, the monster destroys a whole division of fur seals while they use ARMOR PIERCING ammo !! OK, this is a movie, it can happen, right? But here comes the captain's daughter, who can not be over 19 years old and knocks the crap out of the chupacabra with front and side kicks. It was fun. They should get a medal for it.
