The whole act of Joe Rogan - profanity mixed with bile. He is a smoker who entered the Fear Factor, thinking it was a joke. He said that he would call people, because he did not know how stupid people would be. The producers of the show, which he explained, were going to play the unsuspecting participants to see how far they would go. The level of evil involved is a bit distorted. Mr. Roganâ€™s special offer is simply filled with the fuss of a man who is too good for ordinary people. I find him offensive, and more talented comedians like Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock can hear his stuff. Rogan even makes a five-minute set of N words. In general, ignore this special offer.
