I really joined this site just to write about this movie. I was sitting in my living room, and this film was released on one of the local channels. I did it about an hour before I just got bored. It is curious to see what broad public opinion thinks about this film, and I watched it on this site. I was completely shocked to see that a huge number of people thought it was great. I needed to express my opinion, and here it is: this film is an absolute garbage. It was hard work. The “jokes” were boring paraphrases from other, better shows and films, and the maniacal image of the Leguizamo of this disgusting character should only be ten years old or younger. This can actually be a stretch even for this age. I'm all for the absurdity, but there is not even the slightest hint of wit or ingenuity. I have an idea, let's take the bad boring obvious jokes and play them at double speed. Now it's funny. Ha. Ha. <br /> <br /> Movies you should see with silly humor and the addition of comic time and originality: “Night at the Opera” by the Marx Brothers, “The Meaning of Monty Python’s Life”, South Park: Longer, Longer and Uncut,. .. and the list goes on. Do not lose an hour and a half of your life for unforgettable nonsense. <br /> <br /> By the way, I can only assume that the reason why David Bar Katz (another writer) did VERY little in the film after this film, because he was instantly on the blacklist. I'm really impressed that the Leguizamo was able to recover from this mess.
