This film promised many, very many beautiful and well-played actors, but with a plot that said almost nothing. So many potentially promising conflicts between family members that could be developed and developed, but it was all thrown away and not resolved. There was no story to tell, only a demonstration of acting, technology, beautiful scenes - it was all EMPTY. But then again, the acting was excellent, so many of the individual scenes were interesting, but as you became more aware of the lack of fundamental ideas, even the acting was no longer meaningful. So from a promising start, you became more and more disappointed as the non-story continued.
