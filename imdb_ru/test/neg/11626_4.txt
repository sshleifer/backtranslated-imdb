Mickey Rourke (who was once a famous movie star) plays Martin Fallon, an IRA terrorist who accidentally blows up a school bus full of children, who is so disgusted with his actions, decides to leave the IRA and take flight in London. <br /> <br /> !!!! SMART SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The opening of the film is rather alarming, since the lives of young children end with a fireball. Similar things happened during the 1970s and 1980s and in the 1990s in Northern Ireland, which gives “PRAYER FOR DIED” absolute realism. However, as soon as Fallon decides that he is going to give up violence (“What? Is he a terrorist, and has he never blown up innocent bystanders?”), Realism disappears, and cliches and ridiculous plot twists occur. Martin is hired in the underworld of London (don't they have their assassins?) To hit while he wears the IRA uniform (he never knew that they were wearing uniforms for provo) in a cemetery in broad daylight (isn't it? uses a bomb laid under the car?), Where he was noticed by a priest who recognizes him when he was in CAC. Hands up, who thinks I'm lying? I am not, and we are already halfway through the duration, and there are still a few cliches ahead. <br /> <br /> It all sounds very stupid, but is that what you expect from Jack Higgins novel? Everything is clichéd, invented and stereotypical, and the pieces are not just fancy. Critics killed this film when it came out, in particular, they stated that he could have some potential if Bob Hoskins played gangster Jack Meehan in the film, and Alan Bates played SAS soldier who became a priest, and this time the critics were would be right. They should also note that the film could be less scary if Fallon was played by someone who was able to make an Irish accent. Rourke may be clumsy and macho (oh my gosh, another URA movie with an IRA), but accents are not his strong point any more than acting. To give you an idea of ​​how “PRAYING FOR DIE” frustrates, the director ended up denying her, which is always a bad sign. <br /> <br /> As a footnote, the initial release of “PRAYER FOR PROTECTION” in the UK was postponed for several months. due to the "Enniskillen bombardment". In November 1987, the Provisional IRA detonated a bomb in the center of Enniskillen, where a parade was held on Britain's Memorial Day. Eleven (11) people died and dozens were injured. It was not an accident, and no one left the IRA because of this.
