I have to admit that I am disappointed after watching this movie. I expected much more from trailers. The film was absolutely terrible. There was no real storyline in it, and acting was not quite the best. Do not waste your time. The film is not what trailers make you think. I have to say that I usually do not write anything about films on IMDb (actually this is my first film), but this film was such a disappointment that I checked in just so that people knew not to waste their time or money. The storyline is a story about a robbery that should happen, and it looks like it could be good, but what happens in the film is a bit contrived to be believable. Watch another movie instead, maybe an inner person ???
