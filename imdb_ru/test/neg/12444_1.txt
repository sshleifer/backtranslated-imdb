Everyone has already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obviously from people who were either interested in the film, or had friends / family who were interested in the film, and that's fine - if I did the film, all of my family and friends who will praise there too. Honestly, there are good and bad things in this movie. Unfortunately, the bad things far outweigh the good ones. Good: the overall story was a bit interesting. The music was generally pretty good. A few songs (when they could be heard) were really cool. The only musical problems I encountered were: # 1) the first scene of waiting with some kind of quiet instrumental sound (it seemed to take it away from waiting), # 2) the song that was played when the main characters went to the party in the open air to a friend's house and # 3) the songs that were good were too quiet, especially when the heavy metal song was playing in the background, while Danny Trejo hung up the man (it sounded like a pretty cool song, but it had to break out scenes when Danny Trejo became a frog pendulum). Now about absolutely bad things: the script was terrible. I mean, HORRIBLE. I saw a smoother dialogue in the movie Star Wars. Advice to a part-time and full-time writer: when you write a dialogue, ask yourself: “Is this what people will actually say?” Honestly, the script was ridiculous. I want to quit acting, but with such writing it’s hard to know if they have talent or not. A mildly interesting plot was seriously hampered by a shitty dialogue. I know that it was a low-budget project, but words are not worth the money - if you have a good script, even semi-competent actors can do it. In this film, too, there was nothing, but I hope the director will get a second chance to make a better film.
