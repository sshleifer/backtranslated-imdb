Bad. Bad. Bad. These three lines summarize this shitty little film that can only attract idiotic children and their parents to the movies. and his ... # 1 film in America! What does this country think? Mike Myers looks more like Michael Jackson. Some kind of Chinese lady who falls asleep for 3 minutes. Lame story with dirty jokes. This is grotesque and terrible. When Green-Eggs and Ham are released in 2005, I will be so happy! (not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan are likely to play two hipsters, trying to find the lost green eggs and ham. They will try to pursue the self-me-me and that guy who runs off with it. (I hope they do not spoil the classic book.) Do not waste time and money on it.
