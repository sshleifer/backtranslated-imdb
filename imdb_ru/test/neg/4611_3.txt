<br /> <br /> I thought that there was no dramatic tension in this film that was in the first film. This is hard to do when a movie happens within a week. The original film led to the final climate scene for a year, and it was still less violent than a sequel. One good thing about this movie is that the movie went relatively quickly, because the plot seemed to be in a hurry. When Rachel's best friend died, there was no mention of the funeral in the film. Another disadvantage was the participation of Amy Irving. All her scenes shot down the pace of the movie. The dialogue in this film was terrible. This did not reflect how children say it. In conclusion, this film could have been a hit, but it fell apart after the first scene.
