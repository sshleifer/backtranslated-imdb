I'm not sure who recommended Watching to me, but I think I have an idea: one of the Fat Guys in the movie. The man said he was surprised at how great it was and said that it was one of the most scary / exciting films. (I paraphrase and do it only by heart, so forgive me if I quoted incorrectly.) In any case, I decided to look at it. Therefore, I completely blame myself for failing to watch one of the most awful, predictable and stupid films I've ever seen. Strange, I doubt that I ever called the film "stupid," but this was the first word that came to mind about a third and remained in my memory to the end. <br /> <br /> How to start? An incredible premise and reaction, incredibly mentally retarded characters (you can blame the writers or actors, or I just blame both) and an incredibly bad game. I would rather believe Bill Pullman as president of the United States than an FBI agent. (Of course, there is a reason for this, and I partially understand this.) And finally, if you cannot understand the so-called shocking "turn" in the first 5 minutes, then you should be late in the theater or come into the room to watch its late Do not worry, they will tell you a "turn" every five minutes. <br /> <br /> A serial killer was at liberty in the dreary city in the county or the world. But that is not all! Some stupid and corrupt cops like to throw out tires for their own pleasure. Could there be something else? Oh, yes, there is a family, well, maybe not, but there are four people, one boy, one girl, and an adult couple. The girl says she sees things with much less conviction than Cole sees dead people in the “Sixth Sense”. There must be more than what I mentioned! That's what makes the movie interesting! Adding as many subtitles as possible is the way to go! Well, then I will continue. We have stupid FBI agents who made me laugh. A couple of giggling addicts who first shocked their dealers, but then resorted to robbery. Damn it, a great guy who must have been jailed for comic relief, who always fights an evil / suspicious cop. And finally, (poor, poor) Michael Ironside, who did not just make a phone call with his speech, he just wrote about it. <br /> <br /> None of these works. All of them are told in various forms of presence or in memories, and believe me, you will lose your sense of caring after the first of many stories begins. In addition, the reaction of some of these characters is the most shocking of all. Probably, I mean mostly policemen, but mostly a girl who has lost or not lost her family and hardly blinks. <br /> <br /> This stupid and stupid film stinks. This is hardly terrible, as the one who recommended it said, unless his exposure was limited to goosebumps. What about the name? Observation? Oh, I get it; This is because it was used in 1/50 of the scenes only for filming the interview. Since it is so random, it can also be called COP CAR, BULLET or COFFEE. Just stay away from this terrible mess.
