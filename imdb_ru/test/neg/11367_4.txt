I really liked some things in this game. I liked the first-person perspective, and I would like us to have that choice in the first three games. There is nothing better than seeing monsters near your face. The graphics were not really bad, but I would like to interact with it more, although it was just a shooter. The music was fine. The things I hated were: a movement of slop and purposefulness was a complete pain. The story was too lame for words and too much of the same old thing without originality. The inability to save was terrible !!! Some of us have a life, and they would like to save money to finish the game later. I thought the weapon sucks too. This game is interesting for a while, but it is not like the first three and is only good if you just want to shoot things. I would recommend this for the novelty of a first-person game, but that's all. Play at your own risk.
