Altioclar: Lord of Thieves. <br /> <br /> Watch a movie, steal some parts of it, write a script ... It’s very easy to be a director in Turkey. I think that Altioclar looked at “Identity (2003)”, “Saw (2004)”, several episodes about crime, murder, etc. Then he said “Eureka, Eureka” (I found it!), Then he wrote movie script. <br /> <br /> You can guess the killer at the beginning of the movie. It took me only 10 minutes. He shouted: "I am a murderer, I am a murderer." There is no mystery. <br /> <br /> Tamer Karadagli is the same (Suks). Exaggerated facial expressions, funny macho. <br /> <br /> There’s only one good thing about the movie. The performance of Demet Evgara is very good. You can watch the movie just for this.
