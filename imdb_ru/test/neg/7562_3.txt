I’ve seen a movie many times, and every time I’m more and more disappointed, which is a shame, because films with EX YU are usually very good. The shame here is that Hollywood was trying to make a film about a place and people about which he had no idea. I, who came from the Balkans (Macedonia), found this film disappointing. It’s just that the Bosnian characters are not completely understood and not depicted for real. To understand the mentality of a person from EX YU, you need to know their origin, the way of life that makes them cry and laugh. And the film director did not take this for leadership. When we (EX YU) make films, they build a lot of symbolism, which makes the characters recognizable and cute, and mostly depicts the truth (if it is based on real events). Such films as “Pritti Village, Beautiful Flame”, “Tito and I”, “Underground”, “Land without People”, “Before the Rain”, “Black Cat, White Cat”, “Otak on the Service Path” (When father was on a business trip), “Ko tam Peva" (Who sings there?) Rare masterpiece of Balkan cinema, and nothing can compare with it. Not half-burnt history and Hollywood studio. As someone from the group mentioned that the story jumps from one end of the city to others have no real connection. Sorry, but when the film is shot, it is intended not only for American viewers, but also for of the world, and some of them live in the Balkans and Sarajevo. And to add insult to injury, half of the things shoot in Bitola, Macedonia, where I come from. Imagine that I was shocked when I saw the open street Bitola in the open On the movie scene when the bride is removed from the sniper. And what was this the insertion of real shots with the news coverage in the film? In any case, it is very disappointing, because the truth is far from the film. It's a shame that no one consulted with real people how to live in Sarajevo under fire before they make a movie. a book is one thing, but real life is another, and this film sums up both.
