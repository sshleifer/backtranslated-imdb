One minute in the UNKNOWN, and she is already cut off from the PROJECT technician and the BLENDING PART. Does this mean we will see a lot of trees? We are sure that there will be. Will we see how an Austrian bodybuilder blows things up? Well, this movie has a TVM budget, so the answer is no deafening. Is there anyone like these soft porn shows like bedtime stories? Good, because there is a scene in it that looks like a show of this type. Unfortunately, the only thing you see is cellulite. Do you like when the screen turns black during TVM? Great because it happens between every scene in UNTOLD. In fact, this happens during each scene. Did you like the MILLIONER - MAJOR Fraud? Fantastic because one of the characters looks like a bearded major Charles Ingram, a participant who tried to trick the show for a million pounds. Seriously, one of the characters looks like Major Ingram. I expected him to say: “This is a bear. It could be a bear. But it can be a snow man <Cough, cough>, yes, this is a snow man <Cough, ”this is definitely a snow man <Cough> Yes, I am going to take it off. The final answer is Chris "<br /> <br /> Oh, and I already said that all of the above are good bits? <br /> <br /> THE UNTOLD is not the worst bigfoot movie I've ever seen this award has been firmly established in DEMON'S NIGHT, which I saw more than twenty years ago, and I think I have seen only less than a dozen films that have been worse all this time. But THE UNTOLD is still very bad almost all aspects of the film, especially in editing. As some other reviewers point out, it seems that there are no whole pieces of the film, but as there are other pieces in which scenes are combined in the wrong order. It's really a bad film that deserves far less than the 5.1 rating it. I give it 3 out of ten, and I am very good
