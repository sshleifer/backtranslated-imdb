If you took all the basic elements of the movie “Shrek” (angry cannibal, annoying ass, cute kitty, obligatory dance number, etc.), put them in a blender and concentrated it to 20 minutes, you will have this mess. It hurts to watch; Perhaps I laughed once. History and dialogue are thrown out of understanding: the actors are voiced as if they are ringing in their lines. In the final revised version of the poem “A Christmas Carol” it was felt that it was written by the committee in five minutes. And boy, little Eddie Murphy goes a long way. With his desperate attempt to be fashionable and modern, this show will be long outdated and forgotten, while the classics like "Grinch ??" will remain out of time. A sad waste of all participants, a real “shark jump” for the “Shrek” franchise.
