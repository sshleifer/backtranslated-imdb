“Eaten alive” is played out as a bad rehearsal for the next year's Ferox cannibal. Characters everywhere are mild, places are criminally underused, there are no attempts to create tension or uncertainty, physical effects are either ridiculously bad, or shamelessly stolen from other films, and the ubiquitous scenes of tribal rape are hardly worth PG-13 , than usual. The only slightly shocking scene involves the crazy Jonas, a little Goldfinger, who owns a blood-soaked dildo; a scene that is just bizarre, not graphic. My beloved wife, she from Romeo and Juliet's Collector's Edition, watched this movie without disgust! And it calls itself the film "Cannibal"! In general, a rather unfortunate effort that completely betrays the cannibal tradition. Cannibal Ferox, continued by Lucy, is a much better example of the genre.
