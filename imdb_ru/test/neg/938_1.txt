Saw it as part of the "Confirmation" film festival. I hope they got better films than this one, because this film did not live up to the hopes that viewers could entertain, from fantasy to see James Franco without a shirt to more simple desires, such as decent play, consistent leadership, character development or actual production values. Because of the effects of film schools, such as freeze-frames, showing moments of emotional distress, and obvious influences, ranging from My Personal Idaho to Terminator-2, this film failed at almost all levels to attract an audience. After the first twenty minutes, bravely trying to take it seriously, the audience collectively raised their hands and just began to enjoy the inherent fuckiness of the film. I could be upset that I paid nine bucks to see him, and it was two hours that I would never return, but on the other hand, it was an entertaining two hours that I would never return. It would be a classic episode of Mystery Science 3000.
