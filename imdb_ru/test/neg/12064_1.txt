I'm a fan of slasher movies, especially Scream 1-3, but this is one kill after another. To my amazement: Part II is much better, and you summarize the entire history of the first part! So do not waste time on this and go straight to Part II, you will not regret it, because Part 2 actually has a LAND and is completely self-ironic. First part: 1 out of 10 Second part: 4 out of 10
