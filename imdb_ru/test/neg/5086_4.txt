** Warning - this review may contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> The idea behind the character Danny (Jet Li) is good: the young man was taken as a bully and brought up to behave like a vicious pit bull, mainly controlled by whether his collar is on his neck or not. <br /> <br /> However, the author did not know how to translate this idea into the framework of plausibility. <br /> <br /> He has Danny. meeting with the blind pianist Sam (Morgan Freeman), who must be the most trusting fool ever to exist in the world - along with his silly, endlessly chatting, rather unattractive stepdaughter Victoria (Kerry Condon). By the way, I was stunned when I learned that Victoria was supposed to be 18 years old - she looked to me like 25 or 30. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that there is no romance between Danny and Victoria. <br /> <br /> When Danny reappears, wounded, which makes Sam, but will take him straight home. Danny is absent for 2 days, but do these fools take him to the hospital? Nooo. I don't know if they even called the doctors. <br /> <br /> Now Danny is clearly not a mentally stable person, it can be seen from the very beginning, but Sam takes him to his home, where both he and his stepdaughter could be seriously injured or even killed by this rather strange young man. <br /> <br /> Why Morgan Freeman took this tasteless role in this stupid film, I can not even guess. Of course, Mr. Freeman is not so desperate for a salary. <br /> <br /> Then we have Bob Hoskins in the role of Bart, the gangster who “owns” Danny - now you are talking about your son from a pistol who is hard to kill. The car, which is Bart, riddled with bullets that could compete with the death of Bonnie and Clyde. We think he's dead, but no. <br /> <br /> Then we had another car accident - and yet, Bart managed to escape unscathed. <br /> <br /> In addition to this, we also have Danny. fight half a dozen tough guys at the same time, plus the scene where Danny decided he no longer wanted to fight. I do not care how many people do not want to fight when it comes to the fact that you are fighting or dying, I think that someone will fight. <br /> <br /> As I said in the topic Title - this film is about 40 miles from the border of reality, as we learned it. It is not just a case of a suspension of faith — it is completely beyond that. <br /> <br /> Moreover, I did not understand why Danny's mother, who turns out to be a pretty lady, and not a prostitute, as Bart claimed, became mixed with Bart and his gang and got shot. Maybe it was my fault, I was distracted right during the appearance of this scene - but it seemed unlikely that she and Bart would ever cross. <br /> <br /> 4 stars out of 10 - and this is generous.
