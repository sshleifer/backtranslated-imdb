Well, I have to say that I own this film, and I like only the final. The film is boring and slow, but the final battle is so funny. Let's just say that if the fake bird had not attacked the main evil guy, this film would be 0 out of 10. The bird nonetheless makes it 3. If you are really bored or you want something terrible, watch, ride and rewind in the final battle.
