Not a single film that I have ever seen was even as close as dull and stupid as this piece of junk. And I have always been a big fan of B-films. After watching all this shit, although I can honestly say that this is not even close to the B-movie. <br /> <br /> No one in this film can play if their lives depend on it. The script is so stupid, I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone say that in my life. A writer has to spend several years studying real people to see how they act and talk, even then they will not be able to make a film that can be watched, because it is absolutely clear that no one participating in this film can manage talents. them at all. <br /> <br /> I could make a better movie with a digital camera and a few monster toys. In addition, forget about any sex scenes, women in leather clothes are so grotesque that you rather vomit than turn on! <br /> <br /> Avoid this nonsense nonsense if you do not want to be bored in your mind!
