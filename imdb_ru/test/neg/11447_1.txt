Aaran is one of the films where you will find holes in Indian cinema. Here is one good example of how great scriptwriters, directors and actors lend themselves to producers. Here is one of the most remarkable actors, Mohanlal, starring in a film about the real story in Kashmir. The seriousness of the film is not killed by standard comic scenes and songs. There is this character, Havaldar Jaikumar, who is actually the son of the film's producer. Consequently, he does not have a haircut, despite the fact that his officer asked him to do it. This child does not know what is playing, and he is the “hero” of the film. God help Indian movies with such producers. <br /> <br /> This film is a pitiful demonstration of what is happening in Kashmir. An intelligent viewer can intuitively understand the limitations of such great writers, actors and directors who want to share their real life experiences. But it is regrettable that the film about the highest ranks in the Indian militia turns out to be a pathetic show that makes you think that the film is stupid. <br /> <br /> We have to push out such producers in the film industry. and pave the way for a good movie.
