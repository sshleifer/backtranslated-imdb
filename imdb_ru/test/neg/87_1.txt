I can not believe that people appreciated this film on this site. The letter is incredibly bad when people arrive on time and tell what exactly the heroine is doing, trying to escape. (Don't you just hate when this happens?). And the game is so, very bad, that you can get a fragment in the eyes of all the chewable scenery. <br /> <br /> Walnut keeps her hostage, the children are out of the open screen, so she whimpers for help instead of screaming, when she was brave enough just a minute ago to break windows to shout to the same children. <br /> <br /> She is finally free and alone in the house. Her chance to ask for help, so what does she do? Wandering around the house and lying down. She is in the basement, locked up. So what does she do? A little nap. Come on! Most of the film is a nutlet that goes away and discovers that she is sitting there, dozing when he wakes her up. Four times! What kind? If a writer is too bored to write a real story, why should we pay attention to it? I think that the key point here is that initially it was a game for radio, so they were filled with a heroine who simply sat and did not pretend to be writers and actually wrote some actions. <br /> <br /> And the ending is terrible. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is completely implausible, horribly written and almost comical. Watch out for this movie at any cost!
