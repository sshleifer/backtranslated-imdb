I am at a loss for words. This film is beyond description. I do not believe that there is a language on Earth, where there is a word that can describe how terrible this film is. If you try to watch it, do not forget to stop at the “unexpected finale”. I went through three-quarters of all this shit before I could no longer tolerate it. Fortunately (or unfortunately), a couple of my buddies stayed until the end. When they woke up from a coma and after several weeks of therapy, they were able to tell me about what I missed. In this film, there is no story, plot, horrible scenarios, and even worse acting. If you like to watch train derailments or car accidents, then this film is for you. I think my IQ fell about 30 points from watching this (insert explanatory here).
