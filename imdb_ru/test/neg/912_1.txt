The first 4 episodes of the sixth season are just a cast, predictable and the worst scenario I've ever seen. I will not and hopefully I will not buy it. Also seen in the seasons ago, the episodes about space that they made suck even more. All I want to say to the people who do this is: do not make a whole episode about the cosmos, because they suck. The fact is that season 6 sucks even more than the seasons before. It gets worse from season to season. I was so disappointed and upset about watching the first 4 episodes of season 6 that I just had to write it. Only people who are brainwashed can watch this nonsense. It seems that people who write the script for a long time away from the ideas. I think my 2-year-old nephew had a better idea for the episode than these people.
