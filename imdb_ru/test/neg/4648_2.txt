Cameron Mitchell plays an actor who meets a young actress who has previously met with the head of the film studio (she is too young for both of them!). At the party, when he lights a cigarette, the studio boss throws a drink with a high alcohol content in his face, and he lights up. In the hospital, his face is completely bandaged, and he still lights a cigarette! He becomes a resident of the Wax Museum and the Movieland Palace, where he also lights cigarettes! <br /> <br /> Mitchell restores, more or less, really badly making a burn mask on one side of his face, which looks like gray spot and scotch, and eye patch. When Mitchell does not smoke, he kills people. Well, he only sometimes kills people, as he prefers to introduce to them something that introduces them into a kind of wax to whom. If he does not control him regularly (and he never seems to remember), they again begin to move a little, although they are in some kind of hypnotic zombie state. However, not all of his sculptures are human. He obviously has the talent of the sculptor. <br /> <br /> The end, which seemed to be inflicted in a much poorer font than the rest of the film, is really absurd. They did not seem to know what to do, and returned to the title for the idea. In addition to the strangely grainy final shots, the rest of the film is in pretty good shape, except for the sound in some scenes, which sounds like it was passed through a loudspeaker. Definitely not one of the best wax museum films.
