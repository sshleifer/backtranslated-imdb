Sometimes you just need patients when you watch indie horror. If you can just touch your way through the slow early scenes, sometimes a real gem will present itself ... This (unfortunately) was not the case with Satan’s Whip. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Jason Maran, “The Whip of Satan” is trying to captivate us at the boring film snoring festival, without a real return at the end. I guess black and white (and blue) cinematography must have been for some reason, but it never explains why most of the blood is blue, and I found it getting more and more annoying because the film went on. The story itself is not so bad, and in fact it had originality and decent content, but the game is just pathetic. This, in combination with a slow career and the absence of any real (red) blood, caused the "Whip of Satan" to rather quickly be forgotten. I will give him a rating of "4" for some witty dialogue that made me laugh, but alas, who could not save this boring waste of my time.
