This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and believe me, I've seen a lot of bad movies. I love cheesy horror, but it was just awful. In this film there was not a single scene where I would be scared. All the actors were supposed to be the people they found at the bus stop 20 minutes before the shooting. I would like Blockbutser to give me back my 99 cents. The game was terrible. The letter was incredibly bad. Someone should have shown this film before its release and should have known that it was terrible. I would be ashamed if my name was associated with this monster. Do not rent this movie. If you do, do not return it, so no other poor soul will ever make the mistake of renting it.
