The only good thing that made this film is that it made me crave ice cream, with the exception of the dead parts of the body in it. The film is one of the most stupid that I've seen in a long time. When the Ice Cream King died at the beginning, I laughed so hard because the child took the ice cream from him and started eating it. His mother asked him to say something and had to say: “Leave me alone and let me eat free ice cream so that I can watch my acting career collapse in my youth.” Then I wondered why the prince of ice cream was behind the bars of his truck with ice cream. Anyone going to take twenty cents from him? I have never seen a bar on an ice cream truck window. It seemed rather silly. You might also forget about acting, because it’s just awful. Forget about this movie and go to the dairy queen and get ice cream.
