What you need On the threshold of “What you need,” each episode after “Lonely” was to some extent a winner. This episode is the first serious failure after “Escape Clause”. Serling's script is again based on someone else's technique, the story of Lewis Padgett. As in the case of "And when the sky opened," Serling significantly changed the content, removing the scientist and his car and inserting an elderly merchant. <br /> <br /> “What you need” works best when it is sweet. The opening half, in which the peddler provides customers with items in the bar that they will need in the near future, has a delicate charm that may have been depleted throughout the episode, but works well in the timeframes that he has been given. Unfortunately, the main story he creates is full of gaping holes. At that moment, when the performance of Steve Cochran as a two-bit bandit becomes the main focus, the episode falls apart. Part of Cochran is a hidden stereotype, and his flat work emphasizes this shortcoming. His exploitation of the old merchant is boring and predictable, and the revelation that he will kill the old man is completely unconvincing, and the whole scene of slippery shoes seems completely false. Ernest Truex is good as a peddler, bringing a magical, mysterious, but warm edge to the character, but he is not good enough to help the creaking scenario. <br /> <br /> The situation is getting worse, the weak scenario is also full of inconsistencies. For example, we learn that the peddler’s ability to provide people with what they need stems from the ability to look into the future. Since this is what allows him to produce a pen that magically picks up the winning horses. It seems to be a little beyond his realm of power. In addition, for a person who can see the future, the peddler is certainly surprised to find that the thug is waiting for him in his apartment. In “What you need,” you can find many more holes, but it is hardly worth it when the episode is so thin that you can still see through it.
