A potentially good idea completely fails in a weak scenario that throws all authority out the window, leaving the actors very little work. The mouth covers it as it can, being all mouth; Hert is as big a threat as a fluffy rabbit, and Stamp seems unable to decide whether he plays an ex-London cheater or someone speaks directly from the playing field at Eton. As for poor Laura del Sol, she does what she can, but her character is no more than the idea of ​​every North European about a stereotypical Latin American woman who has all pout lips and hot temper. If you are a fan of any of the main actors, do not disappoint yourself and do not be fooled (as I suspect many other reviewers have done here). Watch it at all costs, but remain critical; You know what these guys can do better.
