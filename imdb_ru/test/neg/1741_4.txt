Uzumaki, which translates as "spirals", falling into this new wave of films about Asian horror after such hits as "Ringu", "Ju-on" and "Eye" (two of them with remakes ... and much more, such as " Dark Water ”and“ The Tale of Two Sisters ”)), does not correspond to the creepy, supernatural thriller element so characteristic of other films, the only thing that remains is an oddity, and not in the spirit of Tim Burton or David Lynch, but not related to business and in a boring way. <br /> <br /> It all starts with a girl, some other guy in love with her, her best friend and his father, who is obsessed with Uzumakis! Everything that happens concerns Uzumakis, people die and you see Uzumakis. So, okay, everything will be fine, I'm a little surprised by the spirals, the characters seem to be nowhere to go, but I play along. We learn that the city is cursed by Uzumakis, people start shouting at Uzumakis, and the fact is that Uzumakis is everywhere, the film is a disaster, he does not know where to go, except to show you the strength of Uzumakis !!!! !!!!! There are some cool concepts, for example, when a mother cuts her fingers, because she sees Uzumakis on fingerprints, but there is another scene in which she hears her husband (from the grave !!) tell her that she also has Uzumakis on ear, as they made this scene just ridiculous, not even fun, there are also a few (some) cool visual effects, for example, the collection of father Uzumakis and a girl with hair of Uzumakis ... yes, Uzumakis hair, they are not there, although it seems taken from the Fruit Snack ad where, if you eat the Uzumakis fruit snack, its Cus is so incredible that your hair turns into Uzumakis, now, if it was not bad enough, suddenly, out of nowhere Are there snail men .. or ManSnails ?? no difference?? do you know why? right? Because in their shells they have Uuuuzuuuumaaakiiiis ??. That was enough for a shitty anticlimatic finale, and by that time I was already tired of fucking Uzumaks .. Uzumaks here, Uzumaks there, of course, look around you, how many Uzumaks can you find ?? If you want to watch a movie about spirals, follow the link PI (3.1416), and there you will find some pretty interesting concepts between the meaning of life and the Dark City has a bit of spiralness. <Br /> <br /> This film could work as a music video, it has already gathered a cult of fans, and therefore I was forced to see it, but after that I am not sure why people think that this is great. I was really disappointed.
