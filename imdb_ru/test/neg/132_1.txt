First let me say that 1 out of 10 is too good for this film. Unfortunately, IMDb does not have a tenth of a star ... I watched this abortion from the movie in the middle of the night because of insomnia, and it was absolutely rubbish. The plot was terrible. The game was terrible. The film was very boring. Malachi looked like Shadow with Alec Baldwin (and Shadow is infinitely better than this). The character Eva was so undeveloped and two-dimensional, that she did not even attract my attention. I didn't even know her name was Eve. Don was interested when he kept his mouth shut. The Twist (if you can call it that) was ridiculous and pitiful. When this happened, the film did such a terrible job of creating suspense or affection for any character that I just thought: “Who gives S ***”. The only thing that made me even raise an eyebrow about this film was the fact that the medic. Dyson was a teacher in Terminator 2 (also a film that was light years before the massacre of the movie.) Anyone who was involved in this film should be ashamed of having spent 90 minutes of countless people. It is not surprising that not a single actor from this film had a fruitful career. To summarize ... This film is so bad, I feel dirty and I need a shower. The worst movie in history, Gigli was better, Prom night (remake) was better, and I dare say that Peel IV was better ...........
