Amitabh and Jia Khan, having high hopes for their press conferences, although for critics and for fans, it was pretty easy, because in the end, this highly promoted product Ram Gopal Verma Factory will fail. , most likely! Why, because Jia was so immature and childish, and Bachchan - mixed and insecure. they themselves did not know what the hell they were talking about to the press, keeping up with the slogan that some love stories should not be understood or something like that! Why is the name Nishabd? Rama must refresh his knowledge of Sanskrit, as Vidhu Vinod must study the Mahabharata, marking the line, another glorious failure of the year, Eklavya! Comparison with Sweet hearts and Lolith hearts is inevitable, as it is assumed that the so-called storyline inspired them. but, unfortunately, Rama hardly made any serious efforts to penetrate deeply into the psyche of aging and the young. Does Lolly Pop suck the ultimate innocence indicator? and contrary to this series of childishness, a foot show at the dinner table with Vijay, that is, Vacchan in this role, continuously bursting with squeals of shameless laughter after arrivals? this girl is actually in her seductive game, luring poor Vijay to think that she is in love with him. the legs are also quite thin, and this act of pumping the water hose through the legs is straight down obscene. it is not clear how a girl who comes to visit the house of a body can be so arrogant, bold and too strong? and why the hell is this stupid wife, played by Revati, remarkably well, although poorly written, and unrealistically characterized, encourages her husband to dance with a sexually-speaking young girl? that part of Vijay, trying to get a little retraining for his funny life, is absolute nonsense. because, apparently, it seems that he is happy as he is, with a well-arranged life and a hobby for rest. This is reminiscent of the blame on Rio, the older father, and his young love, superbly played by Michael Caine. Bachchan looks terrible in close-ups and in everything where Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons looked graceful and beautiful, so young chicks are sometimes attracted to older men because of their charming persona compared to the vulnerability of young boys to their age. The only good thing about this film is the green, stretched landscapes, winding roads and pleasant cinematography. No substance, or even any sparkling show of emotions, drama, or even intriguing, violent sex, as in Lolita, this shallow film is not surprising, it fell apart on its face, and it had to be removed from the screens during the first weeks! The next time, before copying any such topic without thought from Hollywood, Rama must do his homework, and Bachan must think twice! You cannot fool all people at all times, Mr. Bachchan!
