This puddle of derivation stole all famous Soviet films and failed miserably. I still have the experience of everything that is wrong with organized religion in general and with particular shortcomings of the Russian Orthodox Church (note that this comment comes from a believer). Even outstanding cinematography left me without inspiration. I spent his most beautiful moments, very well aware of the masterpieces that he imitated poorly. I would not recommend watching this film unless you have a deep passion for the Russian Orthodox Church, its monastic traditions, miracles in the face of communism and the holy seventies. This is a meaningless film from (and near) a narrow perspective that has done absolutely nothing for me.
