The authors do not know anything about Russian prisons, the film is absolutely insensitive, has nothing to do with reality. They also do not believe that foreign prisoners in Russia have a special prison, so foreigners NEVER live together with Russian criminals. The uniforms in this film look like they were stolen somewhere in Latin America. Prisoners in Russia also do not work outside the prison. Each murder in a Russian prison is subject to investigation, so prisoners kill each other only for very important reasons. Playing football is also forbidden in prisons, contacts between prisoners are very limited, there is no chance of bloody battles, and so on. D. And so on. D. And so forth. So this film has nothing to do with reality.
