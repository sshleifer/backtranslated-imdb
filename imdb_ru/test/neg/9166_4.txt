Something like disappointment. Lee J. Cobb is the head of the Roxton Garments union in New York. His business partner dies when the elevator is released and falls twenty-seven floors to the bottom of the mine, in the worst movie scene. <br /> <br /> Cobb does not know this or does not know. He does not allow himself to realize this, but behind the murder is Richard Boone, who protects the business from trade union organizers. <br /> <br /> Then Cobb's son, Kerwin Matthews, returns from Europe to study the business and join it. his father ran a clean shop. He is shocked - shocked! - find out that Boone beats up union members and kills several who have become irrevocably annoying. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is one of the organizers, killed by a pair of Boon's thugs led by Wesley. Addy. Loggia leaves a widow, Guia Scala, with whom Matthew, understandably and decently, enters the fight. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cobb pays for self-deception, Addy and Boone get only their desserts, and Matthew fusses with juicy Rock, after whom the opera house is named. <br /> <br /> There is no brilliance in any line of the dialogue. A couple of lines were stolen literally from “On the Embankment” - “pistoleros”, “you will speak to yourself straight to the grave”. The plot is sketchy and contains absolutely no surprises. Vincent Sherman’s direction is pedestrian. The photo is flat and not inspired, although there are some good shots of the streets of New York. <br /> <br /> Lee J. Cobb can act. In this case, it must have been easy for him, because he replays Johnny Franley from On the Quay only this time with a soft heart. Richard Boone can act too. Joseph Wiseman, in a minor part, does a good job. Jia Scala gets into her assessments, says what the script requires, and does what the director tells her. Awesome woman, her life was spoiled early. The director and photographer did a good job on Wesley Eddy. He has gray hair, a pale face, eyes the color of a glacial lake, and he is sometimes taken off through a wide-angle lens, which turns his surprisingly fleshy lips into the lips of some parasitic fish. I do not see him as a low-level muscular man. He and Boon were supposed to switch roles. Harold J. Stone is his reliable personality, although he has to be more “Italian”, like Tony, than it seems natural to him. No one else in anything resembling the main part is nothing more than mediocre, and some performers do not even clear this bar. Kervin Matthews may be a good guy in real life, but he is impartially barren and filmed in the home dramas of afternoon television. <br /> <br /> A great name suggesting intrigues and shadows. Some good people in the cast. Potentially explosive exposure of a business, about which few people know, but who deals with megabucks. <br /> <br /> And all this turns out.
