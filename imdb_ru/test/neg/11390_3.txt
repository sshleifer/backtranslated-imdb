The brainless, dressing up little boy finds success in the “Spelling Bees” scheme, despite the unconventional and dysfunctional upbringing. Shirley MacLaine starred and played the main role in the role of the grandmother of the child, and it is always nice to see how long-standing actors get a chance to make a film, the material they turn to, and the actors they want to work with. Here the only person who played well in Bruno is McLain. Child actors seem to have been chosen for their brilliance and wit, and the soft-hearted MacLane keeps his close-ups for painfully long periods; nothing in these cherubim seems natural, except for the lines that fall out of the mouth from consciousness, or from the interaction that they have with adults or even with each other. As the boy's disgruntled father, poor Gary Sinise is hovering around the edges, in mocking shame, always with a painful expression on his face. Toward the end of the film, MacLane transforms all this into the bosom of embracing scenes and even ends up embracing the child in Pope in Rome! Another godless treatise from a talented actress who became a director, who, like Sally Field and her film “The Beautiful”, cannot stop winking and nudging the audience. Shirley uses ethnicity as a joke, and childish innocence is a highlight. Children in this cast roll their eyes, wisely climb with mature comments, use loud words - but when one boyish boy calls our pint-sized hero “gay,” McLane's grandmother instructs him to come and hit the child (before the media!). How's that for progression? * from ****
