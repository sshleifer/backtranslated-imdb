This film was so badly shot. What was with the accent of Jeff Bridges is terrible and unbelievable. Was it supposed to be French, Scandinavian? The script was lame. To the heroine jumped over the grave of her boyfriend, running away from the character Jeff Bridges ... are you kidding? How convenient that Jeff brings his dirty shovel into the house after he gets rid of the bodies on the lawn. Do these people just do not believe in calling the police? Well ... I'll get in the car with you, why not? SPIRIT! Why is Bridgeâ€™s daughter obsessed with her father having an affair, her mother so angry or just plain boring? I did not see the original, it would be difficult to do it yourself after watching this movie.
