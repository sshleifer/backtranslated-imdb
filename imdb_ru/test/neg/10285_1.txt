There is a growing tendency in the media to slander and make fun of men. This is evident in television advertising and program stories. Fraudsters are a prime example; they can find many female fraudsters, but the vast majority of them are men, why? The main threat to the power of any government is in the male population, they are less inclined to submit to power and are more likely a physical combat threat. The way to reduce the threat is to emasculate men in society through the media. Other examples of psychological propaganda are criminal dramas full of smug cops, including aggressive women with large jaws, who blame everyone they call into question, trampling on their rights and making these men feel like scum. In Australia, many male sports stars were recently arrested for dubious attacks and accusations of drunkenness, which is another example of how the government controls the male population, arresting its heroes and claiming domination. Fraudsters, in addition to political fraud, are an invasion of privacy and a violation of rights; moreover, most of these women attack men! If everything was the other way around, men would be in prison !! If it was an honest show, they would have found women scammers, because they were usually not caught due to the fact that their male lovers would be happy to join in and go out unconditionally without swinging the boat. Male lovers want the men to themselves, and want to own and control the men and thus catch the men anyway.
