I watched the first episode and found it to be a very wooden performance. <br /> <br /> I watched the original from the first days on Big Girls Blouse to the latest episode on channel seven. Kat and Kim were a great documentary document, and most people get his humor. <br /> <br /> However, in this American version I think it’s boring, Molly Shannon is fashionable to be Kat Day, Kat’s wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the 80s with her curly permies. While Selma Blair's figure hugging clothes is not as good as the original Kimmy. I also discovered that Selma seemed to be puffing heavily, obviously she (Australian) is 12th size, where Kim should be (Australian) 16/18. <br /> <br /> Exchanges with Molly and Obviously, Selma is scripted and there are pauses in which there should not be pauses or pauses too long, as someone suggested that during these pauses there can be a track of laughter . Molly and Shannon are not used to each other, there is no chemistry between mother and daughter. <br /> <br /> Phil was fine, he had an eccentric air like Kel. However, Craig was handsome, not a sweet, simple, modest Brett from the Australian version. <br /> <br /> I found myself looking at this as a very bad scene. The action was largely wooden, and the exaggeration of Selma's expressions erased the fun in ten minutes. Especially her exaggerated scenes. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I think this show is a waste of time. The script is clearly discouraged for Americans, most of whom say they prefer the original. If NBC wants to show Kat and Kim, why not pay the producers money for showing the original. <br /> <br /> I can only add that Magda is one of the smart cookies that prevents producers from using your Sharon character.
