In fact, you need to be ready to make such a terrible movie! In fact, I am more embarrassed by the fact that I sat through it all. It looks like an old science fiction film from the 80s, complemented by super-fake “special effects”, strange images and a very funny dialogue. Maybe that’s how they wanted it to look, maybe they think it’s great to make films in the style of the 80s, as if they were going back in style. Who knows ... <br /> <br /> If you think that the promised candy will save the film, you will be disappointed - the so-called "kids" are courageous and completely ugly. They can’t act at all, I don’t understand why they couldn’t even get pretty chicks if they needed kids without talent! But I suppose that when you make such a stupid film, you don’t have a very good choice, and hot chicks are not just lining up to make such pathetic nonsense!
