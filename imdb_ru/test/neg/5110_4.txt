From time to time I will remember that I really saw this strange fiasco, which is something like “What happened to Baby Jane?”, “Sunset Boulevard”, Lana Turner’s LSD film “The Big Cube” and the murder of Manson happened in 1969, but perhaps before this so-called “film” was shot! There are already some plot descriptions, so I won't go into details. But it is worth noting that Miriam Hopkins plays a parody of himself: a talkative, ego-manic, fading actress. Perhaps she thought she was shooting a film that would be as successful as one of the horrors of Bette Davis. Old Hopkins never stopped working, so you have to give her to her. In this film, she shows too much meat, and Davis and Crawford would never do that. And there's a scene with Miriam at the most sticky Christmas parade on Hollywood Boulevard, which must have been filmed on Christmas Day 1968. <br /> <br /> Gale Sondergard is old, old, old. It is just shocking how wrinkled and horrible it looks. John Garfield Jr. is a bit like his father, but not so interesting. I think one of the Three Puppets is a guide at the beginning. If this is not one of the Stooges, this is someone. <br /> <br /> I was amazed when I stumbled upon this thing in the form of a commercial videotape, which was given to me by a friend who knows everything about garbage like this one. This is amazing !!!
