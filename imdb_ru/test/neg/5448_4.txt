It is difficult to say whether this is a crazy adventure in a B-film deception, tribute or just confusing, but it does not work, no matter how you look at it. Based on the so-called Michael Crichton novel, it is a crazy mix of lost cities, giant hippos, monstrous monkeys, naive visual effects and banal dialogues. The first thing that destroys this joke is the gorilla, which can communicate in sign language, and, of course, the film does not get any better from now on. By making this whole old rope something worthwhile, Tim Curry is turning into a hot piece of ham and with a strange accent that cannot be identified, and Ernie Hudson, who also seems to know that all this is a bunch of old garbage.
