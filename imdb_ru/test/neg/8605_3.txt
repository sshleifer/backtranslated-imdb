I watched this movie with some dangerous hobby, like a hedgehog caught in the headlights. There is no doubt that (even if you liked it) is a bad film, but the important question is why? He has a good composition; it is alive; he is ready to have sex, some characters get some of this, which is unusual for British comedy. He also has Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook, the Marmite performers agreed, but they had their moments in the past. <br /> <br /> What is lacking in principle is charm. The characters are incredibly idiotic, incredible and alienating, so instead of the movie “Bad behavior of men” producers made Game On. Any mediocre writer who wants to make a film about the sexually intimate, sexist British men would get several copies of "Loaded", "Zoo" or even Viz to read "Sid the Sexist", and this thing would have been written by itself. Instead, the producers obviously tried to come up with some idiotic, difficult-to-care characters. The character of a comedy - unlike a farce, etc. - works only if the audience can recognize some human truth in the current situation. But watching this movie is like telling an annoying joke, which, as you know, will not be funny, but you cannot stop it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is also poorly made. The plot structure is weak, there is little delineation or character development, and many scenes are not funny. Time after time the same slop reggae turns into scenes, pointless and random. There are a lot of unnecessary repetitions - when you made one joke about parking near a sex party, you do not need to do it again. Interestingly, what did the UK Film Council see in the film? <br /> <br /> In this world, most men are a rake, and most women are constantly striving for it. The Apartment and Alfie make fun of the same worldview, but the producers of this film accept it without criticism. So they ended up with some bad updating of the “Confessions of a window cleaner”. Does a Briton need to take a different look at such things and do it right ?? good next project for Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, I think ...
