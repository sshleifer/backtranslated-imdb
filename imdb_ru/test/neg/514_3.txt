Poon intended. This low-budget action-horror film for Don Wilson’s ability to create things is what the live video feed consists of. <br /> <br /> Plot: Wilson is a vampire hunter without humor who is being bombarded by locals. law enforcement after he is forced to kill the creatures of the night in the public eye. The police chase him, vampires chase him, he answers, kicks ... a lot. <br /> <br /> There is a little more in this story, but it is so insignificant that I, frankly, cannot remember it; I think that people actually spoke in the film, but this is up to controversy. The plot is nothing more than a setup for Wilson to kill as many vampires as possible while running, usually by kicking them. <br /> <br /> Specifications are, in a word, anemic. Little color approach, amateur use of lighting, simplified use of the camera and viewing angle. Blood and blood are noticeably limited, strange for this type of film. The most offensive of the shooting failures is the abrupt transition to a super-shaky camera during each battle scene. If the camera starts jumping like a monkey Reese at speed, then you know that Don is going to start throwing everything in the eye. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a bad film that can be made well with a few friends and a great cynical humor. Otherwise, don’t look if you don’t like to watch something kick. <br /> <br /> 3/10
