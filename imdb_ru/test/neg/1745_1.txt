If this were the best in Finnish cinema at the moment, I would say that these large tax euros spent on supporting the “culture” were spent here in a terrible way. Paha-maa is the worst example of trying to make a Finnish “European film” for a large audience. I am sure that they wanted it to be all the most modern, intelligent and touching at the same time. The result is shit. <br /> <br /> In short: - The story is pretentious, naive and not credible. The same goes for characters. I can imagine how they brainstorm about making a film in which “everything, for example, will turn around, and people will suffer and feel, you know, very bad inside, because the Finns are also so sadly known for their depression and myself. " “Read so badly” that brings us to the fact that ... <br /> <br /> - There are a lot of cliches in the film, mainly about the “Finnish mentality”. The way it deals with people's problems and their causes can be straight from an ordinary women's magazine or a cheap book on the psychology of self-help. (“We feel so bad inside!”) I’m sure that they also watched Kaurismäki to find out what people like in his films, they misunderstood him completely and came up with a boring, depressing story about people going through all kinds of * * t for no other purpose than artistic, possibly social pornography. It is a pity that they threw Tolstoy here. This is just a sign that you are trying to be smart. And not to be. <br /> <br /> - I think that the worst mistake, however, is the complete lack of vision and depth. The film is very unoriginal. It is also unpleasant to observe how infinitely sulking and suffering without any real revelation. I can think about it ** ck, if the film is funny or ultimately represents a complex joke, or, even better, something sublime, such as in. Trier's background "Breaking the Waves". They were not in Paha-maa. Although in reality I started laughing at some point, because the turn of events was again too predictable, excessive and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Who is this shit? And who likes it? I hope they pretend.
