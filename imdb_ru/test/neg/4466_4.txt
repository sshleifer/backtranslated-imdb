After watching the preview some time ago, I was looking forward to seeing Steve Martin in a comedy that I thought could be the keeper. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The problem was that the previews were the only funny parts of the movie. The rest of the film was pretty much a bunch of rubbish, scenes that were made to death, and characters that we all saw a thousand times. <br /> <br /> This film was proof that if you put enough money on the table, you can talk to anyone. Steve Martin is my favorite, but this one was a big bastard. The only actor in the film that was worth seeing was Eugene Levy; he was the best of the mighty lame group.
