I don’t understand why you give this film something more than 4 ... It’s fair enough that it returns me to the 80s and to the good old horror comedy times, but this genre hasn’t become better since This However, LAME Low budget - low technology - bad game - bad storyline - not at all scary and not funny enough ... in fact, I can not say anything good about it. The so-called monsters are just awful bad! I mean, we went back to the times when they made monsters out of clay and shot scenes fame behind the scenes ... I really don’t understand why someone invests in creating this script for the film - but I think it’s it would be almost normal if it was a film with a large budget. <br /> <br /> A recommendation would be - please do not make the mistake of wasting time on it, unless you want to get tips on bad Halloween makeup! Personally, I enjoy independent films and something non-standard, but this in no way helped me.
