This film is widely advertised as a copy of the Hitch Will Smith film. This film was boring. <br /> <br /> This film is not so boring as unbearable. Govinda looks far behind his prime. He is not at his best like this role. This is just as unconvincing as his performance at Deewana Mastana. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan in his eye is "the best." And this is in those few scenes where he remembers how to dress. Only through nepotism could the scenes of this sick eye be saved from the garbage bin of the cutting floor of any film. <br /> <br /> Another case where Bollywood embarrasses itself with its shameless cloning. Another case where most Bollywood audiences embarrass themselves by making it a hit.
