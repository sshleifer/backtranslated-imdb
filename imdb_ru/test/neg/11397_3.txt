They said that it will be a film more than “Turkey Fruits”. How dare they <br /> <br />? This is not even 10% of this classic. Bad game The only character for whom I felt sympathy was the one played by Angela Schief. Her acting was the best in the whole film. The story might be interesting, but it is not. Some scenes were shot very nicely (lights and camera), (for example, <br /> <br /> opening scene), but because of a bad game, magic disappeared. <br /> br /> I really don't understand why so many people voted for this film so well. <br /> <br />
