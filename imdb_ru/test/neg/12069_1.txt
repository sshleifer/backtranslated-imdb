CAMP BLOOD <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Sound format: mono <br /> <br /> During hiking through the forest next to Blackwood Deserted Camp - the place of unsolved murder ten years earlier - four young citizens become victims of a psychopath in a mask who kills his guide (Courtney Harris) and stalks them through the forest with murderous intent ... <br /> <br / > Low cost time captured on a camcorder using the sequential three-dimensional Nu-View format. At least there is a plot, but the script is closely related to the well-established plan (with obvious nods at the likes of Friday the 13th, Burning and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre) without adding anything even remotely or interestingly using the formula. Director Brad Sykes — also responsible for similar three-dimensional work such as The Zombie Chronicles (2001) and Bloody Teaser (2002) — quotes George Romero’s early works and Sam Raymi as key factors affecting his career, but for now these directors challenged the mainstream with their no-fuss effort, Sykes uses video technology simply to emulate his cinematic heroes, resulting in a homely film with delusions of grandeur. In addition to the three-dimensional format, there is NOTHING required to attract attention to someone. Following CAMP BLOOD 2 (2000).
