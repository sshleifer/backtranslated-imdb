This is a rare sensation when you come across such an embarrassing film that you feel the desire to turn away from the screen. But when you see a noble actor such as Sir John Gilgud, surrounded by naked, mating couples, this is exactly what you want to do. Add to this Peter O'Toole as the syphilis emperor Tiberius and Malcolm McDowell, thrusting his finger into the anus of the male victim, and you begin to realize that Caligula is of interest only to sick / outrageous drug addicts. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the life of the notorious Roman Emperor Caligula (McDowell), a greatly disturbed man, whose story is told through a series of sexual encounters, beheadings, betrayals, murders, incestuous relationships and lesbian sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Although Caligula was completely insane in real life and probably more often succumbed to his basic instincts, the film is still unforgivable dirt. Sex in the film is not used as one aspect of a multi-layered story - sex is a story. After a while, all naked bodies, pushing the hips and sucking the nipple becomes tedious due to the apparent repetition. The performances are completely undisciplined, especially McDowell, who is careful and gives an idea that represents a pose with wild eyes. O'Toole seems to treat the script with the contempt he deserves (of course, is he in it just for the money?!). It is rumored that additional pornographic scenes were added without the consent of the director during post-production, but in fact there is not a single minute in Caligula that is worthy or well done. It is doubtful that this amount of time, talent and money will never be thrown out on a porn movie again, so in this sense Caligul is a one-of-a-kind experience ... on the other hand, it is so terrible that it is monumental, the fact that this “one of a kind” is a hidden blessing.
