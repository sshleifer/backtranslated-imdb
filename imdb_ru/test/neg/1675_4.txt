When this film was shot in 1980, I was a teenager in the football stands and played as part of the audience. It was made in Musickhart, Illinois. Large letters with the inscription "MOOSEHEART" at the top of the stands were closed by a banner in the cinema. The director would tell us to loudly greet at certain points, as if a landing had been made. The Juvenile Correctional Center in St. Charles is a real place less than 30 miles from the Museum, although I think it may have recently closed. During one scene, they show a black woman and a white man from the spectators watching the game. Right below them you can see the head of my sister Noel (she was then 11 years old). In the VHS version, I can only see her head, but when I saw her on TV in 1981, I saw her whole head, as well as my sister, Jacqui. <br /> <br /> I thought the film itself was fine for what was made for a television film. Since there is already a description of the film, I do not need to repeat it. Worth watching at least once.
