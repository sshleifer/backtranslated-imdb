Steven Seagal played in many action movies. Most of them were bad, but not as bad as the Patriot. This is an action movie from a low-budget action movie Z-series. After the operation "Delta Force", "Act of War", "Replacement 2", "Run Plato", "Base", "Drive", "Sabotage", etc. "Patriot" comes. Now Steven Seagal is probably considered a bad actor, such as Mark Dacascos, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Trit Williams, Jack Scalia, Gary Busey, Chuck Norris, Michael Madsen and many others. The script was full of holes, and the characters were unrealistic (perhaps because of very bad actors), and $ 4.25 that you spend on renting a Patriot is called “Lost Money” !!! I give 0 and a half (for laughter) of 5.
