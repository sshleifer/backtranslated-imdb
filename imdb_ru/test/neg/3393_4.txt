That is why this film did not live up to its potential (I do not read much, so I don’t care what the novel looked like) 1. I think Brendan Fraser copied his man Encino from Tarzan Lambert. It was tough, and although his appeal to Tarzan was a bit more realistic, he did not have humanity. 2. They screwed up with the story. Maybe it is written in the book, but as far as I remember, the first statements of Tarzan were “I, Tarzan, you, Jane”. Jane - the first human meeting with Tarzan. I liked the natives a bit more than the miniature Pygmies in the Weismüller variant, but these bows and arrows were a bit silly. 3. Tarzan is first of all a love story. Sorry, but love interest enters the picture in an hour. This gives her the best role at best. Supporting roles and leads do not match, there is not enough time for the screen, sorry. Not only did Andy MacDowell feel pity for pathos (most likely because her strong southern accent could not be disguised), the chemistry scale between Tarzan and Jane was enormous 0. I never believed that they loved each other, which made the Belgian guys silence the voice Frankly, stupid. When Tarzan first sees Jane in the jungle, he feels a desire, if you will, a feeling he has never experienced before. Jane reveals humanity in him, and he reveals its unbridled side. This is chemistry that is irresistible in the history of Tarzan. Not that Lord Greystoke’s dying wish was to keep his land whole, and this Johnny boy would do it for him. Even a good face lift could not help this film. Requires massive internal reconstruction. Oh, and we could shoot more in the jungle, or at least use camera angles that do not demonstrate the sound scene as the qualities of this place. Final Judgment, 4 out of 10. Sorry Tinsmith, and by the way, if you want to see a real game, drop Lambert and check Leonardo DiCaprio.
