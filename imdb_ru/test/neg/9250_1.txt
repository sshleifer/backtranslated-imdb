As bad as good - not only the script is obvious, but the acting is not just bad, but pathetic. The worst of all is the definition of characters: unrealistic inventiveness, affected reactions, the camera makes you look at the surface aspects that are introduced as keys to the plot. <br /> <br /> I can not stop laughing, when in the end, the main character tells the second something like “your daughter does not play football and does not know cooking”. Such an insult to the female intelligence determines the level of this film. <br /> <br /> This is a film about the psychological behavior of the second character, his influence on the main character? Or just a sequence of events taking place in order to warm up for an obvious ending? <br /> <br /> Please make more of them - I had a good time wondering what will happen next ...
