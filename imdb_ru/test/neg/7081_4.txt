As a documentary, it is ridiculous in some way - a shocking collection of recreated biblical tables, mixed with solemn interviews of so-called "experts." Think of it as a commercial that pushes Jesus instead of hip masters. <br /> <br /> However, the detailed scene of the crucifix in terms of historical accuracy is superior to similar scenes in widescreen Hollywood extravaganzas such as Ben-Hur, King of Kings and Greatest History in All History. Reported about this. " For example, instead of dragging his entire cross to Calvary, John Rubinstein simply carries a cross-piece, tied over his shoulders, to his outstretched arms. Nails do not beat on the palms, but on the wrists. His feet are not nailed separately, but one is put on top of another, so only one nail should be used. By the way, the spanking of Rubinstein before his crucifixion takes 35th place in the book “Whip! Hundreds of great scenes of people who are beaten in films. ” <br /> <br /> Of course, Rubinstein and the two thieves wear modest loincloths, which probably does not correspond to the shameful reality of the Roman crucifixes, but it is necessary to make assumptions. It is curious that the “good” thief is on the left hand of Jesus, which contradicts a long tradition. But why exactly this thief is played by a fat, overweight man remains a mystery, especially given the fact that a “bad” thief is something like a “goat”.
