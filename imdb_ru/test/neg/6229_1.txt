Wow! Awful, terrible, terrible, terrible, did I mention terrible? You can only say from the dvd cover to not get this movie, but unfortunately this was not the case. Well, someone brought me this house to see and when I looked at it, I just wanted to strangle the person because they used my money. I, of course, will return them soon, but I could also tell you about it, as long as I have in mind, because I definitely want to forget about it. This film does not deserve to be called terrible. This is beyond horror. Quite possibly the worst movie ever. The acting was so-and-so, so-and-so terribly disgusting, as were the deaths that were so COMPLETELY limp and even predictable. I didnâ€™t even laugh at how bad this film is, which scares me a little. Do not watch this film, do not disgrace if you even look at this page of the film, and I am very sorry for you if you look at this page of the film, because you think it will be DECENT.Final word: YUCK !!!! !!!!!!
