In Sweet Water, ambitious entrepreneur Dick Kranz (Jim Storm) is building a resort in the middle of the desert under the protest of the Katons. When the three workers find some Indian relics and bones in the ditch in place, they accidentally release a giant skeleton-like creature known as the Bone-Eater, and their bones are devoured by the monster. Half-breed Sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) a.k.a. The Running Wolf is responsible for investigating the disappearance of workers, putting pressure on Krantz to arrest the protesters. But the Bone-Eater attacks and kills other locals, while the Storm Cloud (Michael's Horse) is looking for an ancient Tomahawk who can destroy an evil creature. <br /> <br /> “Bone Eater” is a stupid and stupid film from the funniest script I've ever seen. The characters and the situation are underdeveloped, and everything happens without any additional consequences. The conclusion is probably the worst in this film: the typical white North American Bruce Boxleitner, dressed as an Indian (in this story his grandfather was an Indian), cut his own wrist (why? And where is the blood later?) And clumsily throwing an ax into the bone eater's chest by destroying the monster and my last hope for any improvement in history. My last question is: if a bone eater eats bones, what happens to the flesh and clothing of his victims? My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Devorador de Ossos" ("Bone-Eater")
