This film follows the Riddle Tracks for an all-star British cast in a totally awful movie! Bad cgi effects, poor editing, bad direction, cast, which I hope was well paid for, as it will be a nail in many career coffins. <br /> <br /> Nigel Glider should have put his Neil wig on again & at least came out laughing! <br /> <br /> It looked like a particularly long and protracted episode of "Torchwood", but without a fake Canadian doctor, a guy ... he had the same overly dramatic music, although it constantly repeats itself in a vain attempt to raise some tension . <br /> <br /> O mankind!
