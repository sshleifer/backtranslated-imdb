The lack of character development is fatal for this film. The character of Valeria Golino Grace begins to look like a bipolar personality, but quickly degenerates into a caricature and seems unreal. Other characters are subtle, probably the authorâ€™s fault, not the actors. The only exception is Filippo Puchillo, as the younger son of Filippo: his energy and bravado are funny and convincing. <br /> <br /> I believe that the petty cruelty of children should help create an atmosphere of joylessness and emphasize the all-pervading primitiveness in the city, but for me, baseless cruelty is unnecessary and contributes to the general boredom of the film. Some scenes were funny, but not necessarily intended for this, for example, when badly collected dogs are fat and healthy and look as if they are ready to show. Cute cast and decor make for an attractive trailer, but they can't carry the whole movie.
