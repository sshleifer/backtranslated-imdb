I agree with Jessica, this film is pretty bad. I'm surprised someone took this seriously. Characters are one-dimensional, even good guys and especially bad guys. The only merit is that it's so stupid, it's funny. In fact, for me there is an added advantage that he was shot in a state park not far from the place where I live, so seeing some local sights on the big screen is a scream. <br /> <br /> The main character is a policeman on duty, and it makes a lot of sense to teach a good guy that fair justice is not just a bad idea, it is against the law. Imagine how long it lasts ... <br /> <br /> Most of the movie's heroes in Northern California are Hollywood blow-dried cheese balls, it looks like they never fought. The storyline is completely predictable. This film is ripe for lighting MST-3K. Only CAMP value. On the whole, I take a condescending attitude to films, but after seeing the old positive reviews, I had to express myself. This is a dog. I give it 3 out of 10, and then just for a laugh.
