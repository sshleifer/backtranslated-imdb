I can imagine why he wanted to die after starring in this garbage. This man is incredible, but even Sidney Poitier could not save this tedious moral game of racism in the old West. He and Joanna Going are both fantastic in this film: too bad a script, colleagues, directing and judging can not be compared with these two.
