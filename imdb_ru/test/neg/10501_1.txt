So, this is the worst movie you have ever seen. It's there with Crossed Bones and Southern Comforts, but if you're such a bad movie fan like me, then this crime of the movie will be the most fun thing you've ever seen. WHY does the camera make the old-school kung-fu sounds while zooming in? Why does this random guy stuff a nascar memorable plate into his bag? And who is he? WHY do vampires shoot lightning after death? What is it? Highlander? Dracula McCloud? What's the difference! Just laugh at it. In this film there is no continuity, plot, nothing at all. Ron Hall's range of emotions is always off. He looks happy when he is sad, angry when he should get confused. The rest of the actors could not get out of the paper bag. Special (“special” short) effects are randomly arranged and never needed. Most of the scenes are illuminated with a desk lamp, if they are generally illuminated. Mel Novak has AUDACITY to watch his line behind the scenes, and she’s not even edited. They just keep shooting. In fact, half of this film is not filmed at all. This is 1/2 film, 1/2 Sony manual camera. For most of the film, it seems they left their booming microphone at home. In this film, not just a few plot holes, this is my field of confusion and heartache! But oh, I love it! Thank you, Ron Hall, for this cinematic abomination. I went out and bought it because it's so damn funny. ($ 1.99 at Amazon, and I got it in a hurry!) <br /> <br /> "I have a weapon! I have a weapon! I have a WEAPON!"
