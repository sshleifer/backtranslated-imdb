Close, but not a cigar! - such is my opinion about this film! TAG PURVIS and wrote and sent this script, which was to be redone before shooting. At times, ridiculously or tritely, the bright star of this film is Dan Mongomery Jr. and director of photography. Both of these talents should pay attention in the future. I recommend waiting until he reaches your local cable station, and use the money to rent a classic!
