The parrots? PARROTS? I have been around this old land longer than most, and have seen almost all the westerns that have produced. The history of the old West is my passion. Luna Comanche is one of the worst prepared, directing and acting stories I've ever seen. There was very little historical accuracy, but obviously you worked with a limited budget, which <br /> <br /> played a certain role in this insult to intelligence. I am happy that I TIVO made this show. It was bad enough to sit and watch a movie and put up with meaningless advertising. Once again, there was not a single actor who fit anywhere almost convincingly. I continued to hope that this would improve as I progressed for three days. WRONG! I am ashamed to say that I spent 4 and a half hours of that precious time that I had left.
