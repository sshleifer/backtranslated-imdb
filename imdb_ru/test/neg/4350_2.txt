Decent action movies, but the film is burdened with a slow, confusing storyline, an almost non-existent dialogue leading to minimal character development, and a horribly horrible storyline ... <br /> <br /> I mentioned that the storyline does not make sense? But, in turn, the action scenes were impressive enough, even if they made you scratch your head about why they just happened. <br /> <br /> Thereâ€™s nothing more to say about the movie. This is a clever, thoughtless adventure action that makes no sense. It's like watching the worst version of the Matrix and skip the whole storyline and dialogues.
