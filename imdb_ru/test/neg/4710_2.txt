I rented this film because Elijah Wood did a good job, and I thought it might be overlooked. It was not a treasure. I don't know if it was right on the video, but it was supposed to be right at the dump. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood’s fans will love the fact that he looks shirtless in a too-short shower room, but no sensible person would want this scenario. Imagine Memento, played by young actors, but ten times more intricate and a hundred times less believable. Case in point: Jane Garofalo plays a caring psychologist (apparently, “keeping the chain of mediocrity alive”). <br /> <br /> As if the fake memories syndromes and mind-matter medicine are not sufficiently contrived, the film also depends on one of those inexplicable twin mental connections that make the story move and the audience is confused. This same twin relationship creates too many contrived love scenes between Wood’s character and the girl from the film “She’s All”, which plays the holy sister of an evil friend, Wood’s cancer victims. <br /> <br /> Add to the banality of this scenario, Wood’s other friends are mentally retarded cancer victims and a kidney, a young black boy suffering from a mysterious kidney disease. A dying kidney desire comes true when Dr. Garofalo gives him his Walkman. The hackneyed function of this character in the story coincides with his attitude again, again and again to walking. Usually wheelchair bound, Kidney has several unexplained scenes showing that he is pushing others in him. <br /> <br /> Kindi’s characteristics may be one small detail, but this points to many other shortcomings of this film. The bumblebee flies In any case, it is definitely clumsy, but it never flies.
