Apparently, a massive head wound is a cure for suicidal tendencies, turning a deadly sociopath into an attractive, sinister catcher of dogs. In addition (this is for women), it seems that the front gate of the psychiatric hospital is a missed hot spot for meeting with potential comrades. These are just two of about 23 absurdities that we have to accept in order for this film to have any meaning. I love movies and I think that I think many Americans (sorry if I'm wrong) Hollywood turned out to be the best product. I came to find out how sadly naive and brainwashed me, and 2) how much more sophisticated European / Asian cinema is compared to its American counterpart. <br /> <br /> I watched this supposedly disturbing psychological “thriller” the night after watching a Japanese film called Suicide Club. When the camera disappeared into Walter Sparrow’s happy little family, spending some time at the table in the prison room (not to mention the protective voice-over, praising the virtue of “doing the right thing”), I suddenly had an epiphany. I just finished watching a movie that made me feel like I just had a glass of water when I really wanted a beer. My thirst was quenched, but it was strictly utilitarian. The package was slightly interesting, but the story itself with its innumerable "coincidences" (How do we explain that she found the book? We just say something like: "... Or did the book find it?". "They" I will buy it) , the gaping holes in the plot (why did the wife take the skeleton?), predictability and the obligatory happy ending turned out to be just another Hollywood hacker work. Also, Jim Carrey’s casting was just wrong. At any moment I felt that he was able to crack some kind of joke from one of his stupid comedies or “In a lively color”. Jim Carrey as a tattooed, hard-boiled police detective who loves slavery and rough sex? I did not buy it for a second. <br /> <br /> Do you want to bother? Deeply in the way? Watch the Suicide Club. The story surrounds the mysterious mass suicide of 54 schoolgirls. The film begins with a giggling high school girl pondering over the platform of a subway train. Then we watch with horror as they line up, hold hands and joyfully rush in front of the fast moving commuter train. Needless to say, there is a lot of chaos. This is as far as I'm going to go with the plot, because I urge the reader to watch the movie. In fact, I'm not sure if I can describe the plot, even if I wanted to. What begins with a simple mystery quickly descends into the insane asylum of grotesque images. I understand the movie? No, not initially, as in many foreign films with which my girlfriend introduced me. Naturally, I thought it was “bad.” But this one lingered in my head. I went to bed thinking about the movie, and woke up the next morning and looked at IMDb. I read some of the comments from the audience and was surprised by 1) the insight that others had learned from the film, and 2) the fact that I so carefully missed the whole point of the film. I realized that I was so accustomed to the fact that I was “fed” with a false “message” from Hollywood that when I ran into a film that really required the participation of the viewer so that he could think for himself, I was completely out of gear. As if I had to “test my brain at the door” of the theater. <br /> <br /> I say that the “Suicide Club” is the greatest film ever made? Of course not. It has its flaws, many of which were cleverly reported by the IMDb reviewers. I say that all American films are bad, and all foreign films are good? Again, of course not. My point is that there is a whole world of film production outside Hollywood that attracts the viewer; makes them think and cast doubt on films that do not transmit plot twists, follow a strict linear sequence and, above all, do not offend the intellect of the observing person. I look forward to expanding my horizons by exploring this new world of cinema, which “does not think for me.”
