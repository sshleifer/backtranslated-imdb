I heard that this Japanese film is sharp, creatively interesting, “cool new tang” on the Asian cinematic scene ... maybe even such innovative as Ringo by Hideo Nakata or Oldboy by Chan-wook, especially the latter. <br /> <br /> You can imagine my disappointment when, instead, I discovered that the film is fragmented both in narrative and in cinematic terms (although not as much as a film fan appreciates), even in cliché stupid instead. Funny - in short, a very bad blast in Pulp Fiction style. <br /> <br /> I stopped looking after 30 minutes when I was disappointed that I had become something more than what I had. ,
