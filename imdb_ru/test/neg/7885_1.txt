This is one of the rare films that I do not immediately discuss with friends after watching. It was not because I was particularly impressed or impressed. On the contrary, it gave me absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> Why? Because, one way or another, everything was so exaggerated that I could no longer take this film seriously. There was so much sex and violence that I got the strong impression that the film is very, very hard trying to be offensive, as if it was aimed at a superlative degree in ugliness, and does not tell a compelling story about two women caught in the Crime Spiral. <br /> <br /> Bais-my was described as “Thelma and Louise with real sex” for me. Well, it's true that the basic idea is similar. There are two women who travel around the country because they have committed crimes and know that their lives are now over, that the police are going to catch them, and they decided that now that everything is over, there is no way to hold back. <br /> <br /> Baise-moi was described as a feminist film where women who suffered from male domination in the past took revenge on the men they encounter. <br /> <br /> This is something that I have never interpreted in this film, simply because none of these women have ever been innocent, and because they kill not only irresponsible, cruel men, but also men, whom they seduce themselves, men who show a sense of desire to have protected sex. And they kill women. No, they are no better than the characters, whom they meet and kill in disgusting, cruel ways. <br /> <br /> How easy the “heroines” decide to kill, and how much pleasure they get from it. it's absolutely impossible for me to treat them in any way or even take them seriously. It was just too much. Too much sex, too much violence. I got the feeling that sex and violence exist only to create a superlative degree in disgrace, and not to convey a story or make a point of view. <br /> <br /> Baise-moi did not leave me the impression that he hadn’t make me think because it was so far from any real world. Designed, unrealistic and excessive. <br /> <br /> I couldn’t do anything with this film, there was simply nothing to think about except “Why did they make this terrible film?” If the serious unpleasantness that takes place in this film served a purpose, I would easily took it. But since I didn’t find anything, since the story of the film turned out to be nothing more than an excuse to squeeze as much as possible and ugly sex into one movie ... I left it under "unnecessary torture", never decided, NEVER watch this film again, and now I believe that this is the worst film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Worse, not only because my cup of tea is not to watch people being raped, raped, having sex in other forms and killing each other ... but because all that the producers want to tell the world with their film ... if they wanted to say anything at all ... it just didn't work. And nothing can save this film, because it is also shot in such a terrible style.
