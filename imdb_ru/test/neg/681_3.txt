This documentary is full of problems. <br /> <br /> How arrogant to make a documentary about your family? I understand you think the topic is interesting. I was bored with that. This is not an exciting story for me, and I don’t know why you think it was. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to seem bad, but I have to say: most people in this film are simply not attractive. And this is normal, not all beautiful. But the technique of your camera — plugging the lens into their face, so that you can not be overwhelmed by their unpleasant appearance, because it fills your 47-inch TV — is not very pleasant. I had to raise my hand half the time to cover me from warts, wrinkles, bags under my eyes and yellow teeth. In fact, I try not to seem inhuman, but pull the camera back so that it does not seem to me that completely strangers breathe in my face. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera in this “movie” is amateur level. This is the kind of work with the camera that you see in everyone with a video camera at a family picnic. Uninteresting shots, unstable, even static shots were taken carelessly. Make a little effort if you are going to make a living. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I do not understand what this is about.
