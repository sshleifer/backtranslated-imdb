The initial review I planned for this film was perhaps a bit harsh, so I anticipate a good one: Sleepy Hollow is a perfectly acceptable film about beer and pizza or overnight that you watch with a good group. people when the mood is light and no one focuses on the film. The visual elements are beautiful, and it's funny, piece by piece. But horror, my friends, it is not. I made the mistake of watching this, expecting something to tremble when the lights were off. If this is your intention, send me a private message and I will offer you a list of alternative recommendations. (By the way, this is a serious offer. True horror fans deserve the best.) Now my complaints, complete with SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS or the subject of the original? Listen carefully between the lines of a poorly written dialogue, and you will hear the slow outflow of Washington Irving, rolling over in his grave. I'll even take a little detective from a big city, but ... Ricci draws protective hexes around the bed? Let's do now. In “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” there is nothing even vaguely similar to this, but it is a historical SCIENCE. I don't care what kind of neo-pagan ax you have to grind, but in the 18th century, “witchcraft” meant selling your soul to the devil in exchange for devilish powers; This whole fluffy approach to witchcraft, based on the worship of the goddesses of the white witch, "without harm", historically dates back to the time of the British invasion. (If you don’t believe me, parties interested in the real pagan practices of the old school are mentioned in the James Fraser’s Golden Branch.) This creates such a discordant element added to the context of the film that the Sleepy structure itself is an Empty Legend destroyed. Thus, we get a completely different story. If this was Burton's idea, I would like him to warn us in advance. In addition, I would like him to come up with a better story than the rather pedestrian one that I witnessed here. And he could well refuse the claims of Irving as a whole. And, in any case, the film is not scary. Never. It's my pleasure. The deformed tree approached, but was more than balanced by the ridiculous effect of the roar of the Hessian comedy. Finally, yes, I also wanted Christina Ricci for Christmas, but God obviously did not want her to be blonde.
