I was 12 years old when I watched the original film (I lived in Italy, and the Italian name was “FBI, CAT OF WORK!”). It was a fun movie, and not just for kids. This terrible remake is pitiful even for a 5 year old child! What made Disney ruin their reputation and the memory of a beautiful film, I don't know, and I just can't believe it. Even the title track in the original film (both the original and the dubbed Italian version) was very sweet and created the mood for the story. In this remake, the title track is even worse than the movie itself. It was just nice to see Dean Jones, even if he only appeared in a cameo role, he was a regular participant in the films of the great old Disney. To be honest, I don’t see anything positive in this converted movie.
