Once upon a time Quentin Tarantino was a relatively successful director. <br /> <br /> Now, unfortunately, he not only makes horrible films, but calls them like that. <br /> <br /> Presumably cool retro memories of biker films from the 60s and 70s, this plunges new depths into itself. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I like it when the blouse falls in the film more than the next man, but even I felt kindly sloppy to watch it. To use a word that I never thought of, his mussoginism (you see, I can't even write it down). The plot (in the vague sense of the word) is as incomprehensible as the accent of Vinnie Jones, the fact of his terrible play does not stand, especially this damn testament, which you can think of. <br /> <br /> This is just awful. Shocking. It almost made me cry. Horrified.
