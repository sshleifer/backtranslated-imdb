I suppose that in 1961 this film was supposed to be “cool”, but, looking back (45 years), its charm was as stupid as its entertainment value! Of course, special effects work well on the series, which began in 1964, but for a BIG screen ?? I once had an aquarium that was just as exciting! I have to agree with the Octopus scene at the end, where she joined Sea View. Obviously not well organized ... or trained! In general, playing with bad special effects is pretty bad, and I still recommend it - just for fun. It was probably one of the biggest films of Irwin Allen, and I think he thought a lot about it. Barabara Eden continued to play "Djinn" on TV Michel Ansara was her Husband. This is the cool part of this movie! I always liked to see the stars of real men and women in one movie. Neatly!
