** Possible spoilers ahead ** <br /> <br /> Whenever fans of bad movies gather for more than a few minutes, the name Larry Buchanan invariably appears. This amazing director presented us with remakes of other turkeys (ZONTAR THE THING FROM VENUS), crime jackets with a cheap jack, such as “Boulet for a cute boy”, and crazy conspirators like DOWN ON US and GoodDYE NORMA JEAN. THE HORROR OF LOHA NESSUT at least humiliates. Seeing the fact that Loch Ness is extremely long and narrow, Larry was shooting this howler on a wide and round California lake. At the beginning, the film boasts a dazzling (for a budget) underwater photo and creates some atmosphere despite itself. Then he degenerates into a windy dialogue, pronounced by nameless actors with worn Scottish accents, not to mention a soundtrack that does not change anything for heavily slandered bagpipes. At some point, the tourists are singing "Take the main road, and I - low" to add another Scottish phrase. If the Scots ever decide to jump on the bandwagon of Political Correctness, they will sue Larry Buchanan for this film, despite his last name. The monster looks like a giant papier-mâché puppet, and compared to him the dragon in Beanie & Cecil looks awful. In one unforgettable scene, Nessie sits down and, in order to avoid patrolling soldiers, a fifty-foot creature tries to hide behind a tree — and the soldiers do not see it! The horror of Loch Ness is a stunning mind that needs to be seen several times to be believed.
