I didn’t like watching DS9 compared to other Star Treks, even Enterprise, but I didn’t like Babylon 5, and now I know why. This is the same show. I just read the old news that Paramount stole this idea from the creator of Babylon 5, but they decided not to sue for a reason I don't know or don't care, but seeing that the Star Trek series is based on something else, an even more tedious show. Now I will condemn anyone who even mentions DS9 when he talks about the series. Original, TNG and Voyager are my favorites in this order. Before, I did not understand why everyone thinks DS9 is great, but I don’t, but I know what I know. This is also because the captain has a real problem of anger, and I hate people who behave cool, but get mad from nowhere; and he seems to be in every episode.
