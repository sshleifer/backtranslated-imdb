Despite the fact that the widespread and excessive use of the game format is used throughout the entire film, this does not fail. Rather, it is unpersuasive female performances and a rather tedious script, on which the film clearly relied too much. With an idea that had potential, the simple plot is still diminished due to Grahamâ€™s inability to truly express the havoc that her character so adamantly claims to experience. The use of improvised scenes by all actors would not be such a bad idea if only two leading ladies could take advantage of this privilege. As Downey Jr., as usual, proves what a gifted actor he is, he hides two actresses in their scenes together, which is always noticeable. It seems that the senseless, but intense sex scene exists simply so that the film is not too verbally expressive, giving the actors a well-deserved break in the conversation. With an unsatisfactory conclusion, the two girls and the boy, very little to recommend him, except for the terrible Downey Jr., if not inappropriate performance.
