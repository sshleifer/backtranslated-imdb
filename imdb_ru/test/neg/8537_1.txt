I do not expect much from ghost stories, but I expect the story to make sense! Does it require too much from writers and directors? When a bad guy suddenly becomes a maniac killer just because a bunch of crows start pecking at him, then I have problems losing $ 9.00 per ticket! Alfred Hitchcock will rotate in his grave. Nobody learned anything in their 101 College film class? A good movie is based on an INTERESTING story! <br /> <br /> Here are some of the ridiculous posts in this film: If you have desperate financial problems, move from Chicago to the city center in North Dakota to grow sunflowers (I'm not joking!). If your baby has serious neurological problems due to a car accident, move from the best hospitals and speech therapists in the country to a small isolated city in which, at best, there is a public hospital. Hire a stroller to live and work with you, out of the blue, without checking any recommendations when you have a teenage daughter, wife and baby. (I am glad that they are not my parents!) <br /> <br /> A city where everyone knows everything, without any problems will miss the triple murder, not far from the city. And, of course, blame the bad crop of sunflowers for a man’s madness! (Nothing grows in North Dakota anymore?) A couple of days after you buy your worn out house with huge vines all over the place, it reminds you of Jack and the Beanstalk, the X-Files guy, ala Smoker. (I am glad that they didn’t get him cigarettes, he probably doesn’t breathe!) Just suddenly sneak up on you while you work to offer you the price of selling your home, plus 15% more, absolutely for no reason! <br /> <br /> I think you understand. Last month I saw a lot of horrible films forgotten by God, it just amazes me! Is it really so difficult to make a film that does not treat the audience as an idiot? I am glad that at least the crows in this pitiful film turned out to be a bit brainwashed! I would like to say the same for those who think that they will make money on this celluloid piece of garbage!
