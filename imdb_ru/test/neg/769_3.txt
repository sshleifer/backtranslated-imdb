Dumb is right: Tom and Jerry achieve their goal of a non-stop air flight to Africa, but then worry about mingling with the locals. They put on a “black face”, smash a plane, try to survive on an airplane wing floating in the ocean, and then wild animals survive when they are on land. <br /> <br /> After reading a few reviews before seeing this, I knew what to expect. It’s just that these two guys made their impressions of Amos and Andy / Stepin 'Fetchit. Insulting black? Of course, but this is the 1930s for you. Some of their lines were funny, some were stupid. The main mistake I encountered in this cartoon was audio, because it was often not easy to understand what these two guys were saying. <br /> <br /> In general, a curious thing, but do not let racism stop. You check it. At the very least, it gives you an idea of ​​how times have changed ... for the better.
