A pretentious horror film, similar to a soap opera, telling about drugs, sending you to a fantasy world where strange creatures are hiding. The film has good images, but the strange combination of what is real and what is not will not go anywhere. Worse are the vague remarks in the voice of one of the characters. It looks like it foreshadows a more serious, more significant film, but I donâ€™t think they even got into serious or significant territory from the very beginning, so trying to resell the meaning seems silly. Nothing to say, people say, take drugs, visions ... they talk a little more. This is not as bad as pointless and boring. Stupidity is a sin here, and the reason why you want to avoid it.
