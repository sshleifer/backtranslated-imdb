I'm glad it was the last of the 40s films with Universal Mummy. All films were different from each other, and this film was definitely one of the smaller ones. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this is a very slow film in which nothing interesting or exciting happens. Perhaps everything would be better if mom entered the movie earlier. Instead, the film now spends its first 20 minutes again, explaining that everything happened in previous films about the mummy, also using archive footage from this time again of the 1932 Mummy, for which this film is the fourth mummyâ€™s movie after the 1932 mummy story. The film simply does not know how to find the right tempo, and although the film lasts just over an hour, it still feels like dragging. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film does not help has a rather simplified and in fact very little interesting story. The film also seems completely disconnected. The first and second half of the film are not really related to each other, and they looked like two separate films on their own. <br /> <br /> At least Lon Chaney Jr. is still in it. He reiterates the role of the mummy Haris, for the third time. It is a pity that this time he has such a limited screen time. Unfortunately, he has very little interesting, which is also a big waste of the character of the mother himself. In addition, the film is full of dozens of silly actors who play with silly accents. It seemed so unnecessary to me that most of the characters had to speak with such an accent, and this was really annoying and annoying in some moments. <br /> <br /> Films about mummies that would be least worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 4/10
