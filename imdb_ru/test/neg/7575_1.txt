I absolutely can not believe my fellow reviewers IMDb. All the praise of how “original” this film is, as if they had never seen “The Ring” or a million fakes that have appeared in 10 years since the appearance of this film. And some of them claim to be horror movie lovers! I think no! The shutter is fine. Average, I would say. I give it 5 out of 10, but there is simply nothing original, gorgeous and “the scariest thing I've ever seen,” as one reviewer said. Plump, people. This one is simple. It is predictable. <br /> <br /> I swear if I see another ghost movie where the hero traces the ghost's past to find out why she’s so evil, and after them I will scream. <br /> "Original"? Give me a break. You people should get out more. Or at least stop calling yourself “horror movie fans.”
