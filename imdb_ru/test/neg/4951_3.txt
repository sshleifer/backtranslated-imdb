After watching the short film "Still Life" directed by John Knauz, I was genuinely pleased with his debut in the feature film "Jack Brooks: Killer Monsters". Still Life perfectly captured the essence and feeling of the Twilight Zone episode, and I was impatient to see what Knauz could do by taking the horror comedy genre. The whimsical character of the name and promotional materials suggested something like the “Evil Dead” or “Army of Darkness”; funny, horrible 80s style horror movie with lots of monsters. Although this was what Knoutz wanted, he was completely unable to capture any of the fun or entertainment value that these films had. <br /> <br /> The problem with “Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer” is that he absolutely lacks understanding of what these horror comedies it is trying to cause is so great in the first place. Two thirds of the time is mainly devoted to the film’s hero, Jack Brooks, a plumber and a college student when he goes to class and tries to cope with his uncontrollable outbursts of anger. In the most part of the film, not a single monster is visible, not even a drop of blood or the slightest attempt at anything connected with horror. Even if the "Evil Dead" or "Dead Living" had been cut out with subsequent quantities of blood, they would still be interesting. "Jack Brooks" no. It's just boring, which is the worst thing that can be a movie of this kind. Jack Brooks himself is not that interesting, at least not enough to guarantee the amount of time he spends. Everything you need to know about him is revealed in films in the first ten minutes, and from this point on, when he doesn’t beat out the monster’s flesh (and he rarely does), he shouldn’t look. The film goes nowhere, following him in psychiatric sessions and fights with classmates. <br /> <br /> In the end, things are good. Jack Brooks fights several monsters, some heads are broken, several people are killed, and then it's over. Just. All for fifteen minutes. This is a good fifteen minutes. All the monsters are quite creative (made entirely in the chamber), and there are some great onlookers (best of all being a broken zombie head), but after they sit after seventy-five minutes of pure fatigue, fifteen minutes are simply not going to stop it. <br /> <br /> This is really all you need to do. I could talk about an acting game that is pretty well done (especially about Robert Englund’s horror in a non-traditional role) and how creature prosthetics is a good return to those times when movies did not use CGI, but in fact it isn’t. irrelevant. "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer" is extremely boring, and although John Knauts obviously has the talent to create a good film (again, the last fifteen minutes are suicidal, but Still Life was awesome - check it out), "Jack Ruchi" does not fall to the goal. He has his own successes (acting, make-up), but it doesn’t change the fact that it’s not interesting at all. The show, which I caught it, had a director and threw in attendance. One information I picked up, was that the sequel was in development and that this time it would be proc eed to focus on the fight against the monsters, and not on "the creation of a Hero" My advice. skip this and wait for the continuation.
