This should be the greatest practical joke in history. I am amazed that all the other actors were holding straight. I may be mistaken, but I got the impression that because of this film, Frank Stallone and Joe Estevez forced themselves to play in this film with a budget of just under $ 40, depending on how much these non-painting bats and equipment are worth . the most disjointed film ever made, and sit back and laugh at the fact that Joe Estevez and Frank Stallone were not in jest. <br /> <br /> If for some reason they were not joking and legally trying to make a real film, then I feel sorry for everyone who participated in the creation. I had a real love story with stupid movies, but this film is so bad that I can hardly watch it. They repeat meaningless "special effects" so many times that it is obvious that they just tried to hide the fact that they were shooting just 30 minutes. If I was forced to watch this movie with a repetition, I would have killed myself unconscious with my own hands about one and a half times. Do not be offended by the great Frank Stallone, but I would prefer that Sylvester hold a finger drawing lesson for 10 hours than watch this movie ever again.
