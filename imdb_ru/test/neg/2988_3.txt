Silly and cruel thriller, which is the robbery of "Liberation", but without charm and intelligence. The plot is ridiculous, and the actors seem to be tired and want to get rid of this disgusting record. This film is a good example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea. It is a shame to see good actors, such as Thomson and James, who make their living in such a mess.
