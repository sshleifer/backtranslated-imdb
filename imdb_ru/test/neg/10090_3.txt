Imagine every stereotypical, excessive cliché from every film and television show on the streets of Brooklyn between 1930 and 1980. Fill it with a set of interchangeable caricatures instead of real characters. Add a mix of “period” music and electric guitar screams during thundering scenes. Then take your time trying to figure out (or take care of) which of the two will be killed in the final (anti) climatic rumble. <br /> <br /> I’ll give this film points for not just a romantic comedy, teen slasher, explosive fighter, teen sex comedy, children's musical or an Oscar-nominated car But to bring something new or interesting to the genre of the tragedy of a street gang, perhaps, it would be nice.
