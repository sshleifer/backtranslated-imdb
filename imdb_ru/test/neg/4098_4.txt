Although I like the work of Steve Carrell, Evan Almighty, like many other experienced films, turned out to be much worse than I hoped. <br /> <br /> This turned out to be a fun family movie, Kind, who hires a famous comedian to improve his image, but ultimately fails. <br /> <br /> The usual blunt humor of Carella is almost absent from the film, and although he made me laugh several times, nothing funny about him in Evan Almighty. <br /> <br /> His three children, although they might have had some meaning for the biblical character, were really completely useless in the film and terrible actors. Even his wife was something like the third step for such a simple storyline. <br /> <br /> Spending so much money on a comedy was a huge mistake. Although Carelâ€™s career may benefit this film, there is no particular reason to watch it. <br /> <br /> If only his family were a little smaller, Carell, Molly Shannon, and perhaps someone else in the roles of the SNL, this could have been much more interesting. <br /> <br /> 4/10 for a few laughs here and there.
