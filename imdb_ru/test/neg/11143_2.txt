He was quite fond of Flesh and was looking forward to Heat, but could not help but feel that Morrissey had rudely exploited most of the "artists" represented here. It seems that stumbling naked in a narcotic stupor is all that Dallesandro was capable of in this function - a tremendous and heartbreaking contrast to Flesh. His semi-montage in several scenes is the only sign that he can act; basically it looks like what he did to buy drugs. Woodlawn is a revelation, everything is in order - she is the embodiment of the Lower East Side. But her show is one woman — she rarely attracts other performers, although, I must say, her sex scene with a bottle of beer definitely leaves Halle Berry in the shadow when it comes to the cinematic manifestations of brute passion. When she attacks a young, potential lover, it happens with the ferocity of a vampire. Two performers, Andrea and Jane, have such annoying voices that you have to turn off the sound to get through their scenes. The fact that some of these performers committed suicide or were killed after a few years only adds to the atmosphere of exploitation. But they still desperately tried to get in front of Morrissey’s camera. There is probably no worse way to spend a Saturday night, but at the very least, it animates a specific time and place.
