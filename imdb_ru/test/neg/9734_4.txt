Oh, man. Such films really bother me. If this film is supposed to be close to the truth, then I suppose that Rommel knew Hitler before the start of World War II. In the film, Rommel mentions how Hitler has changed from the past. Well, I can not imagine that Rommel would not know something about Hitler’s policies, so Rommel had to bear some blame for the atrocities of Germany. With this in mind, I have a problem with the film that makes Rommel’s life at the end tragic. He made his choice, and we should feel bad for him? I can not do it. I also cannot buy the theory that if the more competent generals were allowed to wage a war, the allies would have more problems with its victory. If more competent people were responsible, World War II might never have begun. From the point of view of watching a movie, the movie jumps from place to place, and most of the time seems to be a special story in which famous actors play historical roles. Leo J. Carroll has some good scenes with James Mason, and I liked the fact that everyone spoke English without ridiculous accents. But besides this is not very important.
