Well, what can be said about the horror comedy, in which there is neither horror nor comedy? There are no characters in the film, but too many plot lines - all are underdeveloped and mostly superfluous. <br /> <br /> Computer-created creatures look bad, a bit like Disney versions of oversized rats without a tail. "The Walking Dead" - the biggest plagiarism, except for the name, they will be like the dead in the film Landis, but far removed. They just look like bad actors with the addition of plastic and bovine blood. <br /> <br /> Two storylines were indeed promised (a love story and a “company” story), but they failed just like the director, the writers, the SFX department, the producers and the actors.
