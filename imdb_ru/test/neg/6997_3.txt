With such a promising cast and director, about which I heard a lot, I was extremely disappointed with this film. It all started with the traces of a great epic story about gangsters and turned into a completely tangled mess with a lot of unanswered questions and some absolutely ridiculous and meaningless scenes (and yes, I did watch the full version). I love Robert DeNiro, and, as usual, he did an excellent acting game, but in all his other gangster films, no matter how many people he kills, I always respected his character, but in this film he was a drug addict a low standard of living A rapist, not caring for anyone but himself. In addition, James Woods, another great actor, wrote several completely ridiculous scenes for him. I thought that the parts where Robert De Niro called him crazy and he lost consciousness completely left the left field, and at the end the writers simply add this random comment about how his father died in an insane asylum, and that is why James Woods did that. as if they call you crazy. In this film, so much remains undeveloped. In addition, we will never know who these people are in the beginning, who are trying to kill Noodles, and we will never know more about Joe Peski's character. It seems that the authors have collected about five different stories and never fully explained any of them. The only redemptive quality of the film was the story when the characters were small children. In this part of the film, the story went smoothly and the children did a great job. Overall, I was completely disappointed with this film, and I donâ€™t see how someone could even compare it with the Godfather 1 and 2, or even with Goodfell. I am sad that I wasted four hours of my life watching this movie
