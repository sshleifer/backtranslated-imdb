I agree with all the comments published so far: this film was a waste of time and energy, both for the audience and for those who made it. Awful CGI, horrible script, wacky conspiracy and hey, Alabama setting, but it looks like California. But the worst thing is the Native American’s view of this, which pulls along any stereotype that you can imagine, from a leader surrounded by smoke, an angry warrior, people who say no cuts (“Don't do it!”), American Indian pipes , playing in the air, etc. It just shows such a lack of respect and understanding that I was tearing my hair out. A Native American with dignity would throw his TV out the window on this garbage. In conclusion, I would say that this film pretty much insults everyone.
