I'm a big fan of really bad movies. And I especially like alien / science fiction films. I say that the cheaper, the more pleasant and the better, the better. The low budget and hockey idea are funny enough for most bad B-films, but this film is so bad that I was really embarrassed by the people who made the film, and from the crazy ad-lib actors. Firstly, there is no real plot, this is any situation a "comedy" (if you can call it that). “Comedy” in this film is more about characters who, in fact, say: “Look at me, I'm in this crazy situation! Isn't that funny? ”But this is only a pity, because nothing does anything funny. There is neither comedy acting, nor any strange plot to transfer all the very unimaginable scenarios through this dreary turd. <br /> <br /> Bad comedy and the absence of something remotely comic is only aggravated by poor advertising acting skills, actors repeating really stupid things over and over again (perhaps trying to catch phrases latently, perhaps just because so bad), really unattractive women, who act like hot chicks, and people who grumble and swoon Bathrooms. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, there was one middle-aged actor who, as I can tell, had several acting roles, and he was pretty convincing in his role. He was just as irrelevant as a solid BM in a weekend detox bathroom. Cory Feldman was filmed for a total of about 3 minutes (fortunately, we didn’t have to put up with him anymore), and he was filmed outside the site — probably near his apartment when they were leaving. He said a few really not funny things about aliens and sex with aliens, and that was the extent of his appearance. <br /> <br /> If you value your life and 90 minutes (and years of memory pain) you lose by watching this trash, avoid it. If you use a lot of drugs, such as the comedy styles of Adam Sandler (and therefore do not have any standards), and are considered to be mentally slow, you might like this movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. I think that people who raved about this should work for Trom or something like that, because I can't believe that people can suck so much to really enjoy this movie. (Do drugs really ruin your mind so much?)
