Well, if I were at the box office, and someone asked me if the movie was worth three dollars for a rental, I would say no. The plot was implausible. I concluded that Keanu Reeves could not act. Sometimes it can be painful for him to watch (although my wife thinks he is cute). Dan Aykroyd (who is usually great) was even a little disappointing as a jaded policeman. On the other hand, the plot (because it is contrived) is unpredictable. Cameron Diaz was good.
