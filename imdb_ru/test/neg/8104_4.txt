This movie is really sorry for making a movie. The pace is low, the budget must be depressingly low, and actions are curtailed (that is, with the exception of Bela Lugosi). The sound at that moment is also terrible, with so much extra noise in the background that it seemed to me that the plane took off for the whole movie. If this doesn't suit you at all, don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you cope with this, you will understand that the idea of ​​the film is very good. A German plastic surgeon (Bela Lugosi) was hired by the Japanese to operate several Japanese agents and transform them into similarities to prominent American businessmen whom the Japanese kidnapped and killed. After completing his work, he was betrayed by the Japanese and thrown into prison. He later escapes and travels to America to take revenge on his patients as a result of a series of widely reported murders. <br /> <br /> It seemed that Bela Lugosi was the only worthy actor in the film, and, frankly, the rest of the actors were completely forgotten and boring. The lead actress was rather dull and stereotypical, while the police officer assigned to her case was a regular, chauvinistic and always correct dominant man who appears in many films of this time period. <br /> <br /> I also found that working with the camera was completely inspirational, often taking the same angles in the same rooms again and again. After some time, this leads to the fact that the film stretches down, setting a very slow pace for “action”, which in any case is more or less absent. <br /> <br /> For me, the idea is fascinating, and with the best writer, director, screenwriter, equipment and actors, it could be a great movie. Unfortunately, these obstacles still hold the film in captivity, and I can not recommend it to anyone except the most open-minded movie lovers.
