It was on TV last night. I painfully made my way through this and barely made it. First of all, with the exception of Leroy, Hilary and, possibly, Koko, none of the other students we need to take care of have any talent. As if HSPA has no standards, just sign the dotted line and you are inside. <br /> <br /> Subject lines were annoying and obvious. Doris was just incredibly awful. The gay guy was such a discarded clich√© (funny that there was only one gay guy in this school, right ...) I liked Leroy's character, but to call your teacher obscene behavior and then insult the school should have sent Leroy. It seems that Lisa would prefer to be somewhere else, and since she had no talent, I wonder why they left her. <br /> <br /> I would appreciate this one star (terrible), but the music was not so bad, and I liked the premise. It would be much better if the students were attractive and really had some talent.
