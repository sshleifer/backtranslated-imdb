“Marathon” has a very interesting background, excellent background sounds and good scenery. Unfortunately, the film, in addition to these aspects, does not make sense. For a woman trying to complete so many crosswords in a day, she spends a lot of time standing around, pouting and not doing puzzles. I believe that the film walks more than her work on these puzzles. Also, although I understand the meaning of showing so much landscape, FAR is just too much. The film is incredibly boring and not focused. Do not buy, rent, watch on TV or watch in any imaginable way. I lost interest so quickly that I'm not sure why I watched the whole movie at all.
