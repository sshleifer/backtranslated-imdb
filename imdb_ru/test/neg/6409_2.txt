What the hell was that? I admit that there were some scenes that caught my attention, such as bullshit 23, where the main character sees or calculates the number 23 wherever he goes, but it was pretty much a movie in two words ?! In order to shout loudly, it had to be a surprise film, and I would be called a psychological thriller. I expected it to have at least some catastrophic effect on the mind, but instead, what did we get? We just got something as shitty as the animal control guy who ended up in the middle of a midlife crisis and his way to redemption. Kind of like an old man, if you ask me. I probably should have just rented Wild Hogs, it wouldn't matter. I mean, whom we joke, they should have made someone else the killer of this girl. Comparing Sparrow with the main character of this book, “Number 23,” they pretty much handed out a movie to the audience, hinting that he was the killer all the time. How would this shock our heads? Shame on all of you, the voters, who have decided to show some generosity towards this pathetic work that you call the film, and thank to most of the critics who agreed with my reaction.
