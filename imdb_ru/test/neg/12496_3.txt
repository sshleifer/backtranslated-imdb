Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret service agent who prevents the senator from being killed, but he finds a conspiracy along the way and keeps a trace on his tail. The tracker, by the way, is prone to complete Phillips. The most obvious source of inspiration for this low-budget Chessball action movie is, of course, Robocop, and although this film had a little imagination and real energy, it just has real kickboxing running away from the robot. The film is not so terrible, it is just empty and repetitive. The story is written in a clich√©, and the characters are set to be destroyed by various shots. Don Wilson, as usual, is terrible in the title role. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4- (Bad)
