Indeed? It's necessary? How can someone make such a film? Disgusting !!! Seteven Seagal with funny hair and as thick as an elephant. Tricks all the time, persecuted cars with annoying soundtrack. Not to mention the finale. Totally pointless with the presence of a little girl. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal wants to be Robin Hood !!! Well, at first the fortune teller answers something, nobody asked. Segal's wife has nightmares, and she can see the future. They must be joking. Steven Seagal passed out after a car chase and I know that he cannot act. It was terrible. Nothing can save this film. <br /> <br /> I lost 90 minutes of my life! See you later
