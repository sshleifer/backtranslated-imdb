This film describes a truly terrible event to be sure. But it all depends on the poor performance of all the actors. It is impossible to feel the emotions of almost any character, since all the emotional scenes seem to be parodies of themselves. For example, at the beginning of the movie they shoot a character, and you get a desperate cliché: “Will I do this, sergeant?” more "War Movie") or starring something with Leslie Nielsen. <br /> <br /> The sergeant played by Sean Penn reminds me of Al Bundy from Married with Children, while Fox is the greatest self-deprecating cliche of a good guy you can imagine ... Thank God he curses and smokes during this. <br /> <br /> His emotional "NOOOO !!!" definitely more suitable for comedies, such as Back To The Future, than for so-called serious films, such as this one. <br /> <br /> To their credit, some of the "main" scenes ... (without giving away too much where they actually perform rather terrible actions) ... well done and make us take the topic seriously. But this is despite the fact that it is not due to the action.
