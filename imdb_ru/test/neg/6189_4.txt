The atmosphere and funny dialogue do not redeem this overvalued classic. Boyer is a French thief hiding in the Algerian Cashier while the police are trying to figure out how to get him out. In the meantime, he falls in love with Lamarra and tries to find a way to escape. The film begins slowly and never goes anywhere. It resembles Casablanca in a sense; it completely lacks a larger theme than a wanted man seducing a good woman. This is all talk, talk, endless scenes in which Boyer amuses himself among his idiotic cohorts, and Boyer looks after Lamarr in the shade. Personally, I did not for a minute care about the character of Boyer, so the tension was completely non-existent. <br /> <br /> The characters' actors of the 1930s stumbled upon a crazy plot in the role of Boyer's minions - guys who clearly do not belong to Algeria. Sigrid Guri is a jealous jealous girl Boyer. His brazen adoration in front of her does not bode well for the future, which he may have with Lamarr. <br /> <br /> The long sequence in which the subordinate tells Boyer how another henchman was captured is especially bad. It sounds exciting ... It is a pity that we did not see it ourselves. The finale is completely anticlimatic and seems wonderful only because it is not a Hollywood happy ending; it does not prevent him from being fed.
