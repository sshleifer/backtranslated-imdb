This film was highly recommended by a friend, and, being a big fan of Brando, I ordered this film from Harrods and was looking forward to his arrival. I have rarely been so disappointed with the film. Brando was good as a German officer, but the rest of the film was unbearable. You never love and do not care about any characters (perhaps, except for Brando). The game was fine. A story, what a story? Maybe that's the point. In the end, this is war, but I have seen much better films about war. (Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, even Star Wars) I was so bored that I checked my watch all the time ... <br /> <br /> In general, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. . Please do not waste your time and money on this. Let me also add that this is the first user comment I wrote, I just had to tell my feelings about this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, all my favorite films: Casablanca, The Godfather 1 & 2, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Pulp Fiction and Amadeus. If you have not seen them, please take some time to do this. And Amadeus MUST be in 2.35: 1 widescreen format.
