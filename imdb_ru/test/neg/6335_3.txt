Another film about cookies, about a seasoned adult, who meets a charming, street intelligent child (Policeman, 1/2, Gloria, etc.). And once again, it is not funny and not interesting, to look to anyone - children or adults. I'm sure some people may find this movie funny, but I have no idea why. Once again, I feel sorry for poor children who were forced to work in this film so that everyone else and their parents could earn a few dollars at the price of a trashy crappy film.
