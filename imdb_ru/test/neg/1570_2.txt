Let me start with how I love the show. The nature of class war has always been ridiculous, but this series uses it better than most. The chemistry between Yuta Joyce and Brian Murphy has always been electrified, and the writers each time wrote almost completely flawless episodes. In my opinion, this is the best British sitcom of the mid-to late 1970s, superior to RISING DAMP, ROBIN'S NEST, do you serve? and so on. After ON THE BUSES ended several years earlier, GEORGE AND MILDRED became the next pride and joy of ITV (or ITV 1, as it is now called) enjoying a four-year show on the channel. <br /> <br /> The film, however, is absolutely terrible in almost all respects. The authors of this terrible film almost completely removed the essence of the television series (who immediately notice, not those who worked on the series). As one commenter pointed out, Mildred lacks the sharpness that she had on the show, and does not seem as powerful as anywhere else. <br /> <br /> The plot instead of focusing on the class war with the Furmili. this was the very basis of the television series, actually writing Fourmiles almost completely after the first half hour. The plot, if you can call it that, is that George and Mildred go on vacation to some hotel and mix with the gangsters. Top-notch talents in the form of Stratford Jones, Kenneth Cope, David Barry and Sue Bond are all in vain. Most of them have flourished long ago, and they all look very embarrassed, as if they know very well that the only thing worth hanging out for is a salary (which probably will not be big). <br /> <br /> Jokes and jokes in the film (if you can call them that) largely depend on the traditional British farce, including mistaken personalities, embarrassing situations, untimely farce, characters losing control over what is happening to them, and confusion. And all this fails miserably. As noted by another commentator, it appears that the authors of this film have never seen an episode from the series, but instead created something that resembles a noisy game. The scene in which George is stripped because of the character of Sue Bond, especially out of context. <br /> <br /> The mystery of this film is to provide a BBFC certificate - 15. Why did he get 15 points when all he could see? is it harmless, not vulgar entertainment? <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that the sitcom era ended shortly before the release of this film (shortly after the sad death of Yuty Joyce). And the company behind this film, Hummer, well known for producing first-class horror films from the 1950s to the mid-1970s, soon disappeared into complete obscurity. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is almost completely washed away. My advice is to skip this and stick to the series. You do not miss anything, I assure you.
