This is one of the few films that may be the only one that has really pursued me for years. It was the first time when I saw people who were tortured so hard that blood was flowing from the mouth, gritting his teeth, shouting, etc. This was cruel; the worst thing I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Dr. Clement Molloch, played by Joseph Meyer, still remains one of the most evil characters I've ever seen in a movie, and I watched thousands. He was so sadistic that I would never watch this movie again and would not recommend it. He makes Hannibal Lecter look like Mr. Rogers. If you look at the people who were tortured - this is not your idea of ​​fun, stay away from this movie. <br /> <br /> I know that there are many sick people there, many of whom are professional film critics who probably liked this disgusting sick story. In any case, this is the film “B”, with a silly dialogue and some kind of wooden game of Charles Bronson. This is not one of his best efforts. Even if it were so, there are so many horrible scenes that you would not want to watch. Believe me of it.
