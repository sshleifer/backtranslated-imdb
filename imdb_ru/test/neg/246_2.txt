2/3 of this film is recycled footage of previous films, and this fact, unfortunately, is obvious even for a person like me who has not seen the original films. And for some reason it looks like plagiarism, although I have never seen anything like this before. It's like that episode of each TV show where the characters sit around a photo album or something else, and you just see the recycled footage of the other episodes. I have seen some manufacturers extend the installation of recycled material, but not more than 5 minutes or so. This film is mostly material that the audience has already seen, so that you could prove that it is one of the largest robberies ever imposed on the public. <br /> <br /> I had to see him in the Theater, printed in 16 mm font, which is good enough, I suppose, considering how rare this material should be on the film these days. and for unintended humor, but that's all. The Aztec monster mummy looks good, even has some mobility on the face, which is better than most movie monsters of the time. But the robot is pathetic, although it is interesting that they made the human face completely visible. This is a “human-robot” or something like that, as they explain in the film. I think this is considered Android. Technically, from a technical point of view, this film should be called “Android vs. Aztec Mummy ”, but I doubt that someone here was too worried about the technical details than about the quality. In fact, the film is so carelessly complex that it makes television look good. Even rewriting from Mexican to English is lazy and weak — for example, at some point the hero says: “I could also start from the very beginning ...”. What the hell is the translation? Couldn't they, at least, force him to say “start from the very beginning” so that it does not re-sound? The editor of the high school newspaper could have fixed the script for this movie. This is the embodiment of utilitarian filmmaking, just in this film there is absolutely nothing that would not be necessary for the main commercial purpose of the film. They made no more effort to do this than they should have, and, given the extensive reworked videotape, I doubt that they actually spent more than a week making this film. <br /> <br /> Now I’ll stop publishing information about this principle, according to which I don’t want to spend more energy on the commenting process than the filmmakers actually spent.
