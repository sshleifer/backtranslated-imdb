It only gets hit, because it stars David Hasselhoff. Well, then let me. Compared to the rubbish that today is terrified, this film is not so bad. There's a beautiful Leslie Cumming. She is very hot, but does not speak very well. A wonderful scene happens to her when she is supernaturally raped. She shows her beautiful body. Linda Blair does nothing here, as does Hasselhoff. 3/10
