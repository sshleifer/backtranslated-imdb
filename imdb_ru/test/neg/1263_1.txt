I wanted this film to be liked, but there is very little in it. It starts with Jean Stapleton and Randy Newman's songs in Iowa (I think, in northwestern Iowa), reminiscent of Norman Lear's “Cold Turkey”, which was one of the best films ever made, according to people on IMDb. So far, so good. And the idea of ​​the Archangel Michael, living in a motel Pansy Milbank on earth? Well, give him a chance, it must be a comedy. Ok, so far so good. But Michael does things that an angel will never do without falling, and this completely undermines the credibility of the film. Other characters in the film are also not very attractive. Michael returns the dog to life, and we should be delighted with it. People compose banal country songs. After all, Stapleton is dancing with Travolta. Big deal If she were smart, she wouldn't even have been in this film. When it was over, I thought, “Gee, what a stupid, tasteless, boring, banal, blasphemous film!” This is not suitable for being noticed by children or anyone else.
