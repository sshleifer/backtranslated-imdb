After spending six years writing and producing, Luc Besson returns to the directorâ€™s chair with Angel-A. I'm a big fan of Leon, and I really liked the perspective of a black and white French film from the same chapter. <br /> <br /> Andre is a liar addict who played gambling, thanks to which almost every usurer has money in Paris. Unable to pay off his debts and fed up with the detention over the edge of the Eiffel Tower, he decides to commit suicide. He does this at the same time with the mysterious woman who decides to save. Determined to thank him, she begins to help him organize his own life. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a few laughs that go well together. The visual effects are pretty good and blend well with the sights of Paris. But it is so. That's all the movie needs. And these two aspects cannot stop the flow of horrendous filming. Although I cannot blame the main character much (although his inconsistencies are close), the eponymous one is terrible. The terrible presence of the screen and bitterly annoying. The plot itself is absurdly contradictory, and sometimes strangely stupid, especially the end; an ending that completely blooded the fledgling redemption generated by the scenes just before that. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene for which I saw the shame is stupid, condescending, melodramatic, and far too terrible to be "so bad, it's funny." The general premise of the film may have once had potential, but it was brutally destroyed by the infinitely terrible realization of his ideas. The film was really a task to watch, and one that made me scream at the screen all the time. <br /> <br /> A massive and immeasurable flaw, Angel-A is just awful. Although his occasionally amusing dialogue manages to pull out quarrels at rare intervals, by the end it becomes clear that this film is nothing more than disgusting.
