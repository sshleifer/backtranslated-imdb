The well-thought-out setting of the 1930s is of great interest to the viewer at the beginning of the 21st century; Unfortunately, “London Belongs To Me” can recommend little, except for a strange English charm. All problems are connected with deeply focused history. The main plot concerns the actions of a young boy Richard Attenborough, the problems he faces, and how the community in which he lives is united to save him from the laws of society. Or something. The main problem here is that the Attenborough character brings on itself everything and, frankly, is guilty of almost every accusation made against him, so it confuses why the film (and all the characters) feel so much sympathy for him. He is treated as a victim of circumstances, when he is really, really not; and, moreover, he is not shown that he repented strongly of his actions, taking care only of leaving the affairs that he did not want to do. Alastair Sim gets a lot of screen time in the plot, which has absolutely no relation to the main storyline, and you wonder what he is doing there (although Sim, as always, is great). You know that there is a problem with the structure, when the main plot constantly influences the plot, and not vice versa. And, following a balanced pace and careful build-up, in the last 20 minutes the plot completely collapses with an extremely unsatisfactory and inexplicable conclusion that does not even show us whether the character Attenborough has developed from previous hearings. The film does not end, it just stops. <br /> <br /> The action, direction and general feeling of the film - all this can be praised, but, unfortunately, the story and the structure of the play are constantly heard. The last point of trivia: Alec Guinness based his performance on the extraordinarily excellent film “Ledkillers” performed by Alastair Sim in this film, down to both characters, having almost identical first scenes.
