Rabbit Fever is one of the film’s weirdness. This is a pleasant 90 minutes, requiring little from the viewer and delivering the same amount, and on any terrestrial television channel, even in a prime time slot, I think Rabbit Fever would be fairly well received. It makes me wonder why it was filmed in cinemas. <br /> <br /> The film is made in the style of a television documentary and introduces us to 6 women who have an exciting relationship with the Rabbit Vibrator. The film focuses on investigating the alleged addictive quality of a well-known sexual health product. The story is one hundred percent. <br /> <br /> The storyline is strong, familiarity with some well rounded and pleasant characters, some pleasant stories, minor characters and situations turn into a fascinating story, and pleasant conclusions. Unfortunately, there is nothing that seems smart or new. <br /> <br /> Rabbit fever has some poignant moments, a few switches that hint at what writers are capable of, and all this is attributed to them not just 90-minute jokes and insinuations, I could probably watch it my mom. But there is laziness in some scenes that hold it back, those moments are gone, you are ready for this, when you want it to be outrageous, and all you get is a portion of sit-com. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I left the theater, feeling sympathy for the heroes, but I also left with a bitter thought that someone had taken a 90-minute video made for television, light entertainment, and tried to put it in national cinema. <br /> <br /> I think “Rabbit Fever” achieves some of what she intended to do, this is a quirky plot, a rounded storyline, a well-presented cast and good entertainment for 90 minutes. But there is nothing in it that could justify the extravagance of the cinema. Rather, on the contrary - a few advertising breaks would give the viewer a chance to breathe life, which seems to be not enough Fever rabbits.
