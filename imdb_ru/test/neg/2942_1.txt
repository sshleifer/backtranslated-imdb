The Twins Effect is the worst movie I've ever seen! Weakness is not only support, but also characters. I'm sorry to say to you, Edison fans, but Kazaf is by far the weakest vampire I've seen in my life. Sorry, Edison; Your role in this film was disappointing. Edison does not fight at all in this film, and I’m sure that if there was no Kazaf in the film, the plot wouldn’t have changed much. The main plot of the film is not sufficiently explained, and the entire film is too focused on the growing relationship of Helen and Kazaf. I mean, who the hell was Kazaf and why do they need his blood? Yes, he is a prince, right? So what! <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes in this movie were just silly. Yes, the action was great, but all its outlines were stupid. In one of the scenes near the end, Duke Decotes says that Kazaf is the strongest of his brothers ... yes, it seems, now that he has grown up. Why do you have to wait until he attacks? Another scene was with Jackie Chan, one of my favorites. On stage, Jackie asked Helen who were the creatures who were constantly following them. How can you be so naive not to know that they are vampires? People die around them with bite marks on their necks; Of course, the news will be on it faster than you can say "vampire." <br /> <br /> Characters were another mistake in the film. Helen, played by Charlene Choi, is Kazaf's girlfriend. What girl will not be afraid of vampires, especially if it’s your brother’s task to kill them? I bet you wouldn’t find such a brave girl like Helen if you’ve been looking for your whole life. Helen is annoying, bitch, and is the full queen of drama in the film. She tries too hard to be different and, in the end, fails. One of the strangest and most disturbing characters I've ever seen in any movie. Why do you bite someone's neck, especially if you are not a vampire? It is very strange that her reaction to the recognition of Kazaf does not distract him. Kazaf, played by Edison Chen, is another stupid character in this story. It is humiliating for a young actor, like himself, to play in a film with such a poorly constructed role. He does not protect himself throughout the film and does not fight. Although I am a fan of Edison, I would not want a man lying on the ground all the time. Gypsy and Reeve are my favorite characters in the film. Their love is pure and sweet. The gypsy is gorgeous and doesn’t try too hard, like Elena. Reeve, played by Ekin Chen, is wise and seems the only person who makes sense in the film. The failure of the conspiracy was the death of Reeve. There was absolutely no point in the film, but he doomed himself by removing one of the only pleasant characters. Another character was the Duke of Decotes. This story was not too focused on him, and therefore his desire to get the "rock" of Kazaf seemed out of place. <br /> <br /> This is very sad, because by the end of the movie I forced myself to watch, because I so desperately wanted to see the fight of Kazaf. The end was so unexpected, because all the time I expected it to be so great. Kazaf, the supposed Vampire Prince, does nothing for the film, and I’m sure that if he were killed, the film wouldn’t have changed much. I highly recommend that you DO NOT waste your time on this film like mine. I was very disappointed. If you are looking for a great movie, why not watch “The Lord of the Rings” or “Pirates of the Caribbean”? Cute characters with a well-written plot.
