One could make you believe that this game is about a man possessed by a number. And of course, this is an interesting topic - can a person become so obsessed with something marginal, like a prime number, that he completely loses touch with reality and becomes hopelessly delusional and paranoid? <br /> <br /> Well, maybe someone will ever make a film about it. This, unfortunately, has nothing to do with the above, not to mention the fact that the trailers (or even the film itself) would like you to believe. I would like to say that this number is just MacGuffin, but this is not even the case. It's pointless. Trick. A hook for an unsuspecting audience. <br /> <br /> What is the film about? A dog catcher (Kerry) who becomes obsessed with a stupid book about noir crimes, because he feels that it somehow reflects his own life. There. Undoubtedly, the character in the book - Detective Fingerling (sigh) - (for some reason) is obsessed with number 23, and Kerry himself becomes obsessed and begins to see the number everywhere ... but this is just a digression and is completely irrelevant to the story. In fact, you can cut out all 23 links and make the main character (s) go crazy about cheese or something else, and you will have the exact same story. It is extremely obvious that all the “23” materials were written in full after the story was already finished, rejected and sent for “rewriting”. <br /> <br /> That would be fine .. I think ... if the film were not boring, boring, boring. Half of the film is narrated, for chrissakes. You are not watching a movie, you are listening to Jim Carrey tell a movie. About a quarter of Kerry begins to read the book, and since then, until the terrible cliche ends, we are forced to watch "real" scenes from the life of the dogman (where nothing happens) with a blotch of the narrated artistic book Noir. “Scenes that either leave you snickering or just get depressed. It's like the “City of Sins” for the poor, where all the violence is stopped, told by Kerry and shown in slow motion. Ugh. <br /> <br /> This is a simple case where the C-movie script is somehow filmed using the cast ... probably because of the “number 23” hook, which I think sounds intriguing enough on paper to guarantee the premium of Hollywood treatment. However, since, as I said, the film about the 23rd issue is as much as about the production of cheese in Switzerland, nothing is felt except for deception. <br /> <br /> I give the film "Fingerling - Film" 3 out of 10, because I think it did not offend my mind as much as the Forsaken, or made me completely suicidal, like "The Land of Battle" , and the bottom of the scale should be reserved for abominations like this. But don't worry, it's still a pretty lousy click.
