Talk about action ... !!!! not only Govinda, but also Salman and Lara ... The direction was terrible. In the first half hour you would very much like to turn off the film .. because this film is very unpleasant (remember my words. <br /> <br /> I liked Govinda in some of his comedy roles, such as Hasina Maan Jayee, Jodie No. 1, Ahillon Se Goli Maare and Jees Desch Mein Gang Reht Hai, and this is incomparable with anything. And Salman Khan should not act in comedy roles at all !! He sucks. He doesn't know how to make a comedy. The only good comedy role he played , was in Andaz Apna Apna, which was brilliant next to Amir Khan. <br /> <br /> In this film about as many "made too silly unhumorous" scenes that make you want to remove the DVD and burn it to anyone in your home have not watched it again.
