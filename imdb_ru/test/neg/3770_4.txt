The director doesn't know what to do with the camera ... there are too many options, and she always chooses the wrong one ... she allows Travolta to take responsibility ... and he controls the film from beginning to end .. ... characters are not developed ... maybe because we need to watch them sing ... there is no pace at all, sometimes too fast, sometimes too slow ... wrong: travolta OK ... Johansson, she is too adult to be 18 .. ... even if she really has a 20 ... <br /> <br /> happy ending? Well, it seems that he should be alone, so the story is sad, but not too sad ... Travolta does not know how to play the guitar, but the director does not look so that she is too important that he is completely out of sync ... <br /> <br /> An idea is the only thing that is great ... but how did it develop it? well, it's just full of stereotypes and lines heard too many times ... <br /> <br /> too bad, another missed chance ...
