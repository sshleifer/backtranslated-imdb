I did not have the opportunity to watch the previous film, but from what I read in other posts, it was supposedly worse than this one, although I doubt that this is possible. I’m a big fan of the Zombie genre, and I’m fascinated by the psychological aspects of viewing creatures that are human in all senses and purposes, like an atrocity that just shoots at the head. However, HOTD 2 brings the film "Zombies" to a completely new minimum. <br /> <br /> Not giving big spoilers (which I really have to do, just so you don’t waste your time watching this movie). I would like to express my complete contempt for the way the authors of this film portray the special forces of our countries. Homer Pyle might have survived longer than the Special Operations soldiers in this film. To shout loudly, they had to call them special education forces. If you are going to write a script in which you send an elite team to fight zombies, at least the soldiers must be smarter than walking corpses. I understand that you need to kill some or most of the crew, but you can find better ways to do this than get them to put their machine guns on and go to put a gentle hand on the shoulder of a slobbering madman leaning back and forth in the corner of a dark creepy basement. <br /> <br /> Writers are actually trying to raise the whole zombie to a more high-tech level, making it the virus for which they are looking for a vaccine, and the idea makes sense if it is not stuck in the midst of such a ridiculous show of wayward filmmaking. I mean, come on, movies about zombies are not really “high art”, and the viewer expects a little mocking fun along with blood and thrills, but HOTD 2 is the type of cheese that makes you turn the channel and thrill with obvious disgust characters. If you're a fan of zombie movies like me, do yourself a favor and stay away from it.
