When I watched Showtime, I got the impression that the producers had an idea to put Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy just to make a film in which they starred together. In addition, I can not think of a reason to justify the existence of the film. It’s not that it wasn’t funny in some places, it’s certainly so, but the concept is so ridiculous that laughter is somewhat muffled. <br /> <br /> What really struck me was Eddie Murphy's character. It seems I can’t think that someone from the police is just a day job. When I worked on the New York State Victims Victims Board, I had to deal with all kinds of police officers, and they made their way between truly loyal and some real slugs, but I can't remember who thought it was just something I was doing this, until I start my career in a remote area. I mean, do you really see how Eddie Murphy or someone else is going through the rigors of a real Police Academy, and not a screen version, just to get a day job? <br /> <br /> In any case, DeNiro is your main hardworking detective who is on the trail of a major arms dealer. He is under cover, and Murphy is part of his reinforcement. So what makes the show Murphy, he calls the show, based on reality, as COPS, to shoot the action. <br /> <br /> So, the bust of De Niro is blown up to the skies, but the producer of the series takes good shots of Murphy and De Niro and selects a new television series based on reality. Thus, these unwitting partners join in and try to continue the business of Deniro with all the cameras. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy is a funny guy, I loved him in the film “Beverly Hills” and in the films “Doctor Dolittle”, but he did better than Showtime, and Robert De Niro certainly did. <br /> <br /> I guess Murphy wanted a chance to work with DeNiro, and DeNiro must have earned one hefty salary to make this film.
