I accidentally stumbled upon this film online, and I was horrified by its content of scenes of violence and torture. it was a relief to learn that it was not real after reading the comments. which dangerous sick animals do something like that and for what purpose go beyond the boundaries of faith. I was even more shocked to see people evaluating the film in the comments section of this site. This is really a very disturbing film that can change your life forever. the people behind this should be bought out as soon as possible. today they showed a girl who was raped and butchered on the screen, tomorrow it could be a child. even if it is fake or not, it is very, very deadly anxious, sickening.
