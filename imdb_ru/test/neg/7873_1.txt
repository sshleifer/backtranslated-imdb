One of the worst movies I've ever seen. When I tried to watch it, I had the flu, and I was pretty open to any brainless entertainment. Unfortunately it was too much. How are so many absolutely incompetent actors in one movie? This movie makes porn look like European art cinema. Cast simply speaks his lines with no emotion; Special thanks to Charlie Snow (Baldwin), who will soon become an ex-wife who talks about her divorce, as we all do, talking about the weather. Just awful (and funny). <br /> <br /> With a lot of booze and friends, it can be just background entertainment and a bit of laughter, like in Ed Wood films. The plot is a joke and soundtrack straight from some sassy soap opera. <br /> <br /> I hope no one paid for watching this movie. <br /> <br />
