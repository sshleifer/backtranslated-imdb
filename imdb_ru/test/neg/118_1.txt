Honestly, a terrible movie, poor editing, terrible coverage, terrible dialogue and a poor script. <br /> <br /> The lighting is so bad that there are moments that you donâ€™t even see what is happening, I even tried to play with contrast and brightness so that I could see something, but it did not help. <br /> <br /> They must have found the script in the trash can, character development is just as awful, and although you can hardly expect much from Jean-Claude. The film is Van Damme, who manages to hit all the time low. You can't even laugh at stupidity. <br /> <br /> Directing and editing are also terrible, the whole movie follows an extremely weary routine and fails at every turn when it passes through a plot that is so weak, it is simply unrealistic. <br /> <br /> There is nothing more to say, except that it is really bad, and nothing like the earlier work of Jean-Claude Van Damme that you could enjoy. <br /> <br /> Avoid as a memorial plaque, frankly, unable to condemn this "film".
