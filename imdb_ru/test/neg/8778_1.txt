There are so many bad things in this movie that it’s hard to pick just a few. Let's start with stupid and annoying songs. For example, “Journey, little cowboy,” which only emphasized the city image of Clinton Spilsbury. The stupid songs of cowboy kids that sound in the background during the movie undermine any authority or impulse that the story tells about it. <br /> <br /> I saw a stir in the media before the release of this film, and I saw Clinton Spilsbury gave interviews on various television shows, and he had a very soft, sweet, sharp voice. His body language was not exactly what the people who were fans of Clayton Moore and the Lone Ranger TV series remembered. Spilsbury did not help, acting like a diva and talking about Clayton Moore, after the producers received an injunction prohibiting Moore from appearing at conventions and other events as the original Lone Ranger. Clayton Moore was not even allowed to sign up as "Clayton Moore, the Lone Ranger." He could only sign up as a “Masked Man”. The incredible amount of negative publicity this move gave the film was only added to Spilsbury’s irritable attitude, which very quickly told reporters that Clayton Moore would be quickly forgotten as soon as the film was released! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even after the film’s total failure, the company that owned the Lone Ranger refused to cancel the injunction against Clayton Moore, and he was never allowed to sign anything other than “The Masked Man” ". "and he could not put his black mask on any public appearances. Between the Spilsbury personality and the negative advertising of the film, he certainly did not help to make a good impression on the public. Worse, several weeks before the film was finally released, the news that Spilsbury’s voice in the film was excessively dubbed by James Kitch, because the producers thought that Spilsbury didn’t sound very convincingly like a cowboy. The last nail in the coffin. <br /> <br /> But then Merle Haggard appeared, telling about his film. Merle Haggard's narration was another annoyance that viewers had to face. Sometimes Haggard rhymes with his narration, and it sounds like some kind of weird children's film. could gather s, was destroyed by Haggard and soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Tonto was played by Michael Horse, and, as others have noted, the Horse had a lot more personality than Spilsbury. In fact, perhaps because of Spilsbury’s supposedly fighting relationship during filming, it seems that the Horses gave much more dialogue and time to the screen than anyone could have expected from Tonto. Tonto takes responsibility and is often the leader instead of the Lone Ranger. I was expecting (or hoping) that Billie Jack would be acting as Brother Tonto (that would make the movie much better). The horse is not only more interesting than Spilsbury, but he says more and has better scenes. Perhaps this was the case when the Horse stole the show from Spilsbury. However, since the film was so pathetic, the Horse did not receive much recognition. Unlike Spilsbury, the Horse had a very productive career in the film industry. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the last minus of this film is the Powder Blue outfit in the Lone Ranger. The material that was chosen for Spilsbury was more powder blue in color than what Clayton Moore usually wore during the shows. That choice of color for clothes only made Spilsbury look more feminine in his role. The comic book version showed that the Lone Ranger is also wearing a red shirt and black pants, and this alternate outfit would have made Spillsbury look more convincing, like the Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> The cast basically performed in their performances, They all look as if they are working on a television episode, and no one seemed very convincing. Even the villain Cavendish lost his urgency because of the people around him. In general, I'm sorry Spilsbury. Not only did he do a terrible acting job, but it’s obvious that production and advertising were terrible and effectively sabotaged any chance the poor guy had. Even if he was a great substitute for Clayton Moore, I doubt that the film would have been successful as a result of other factors. In its current form, this film is sad and funny.
