Oh my God! Book II is more like a bad remake of the original than a sequel to it. It's not so funny, its plot plays too much <br /> <br />, like a comedy pilot with a rejected situation and the use of the “Think of God” slogan is another variation of the idea that worked much better in the original. John Denver did not return to this film, and it had a BIG value. George Burns, how beautiful he was, <br /> <br /> played god, he didn't have that chemistry with the little girl he played with John Denver. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a rating of 3 out of 10, but only for <br /> George Burns; the rest of the cast is nothing special. <br /> <br /> If you liked the first one, you should not watch it.
