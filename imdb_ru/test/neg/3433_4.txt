It seemed to me that this film is all right. <br /> <br /> On paper in this film is everything that a person can wish for! Melodrama, comedy, drama Bank robbery, unique cast, great music and storytelling! <br /> <br /> In fact, this film turned out to be mostly garbage, and I will tell you why. <br /> <br /> a) This is my biggest problem: editing. This film has the worst editing I've ever seen, with the exception of the local auto show commercial. Editing might be better if the deaf Parkinson patient pounded a dead cat at iMovie. There are scenes where two characters talk to each other, and you can see their lips move, and the audio / video is not synchronized, because it is clearly duplicated. Why was this duplicated? I dont know! This is English dubbing! The voices were made in a studio elsewhere in certain scenes! Can't they find a boom microphone ?! They are not expensive; Jesus, even I have one! And I do not make films! <br /> <br /> b) Andrew Keegan was missing. It seems that he did not want to participate in this project, and his game was the equivalent of a parody performed by DAAR.E. for schoolchildren. At least, John Krasinksy showed some enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Yes, John Krasinski is the only reason I made this film, and the only real reason worth watching. He had a good, ingenious presentation, and he was the most three-dimensional character. Dean Edwards's character was rather thin, as was her face. <br /> <br /> Last word? If you're a John Krasinski fan, it's worth your while. If not, do not even worry. Editing
