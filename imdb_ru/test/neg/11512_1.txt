For those of us who are part of the real ballet world, this film is completely ridiculous. Ivan Kirov was mostly a gymnast, not a ballet dancer. Viola Essen at that time worked at the Ballet Theater, and now at the American Ballet Theater, and was a fairly good dancer, but, apart from Dame Judith Anderson, acting at an amateur level, and Chekov is completely out of sorts ... embarrassing! I saw this film at the age of 14, and at that time, never seeing ballet, I was very impressed. However, later, many years after I finished my career as a dancer, I bought a video tape with her, and I was curious about what it looked like. I could not believe how naive Hollywood can be about the world of ballet. But this was done in the mid-40s, before the "Red Shoes" or "Turning Point", the last of which gave a true picture of the world of ballet. The entire cast of the Phantom has already passed away ... Ivan Kirov (not his real name) dies at the age of 79. It was his only film, after which a Chicago businessman keeps him ... so there are rumors.
