I went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night. I am 20 years old and this film was too much for me. I could not imagine that a teenager, teenager or (especially) a child would be accepted into this film. It was rude and insulting. I was completely misled by its PG-13 rating and the preview that I saw for that. I initially saw a preview for him on Nickelodeon, and I thought it looked pretty nice (maybe I just don’t remember the preview correctly). In addition, Drake Bell (the main character of the film) is filmed in the television show Nickelodeon, which is intended for children and teenagers. I really did not think that the content of the film would be as risky as it was. I should have done more research about this before I left. However, I hope that parents will read this film before they take their children to watch it, simply because Drake Bell is in it. <br /> <br /> Seriously, do NOT take your children or teenagers to view. This movie. The rating was supposed to be R. There are many sexual references, references to drugs and disturbing events throughout the film. Examples: Drake Bell is attacked by sexually charged animals, several scenes where men grab female breasts, a lot of profanity, Drake Bell uses a cam to smoke vanilla icing (or something like that), people get knife wounds, blows and wounds the movie, and the old lady and her dog are lost. There are many other offensive and disgusting scenes in the film. It was really humiliating for women in general. This film was created by the people who filmed the series “Scary Movies”, so he should tell you something. Please remember that such films may give children and adolescents misconceptions about sex, drugs and violence. Most children and adolescents cannot solve parody, comedy and reality. <br /> <br /> I have a sense of humor. I also know that the humor that was in this film is typical of its genre. But I find the possibility that children and teenagers will watch this movie HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> As for the overall quality of the film, I don’t think it was so original or funny. He stretched in parts, and part of the humor was simply forced and painful. The game wasn't too bad considering how bad the script is. If you are an adult or elderly teenager looking for a funny movie, skip it or rent it.
