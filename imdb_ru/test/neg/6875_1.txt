In this film, everything possible was not so, and I do not know why I had to watch it to the end. It would be more fun to watch the dried paint. I even liked D-Tox for a loud cry, and it was much better than this one. Here is the main plot for you: the goons are bitten by snakes, who hold the evil of 13 murderers, and become the killing machine for undead who kill teenagers with zero personality. During the film, I lost hope when it didnâ€™t frighten me at all, when the killings were bad, and there were BAD CGI blood and CGI snakes. Worst of all, thin cardboard characters killed their girlfriend, holding her from their feet and not letting go, so she was pierced by a tree and when the bad guy moved under water like a shark in Jaws. I'm still upset why I even worried about it. I think because I'm a fan of horror movies.
