This is a great example of what happened at Comedy Central after the departure of Dave Chapelle. Here is the problem with Carlos Mencia. First, his natural name is Ned Holness, and it was known that he was under 18 when he changed his name to Ned Arnel Mencia. He was born in Honduras, although he behaves as if he were from Mexico. He also grew up in the United States. <br /> <br /> I could forgive all this nonsense, but ... <br /> <br /> He was caught stealing other people's materials. Joe Rogan was his loudest critic in that regard. The stereotypical Olympiad was an idea that he ripped off a couple of DJs from Miami. He stole jokes from Bill Cosby. He stole George Lopez's material in his special HBO edition (13 minutes). <br /> <br /> He believes that what he does is so original, but for years Dave Chapelle and Lisa Lampanelli have been chasing races before this idiot (among others). <br /> <br /> This show will collapse and burn. The word Biner can not last as long as it is old. He has not done anything new since the first episode. <br /> <br /> "Want to hear a joke? Beaner jumps over the fence! It's funny for 3 seasons!" Not. <br /> <br /> Awful.
