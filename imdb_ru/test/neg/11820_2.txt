Some of the films filmed by Roger Corman’s New World Film Company in the 1970s are the best kind of B-films, where the limitations of the genre actually act as a kind of liberating influence on script writers and directors. classic films such as Deathrace 2000, Hollywood Boulevard, Grand Theft Auto and Caged Heat originated from this medium. Unfortunately, his former associates in American International Pictures exhausted themselves in the 1970s, especially in the absence of Jim Nicholson, and they often produced second-rate imitations of Corman’s films, sometimes with the stars he made himself. "Black Mom, White Mom" ​​- one of these films. In fact, it is a cheaper imitation of the “Big Doll House”, where the same stars do many of the same things. Yes, this is a co-production of John Ashley (yes, that same John Ashley, who was a funny Elvis who wants to be in "How to make a monster" and paired with Debbie Wally in "Beach Blanket Bingo" with all the brand names of his productions - female in prisons, where all but 2 or 3 main characters, including prisoners and guards, are Filipino actors, mostly not speaking roles, where we see women like supermodels playing the role of revolutionary militants, and where the main joy of the film stems from the rudimentary exploitation of S & M . <br /> <br /> The impression I saw This recently he was badly damaged by light (good ol Will Will Viharo called him "Yellow Mom, Yellow Mom"), but I think that even in the best conditions, photography and directing are extremely common. Is there also very little visual value here? Corman shouldn’t have had much to do with the film itself, because it was always tricky enough to at least give its films additional production value by shooting in free public places, which would make the film more impressive. This film does not look impressive, it does not have an impressive soundtrack, and you are just ashamed of everyone who demonstrates a piece of talent. The only remotely interesting performances come from Pam Greer as a brave whore who wants to escape from life, from Filipino actor Dindo Fernando as her grotesquely indulgent pimp and from Sid Haig as a cowboy-style mercenary. The story puts Greer and her film colleague Margaret Markov in the low-budget female version of Challengers, but does very little with the melodramatic possibilities that this premise gives. In fact, this is just an excuse to ensure that the two main characters can still stop for a good dirt fight while they try to escape from prison together. This is all in the spirit of good fun, but the film ultimately fails even in exploitation quality, because in such scenes there must be certain advantages and rawness, which are instead replaced by this director with a kind of yawning predictability instead. <Br /> <br /> So the film will be of little use to hardcore fans? at least in the version I saw, it is no more explicit than "Faster, pussy, kill! Kill!" more than ten years ago, and much less interesting visually and thematically. For those who just like to laugh at the films “so bad it's good,” this one can be fun, but not at the top level. People are better advised to look for the "heat in the cage" or some others who revel in their own cruelty to such an extent that it becomes a camp; this one is more like less ambitious efforts, such as the Mooters of Chirio Santiago. Unfortunately, the best thing about this particular movie is the name and presence of Pam Greer, which was better in other films around the same time (especially in Jack Hill's Coffey). This film may illustrate an intermediate point on Miss Greer’s secretary from Corman’s secretary to the film “Queen for God's sake”, but apart from the historical “meaning” as such, it will not have much value even for Greer big fans, because she is allowed to work here. very little. <br /> <br /> You should miss it, of course, if you don’t see it in the cinema with a lot of friends and a lot of beer, like me. And even then its value is questionable.
