Rent this movie if you have the mood to laugh (for sheer stupidity), as this movie does not scare a handful of kids at a Halloween party! The problem is that children have too much blood, so definitely don’t put this in the toddler VCR. It all starts with a little promise that gives you the impression that the author of the box cover may have really started watching this movie before creating the cover, but then quickly plunges into epic stupidity. “Effigy killers” are clumsy bosses that are about as scary as in The Wizard of Oz, but not so smart. If they only had a brain ...? I bought this film for $ 1.20 at a local discount store, and even then I feel a little ripped off. I think with all the other comments posted here, if you really pay to see it, you can only blame yourself.
