I recently borrowed a copy of this film, and it took me three sessions over the course of three days. This is another comment. <br /> <br /> But first I would like to comment on the negligence regarding the features of the DVD. It included a memory game that asks the player / viewer to pick up pairs of animals to climb the ark. However, each time he detects a selected animal, the screen prompts the player to find (or congratulates the player on the discovery) “his assistant”. This is a spelling mistake, as it should be “his mate” as a possessive pronoun, and not an abbreviation “it is”. It is an annoying mistake to repeat 16 or more times to complete the game. Of course, this is really a child's lesson, but it teaches children to misspell. <br /> <br /> And yes, the game never changes. This is the same game with the same locations of the same animals every time. Plus it doesn't score, as the number of moves it took to solve a game. Thus, there is no permanent value or problem to this. This is just a feature that can be listed on the packaging. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this “special” function could be thought out and carefully, just like in this tangled film.
