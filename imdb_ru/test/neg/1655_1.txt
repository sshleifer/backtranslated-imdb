This is one of the worst parts of the movie that I have ever seen. This is also my first review, so you can say that I should hate this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I like my serious films. I donâ€™t really like Hollywood, I like the French, Italian, unusual USA or something that is trying to convey something meaningful. <br /> <br /> But it was awful Why? 1. The plot (as it was) was absolutely incredible, although the director seems to depend on a sense of realism. <br /> <br /> 2. The main character has nothing to recommend him. Does he smoke for the sake of coolness or shows us his fear? For God's sake, this guy must be a former mafia lawyer. We need to take more care, because he is also one of the meanest unfriendly people you have ever met? And he smokes ... so he must have deep personal problems. Pop psychology at its best. In the last minutes I was almost glad when he was buried in cement. The best place for him. And I thought it was the only good scene. Or maybe it was because he was so close to the final loans. <br /> <br /> 3. A very tired and incredible interest in the main character from a beautiful girl. She was there simply because beautiful girls always have strange sexual relationships with old, old men with a deep and meaningful personality (as shown by smoking). It happens all the time. In really bad movies it is. <br /> <br /> 4. The pace was so leaden. I love slow, I love cautious. But it was just deadly. <br /> <br /> 5-50 a bunch of other things that I really can't write. <br /> <br /> Awful.
