I have always liked the movies “Continue”, with their double sexual implications of dialogue and moments of a comedy film, but I can understand why critics put him two stars. Basically, many Britons are going by bus to go to the Spanish holiday on the island of Elsbels at the Palace Hotel. What they did not know is that it is not fully built, plus they have to share bathrooms with their neighbors, they have crappy drawings and many other complications and complaints that the owner is Pepe (Peter Butterworth, making a rather funny accent, for example The world sounds like a bad word P). Starring Syd James as Vic Flange, Kenneth Williams as Stuart Farquhar, Charles Hotrie as Eustace Tuttle, Joan Sims as Cora Flange, Barbara Windsor as Sadie Tomkins, Kenneth Connor as Stanley Blunt, apparently shit (person I do not remember who he is Jimmy Logan in the role of Bert Conway, June Whitfield in the role of Evelyn Blunt, Hattie Jacques in the role of Fell (absurd hag character, not as memorable as her usual Matron) Lily, Carol Hawkins as Marge, Jack Douglas Harry and Patsy Rowlands Miss Dobbs. I admit that this is not very good, but in the dialogues enough, and, of course, Babs in the shower, and she goes to her ass with this iconic whistle, and then quickly rips her bra. Okay!
