No expiatory traits, this film is rubbish. His jokes don't get funny. Children's humor is pathetic, and trying to appeal to adults simply adds sticky stupidity to all this pathetic packaging. When I watched this with the children, I was embarrassed by what might happen next. I could not enjoy the film at all. Although my child, for whom the DVD was purchased, liked the fact that she owned a new DVD, neither she nor her sister showed much interest in replaying it, unlike Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Books, Lion King and D. Receive frequent requests for retry.
