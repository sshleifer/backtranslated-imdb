Being one of the victims of the Enron scandal, my mom made me watch this movie with her. How many times can I say terrible? The script was so weak that it used cliché for cliché. It seems that the authors wrote this story along with several articles on Enron. Watching the film, we honestly were able to complete approximately half of the lines and thoughts of one-dimensional characters. I understand that this was supposedly adapted from the book, but was the book bad? I do not know what to say. Just awful. The best thing about the movie? Shannon Elizabeth actually kept her clothes. In addition, this film gets a big fat F.
