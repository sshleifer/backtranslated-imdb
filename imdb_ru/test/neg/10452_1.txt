The science fiction channel considers it to be science fiction; it's a shame. Big bugs, snakes, mythical little animals and so on, they continue to exist. <br /> <br /> Someone at Universal was smart enough to turn on BattleStar Galactica (new, good) and Firefly for a short time in their line up. I know that they know that they distinguish between complete garbage and extremely high-quality science fiction. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, they talked about how they were all moving high and powerful, making productions that were not just simple, sloppy tracks for us. Many thanks, Sci-Fi! You know, you make films so bad that even Trek will not watch them, so you have achieved your goal! Fire Serpent, Ice Spiders, Manticore, Larvae, etc., and then a vast relentless storm, and they still spread faster than the last flu virus! How they do it, I can't afford it. Why they do it, I just do not know. How I can ignore these reviews, comments, blogs and emails, I also do not know, but it is clear that they think little of their audience and do not care about our opinion! They seem to think that science fiction fans want it! You might think that one or two good performances with some sense of crawl, when the one who lights the green trash, goes on vacation. At the very least, they use the Misfit toy collection; many of the science fiction movie of the week actors were on science fiction shows once and now need money. I love you guys and hope you get the best job!
