Maybe I'm the only one here, but this is a shit show. Sorry, but I was lured when I found out about Lille Bill O'Reilly (whom I had no idea, left this show until a few months later, and since then, frankly, I lost my appeal), but I gave the show a chance Spike struggles to turn into what he is not, that is, he tries to be human. Fox didn't even bother to hide the strings when they dragged him out of the box he entered. His sketches are trying their best, he himself is not funny, and the writers are struggling to write material for an un-talented host. There are too many good TVs to spend your time on this show, and Fox ..... Fox, we had a good time, but you need to get your game together and come up with something original instead of trying to be just another network " I, too".
