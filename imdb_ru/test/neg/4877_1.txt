Where to begin. Let's first list all the good things about this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. Mikael Persbrandt is great as the Gangster Thomas. This is the only character you really care about, and he is a bad guy! (allthogh never does anything bad and is usually a very nice guy) 2. Kjell Bergquist is always great. He is a bit muffled, but he is still quite funny. 3. The film looked pretty good by Swedish standards, good use of depth of field and light. <br /> <br /> Now bad. This is by far the worst scenario ever to appear on the big screen. The game of all the others was pretty bad and excessive. The direction was terrible. Absolutely meaningless story, completely unrealistic characters and events, and 1.5 hours before the end. During the emotional scenes, everyone in the theater laughed. People just started coming out during the screening. <br /> <br /> It’s impossible to summarize a story into something connected, so I won’t even try. Every cliche ever conceived is there and in all the wrong places. I'm sorry to say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my whole life. <br /> <br /> See how to laugh, but try not to pay money for it;) <br /> <br /> .R
