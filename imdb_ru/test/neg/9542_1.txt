Wow - this movie was really bad! Are you talking about the formal, typical plot of the film? Watching this film was like hitting my head against a brick wall several times. The transitions continued to try to be cool, but failed. Rotation of the plot at the end, where we find out who the bad guy was, was unexpected, but it doesn't make much sense while his monologue. Even then ... The amount of blood in this film doesn't help either. Are all these images necessary? My last complaint concerns the credibility of fragments of a film. Will the police send a lonely officer to an unlit warehouse, a subway tunnel, or somewhere to find the body when the location of the criminal is unknown? And why does romance just suddenly happen in the end? As if the writer was trying to fit into every Hollywood cliche that could. Don't waste your time watching this ... something.
