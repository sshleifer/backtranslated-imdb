Terrible! I am a teenager and I am not against teen films, but this is terrible! Aaron Carter plays this pop star named J. D. McQueen and to support his grades or something, he works with Jane, the “nerd”, whatever it is. But "evil girls" are too predictable and such. The clothes that most girls wear in the film is unreal. How could any of these girls get off without wearing a bra, panties and shirts that expose their belly? In high school? In my school we will be sent home for something like this. <br /> <br /> And one part of the film where JD is writing to Jane, she says: “Sleep well? He must think that I'm an idiot! I did not know that text messages were so stressful! How are text messages stressful? And the way Jane is obsessed with JD and how he “falls in love” with her is very silly. The dialogue is stupid and stupid, the game is terrible. the music is somewhat pleasant, and the plot has almost no analogues. <br /> <br /> For teens who still love Aaron Carter, you'll love it. If you are a casual observer like me, this is not a movie for you.
