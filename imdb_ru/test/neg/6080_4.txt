It is always interesting to me to see the films launched, which seem to have good powers, but in this case ignoring the film seems justified. Obviously, based on some real incidents during the Second World War, the film simply does not associate with the viewer for some reason, which I do not quite understand. One of the most likely reasons is that - in any case, in print, which I saw at TCM, - not one of the scenes where the Germans were talking to each other was called. This interesting directorial concept — to allow a spectator who does not speak German simply to guess from the “context” what the Germans say to each other — in my book a complete failure and helps block the spectator. In addition, the way the film begins — simply diving us into a very confusing situation without much adjustment — is disorienting. Brian Keith is pretty good here, but the reputation of “The Great Escape” and “Stalag 17” will not be challenged by this film.
