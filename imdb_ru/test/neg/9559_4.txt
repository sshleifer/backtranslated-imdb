Bugsy Siegel was 31 years old when he went to the west coast. In addition to his dreams of Las Vegas, he played with the idea of ​​acting. He was a handsome guy and about 7 years younger than his friend George Raft, so it was not such a crazy idea. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty was 54 when he made this film, despite the hair dye he was too old for this part. Beatty was a mistake; Bugsy was supposed to play someone like Alec Baldwin. Bugsy was a tough guy his contemporaries feared; Beatty just does not emit a threat. <br /> <br /> This was a vain project for Beatty, who did not accept the fact that he was no longer the leading man. <br /> <br /> Another big annoying mistake is Mantegna as George Raft. Raft had distinctive voice and manners, none of which Mantegna even tries to match. You never believe that Mantegna came from the streets. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty and Robert Redford have been pretending for years to become younger because of the massive use of hair dye, and now it will be a shock to suddenly turn gray and play the role of characters.
