The performance in this video is so bad that it cannot be seen. The performance took the second place in the overwhelming majority of creative jokes of the studio wank with about thirty special effects per minute. It is shot in a cloud of smoke, lasting only one or two seconds per frame, and often background spotlights shine directly into the camera. The lighting was terrible for filming. There is a constant zoom in and out with a complete lack of visual continuity. There may have been some good dancing available for a live audience, but viewers of the video will never know.
