This movie makes “Sparkle” look like Schindler's List. Tarantino and Weinstein really need to think about adding their names to the product. Green lighting P.O.S. like this, regardless of friendships, it's just a bad business. Larry Bishop needs to stay away from the movie camera at all costs. Writer / director / producer / actor Bishop shows that his skills are not suitable for any of these works. The vanity project sent to the south, Hell's Ride, usually allows good actors to chew on the scenery ... at least when the camera is not focused on Bishop's weak attempts to steal every scene he is in. The last three words on Hell's Journey: STINK, STANK, STUNK.
