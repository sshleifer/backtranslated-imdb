I started watching this because I thought it was really bad porn. As I continued to watch, the only excitement I received from this film was figuring out how it was called, so that I could watch it and break it. I just finished and decided to end my life, knowing that someone actually shot this film. <br /> <br /> For those who have commented on this film as a good script and a great game, my words of wisdom for you probably don’t have friends because you were in the film. You probably would like to have all this time ago spent on making this film. <br /> <br /> By no means is this a serious film. There was an old man who was hit, and it did not even hurt him at all. And when everyone else gets hit, they drop dead. <br /> <br /> It was probably important that these people kill random people and eat them, as well as hang out with an 80-year-old man who wanted to put parts in his body. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was when the old man discovered “hemoglobens” or how you write it, because because of this the film seemed very intelligent and probably helped to reach the older crowd. <br /> <br /> What really struck me was that they decided to add this random scene about college girls who go into the woods in search of fake skulls. <br /> <br /> If you try to watch this film, you should probably fill out, raise your bath, put a hairdryer in it, and be ready for it. <br /> <br /> THIS MUST SEE !!! .... for those who believe that life can not be worse, because it will help you realize that there are people (the creators of this film) who are even more pitiful and do not go anywhere in life.
