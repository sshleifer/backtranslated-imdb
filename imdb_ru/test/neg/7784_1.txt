A friend of mine once rented it, thinking that since Peter Fonda had starred in it, it could not be bad. WRONG! This is bad, like everyone. There are so many laughs, and this is not a joke. For example, in one scene, Hawken walks into the forest, and when he leaves, he suddenly wears a completely different outfit! Where was the "director's brain" when he was shooting this scene?!? Probably the same place was at Funds when he agreed to make this film. It's really a shame when you need to see how such a good actor gets numb in this bad excuse for a film. <br /> <br /> No one can be called an actor's game. Jack Elam is invited here simply to count the number of stars, but all he does is look startled in a very dark and horrible scene in a bar. Not to mention the "Indians", the girl was so monstrous that I wanted to shoot her to put an end to her suffering and my suffering. If I could give it a 0, I would. The shame of this sign does not exist here. It really looks like a bad joke or amateur shots made just for fun. This should serve as proof of how bad B-movies can be.
