This is one of the most ridiculous westerns ever created by Hollywood. Gary Cooper plays Reb Hollister, a former confederation officer, wanted by law. He meets with a jerk named Weatherby, played by Leif Ericson, a US Marshal with no knowledge of firearms. Weatherby is going to Dallas to see her bride, Tonya Robles, played by Ruth Roman. Senor Robles, Tony's father, has many people, but they cannot follow his cattle, who regularly rustle the Marlowe brothers. Will Marlowe, played by Raymond Massey, financed a loan at Robles estate, making things completely absurd. He even has the right to demand payment on mortgage loans before they come, simply because he so wants. <br /> <br /> Weatherby is a Boston boy who cannot fight because he became a marshal, so he could visit his bride, Tonya, (just another case of a more stupid conspiracy. Should we assume that you need just pass a written test to get this job? Wait, this guy also could not pass a written test.) he changes his personality with reb Hollister, who, of course, is an experienced fighter. Reb has the right to greet the girl Weatherby passionate kiss, and Weatherby looks like an idiot. Gary Cooper, the number one Hollywood stallion, is in great shape, like a reb. Before the film is finished, he not only takes the work of Weatherby, he also steals his bride, and Ruth Roman, like Tonya, falls in love with him so quickly and so quickly that she waves off the dude Leif Erikson before the movies a little more than half. is over. <br /> <br /> In the entire film there is not the slightest confidence in the plot, so, despite the good cast and magnificent photo, the film is not very successful. And Cooper's character is a heel to boot. The film also features Barbara Payton as Brant Marlowe, a beautiful and talented actress who, unfortunately, missed her chances, creating too many headlines for the wrong reasons. I highly recommend you pass it on.
