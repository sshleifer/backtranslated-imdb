This film tells about a mysterious love letter that turned the love life of 4 people upside down. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is interesting, and the film could be fun. However, this film is simply something that a romantic comedy should not be. At first, characters are introduced inadequately, which is why it is so confusing. Auxiliary characters come and go without sufficient reason, as if they exist only for one particular scene, and then disappear into the air. The pace is very slow, due to which 90 minutes seem more like 180 minutes. <br /> <br /> It could have been romantic and funny, but this film was not a success.
