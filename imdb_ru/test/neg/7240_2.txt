The incident with Salena, of course, the director, the best film of Dustin Rickert, - which says little. In my past films (and I freely use the term “films”), the director takes ideas from Hollywood blockbusters and subject them to serious marginalization. The Salena incident is no different. In fact, the film "Con Air" meets aliens, made with the likeness of your usual film school. The film is imbued with out of focus frames and suffers from special effects that could hardly compete with most computer animation classes in high school. For example, almost every explosion on the screen is one and the same fire effect, entangled on the screen. <br /> <br /> Weak effects and production value are compromised only by an incorrect plot and rocky dialogue. In the sentence, the story is connected together, as an exposition of overly used Hollywood clichés. The film begins with the worst CGI Alien ship ever made crashing into the worst CGI land ever made, and an army team going down to explore. Then a prison bus transporting the worst of the worst from all over the state was overthrown by prisoners with the help of their blond girlfriends armed with silicone implants. Prisoners escape and flee to the city of Salena, where they encounter aliens who ... SHOCK ... escaped from prison transport of aliens carrying the worst of the worst in the galaxy. Prisoners and their captive police, armed only with guns and sad puns, must fight off the aliens and escape from the city before the International Space Alliance * rolls its eyes * bombard the city in oblivion. <br /> <br /> The only true part of the film is when actors (who are clearly undermined by the script) are given the freedom to improvise, as well as when they beat off the smaller of the alien creatures in the squall of firearms. In addition, the film really does not cost anyone, not to mention the plastic from which the DVD is made. How terrible was that? Let's just say: the Minister of Defense is about 90 years old, he works in a room similar to the high-tech office in the 1950s and wears a Looney Tunes tie. Yes, if before this was not clear enough, the MAN, GUIDING PENTAGON, DIRECTES ITS RELATION TO BUNNY DOLLS AND ROAD SAFE. The film basically ends (Ha-ha-ha-ha, as I said, ends ...) when the last remaining soldier encounters a group of prisoners and guards, and a new formed team fights away from vicious aliens - which is strange reason leads them back to the alien ship? Yes ... <br /> <br /> The film has a heart, but it is permeated with a terrible direction and even worse camera work. Someone seriously needed to hit DP and tell him that there is more for cinematography than repetitive, stagnant shots at chest level. This film is really not worth renting (if it ever makes it that far), because it’s not as bad as the last films made by the director, which reduces the ability to laugh, but it’s not at all like a watchable movie.
