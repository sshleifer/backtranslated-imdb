Horrible Horrible movie, I still can not believe that my friend persuaded me to see it! No plot, bad game, unfunny scenes and very, very stupid conversations. All I have to say is that this film is the worst film I have ever seen, and it is worse than Halloween III, to which I also gave 0 stars. So I give him 0 stars and 0 out of 10, well, here is 1, but you understand.
