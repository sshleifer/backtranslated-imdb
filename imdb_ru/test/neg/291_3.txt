I heard stories about ravers in a movie, which is great, but it's only 1/100 of a movie. The problem with this movie is cheerfulness. I never got the plot or why the guy stole the girls. It doesn't make sense, but hey ... why they were at the club by chance, it was curious as well. Many parts of this film do not make sense, but in general I was interested. On many levels, this was confusing ... maybe I was just not indie enough for this film, but judging by the final scene in film B, they ran out of money, they just added something and forgot about the plot. Its low budget looks like this. I like the fact that they used small special effects that were bad, but they did not use any that were of high quality. I would say that this film is a typical bad script, with good production. This is definitely not as random as many movies I've seen, but the pieces of the puzzle just don't make sense together. As a result, I would eliminate the final battle, when all the effects went on my ass of the 1950s. Sparks from models and the like. Check it out if you like the unintended action movie comedy. The mysterious scientific theater has a candidate.
