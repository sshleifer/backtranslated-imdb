While the dog was cute, there was no movie. It was not a premise or a topic that was a problem. The room had great opportunities for humor and pathos. Subject worthy. Helping other people is more important than accumulating a fortune. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the charming dog, the unique premise and theme were undermined by bad play, unnatural dialogue and amateur footage. <br /> Even my youngest child, who will survive almost everything, gave up before we went half way. How many times can this dog run up and down the same corridor? I can't spoil it for you, since I never saw the end. Just not worth watching all the way to the end.
