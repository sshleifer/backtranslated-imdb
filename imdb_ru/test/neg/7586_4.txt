I usually don’t spend my time criticizing a useless film like this one. However, this week I do not work, so I have a lot of time to get bogged down in meaningless trifles. To begin, let me say that I often enjoy non-commercial, non-core, non-American cinema. (Feel free to click on my user profile for supportive filmography.) However, there are a lot of bad movies that are released in countries outside the US. Believe me, hundreds of them tortured me. Lost in Beijing is one of the worst films ever. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is an impressive, non-stop exhibition of moral degeneration. This film presents some classic morals that belong to the same level as the Bad Boy by Kim Ki-Duca (2001). <br /> <br /> 1. women really enjoy being raped; 2. rape should be glorified, praised and respected; 3. Feel free to rape any woman you like, because while you “do” her, she will eventually begin to love it and reach orgasm; 4. If your wife is raped, make sure that you blackmail her abuser for a lot of money, but if he does not pay, just repeatedly beat his whore with his wife in compensation; 5. If your wife is raped, be sure to screw up and humiliate her the next day, playing the role of a rapist, mocking her with such lines as: “Did you like him?”; 6. If you are a husband - a rapist, just accept it; 7. After you are personally raped, make friends with your abuser and, if possible, communicate with him. <br /> <br /> How can any sane person take care of any of these characters? They are nothing more than a group of degenerates who not only lead their lives carelessly, but in fact enjoy their meaninglessness and support each other. Don't get me wrong, though. I am very capable of enjoying films that depict lifestyle and morality that are contrary to my own. Ichi the Killer (2001) and Moonlight Whispers (1999) are very interesting images of sadomasochism. “Strange Circus” (2005) is an extremely perverse game about child sexual abuse. “Marriage is a crazy thing” (2002) is a terrible charge of traditional marriage. Even religious films such as Karma Runner (2003) and Samsara (2001) sometimes entertained me. The difference is that these films do have an interesting psychological content and character development, while Lost in Beijing has practically none. <br /> <br /> It is known that there are people on this planet with an unorthodox mindset, but some kind of character development or psychology behind the actions themselves leads to a superficial presentation of despicable behavior. Why did Bing Bing end up making friends and taking care of his rapist? Why does the wife of the abuser accept his behavior unconditionally? The filmmakers never bothered to tell us. Even the obvious juxtaposition of the rich and poor classes was irrelevantly conceived and, in the end, served as a simple situational ploy. After half an hour of dirty opening, everything seems too soft and forgotten. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers here seem to confuse moral ambiguity with complex characteristics. The reason you cannot choose which person to contact is because it was not properly designed. Do not think that in this film complex characters just because they are not clearly defined. On the contrary, the reason why they are not clearly defined is that we do not know anything about them or what they think. This is hardly a positive attribute of this film. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, cinematography and acting are pretty good, but everything else becomes duller and duller as the movie progresses. You can put it next to the garbage like “Turning Gate” (2002), “How much time is there” (2001), “Irreversible” (2002) and the aforementioned “Bad Boy”.
