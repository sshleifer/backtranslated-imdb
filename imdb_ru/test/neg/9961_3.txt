A scientist (George Zucco) wants to create wolf people from American soldiers to fight the Nazis, but is considered insane. He uses a prostitute gardener (Glenn Strange) to experiment by mixing his blood with the blood of a wolf. Strange, constantly putting his dialogue with the tones of Lon Cheney, Jr. in “Mice and Men,” has no idea what is happening, only that he walks in a dream. Victims are beginning to pile up (including a little girl, which modern viewers may find quite disturbing, and two rivals Zucco). There is a good dialogue about how a person should not communicate with nature (still common today) and play God. Zucco's motives may be honest, but his methods are most dubious. And there is his daughter, Anne Nagel, who sympathizes with Strange, but has no idea about the affairs of her father. Johnny Downes is a reporter who puts Zukko in a bad way, interrogating him, but winning the heart of Nagel, thereby creating an ordinary and always boring romantic plot in classic horror films. 77 minutes is about 15 minutes more than usual for the horror film of the early 40s (especially one of the PRC, who released this film), so a romantic story could be cut off by cost and speed up the process a bit, Fortunately Zucco is never hammi; He left it Bela Lugosi (who always admired in a theatrical manner that he liked the audience) and Todd Sloter from England. But try not to think about the laboratory of the Bride of the Monster, looking at the one in which Zukko works, or at some of the dialogues of Lugoshi in this now classic cult film. The Mad Monster lacks a cult, because it’s not adorably bad, it’s just boring in several places. For fans of the PRC and monograms, I would recommend "The corpse disappears" or "Misty island" above this
