Hi, this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. On that day, when I watched this movie, I had a fever. But still I watched the movie with great patience. And after watching the movie I wanted to repent. Because I spent 3 hours on this stupid movie. I could rest, not watch this movie. And I was very surprised that actors like Sunny Deol, Akshay Kumar Aftab and others were in this film. <br /> <br /> I don’t understand if directors didn’t find a good story to make a film, why do they remain as directors? Why can't they stay at home and spend time at home? <br /> <br /> I ask all the directors that it will be good for them if they ask the audience by mail or through the media, newspapers, radio, etc. ... to send them a good story if they will not find any good story to make a film. I ask all directors again, please do not make such films.
