I am the only person who saw and remembers Amadeus. Each scene in “Copying” has its counterpart in Amadeus’s “Milossky Foreman” - from galloping carriages, accompanied by frantic strings, to Anna’s entrance through a dark corridor, preceded by a man with a key, to the conclusion of the dialogue with Anna at Beethoven’s feet a la Salieri before the dying mozart. No one else remembers the dialogue in this scenario: <br /> <br /> Salieri "Time?" Mozart's "Total Time". ..... "We start with the strings ...", and therefore he "copies". <br /> <br /> Remember, Cynthia Nixon leaned against the doorjamb, tears fell on her freckled face - the same scene, just replace it with Beethoven's nephew. Even scatological humor (fart jokes) is the same. We even have a cardinal, accompanied by a plate of sweet cookies, which resembles Salieri in the banquet hall. No one else remembers? !!!! <br /> <br /> And the scene where Anna cries before God: “Why did you give me this gift?” ... Salieri said the same thing! <br /> <br /> And outside of all that we have a scenario for minors with an introductory exposure, which reads like character identification, which you will find in children's history. “I'm Mr. Beethoven. I am a composer ... ". <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of the bridge builder? In addition, to compare the technical with the artistic ... a comparison that is not developed at all - probably because it does not matter at all, especially when it comes to Beethov, who was a technical technician. <br /> <br /> There is only one magnificent scene - the ninth game. First, the music, which in itself brings you to tears. But then, there is a very erotic interaction of Anna, a copyist, holding Beethoven’s time and conduct, which surpasses the most obvious sexual intimacy. So intense, it's almost a shame. <br /> <br /> But please, the rest of the film - Where is the collective memory of the world? You've seen it all before .... and better!
