This film was different from most of the 1930s Jimmy Kenji films in that it was NOT made by Warner Brothers / First National, but was leased to a small studio. Since it was a “poor” studio, production values ​​are lower than you could get used to seeing with Cagney’s films. Plus, the plot is definitely one of the strangest I've ever seen. Instead of being a gangster, he was a good guy at that — fighting for the law. This is not so unusual, because Cagney often played for lawyers - such as the OSS leader (CIA progenitor) FBI agent. BUT, it was really strange to make him an investigator of the Bureau of Measures and Scales - especially since sometimes he acted almost the same way as in the movie “G-MEN”! <br /> <br /> In general, bystander, that's all. <br /> <br /> Finally, the video I saw in Memory Lane Video was probably one of the poorest ones I ever met, the sound was terrible and scratching, and the print looked very white and had a lot of torn film and tears.
