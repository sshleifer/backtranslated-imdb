The film is great for Venezuelan tourism, birds, birds and other birds. Only 1 piranha. Nice landscape. The only highlight was the alligator seen during a very long and boring motorcycle race. The end, when Caribe sinks, is a definite Hollywood prop. There is no definite storyline. He goes from Venezuelan landscapes to robbing a lightweight racer, mining diamonds and a ruthless hunter going crazy for some reason, who eventually gets it. A very low-budget film that could be shot anywhere with Venezuela. William Smith is a very talented actor who has shot some very good films. Like all actors, they need at least one bad movie. Do not spend $ 5 on a DVD.
