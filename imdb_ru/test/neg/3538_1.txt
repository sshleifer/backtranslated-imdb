The only reason I watched this film was because it was Giovanni Ribisi, and it was supposed to be “Horror.” Don't be fooled, this movie should be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. We are talking about these people who go to a secret place with a monster. Monster - a man with a distorted face, running in blue sweatpants, hungry for brains. Some people die, some not. In the end, they drop the monster from the plane, and then happily fly away. BUT IT NO! The monster is still alive after it leaves the plane! Spend 2 hours trying to see how the paint dries on the wall, believe me, it's more fun than this stuff.
