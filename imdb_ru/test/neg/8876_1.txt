This film is just another waste of time. The plot is a funny, forced US drama. All the characters were really weak, especially the charismatic Goya and the poor interpretation of Bardem, who was only fine in his classical interpretation when he acted as a French ally. <br /> <br /> Another lost chance spent money in a good movie. I think it was not a low budget movie. Definitely not recommended. Perhaps the director should think a little about whether the film makes sense or not before spending money. They may not be worried, because they have a profit before they go to the movies. <br /> <br /> There is no more hope in the movies ...
