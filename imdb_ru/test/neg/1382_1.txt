Well, I would give the advantage of doubt. I watched his show. <br /> <br /> This is not funny to me. All that I remember was a lot of "strange" noises and screams. I don't think I even smiled. The only thing that somehow resembled humor was his role as Angelina Jolie / Jennifer Aniston. I think you can get dumber any minute by looking at him. <br /> <br /> Also, what about "Ask Whitey?" section? This is plagiarism. “Ask for a gay? Black? ”From the Shappel Show? Isn't it obvious? But when Chappelle did it, he exposed the ignorance of the subject. Like borat. But what happened to the selection of random white people and shouts at them? This is not funny, just stupid. <br /> <br /> And I’m almost sure that I’ve heard some “jokes” about him somewhere else ... it seems that he is “smearing” pieces and pieces of several “loud” screams. <br /> <br /> In any case, it was not funny. Seriously. Don't even waste your time.
