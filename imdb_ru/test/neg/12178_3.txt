Lame. Lame. Lame. Ultralame. Should I go further? There is one, I repeat * one * funny scene in this whole protracted, not funny, amateur program “Special Hour” of the film: fat father Fares Fares shoots down someone with his beer. That's all. The rest of this shockingly mediocre heap of non-existence consists of the usual dull-looking Swedish “actors” leading the dialogues that go into one ear and from the other, a banal story, sloppy guidance, and, well, not much to mention. Fares Fares, a non-caustic composition, is just as charismatic as a certified public accountant, and his nose competes even with Adrian Brody in terms of sheer absurdity. Torkel Petersson should only work with Lasse Spang Olsen. The rest of the cast, fortunately, is easily forgotten, while the enormous titanic nose of Fares will forever haunt me in my dreams. <br /> <br /> Josef Fares helps to destroy the Swedish cinema. Do not support him and his nonsense. Jalla Jalla for the comedies that Arnold Schwarzenegger is for acting, Copps would be much more respectable if it were a video without a budget for Youtube, and Zozo was just the most pretentious, pseudo-touching garbage ever produced by a Swedish director. Wake up and smell the roses: Swedish films can be much better than this, so stop pretending that Fares films are worth watching just because they are “good to be Swedes.” You are welcome.
