Not that I expected much from this, but at least I was hoping for a funny, dull big budget movie. It is not even that. This item is included in the bottom half of all vampire films I've ever seen (and believe me, I've seen a lot of them). Bad behavior, zero performance, almost without thinking, almost non-existent plot (and that this is there, you can drive through the holes in the trucks). Of course, he has an action and it is loud, and there is more action in it, and more noise, and blood, and actions ... Some of these things do not make a good (or even half decent) film. It beats me, as some people may say, that this is the best vampire film of all, which I can assume that they have not seen many. Instead, I suggest seeing Near Dark.
