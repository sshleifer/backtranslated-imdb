The series “Charlie Chan” of the 20th Century Fox, based on Earl Derr Biggers’s novels, turned out to be a favorite of the public, but when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the studio was afraid that the audience would turn against its Asian hero. It was a miscalculation: the actor Sydney Toler took a role in Monogram Studios, where he continued to portray the character in eleven films shot between 1944 and his death in 1947. <br /> <br /> 20th Century Fox viewed Chan’s films as inexpensive “B” films, but even so the studio took care of them: the stories were often stupid, but the pace was abrupt, a witty dialogue and throws (which included such as Bela Lugosi) and Ray Milland) is always an expert. The result was a pleasant charm that stood the test of time. The monogram is different: Chan’s films were simple and straightforward. Scenarios or actors were little involved, and the resulting films were flat, mediocre at best, almost imperceptible at worst. <br /> <br /> Thanks to a suitable cast of actors and a few interesting plot devices, the SHANGHAI COBRA is one of the best films of Chan made in a monogram - but even in this case, it is hardly possible to achieve consistent mediocrity. In this record, especially Chan (Sidney Toler) is called upon to investigate the killer, which kills appears to be a cobra-like bite; at the same time, he decides to make sure that government supplies of radium, hidden in a bank vault, remain safe in all places. Do these two seemingly unrelated plot lines converge? Well, maybe! Sydney Tauler is always fun, like Chen, but most of his performances in Monogram seemed to be “ringing” - and this is as true for COBRA as it was for any Monogram Chan movie. As usual, the really enjoyable performer is Mantan Mooreland. Changing times forced us to see Moreland's comedy as humiliating for African Americans, but he was an experienced actor and comedian, and in the context of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s, his work has tremendous charm and innocence. <br /> <br /> Fox 20th Century series fans are likely to find Chan Monograms a significant disappointment, and newcomers who like Monogrammed films are likely to be third in importance after becoming familiar with Fox films. Like other monogrammed films of Chan, "SHANGHAI COBRA" is best given to four star collectors, and this is generous. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
