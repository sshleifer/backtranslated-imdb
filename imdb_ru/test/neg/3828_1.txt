I can hardly find words to describe how much this piece of garbage has offended me. Why do American filmmakers always try their best to portray Jamaicans as a bunch of backward babies in the bushes and, even worse, throw people to play Jamaicans who sound completely ridiculous when they try to imitate an accent? We are not all very dark, we are not all walking with a machete at work or for protection, we do not go naked in our homes and do not deal with voodoo !! We are doctors, lawyers, architects, businessmen and women, musicians, actors and directors. I am tired of looking at all these images of Jamaicans as a bunch of dreads, dressed in Rastafarians, who do nothing but sit all day, smoke weed on the beach or shoot guns in the air (When we do not live in our houses in the trees). Yes, we wear clothes. Yes, we have electricity. No, weeds are not allowed on the island, and, most likely, we speak better English than you! Worst of all, this is not just malice and bitterness, these are real answers to the questions that most Jamaicans who traveled abroad once asked. Read the book before assuming that it is in another country, and even worse, decide to make a film about it. <br /> <br /> WELCOME TO THE JAMAICA! A country where everything we do is killing white people and beating our bongo drums ... Tales from the crypt officially make me sick, like the whole team of people who worked on this garbage, especially the writer.
