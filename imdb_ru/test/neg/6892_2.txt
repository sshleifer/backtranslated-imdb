I have to admit that of the many thrillers I have seen, this must be one of the worst. I was shocked to find that this part of the work had a budget of 1.5 million. When it started, I thought that the initial sequence was pretty good, pretty standard for this kind of film, but pretty good anyway. But as the movie progressed, I began to feel uneasy because of the lack of tempo that I saw, each sequence seemed to take hours. The reason for this could be that by the present moment the film has already bored me to tears, nothing happened except for endless accusations, accompanied by confused memories and an occasional fit of bad mood. Well ... after we went through all these scenes, we finally reached a big finale ... all singing, a dance demonstration of how lack of imagination can completely destroy what could be a good movie. <Br /> <br /> In general, I found this film predictable and tedious, and I would not recommend this film to anyone other than those whom I personally do not like, but if you have a couple of hours to spend wasted, and you want to watch a thriller, even remotely scary, this is a movie for you.
