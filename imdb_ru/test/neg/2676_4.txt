The Curse of Michael Myers is a very disappointing thing for a fan of the Halloween series. After a very disappointing Halloween disappointment 5, the series reached an almost drab plot line, with silly witchcraft and a teen cult dedicated to the worship of Michael Myers. "The Curse of Michael Myers" raises the stakes in blood and gore, but in reality represents a breach of the integrity of the series. This is too bad, as this is the last film for Donald Pleasans as the hero of Dr. Loomis. Pleasance has a few good moments on screen (valuable if you're a fan of the show), because he is very old now and, as he says, “a very retired doctor.” Unfortunately, he died before the film was finished, and by the conclusion of the film it becomes obvious that the original climate scene of the stories was never realized. From the very beginning, in the movie "Halloween 6" is more like the movie "Made for Television" than the movie "Horrible Blockbuster", which began in 1978. Any loyal Halloween graduate should have demanded more from this movie ... Dr. Loomis and Donald Pleasans deserved more.
