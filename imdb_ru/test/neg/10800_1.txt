Did this doodoo crock win an award? They must have been desperate to get a reward for something. This movie smells like tiny trash and makes me sick. Fortunately, I watched it with Mike MST3K and bots, so it became bearable. A horrible game, an alarming moment for a mother / daughter, a stupid premise, if you want a bad movie, here it is. Be careful, though watch him with Mike and the bots, otherwise you will suffer. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10. I still can't believe that he won the award, and the director defends this * && ^ $$ # $ ^ && part of the movie ^% ^% $ ^ $ #% @ $ # @!
