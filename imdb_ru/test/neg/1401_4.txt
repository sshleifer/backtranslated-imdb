In some ways it’s funny how the comments on this film went down a line, now I’ll add mine. I think that the script could be saved if you act better, and the script is better. Together it was difficult to watch, and I did not flinch from such a topic. <br /> <br /> Sigourney was the best part (I thought that the relationship between her and her surviving son was pretty much the only new thing this film offers in its genre), but even it has fallen behind. I can not blame her, who knows what the director and / or editor shot on the floor of the cutting room. The whole movie was “good, it's good enough, let's move on”, when I KNEW that there was something else to get from the actors and the script, in which there are some good lines and some interesting topics. <Br /> <br /> I don’t think this is considered a spoiler, but a perfect example is the scene where Sigourney walks up to the house of the alleged torturer of her son, and she has such a look, and I thought, "This is the face of someone who overestimates what it is like to see someone living in a mobile home "and, of course, the next shot that should have shocked us, I'm sure the bully lives in a trailer and not in a good house like hers. <br / > As stated by many other authors, there are MUCH MORE best movies with the same aerial scenarios about similar families that rye best fall into the notes - “Celebration” is probably the last example I've seen.
