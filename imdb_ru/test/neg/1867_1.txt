All movies that contain “dumb sound effects” should be shot. If there is something that I HATE, it should be using "Whoop Whoop Whoo" when someone gets hit on the head. The only films I've seen to do this are Ghoulies IV and Hobgoblins when they are at the bar, and Pixie beats the guy in the red suit with a bottle of beer ... or rather inflates it with a bottle of beer because she never hits him by it. Yes, Ghoulies IV sucks. But I have to ask myself: Did they mean that they do not make the so-called “ghoul” mouths move when they are supposedly talking? Their faces are almost as static as the masks used in Trolls 2. Damn, I can make a better construction paper mask, some rubber cement and a handful of sparkles. It sucks.
