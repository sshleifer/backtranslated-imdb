The social responsibility of Warner Brothers is most limited: every five minutes or so we preach that we are Americans, we do not run away from trouble, we fulfill our duties. It also says that if you are willing to hurt yourself to protect your family from clearly deadly gangsters, you are non-American. Walter Houston, looking bored, frustrated, and the “average American family” includes such familiar faces as Sally Blanc (very much like her sister Loretta Young) and Dickie Moore, like a supposedly charming mother. Both are regularly forced out of Chic Sale, only then 47, but they play an eighty-year-old Civil War veteran, jumping hard and “funny” by biting “The Ban”, and moralizing us that we are Americans, damn it. His performance in the style of St.-Vitus Dance is tiring; it’s like Walter Brennan based his whole career on this. William Wellman directs efficiently and quickly, very much like his earlier Public Enemy, but he and the screenwriter neglect to show what happens to this family after a happy disappearance — that is, they are likely to be erased from the crowd.
