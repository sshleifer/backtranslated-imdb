30 rupees / - that's all I paid for rent for a DVD movie and, believe me, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Bollywood filmmakers find it funny to show fools? Well, it is not. Please grow up. <br /> <br /> Here comes the dialogue from the film “Agar Tu Ladki Ko Idzhat Dog Ladki Tume Apni Ijat Degi”. <br /> <br /> The plot is useless, the criminals and the police also run after fools. That's all. Bhagam Bhag. <br /> <br /> Well, it was so, and I had to run away from him. :) I switched to Star Movies and instead looked at Home Alone 2 and laughed.
