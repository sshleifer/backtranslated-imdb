While this film had a few scary moments (a lot of use of the film’s music and perspectives to create ambiguity), it’s obvious that director Ethan Wiley and screenwriter Elari Eddy didn’t waste time studying their subject matter; which also makes me doubt their claim that a real Catholic bishop was following the scenes of exile. <br /> <br /> Among many discrepancies: <br /> <br /> * Jacob, a Roman Catholic priest, when we first meet him outside the church, wear an academic gown on his clerics, not a typical alba, ritual or accomplice. Academic clothes are usually worn by Protestant ministers in liturgical confessions, and not Roman Catholic priests. <br /> <br /> * Priest Jacob quotes some vague and disturbing scripture that angels took up arms. He attributes this to St. To Paul This verse is not from the writings of St. Paul or the Bible. I cannot even find it in the Gnostic scriptures. <br /> <br /> * Jacob tells his bishop that he does not believe in demon possession, and rejects the request to study exorcism, but makes as many as 180 (later that day?) within a few minutes after talking with possessed Isabel. Of course it is possible; but a bit unreal. Look at Damien's father as a priest / psychologist in the original Exorcist to see a more realistic image of a skeptic who has become a believer. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, a former priest who became a farmer, will be the first to try to expel Isabel. He quotes Scripture, and she quotes in reply. He says, “I see, you know, Psalm 65,” she corrects him, “this is Psalm 67,” they are both wrong. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, a former priest who has just committed an exorcism - making the sign of the cross, calling on the name of Christ, using holy water, etc. - says to Jacob that he does not believe in the church, and he does not believe in god. (Maybe he just contradicts each other?) Jacob will recruit him to put on his home garb and try again anyway. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, a former Roman Catholic priest, is baptized in the opposite direction (or in Eastern Orthodox style). As a Hispanic-Roman Catholic who USED to be a priest, he had to cross himself from the forehead to the sternum, from the left side to the right side of the chest. <br /> <br /> I had to read a little side stories to get an idea that Satan spoils the whole family, not just Isabel; but even at the end it was difficult to say for sure whether anyone was really guilty of the images in their heads or it was all demonic deception (with the exception of the sheriff - it is pretty clear that he was guilty). <br /> <br /> On the positive side: Isabelle was CREEPY - in my opinion, it was the best part of the whole movie, and I liked the turnaround with Claire. <br /> <br /> I'm just not sure what the film was. This is serious or fake. <br /> <br /> Listening to the comments of Cameron Daddo and Ethan Willy, I am inclined to believe that it was a joke.
