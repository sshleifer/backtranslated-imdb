I watched this movie last night, and let me say this is the worst thing I've ever seen. The whole movie is a train wreck, and these are not actors. This is a terrible script. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** Well, Eddie loses his job because of the monkey. His nerdy son is disappointed. The bathroom goes crazy. <br /> <br /> He gets a free vacation. He goes along with Uncle Nick and the original Audrey. Their boats crash. They remain on the island. They are stupid and did not even bother to look at a nearby hotel. <br /> <br /> OK, that's all. What makes this film miserable is humor. It's so awful, stupid and stupid that you can't even laugh. And this is also not a silly funny humor. I could not laugh at all this.
