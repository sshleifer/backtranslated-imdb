I usually like these stupid movies without brain activity, but that was too stupid. There were too many cliches, and the plot did not make much sense. There were many loose ends, and the final was very bad and sharp. We didnâ€™t even understand if the big master plan worked. We only saw the main character crying over his dead father, a professor (who died because of stupidity (see below)). <br /> <br /> One scene especially annoyed me. Why did the professor have only about 5 minutes of oxygen in his container when he went to manually block the dam? And if they only had oxygen cylinders with oxygen for 5 minutes, why didn't he bring two or three of them? Then he would have survived ?? it was damn stupid. The film is full of such nonsense. I can't recommend it at all.
