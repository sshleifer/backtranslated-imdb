Not only did the effects and actions in this movie bite, but the story was terrible. <br /> <br /> A scientist discovers that a fragment of a comet will hit the moon ... world leaders ignore him ... he creates shelter ... then everyone gets upset that he "plays God." <br /> <br /> How stupid! He built a thing, why everyone "has the right" to access? Absolutely sucks story, do not waste your time!
