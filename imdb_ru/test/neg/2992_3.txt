It seems there are many fans of this film, but I found it boring, slow, winding and meaningless. And I watch and enjoy a lot of art houses and independent films, so I did not expect an action movie. I did not sympathize with any of the characters. The guy from the countryside was a bad guest and didnâ€™t seem to be trying hard to find a job, and his relative in Istanbul was emotionally closed and without a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> In an interview on DVD, the director says that the film tells about a typical situation in Turkey - a person who is leaving for the countryside because he does not have a job, he comes to Istanbul and stays with relatives while trying to find work This in itself is interesting, but the film was not.
