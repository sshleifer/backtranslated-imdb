I spent a lot of time watching all the reviews on this movie. I fully agree with almost all reviewers, saying that Noah's Ark is shit, crap, crap, crap, crap! Do executives in NBC have any class? I feel nauseous for actually watching both parts of this mini-series. The script is so stupid, so meaningless, and yes, completely inaccurate! I can figure out how to make some changes for dramatic purposes, but this film has changed almost everything in history. God himself will have to go through troubles to kill the entire population of the Earth, but for some reason he misses one guy who is swimming around trying to sell something to Noah. Give me a break! And what happened to Noah's sons behaving like Indiana Jones, saving the girls in trouble? If all this is not bad enough, there is a part where God apologizes to Noah and says: “Sorry, Noah, I was wrong.” Newsflash NBC, GOD CAN'T WRONG! This film is the most tasteless and shameful biblical film ever made.
