If you are a pervert who thinks it's “romantic” and it's great to have sex with a woman who is your mother’s genetic equivalent, get pregnant and then have sex with her again after she has an abortion And do not tell her that you have by you, then you will like this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to the fact that the guy is married and has a son at home - this makes him even more disgusting and regrettable, that he does not have a conscience regarding what he does He cannot do his right work, my family, OR Mary. He is a loser. There is nothing romantic or positive about this film - it is vile and incestuous. <br /> <br /> He moves slowly and does not lead to anything during the first half of the film. I could not even finish watching this pathetic excuse for “romance”. I am glad that we have not wasted our money in the cinema for this. 0/10
