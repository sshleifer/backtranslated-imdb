This is the film from which I almost came out, and it would have been if my friends had not been with me in the cinema. Usually, even if I don’t like the film, I think it’s still worth watching it to the end. Thus, you can really say that you gave him every chance to redeem yourself. But with The Million Dollar Hotel, it was so terrible that I just wanted this experience to end as quickly as possible. I think that I probably would not have been so disappointed if this film had been shot by a smaller director who I usually didn’t like so much. But from Wenders it was all the more shocking. I know Bono from U2, a good friend of Wenders, who wrote the script for this terrible film, and I wonder why Wenders allowed him to be as much a friend as two. “Stick to your day job, Bono,” is a sentence that is easy to remember when viewing this mess. Frilly, scattered, a jumble of all sorts of modern stereotypes about films, a naive and transparent attempt to seem strange and bold, with the most annoying characters I have ever seen, especially with the leading ones, Jeremy Davis, Milla Jovovich Mel Gibson, none of whom I like usually. The happiest end I could wish for would be dropping a nuclear bomb on their collective heads to get it over with as soon as possible. The good news is that the first five minutes of the film are very good, with an extremely exciting soundtrack from U2. But the first shots of the film make the rest of the film (which has since made an exciting immersion in the nose) even more disappointing, because they promise a cinematic quality that has never been done, even close.
