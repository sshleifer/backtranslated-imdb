The material is bad ... the script is terrible .... at best, mediocre, and the music wire that the scene should report as a blow to the head. <br /> <br /> Give it a miss .... even Yancy Butlers are not hot enough even in semi-naked scenes to save this prank. <br /> <br /> I am amazed that people are delirious to Yancy Butler ..... given what I saw here and in several other things I saw in her, she has no depth or presence to be a star ... and her off-camera behavior will mean that she knows it too. <br /> <br /> Last thing, where was this shot? I do not recognize appearance.
