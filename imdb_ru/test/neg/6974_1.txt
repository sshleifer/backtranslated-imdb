Glen or Glenda was the first attempt by the director of the feature film Edward D. Wood Jr. For this, he chose a topic that was close and dear to his heart ... transvestism, the "art" of a man who wants to dress in women's clothes. To his credit, Wood tried to deal with the theme, which in 1953 was mostly taboo. Unfortunately, Wood had no budget, no knowledge how to make a film. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the prologue of Bela. Lugosi, who has no meaning, then goes on to discover the dead transvestite Glen / Glenda (Daniel Davies, aka Ed Wood). Inspector Warren (Lyle Talbot) with the help of the psychiatrist Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell) is trying to understand why a man wants to live (and die) in this way. <br /> <br /> Glen is engaged to Barbara (Dolores) Fuller) and reluctantly tells her about his obsession. And it's all. We see endless video footage of something from the freeway to soldiers landing on the beach with shots of Wood walking in the same street, dressed as Glen or Glenda, and looking at women's clothes in a shop window with anguish. Poor old Bela, who was unlucky and made friends with Wood, continues to appear throughout history. I'm not 100% sure, but I think that Bela's scenes were added for the meaning of his name after the main part of the film was completed. <br /> <br /> To add to the confusion of Lugosi's narration, Farrell, like Dr. Alton, also provides an off-screen narration. Lugosi goes on to say: "Be careful, beware ... take care of yourself, take care of yourself, as well as gibberish about snakes, snails and puppies' tails." <br /> <br /> The story also concerns a transvestite who successfully performs a sex change operation and tries to explain the difference between this person and Wood’s characters. The sequences of dreams are ridiculous. The wedding episode in which a person dressed as a devil appears is a good example. Wood also gives us an obvious scene of rape with actors (?) Fully dressed, but leaving little to the imagination, risky for 1953. <br /> <br /> This film, along with Wood’s other “classics,” was so bad that they were perceived by the public as a cult classic over the years. For this reason, they have survived to this day.
