Adela is a rebellious teenager with an attitude that she is right and everyone else is wrong. She must be the center of attention and she will behave foolishly to do it. With her attitude, she is sent to the school of charm. <br /> <br /> There she meets the typical characters of modern cinema; nerd, clumsy, stepford housewife and sexual minority. Things happen, and in the end, Adela "learns the lessons." The plot is trying to convey a deeper meaning to the state in which Adela is located, but completely unable to deliver (at least I did not buy it). So what remains is a superficial interaction within the same stereotypes that you have seen in millions of films before. In addition, the director seems to have breast fixation, Adela shows her boobs several times, at least I don’t see that they are related to the story. <br /> <br /> So the film is fine, but if you are like me and you don’t like to watch a teenager in one moment deceive people and make a turn of behavior, which I consider very incredible, think twice before watch.
