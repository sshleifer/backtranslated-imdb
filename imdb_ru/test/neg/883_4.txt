If you read the book before watching a movie, you may be disappointed, as I am. The book was wonderful, and after watching the preview of the film, I was sure that the film would also be great, but I felt that I was watching a movie in which the director and actors did not even read what these characters love. The film is short, and they never make us feel that these people are really in love and feel like lonely friends. Even if the film did not go in the same direction as the book, at least they could have made the romance between the two characters more intense. I think both Diane Lane and Richard Gere were ideal for these two characters, and they have good chemistry, but they just didnâ€™t have a long enough storyline so we can see how they crave each other. The book was a true love story, and I think this film could have been much better.
