With so many horrible fake movies, this is unfortunately a breath of fresh air for the genre. Compared to classics such as Airplane or Naked Gun, this is terrible, but compared to recent scam movies such as Meet the Spartans and Disaster, this is very clever and original. Don't get me wrong, although it was not a very good movie. I laughed a few times, and there are some inspired jokes, but any reference to pop culture does not make sense, like most of the jokes in the film. <br /> <br /> Lambeau Fields (David Koechner) was a bad coach in the past, but now he is back to teach college football, and this time he will do a good job. His wife (Melora Hardin) feels far away from him, and his daughter meets a football player to anger her father. Parodies of various recent films come into play, as well as a multitude of visual jokes and unrestrained stupidity. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the film are jokes that are not based on references to recent films. The fakes of Radio, Rocky, Dodgeball, Friday Light, Invincible, and many other sports films are not in the least ridiculous. These are mostly small jokes that cause laughter, for example, a strange scene of scratching the crotch or a joke with chewing tobacco. These little ridiculous giggles can't carry a film, and after all, it's hard to watch. The last 20 minutes are exhausting to sit around. <br /> <br /> The characters are amazingly designed for a sports movie, but I'm sure the characters were built on clichés from the genre. However, they are not so bad. David Kochner can take the lead in the film. It is a pity that they gave him so much dirty material for work. Matthew Laverens has wonderful comedic moments in the not-always-comedic role of a ballet dancer with his father in dressing up. Karl Weathers completes the set by playing a sports film that is not a party again (not in Rocky ... Happy Gilmore!). In general, this is a silly comedy. Sometimes it’s funny, but more often it’s very annoying and predictable. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 of ****. 90 minutes PG-13 for language, sexual humor and drug addiction.
