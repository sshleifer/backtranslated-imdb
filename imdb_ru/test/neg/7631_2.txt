Unfortunately, in 1995 a lot of good films were released (in particular, Mortal Kombat and Seven), but, unfortunately, there had to be several bombs, and this film really falls into the last category with a boring, predictable storyline and lousy ending. It seems that Antonio Banderas could not find a decent script from the time of “Desperate”, the only remarkable film that he shot. Anyone with the eighth brain could tell from the very beginning who the stalker Demorney was. Her memories of her mother’s death didn’t do anything but confuse the already lifeless story. It is a pity that Dennis Miller was wasted in this film; This piece resembles its frighteningly similar role in the “Network.” <br /> <br /> The tangled finale made me shake my head as I did throughout the film. In addition, any film that depicts animal abuse in any form or form, no matter how fake it looks, automatically gets my thumbs up. <br /> <br /> In short, if you want to enjoy a good thriller, then avoid it at all costs. Never talk to strangers ... especially those who recommend this movie. 2/10
