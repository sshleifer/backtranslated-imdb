I just do not understand why every time someone makes a show about one of the largest metro areas in the country (Houston, Dallas, Austin / San Antonio, etc.), He portrays an ordinary person as a person a debater / cowboy hat, talking to a fighter, no sense in fashion, and driving a truck on the way to the “lounge” or the next hunt, rodeo, skeet or country-style concert. I have never seen a policeman from a small town drive a police truck ... anywhere in Texas. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that this was not done for artistic reasons or because of comedy ... in fact, they are serious and I believe that the average person is too stupid to understand the difference. Bad scenarios and equally bad behavior give it. This show makes stupid shows in the past, such as the Knightrider, look like entertainment programs. At least Nyderyder had a talking car.
