Mario Rakochevich from Europe is the only user who has left a comment so far and highlights the highlights of the film. However, another complex film that can be bought in the UK. I had to go through the "Midnight Video", which has a branch in Sweden. I went to the post office and mailed this and a similar header just for the SKR30 header. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of “aka” depending on when and where it is for sale. the previously purchased “The Bloodthirster leads the dance” (which you will find if you search Imdb in the “people” section and enter “Krista Nell”). The actor playing the count on his private island in the last film had duplicated words From Italian to English, an actor with an unmistakably sad and rather tired sounding voice. I smiled when I heard the same voice, which duplicates the English soundtrack, as a police inspector who investigates the murder of a prostitute killed in a grove in a plot film. My choice, of course, was to see another walk by Christa Nell. <br /> <br /> The film has quite a few minor scenes related to blackmail / extortion, dirty relationships with mothers of girlfriends, motorcycle chase leading to a gang hit, ganggraph “client” friends on a motorcycle, sloppy photography, dressing up transvestites and etc., which give a taste of this film, summarized in the word - SLEAZE, (but artistic deception). Do not do without explaining their "where and why." Personally, I thought that there were too many plots and insufficiently embedded in the main story and the connection of these subordinate characters with the central plot and the development of their on-screen characters. Also, the professional film editor was badly needed, because some scenes seemed to last too long, making their point, so the film seemed to stretch in some places; for example the scene of a dancing transvestite. Krista Nell appears in the same fruit scene with a client, but this is also just a vignette, and I stayed, wanting more from her, the director and the script. <br /> <br /> I like the political incorrectness shown in old films (this is 30 years since its inception), for example, smoking in offices and how some characters react to each other in the office! I would suggest 4/10 as a more realistic rating, and I awarded it as such.
