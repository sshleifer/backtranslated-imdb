This man is the so-called entertainer, who has to resort to profanity, vulgarity and slander to try to make others believe in his talent. I have often seen comics using a bit of each with an effect, but when all you can say is connected with it, itâ€™s a sign of a distorted, drugged mind. It makes me think about where his perverted and fried brain will be abused in a few years. Poor man!!! I admit that I could not watch it all - too stupid for words. The amazing part of this is that someone really believes that he is a philosopher !!! It is not surprising that self-respect and decency are exhausted, and depravity is growing. Could it be that the UFC could be a factor in his dead brain?
