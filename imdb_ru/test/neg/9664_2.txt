I do not think that this is really important for the plot of this film, the main thing that you will notice is the extreme lack of professionalism of the entire production. Action is what you get if you choose people on the street by chance. The sound is really annoying - the first-aid kit closes with all the pleasure of a shot in the ear, while the dialogue is perhaps one fifth louder. The different sounds on the set dominate the soundtrack to a large extent, and the dialogues move back. Thematic music sounds as if it was released by about a quarter, since in large parts of the film there is no music at all. Camera work is best described as a crooked mess, with close-ups, where the average angle would be much better; operators walk around and push the camera in different directions, completely ignoring the framing of any scene; stand. If the operator was a foot taller than the actors, and you end up looking at the crown of each head, well, so be it. Editing is just the work of a butcher; Everything is brought together in the harshest way possible, nothing flows and does not pass in any sense of the word. I do not know whether it was videotaped or, perhaps, on a rented video camera, I tend to think that this was the last one. <br /> <br /> I went through three-quarters of it all, before turning it off, I got so angry because of the poor quality of the products that I could not bear it anymore. Itâ€™s like an audio-visual class project in ninth grade.
