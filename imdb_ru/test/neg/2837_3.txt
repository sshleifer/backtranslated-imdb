... Brian? what the hell were you * when * signed up to do this? <br /> <br /> I recently saw this at a festival, and a howling laugh greeted him. By the time the credits rolled, tears streamed down the faces of many viewers. <br /> <br /> The plot is a clumsy fusion of “E.R.” and “The X-Files”; as cynically aimed at a television audience as possible without a lawsuit. The sequences associated with the abductions are ridiculous — and the production of “floating out of bed” by Yuzna and the screaming plastic aliens of “Screaming Mad George” caused a storm of unbeliever, mocking laughter. <br /> <br /> Lame, camp and stupid. My only hope is that it was an aberration. As good as "Return of the Living Dead 3". <br /> <br /> Steev
