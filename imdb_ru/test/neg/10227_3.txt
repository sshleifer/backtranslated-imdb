This is one of the most non-original cliché films I've ever seen. Even if you didn’t like past movies, “Bad News Bears” and “Mighty Ducks”, they certainly did a better job than this one. From the moment a new teacher greets her class, and they say to her: “Don't worry about us, we all lost”, you can see everything that will be twenty miles from here until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> All the usual suspects are here. In addition to a cheerful teacher, we have a group of what should be good-natured children (they are, of course, insane, yes, but not so cute), a weak-minded sheriff from a small town whom they like to torture, an arrogant head coach the winning team and so on, to nausea. Only Olivia d'Abo as a new teacher shows some sympathy. I have never cared about Steve Guttenberg and his role as a sheriff who changes nothing. Jay O. Sanders is a capable actor, but his character, the trainer-rival, leaves nothing to do with him. Let's hope the next time screenwriter / director Holly Goldberg Sloan comes up with something better.
