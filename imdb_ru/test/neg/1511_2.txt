(As a note, I would like to say that I saw this film in my annual church camp, where the whole youth group laughed at it. I bought it when I saw it on the shelf a year later, at least for humor I happened because of an unsuccessful attempts to make an evangelical film.) <br /> <br /> “Postpone” does not meet the expectations of many movie fans in several different planes. Most of the problems are impersonal action. Regardless of the good cars in the film or the truth in the sacrifice of Christ for you, as the film And the instrument of testimony, “Put it down” is unlikely to deliver. <br /> <br /> Most of the good opinions about films are supported by Christians who agree with the message. While it is easy for a Christian to agree with the set points, the public is unlikely to ever witness life outside the clichés. The fight scene between Ben and his brother is horribly dubbed. And in the subtitles there are at least three glaring typos. <br /> <br /> I urge everyone to watch the film a second time with the director’s comments. It really helps to understand why the film was written the way it was. The director’s views on secular society are almost the opposite of what would satisfy the needs of the moviegoer: he demonstrates a pedantic understanding of non-Christians, as well as some moments of religious conflict; much of the editing, he admits, was hasty, but “satisfactory”; he believed that overused transitions and topics were effective; and was completely pleased with the acting skills. <br /> <br /> He also put in motives of which he was rather proud: -All (read: most) names are significant. Ben Destin = "Been Destined", Gus Pelman = "Man of the Gospel", Nicky D = Nicodemus. - The machine that makes donuts symbolizes circling nothingness, that is, life without Christ. -When Ben drives away on Pete's motorcycle, he crosses his crutches, forming a "cross." <br /> <br /> I do not invent any of this. He scatters such things between words, while street racers and the like “knock their brains out of their weapons,” and how “God controls when you are born and when you die.” Yes, it was not a typo. He really says so. <br /> <br /> I have (some) forgiveness for this film. “Cool Cars” and “Good Communication” don't make Jack to make this movie good. However, the film was shot by a group of non-professionals with a budget of less than 1/100 of “Fasting and Rage”, and the deadline was inexorable. With this in mind, I give him a 2/10 rating, not 1/10, which I think so deeply that she deserves.
