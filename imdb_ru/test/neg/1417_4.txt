I saw this movie show last night. I had high hopes for this, but I was definitely disappointed. Within 5 minutes of opening, Williams is already campaigning for his presidency. And he becomes president in the first 40 minutes. So this whole aspect of the film. The first half hour is fun. Don't get me wrong, the film has its moments. But after the first half hour, there is a turn for the worse. It becomes not a comedy, but a thriller / drama / love story ... which is meaningless. the film goes nowhere and stands still a good 30 minutes. laughter is mixed here and there, but always the funny part is the beginning and only the beginning. At some point, the biggest approval I heard in the audience was when a man in the crowd shouted “Buu” during a very vaguely emotional scene. Williams gives an excellent performance, right at the level of his comedy style. Walken also performs a strong supporting role as soon as he can. I think the one character that is underestimated is Lewis Black. Constantly vulgar and political, it's funny to see him lower the PG-13 rating. In general, I would not pay per view movie. In the end, I saw it for free, and even I was disappointed. The first half hour is solid, and from there everything is down. Not quite fitting into the category, the film understands halfway that it should not have been anything more than a one-hour comedy series. 4.5 / 10
