A rather transparent attempt to withdraw money from the thriving British club scene, “Sorting” is a film that shows promising results in some departments, but does little. A careless thriller plot (which simply unites club sequences), a variable game and a rather ridiculous scenario - all this ceased to be a sorting from the demonstration that director Jovi clearly wanted. <br /> <br /> However, although Jovi is sometimes overly indulgent (especially when using often unsuitable dance music), he does show potential, and the lack of anti-drug messages is extremely refreshing. In general, however, the film is a lost opportunity, and the prospects for a good club film remain somewhere there. Look all the same.
