I am sure that some people will like it, and they will find it powerful or have some kind of personal connection with the characters and the story, but from an objective point of view, this is not very well done. The film is about atypical, fear-suffering adolescents, each of whom plays a different stereotype, forcing us to believe that this is what it means to be a teenager. We can see a bit of life style of every teenager, but the whole project just seemed pretentious to me, whether it was constant pictures of tree branches from a low angle in the wind or black and white interviews with students, there was nothing new or original in this film, and I nothing needed to be seen. Yes, he is dealing with some kind of strong subject matter, and the dramatic scenes play out and act well, but the whole project seems unnecessary, especially when it seems to be an almost exact copy of “Elephant” by Van Santa (one dedicated to suicide, the other is school shooting) . As I said, some people will probably like it, and the director / screenwriter obviously had some kind of inspiration to make this film based on the death of a loved one, so it's good that the film was made with some heart, but I feel that this is incredibly inefficient, and when dealing with material that can be so easily persuaded to do something original with it. I would not recommend this movie.
