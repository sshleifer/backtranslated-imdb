The only thing he can offer is True and Jack’s interesting opposites, their choices and points of view, as well as philosophical questions that he raises. Tru feels that she is helping people who should not die, and Jack feels that they must die, and she is indulging with a plan of fate, or a plan of the universe, or something else. <br /> <br /> But she is obviously capable of changing something, so there’s clearly no such thing as fate in the series’s metaphysics. Jack has no reason to believe that this is so. And very convenient, Tru never asks him the right questions. No one does. Which, obviously, proves that the creators of the series have no answer. <br /> <br /> There is simply no plot! <br /> <br /> Instead, they leave it muddy, to be able to continue the series of boring girlish things, only occasionally interrupted by Tru and Jack rushing against each other towards unknown targets ... /> It turns out that none of this is Youth pop series with this pretend to be something else. <br /> <br /> Your time will be better spent in a dream.
