This film is as bad as it turns out. If you like logic (or lack thereof), for example, National Treasure and bad behavior, then this could be a movie for you. <br /> <br /> Otherwise you will spend time in the sun and your money on beer. <br /> <br /> Actually it looks like a badly thought out promo or demo photo to promote the people involved (for example, actors, special effects, and so on) By chance, they produce a really bad expose of their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> In this case, the film company should be ordered to return money to customers who are not satisfied with the product. <br /> <br /> This is really lousy.
