Worse than a mediocre thriller about a mistreated wife who flees after being indirectly linked to the death of her husband and sister. Deciding to prove that her husband is alive, she follows statewide, her danger increases with each stop. The traditional partners of “good cop” and “bad cop” are chasing her. One is convinced of her innocence, the other is more interested in closing the case and returning home. This pair can often drive a suspect into a corner, but can not catch her in any way. All the major players are found in a remote city in the desert, and the truth begins to unfold with deadly consequences for some. <br /> <br /> Wow! It was a bad movie. Leading acted as if it calmed down. The police could not find the suspect if he or she is at the police station (this happens twice), and everyone else is as one-sided as possible. Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br />
