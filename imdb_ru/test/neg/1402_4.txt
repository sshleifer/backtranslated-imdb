I just finished watching this terribly depressive drama and realized that in the light of such recent dramas, the only ones who can be considered abnormal are those who are least aware that life is nothing more than tragic. I would suggest how disgusting the defeatist and counterproductive this conclusion is, even if attitudes and views similar to those presented in this film are to some extent justified. But instead, I realized that these films made the very definition of a great “tragedy” trivial, when the same boring situations, the same suffocating dysfunctional families and friendship continue to play out, just if they are again and again in some way . an attempt to eradicate the former distortions of family life (most of which existed in the 1950s and earlier, when the aberrations of the personality and character became more and more subtle), instead supplanting them with the “reality” of how things really are. In fact, what we are seeing is no longer dysfunctional, but in fact represents a normal existence and a set of circumstances that really existed all the time, but which we may not have previously known and, thus, ignored or, at least least Denied. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that too many films tried to prove it. And at the same time in almost identical form. When I read the synopsis for the film, I immediately thought of Icestorm. Watching the depressing lifelessness of the Travis family, which seemed to tolerate repeated emotional insults, I immediately recalled "American Beauty." And, in some respects, the interaction between parents and the middle child, Tim, I drew from the "Igby goes down." “Imaginary heroes” can be a new experience, maybe refreshing for an honest portrayal of character, which, as mentioned earlier, is often not allowed in family films (which is silly to think in any case, considering that we were) I have already seen such a relationship in films such as Ordinary People, back in 1980, and which goes even further). But for the sophisticated viewer, these films can not offer anything new. In fact, they have become a rather tired testimony of too many directors who may try to surpass the other in the number of injuries and apathy that they can put together in one family (and here it applies to neighbors and friends). In fact, “Imaginary Heroes”, the latest in this genre (I think there were enough films to accurately declare it a “genre”), absorbs so many disasters and surprises into one family that they will find prizes for a daily talk show host. This is the story of a family that the eldest son, a talented and decorated swimmer, who passionately hated sports, is experiencing suicide. The younger son knew this, the father was stunned and blinded by the desire for competitiveness in his star son. And it is not clear that the mother and sister had a lot of relationships with the young man. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is no less interesting (to some extent, for those who consider this material too depressing after a while). ), and the performances are pretty good, especially Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels. But I very much hope that filmmakers in the future, wanting to add to the commentary wrestling family relationships (which coincidentally or do not always seem to be white suburban families from the upper middle class), intend to offer something new in the form of material and understanding. I should not see any difference (and, therefore, no goal) otherwise.
