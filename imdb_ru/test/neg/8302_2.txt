Well, anyone who wants to see a great work of art should not watch this movie. The refined connoisseur of the cinema, no doubt, will be nauseated by the terrible production values ​​and the kind of observation of the wonderful actor (Joseph Kotten), hungry for money. Mr. Cotten must have really needed the money, or he was too old to realize that the film was crap. The same thing happened with Dana Andrews, who at the end of her career was in an indecent and terrible state. I know that Mr. Andrews is suffering from alcoholism, but why did Cotten make this mess ?! <br /> <br /> As for the plot, this is a remake of the plot of Frankenstein. The first half of the film really looked as if they were making a serious but seriously flawed version of the original Frankenstein story. Then, inexplicably, they introduced the daughter. It was not bad, ... until, of blue, they decided to stop the horror film, but to make a soft core of a pornographic film !! The change was dramatic and strange. It was as if they said, “Well, Mr. Cotten finished his scenes and went home, ... now ladies, ... STRIP!" <br /> <br /> The problem is that at every level the movie is just awful, except for monster makeup. Although it's not so cool, it's still pretty cool. But poor writing, acting and a budget of $ 17.46 conspired to make it a boring and horrible film - so bad that throwing some nudity for perverts should not be enough to tempt anyone to see it.
