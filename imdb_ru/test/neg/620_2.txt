I couldn’t bore me, not only because the acting was terrible, and the tragic story was just a b-film whose plot was entirely devoted to cannibalism, but the fact that I watched a foreign film with subtitles that didn’t bother me but was still duplicated. <br /> <br /> The “special effects” were terrible. When the back of the plane broke away, you can see that the model is hollow, as it “breaks off” in fake snow. Most of the film takes place on the sound stage, which is clearly not real and looks almost like a play, since the "sounds" of snow blow everywhere, but not really. <br /> <br /> “But what will they eat? They have no food, ”one military man says (it’s never clear what this guy is doing or why he’s responsible for this), which I’m sure no one really said and didn’t even think about food as they were concerned if people were alive, not like they would eat. It was just a stupid line, written to indicate that, yes, they would have to eat the corpses in order to survive. <br /> <br /> When they finally decide to eat the bodies, one person finds one body without a shirt, which, despite being in the snow for a long time, is not frozen, although its flesh is very flexible and fresh. He cuts fresh meat from his back, which, again, does not freeze and does not even seem cold, and this scene lasts five minutes. This is where I should have stayed. The Live Alive was a much better movie about trying to survive in a terrible situation, which I am sure the real survivors praised, whereas I cannot imagine that any of them could say anything good about this version. It was just about eating corpses, and everything else was secondary. Avoid.
