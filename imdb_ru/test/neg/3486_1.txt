This film has language, style and attitude down ... plus great trips from Occy (world champion) and the great Jerry Lopez. John Philbin as the Turtle turned off the surf pidgin, and the surfing scenes are still the best. A real classic that can be seen many times. Nia Peeples is a baby, and Laird Hamilton shows the early things that made him the number one extreme surfer in the world.
