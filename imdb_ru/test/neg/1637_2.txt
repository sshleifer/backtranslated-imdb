It was the second MST3K movie I've ever seen, and it still takes place in my heart as one of the most fun and awesome movies you will ever have. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keefe (sp?) in this, uses his fine physique to win another mortgage payment in his condominium. He is tough, wooden and unconvincing, but he still looks like a cool, nice guy, and at least he's photogenic. This is the only decent thing I can say about the film, so I thought that I would immediately remove it from the road. The fact that he starred in the film adds another point to the score and saves him from “1 out of 10”. <br /> <br /> In a particular order, examples of how poorly composed this film is: <br /> <br /> 1) OK, the clone (Mila) Tanya Roberts is looking for “the ends of the earth” to “find Ator which takes 3 minutes of screen time, including the time she spends stumbling, dying from a poisoned arrow in her shoulder (which, I suppose, would slow her down quite a bit). So, Ator heals her, takes his faithful help from Thong and goes back to her castle ... and continues to shoot the next 50 minutes or more of the film, restoring the soil that Mila went through in 3 minutes. How it works??? I know that the fearless team is being persecuted by magical forces, enemies, etc. On the way back, but still ...! <br /> <br /> 2) Apparently, the writer / director felt the need to add “depth” to the film, adding the current debate / Socrates dialogue / game of 20 questions between Zora (mean John Saxon imitator) and the sage Akronas (copycat Richard Harris ). But Joe Damoto obviously got his philosophical education from Hallmark cards, T-shirts and bumper stickers, and he doesn't understand tempo, tempo or rhythm ... and the actors too. (Crow's note during one of these exchanges is the string for my record.) Scenes with these two are drawn in, leading the film to a hopeless halt and killing any impulse or excitement caused by the sword fighting and the search for a heroic trio. <br /> <br /> 3) As soon as Ator arrives at the castle (and is captured), things go even further down the slope. Zor decides to feed a group of women victims, along with Ator and Mila the Snake God, whom he keeps in his basement. This scene had some potential for excitement, so the director immediately killed this potential, instilling in the scene the entire drama of people waiting for their turn at the DMV to pay fines for traffic. Ator embarks on a big battle with the Serpent, which is hardly more convincing than the battle of Bela Lugosi with a rubber octopus puppet in The Monster's Bride. <br /> <br /> 4) The climatic scene, in which Ator invents a hang-glider from the branches and skins of animals, is so obviously stupid that it completely knocks the viewer out of the film and makes you roll on the floor, laugh, until your sides hurt. <br /> <br /> 5) Oh, yes, and the filmmakers decided at the end to include in their cadres an atomic explosion, based on the moral that Ator decided to destroy the “atomic nucleus” of McGuffin, which drives the film, because humanity was "not ready". (“Zzzzip! MESSAGE, COMING !!!”) Just like “Bride Of Monster” again, think about it. All that was needed was an observer who observed: "They interfered in the possession of God." <br /> <br /> 6) For some reason, in the version of the film I saw, homo-erotic credit sequences were introduced and closed, which have absolutely NOTHING to do with anyone or with anything else in the movie. I have no idea where these shots came from, but in fact it is MORE than the film itself. <br /> <br /> Watch this, only if you are a big fan of Miles or you like the way MST3K pierces stuff like this.
