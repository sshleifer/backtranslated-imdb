Bad ambient sound. A lot of shuffling. Too pointless scenes. For example: a guy sees an interesting woman in the lobby. He manages to stay there and watch her under the guise of waiting until the building manager receives the parcel. Says Nothing Looks creepy. More shuffling and other annoying ambient noise. Wait. Wait. Wait. The guy says nothing. A woman looks frightened or at least slightly worried about this and fair. The manager returns with the package. The guy goes to the apartment with the package. <br /> <br /> Another example: the guy and his master are sitting and watching a bad TV. More ambient noise and shuffling. Wait, wait, wait, wait. The guy goes to sleep. If you can watch more of this movie, you can watch it again later and watch TV. <br /> <br /> If you need a story, dialogue, entertainment, or a well-thought film, look elsewhere,
