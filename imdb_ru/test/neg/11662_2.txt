Now I remember the fact that “rake” indie-directors before “Pulp Fiction”. It was David Lynch, right? <br /> <br /> I was hunting for this to see Kyle Sykor. What a waste of perfectly good Bayliss. It was so painful to look at him, as if someone you love is terribly sick, and you can't do anything. <br /> <br /> Almost all the clichés in the book are: desert, psycho, the strange mafia boss Biker, Tracy Walker (who, fortunately, was only in one scene, but I kept expecting him to appear again and say something something strange and deep, like “If a person wants to know where he goes, he has to look where he was” or some kind of garbage made up like this). I have a theory why so much indie is not enough space in the desert. I think this is because they can save money on coverage. <br /> <br /> If you like to feel pain, find this movie and watch it. If you're a Kyle Secor fan, watch Kill Replays on Court TV. If you need a good, freakish road fighter, take a look at Wild At Heart. <br /> <br /> There is a reason nobody has heard about Delusion! My God, what a waste of a good title.
