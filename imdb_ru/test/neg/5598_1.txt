For God's sake, it was done in 2004, what happened to our modern special effects? What happened to our rough around the edges, but still good actors? The actors in this film were incredibly horrible, there was one or two that were not bad, but the rest, thumbs down. Could not listen to poorly written dialogue, I mean, who the hell wrote this script? Please never write again! Special effects? Don't even get me into special effects. Of course, they could come up with better than fully artificial green balls of light in their sockets. Looks so old and .. frankly. Even the simplest thing to look realistic ... her teeth looked so fake and stupid that I almost wiped the tear out of my eyes in annoyance. Well, I can't believe that it was even shown to the public!
