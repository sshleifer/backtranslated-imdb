About twenty years ago, Charles Bukowski was my hero. I blindly accepted the image created by intellectual types and seen in various films. Of course, I have never met the intellectual types that prescribed Bukowski as a hero. They can usually be safely found behind the counter in hipster video stores and music stores. These people barely spoke and, when asked a question, they were usually mocked and nodded in a vague direction. They were useless when it came to finding a particular name, but their shelves were always filled with strange and unique names. To be introduced to a secret hipster club, I believed that I had to get rid of my bourgeois upbringing and support the counterculture. <br /> <br /> My acquaintance with Bukovsky began with the film “Barflay”, the film of the late 80s, starring Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunnaway. I was a fan of Rourke at the time. He also embodied a kind of modern male fantasy antihero, brooding intellectual type. At the time, it appealed to me. Hero Barflay mocked the convention. The tramp of the mid-30s, who lives life without a tie, does not answer anyone, - Oh, and to be recognized as a genius as a hot female literary snob burning the cake. After that, I read Post Office and Hollywood, and later Bukowski took over his experience with the film. Now let me turn to the last movie based on the book Bukowski Factotum, which I read and enjoyed. Bukovsky takes the form of Chinaski in this novel. I often wonder where Bukowski ended and Chinaski began 20 years after Barfly, the fictional film Bukowski is still the same. I watched about an hour of the movie, and I still have to see signs of cracking the facade. That's why Factotum Bukowski was my hero. Chinaski is handsome (played by Matt Dillon). He has clean neat hair, laid, but not on top. When Dillon smokes and writes, he looks cool. Chinaski go from work to work, ignoring and / or fighting with various bosses. He gets two gateways, one of which lives with him, goes out only to return with some consequences. Chinaski is his own person, and we never see his emotions. He is a sterile, one-dimensional, something, archetype of James Dean. Factotum lies to the viewer. He does this by pursuing the idea of ​​a person (writer) without consequences. A poor man who suffers for his art. What could be cooler than this? Now, let's say, in Factotum there are some truths in which events occurred. The public lacks the pain that envelops the existence of Chinaski. Perhaps the meaning of this film and most films is that within 80 minutes we need to escape from a world filled with consequences and pain, and replace it with an antisocial womanizer who smokes, talks, drinks with aloof coolness. One who rejects normal behavior at work and in the family. My hero was the movie Bukowski. A long time ago it would have worked. Then it was easier. Now I still have to claim the title of hero. It is not that simple. Hipster logic and film production of counterculture pictograms offer no solutions or even ask questions.
