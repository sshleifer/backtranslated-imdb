First, separate the story from the movie. The story of the second ongoing war in heaven is good, very good. Religious themed films are not the main choice for many people, but angels in war. I really liked this story, and some of the images provided reinforced it, like a field of angels on thorns ... amazing images. Although the film itself was just bad, I can’t find a reason for the main character - in general there was a priest-cop-cop. The main character too ... there is no reason to be there, the dialogue of the main characters was just empty, he had no meaning, the story could have been well told without them. Now, in some amazing performances, Walken, Stolz and Mortensen shot some wingers, although their scenes were mostly lifeless. <br /> <br /> Another thing I don’t get from this film is why the rituals of Native Americans to cleanse the dark soul. The child who wears it is clearly of American origin, but, apart from the final scenario, there is nothing here that would bind this legacy. The plot concerning the darkest soul, he barely told, strangely, considering that the dark soul is the driving force of the whole premise of the film. A brief history of its original owner (colonel) is briefly touched upon, but not so much as to allow him to understand why it is his soul that is special. <br /> <br /> I cannot find an excuse for scrolling landscape shots in this film as well as several plains around the chimney. I have a feeling that they had a helicopter, and he wanted to make the most of it, since none of the pictures had anything to do with and did not match the mood -> Horror. The film falls into the category of science fiction more than horror. There were no real scenes of shock or intimidation, a little bit of blood and blood, but there was no element of fear. <br /> <br /> So, apart from the three roles played to hell, this film is a big nonsense. Unfortunately, the fool factor outweighs the good acting factor, too many weekend actors.
