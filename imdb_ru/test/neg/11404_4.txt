Since 2002, the Dutch cinema has finally got better again. This film is still part of a school textbook about the bad period of Dutch cinema. <br /> <br /> The story is unnecessarily told in the style of memories. All the “real” sequences established in France are completely redundant and do not add anything to the story, emotions or power. For some reason, European directors often find it necessary to tell the story in a non-chronological order. I never understood why or how attractive it is. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also not the best. It is not always clear where the film is going and what it is trying to tell. The story of a young inexperienced boy who fell in love with a wild young girl who later turns out to be quite psychotic can sound quite good on paper and even shows some parallels with the “fruit of the Turks” by Paul Verhoeven, with whom this film was often compared. before and during its release. However, the end result is far from comparable. The story is not able to capture the right emotions, which is also associated with the unimaginable actions of the actors. The way the story is told makes the film far from always interesting or compelling. After 40 minutes, I lost interest in this film. <br /> <br /> At the time of making the film, Anthony Kamerling and Angela Schief were promising rising stars with great potential and ambition, but with both careers. already almost dried out. Angela Schijf seems to pay more attention to her family than to her career (which is, of course, not bad), while Anthony Kamerling tried to start a career in Hollywood. He never got anything but to play small roles in Renny Harlin's two flops. To be honest, I'm not surprised. It's not that he is a bad actor and, of course, he looks right, but his English, to put it mildly, is not good enough. Just listen to how he speaks English at the beginning of this film and you’ll understand what I mean. They are really good actors, but for some reason this is not seen in this film. This is also probably due to poor dialogue. I still liked Bo van Erven Dorens. He was much criticized, but his game seems very natural. He always keeps the characters next to who he is. <br /> <br /> This is by no means one of the worst films ever made, but I would not recommend it. Bad and uninteresting narration makes this movie bad. <br /> <br /> 4/10
