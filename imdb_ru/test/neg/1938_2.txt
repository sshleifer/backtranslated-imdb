I did not watch every episode of donkeys. It was a bit exciting if nothing else happened. But after watching Jackass # 2, I loved Bam and Dunn. They had a good attitude towards the cinema donkey, so I decided to tune in to Viva-la-Bam. Boy, I was wrong. Seriously, you can create a pair of 2'-graders, give them the same budget, and I’m willing to bet that they can do something more creative on the screen. I mean, come on MTV! At 23, where most people are set up, you give us this garbage. <br /> <br /> Everything seems so forced. You do not know the characters, because there is no relationship at all. You cannot appreciate Bam or Dunn, or anyone for that matter. If there was just a tiny dose of thought. All that we will not forget as soon as the next shot starts. <br /> <br /> They finally manage to create a good shot, and you like what happens. You sit there, just waiting for their reaction, and then some jerk closes the scene with two unsuccessful sentences and a punch. Was it the end for this shot or what, please? If I had been there, I would have been frightened and laughed. Do some crazy things and make my adrenaline pump up, but these guys ... Just silly reactions, written according to the script. <br /> <br /> Yes, they get a few public laughs with cheap rude jokes or giant jokes that I think are such a waste of money. <br /> <br /> Many normal people who were not taken under Jakas’s wing could, in an instant, write a much more ridiculous script. Or hit the visual camera work. Even spontaneous imitators, tough guys without a script, would draw for themselves the best work. MTV can whim display more soothing material. You just need to fire the author of this stupid show. <br /> <br /> Some scenes require a little boldness and therefore 2 stars.
