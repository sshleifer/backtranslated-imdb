In his debut in the feature film "Yellow", Chris Chang Lee tries to illuminate the Hollywood image of Asian Americans, abandoning the stereotypes usually depicted in the main film. However, in this case, Lee commits a much more heinous crime: he exaggerates his own stereotypes of Asian Americans to unbelievable. Result? Terribly one-dimensional characters and an incredibly small script infuriate the actors of excessive action, which ultimately leads to a film that is physically painful to watch. <br /> <br /> Do not be deceived by any of the positive feedback from "Yellow"; each falls into one of two camps. In one corner (for example, right here on imdb.com) you will find Asian Americans who are so excited that an Asian character can be displayed on the screen without thick glasses and a mathematical book that they somehow neglect the idiocy of the end product Lee. On the other hand, you will find film critics who simply suggested that it would be embarrassing to give the Yellow the thorough beating it deserves; after all, this is a sharp Asian-American film, shot by an independent Asian-American director ... yet protected territory. <br /> <br /> Case example: the protagonist Xing Lee (Michael Cheung). Writer / director Lee performs a monumental feat with Sin, editing Yellow in such a way that Sin never appears on the screen unless he frowns or screams. See how Sin is offended by the support of his friends. To frown. Look, it's a sinful walk along the beach and a brood. To frown. (Screaming.) See how Sin closes his father's shop. To frown. Look, urine urinates. To frown. See Sin breath. Frowning. <br /> <br /> Gee, I wonder if Asian-American fear is sinful. You think? I'm not sure. To frown. Scowl. <br /> <br /> Just to be attentive, Lee introduces us to Father Xing, Woon Li (Soon-tek Oh). Throughout the film, while Shin simply frowns or screams, Mr. Lee frowns * and * screams. In fact, this is Woon's main role in “Yellow”: simultaneous frowning and screaming. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Woon - Asian father with a complex of authorities? You think? I'm not sure. To frown. Yell. <br /> <br /> If one-dimensional characters Do not annoy you, his storyline will be. Meet Mina (Mary Chen) and Joe (John Cho), the two characters that exist in this film solely to include a tangential love story that is completely irrelevant to the film. You see, Lee found out at the film school that in every good movie there must be some kind of undercurrent to love, and these two characters allow him to fulfill his commitment. Mina’s and Joey’s terribly insane flirting dialogue consists of single-row insults ending with a kiss: “Blockhead!”; `Stupidhead! '; (eyes meet); (knowing smile); (kisses followed). <br /> <br /> But rest assured, somewhere out there, Xin frowns while it all happens. <br /> <br /> Neither Mina nor Joey make any contribution to the plot of the film does not perplex me as much as Lee’s perseverance in the most beaten movie stamps to fulfill his inconsistencies. And believe me, the flirting episode is just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, we discover that Woon Lee is trying to explain his constant frowning and screaming girlfriend Xing, Teri (Mia Soo). ), in which I am sure that Lee had in mind a sharp moment. What a surprise: when Woon recalls the metaphorical story of his homeland, to illustrate his point of view, he broke free from Reader's Digest, his voice trembles with this special image of his father. The camera shows a mandatory shot of Teri’s trembling hands. We feel the need to roll our eyes, except that we understand that Woon’s explanation makes no sense. But the lack of matter did not prevent Lee from making the film, so why should he shoot this particularly ineffective scene? After all, the world can always use another cliché. <br /> <br /> Well, you say the film can be painful, but at least it * should * be a technical masterpiece - say, “What dreams” I can come. ' Sorry, for technical reasons, Yellow is also disappointing. Editing Lee is clumsy and upsets that little rhythm that exists in the film in general, but I'm sure Lee thought they would seem fashionable. Worse, each frame is either underexposed or overexposed. Although the light meter was invented in 1932, somehow the newfangled technology did not hit the “yellow” set. <br /> <br /> In the light of the absolute lack of a film, second-order actor Bert Bolos, who plays the best role of Sin Friend Alex, performs well. Although Bolos was a bit overzealous, you can't blame him when Lee’s script consists solely of frowns and screams. On the other hand, Bolos's colleagues do not show restraint in reassessing them. <br /> <br /> I haven’t seen such a bad film as Yellow for a very long time. And I sincerely pray that for some time I would not see such a bad film as “Yellow”. Please do not waste it; life is already too short. Thank.
