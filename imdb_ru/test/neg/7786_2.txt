When there is heterosexual dysfunction in the BBC thriller, you know who the killer should be: a homosexual. <br /> <br /> Who killed a sexy teenage blonde (who is also a pathological liar) on his way home from school? Let's see if this can be a mother who (contrary to all common sense) allows her teenage son to make unchecked visits to her father-serial killer behind bars? Could this be a sullen son who was impressed by his fatherâ€™s insane attitude towards women? Could this be the serial killer himself, who seems to be able to manipulate events from behind bars like Hannibal Lecter? Could this be a mom's boyfriend, a teacher at school, whose love affair with a former student led to his wife's suicide? Or could it be the daughter of a boyfriend who makes all the school secrets loose, causing untold suffering? No, this is none of these probable suspects. This is ... Homosexual! <br /> <br /> The only mystery for the viewer is to guess who the homosexual is. Of course, this could be anyone, since the only characteristics of a homosexual are shameful secrecy and a tendency to kill, which otherwise complicate the lives of "normal" people. Homosexual - the invisible root cause of diseases of society; Only when this person is exposed and destroyed can the family be restored, and everything can return to normal ... whatever it is. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, both Gemma Redgrave and Robson Green have now officially expired. The world could have lived beautifully without even seeing one of them on the screen again, but as long as the BBC has roles in the film Unhappy Woman and Misunderstood Man, I think they will return in films like this one.
