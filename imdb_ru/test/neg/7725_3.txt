I saw the first House of the Dead and expected that visiting the root canal would be more pleasant, so when it was not so bad, I was delightfully surprised. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, then I got my hopes that the second one will also be fine ... and I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It seems that I am one of the few who saw this film and considers it bad. <br /> <br /> I don’t know whether to watch it again and force myself to see what all the people who gave good reviews saw, or to wonder if I saw the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> Ed Quinn Ellis and Emmanuel Voigier in the role of Alexandra “The Nightingale” Morgan did a great job in roles that were far below them. They deserve to star in the best movies. <br /> <br /> The special effects were fine, some characters were cute / hateful, and that made them bearable for hours, but for the most part this film was just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I have to ask it, because I found myself asking ALL out loud through the movie ... didn’t anyone know how to close the doors behind them so that the zombies wouldn't just wander around ? Only once did it happen (zombies roam), and I found it a bit comfortable ... soldiers enter the room, open the door wide, pay little attention to the same door, so zombies can simply enter if they feel it is so (with the unfortunate "living things" cornered, without the ability to escape), and yet only once did zombies follow them. <br /> <br /> Nitpicky? Perhaps, but, to be honest ... if I fought for my life, the last thing I would do was enter the room and leave the door wide open so zombies could break in and eat me. <br /> <br /> This is really the only thing that * worried * me throughout the entire film, and just the film was for the most part a bad continuation of the not quite disgusting original.
