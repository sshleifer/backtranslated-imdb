When I borrowed this film, I did not expect a quality presentation, but it was just sad. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting was so incredibly bad that it was impossible to get into this movie if you tried. There is nothing better than to see a child announce things like “Oh, no! My dad is invisible! ”Or“ I wonder what it does? ” in the same monotone with which it would be possible to announce transport councils by radio. There are good actors, but they are wasted on smaller parts. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, although it is quite easy to guess, given that there are not so many real changes to the plot. Lots of holes too. For example, the pope is invisible, and the inventor finds out what part is needed to notice him again. So the boy goes and steals a part from an electronics store. Can't he just ask his father for money? <br /> <br /> This is manifested in the Comedy category, but much of the comedy in this film was rather stupid, like Invisible Dad taking off her clothes and invisible and then almost reappears naked during a meeting or goes covered head all the time. At first funny, but getting old. <br /> <br /> 2/5, because it is watchable, and it is one of those films that are funny in their own way ... like monotonous reading of lines.
