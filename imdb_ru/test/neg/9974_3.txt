This original HBO is pretty simple and pretty dumb. Armand Assante, once again making a poor imitation of Stallone, is Ray Wellman, a former prisoner who had just been released on parole. All he wants is his old friend Lacy, played by young Marcia Gay Harden. Unfortunately for Ray, Lacy has teamed up with the staunch Elliot, played by Sam Neal. Even more complicated is the fact that the old buddies of Ray from Sella want favors, and they kidnap Lacy to make sure they happen. Ray and Elliot unite, despite their mutual dislike. <br /> <br /> What follows is brutal and slow, but Marcia Gay Harden shows us why she will win an Oscar in the future, she is not so full here, but her coarse emotions are Sincerity and some pretty candid nude scenes are almost make it worthy of attention. Nearly. <br /> <br /> Rent “Fever” (there is no name that does not fit the film), if you are a fan of it, otherwise skip it and be grateful that the stars have gone for the best. <br /> <br /> Notice - this is a tough “R” flick for language, violence and nudity.
