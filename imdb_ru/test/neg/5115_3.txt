This film is exactly the same as the film Ridley Scott "Someone Who Watches Me," which is classic. It starred Tom Berenguer, Mimi Rogers and the bad guy from “The Fugitive.” This is a quality film with good leadership and excellent acting. This film is the polar opposite. This is the same story, only without any good game and adding directing television films. I have to say that I like the interaction between Low and the woman. She is hot and their romance is believable on many levels. Unfortunately, this alone cannot save this exact copy of Ridley Scott's classic film. <br /> <br /> Usually trashy television films have a certain redemptive quality that at least makes them available for viewing. I think the value of this film is that Rob Lowe and the main woman have chemistry. So I was able to watch and compare the plot with another high-quality film.
