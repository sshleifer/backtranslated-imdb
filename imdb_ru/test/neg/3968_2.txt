This film was obtained from the mum of my friends who worked in a thrift store. She gave it to us along with many other unknown tapes. The film itself is a little rubbish. There are several remarkable moments that need to be laughed at, for example, when his girlfriend is hammered in, but in general the film is boring. Interestingly, when I saw the “Island” trailer, I could not help but notice the similarities. Could Clonus have been the inspiration for this film? In general, do not worry about watching this movie, as it is boring and boring. We liked it so much when we were 16 years old that we named our group after that. Another sign that this movie is a little wacky is that the footage on the back of the video corps doesn't actually appear in the movie? strange
