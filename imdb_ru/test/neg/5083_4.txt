This is the reward that made me lose all respect for Hugos. <br /> <br /> If such an “outstanding” panel does not see or does not care about the obvious problems of storytelling Battlestar Galactica, then what is their reward worth? The answer is: not so much. <br /> <br /> Award winning shows should be examples of creativity and excellence, none of which is proof in BG, neither in this episode, nor in any other that I have seen. <Br /> <br /> Shooting gray video is not “artistic”, but simply cheap. Shaking the camera is not “creative,” but vomiting and laziness, as it can be. <br /> <br /> All that BG has shown is how corrupt most of the award-winning “academies” are, and how easy it is to buy awards. with a lot of PR money.
