This is supposedly a story in which a RUSSIAN MAN tells a story about his youth. However, you see things like personal computers, email, faxes, etc., that were used at the end of the 20th century and at the beginning of the 21st. <br /> <br /> So, when this guy should tell this story - in 2020. Gee, I wonder how much we advanced then. How about telling us that? <br /> <br /> In addition, there are several legal issues that also have no meaning. In the courtroom, the story falls into the usual cases of unexpected evidence, which is unacceptable in any real court in this country. In addition, the grandmother in most states would have been at least seven years old before she was officially declared dead. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Elmo Shropshire. You are now officially SALE.
