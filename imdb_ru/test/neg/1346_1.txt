This film is not a comedy. It's not even funny in the section “this film is so bad, it's funny”. Rather, it's just bad. Other reviewers mention poor coverage, but beyond that there is an abundance of poor plastic surgery. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, a lot of bad acting talent was wasted because of a bad script and boring direction. The main characters are one-dimensional and boring. (It is difficult to feel sympathy for any of them). It is also difficult to see the four characters as close friends. It seems that this is just a gathering of women pretending to be close. <br /> <br /> I will not list all the problems with this film, as it does not deserve so much attention. (And not worth it to watch it).
