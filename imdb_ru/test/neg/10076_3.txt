To summarize, my group of friends and I spent about 45 minutes outside the theater, sharing our favorite missteps, plot inconsistencies, untied interchanges and other ridiculous aspects of this film. I found that the story is banal to some extent unimportant, and the plot lines were as underdeveloped as dinosaur embryos still locked in a jerry-cream canister from the Jurassic Park 1. Editing was bad and none of the characters caused any either sympathy or feelings. In short, in this film there was not the slightest tension and thrill that was in the first film from the point of view of the plot. <br /> <br /> Even the new dinosaurs were few, and they were far from each other (although I really liked pterodactyls.) We received some brief snapshots of the new species, and only 2 were actually involved in the action. <br /> <br /> As a scientist and former paleontologist of childhood, the absence of any real scientific content (not that it was realistic, but logically, that is how they built dinosaurs in No. 1 and the chaos of Balkom Malcom) too disappointing. <br /> <br /> In short, the film seemed to be nothing more than a pretext for throwing dinosaurs back onto the stage to make some money. I hope that movie lovers will not fall into this trap again (although, apparently, I did it)
