I watched this movie at the party, we were very puzzled by the finale, it ended up pretty bad. although the whole movie is not too amazing, I was expecting something a bit better. This film is pure trash, but I advise you to watch it if you find cheap horror films with a weak script quite funny. Personally, I liked the advertisement, it was my main highlight, the battle scenes were simple, a knife shot, some shadows in the window, fake blood. I have to say that the grandmother's costume was pretty scary, this film is a mixture of killing joy, camp blood and waterlogged creek 2, except that this film has a slightly better camera and color reproduction compared to lager blood.
