This relatively obscure Hong Kong “minor” is the perfect film about a desert island for video-age-peeping volumes (at least its first half is as follows). Each decoration, each scene, each sequence is a reason to look at the girl’s skirt, look at her breasts, look at her bottom and look at her narrow crotch. Of course, he establishes the perverse tendencies of the main character (!) <br /> <br /> The resistant genre Anthony Wong is a marginal perverted married man suffering from erotic dreams and outrageous fantasies. All of them include poorly dressed, sexy Chinese ladies who have only sexual slavery on their minds. <br /> <br /> The plot is thickened with a murderous plot, a voodoo doll skewer and some rape and robbery. <br /> <br /> Some sex scenes are quite hot, and the blood is liberal, but the supernatural elements, introduced in the second half, seem to be unfinished, and the plot plots are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the producer of bright garbage, Wong Jing, was in a great hurry to get it to and from cinemas. <br /> <br /> This episode with a mysterious title did not deceive this exhausted player.
