I’m sure I counted hundreds before I gave up and started watching the movie again. <br /> <br /> Secondly, what the hell is with these blue monkeys? So, the Dansen family led a very personal life and had one brown eyes and one blue eye, but since when does this turn people into underground carnivorous blue zombie creatures? <br /> <br /> and finally “Old believers here will protect me hahaha :)
