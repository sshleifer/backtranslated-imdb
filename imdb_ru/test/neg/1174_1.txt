I would not want anyone to watch this film “inspired by a real story” and draw any conclusions about the true event. The few things they did right were overshadowed by things that were simply not true. Ed Gein never dragged anyone behind the car, never met someone at the cemetery or killed them, no evidence that he returned body parts to the cemetery. What he did was horrible enough, why try to make it worse? <br /> <br /> This film is one of my 10 most terrible types of eye strain. "In the light of the moon" is a much better film on this subject, it is more actual, and the action surpasses it.
