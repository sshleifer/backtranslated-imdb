It was (stupid) with some degree of pleasure that I sat down to see what a friend had promised, it would be the worst / best film in my life, the mighty "Movie 7". 2 years have passed, and I am still on therapy. Oh yes, my dear friends, this is really what is bad. They obviously got about 40 minutes of footage in a jar, and then decided to use these footage infinitely and repeatedly for a stunning effect. My only fear of the post-apocalyptic world represented in this turkey is that somehow the imprint of this abomination will survive. Truly the living will envy the dead.
