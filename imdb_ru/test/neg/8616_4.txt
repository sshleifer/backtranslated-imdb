This is a continuation of John Carpenter’s The Vampires movie, dedicated only to the title, happening in Thailand and includes a group of bad vampires who like to kill people, and a group of good vampires who don’t. Although an interesting idea to make a film about vampires in Thailand, the writers seem to be doing little with exotic language. This film could also have been easily made in Los Angeles. This brings me to the next point: it looks like Blade Lite. We have a rock soundtrack, battle scenes of martial arts, bloodshed in the dance club and, of course, a lot of sharp objects passing through the vampires. What we do not have is budget and talent. Yes, the hero is a good martial arts fighter, too bad that his acting was not so good, and there is a lot of decent wire work, and a lot of lively combat sequences, maybe too much. The problem is that they simply do not have the same effect as in Blade movies. Perhaps it’s just "the film was visible there." <br /> <br /> However, for me the biggest problem was that the filmmakers did not find enough time to establish the relationship between the lead by the buff and the polite Colin Egglesfield and his girlfriend. She was kidnapped at the very beginning of the film after a whiny exchange with her boyfriend. At the moment we are not interested in her well-being and we have no reason to believe that her boyfriend is willing to risk his neck to save her. Now this is the main drawback when it is the main point of the plot. <br /> <br /> In the end, you could have done worse than wasting 85 minutes of your time on it, but I can come up with much better things to do with my time, like renting any of the Blade movies.
