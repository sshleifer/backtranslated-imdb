“Heart of Darkness” Review of the film “Heart of Darkness” by Joseph Conrad is rather dark, deep and very deep. I have to say that reading the novel is much better than the movie. The character Mr. Kurtz, played by John Malkowick, was absolutely not the actor who played this role. It fits the character in Mice and Men. The film skipped the key points that I consider important to get the true meaning of the story. <br /> <br /> The film is badly edited. It shows a lot of unimportant and annoying flashes. In the novel, he has a very tense atmosphere, but in the film there is no such feeling. The book has so much that is left to the reader’s imagination. For example, when Marlowe spent endless hours and days waiting for rivets, and the whole scene was excluded from the film. In Marlowe's novel, he waited a long time for the rivets to come in to repair the boat. It was a great source of uselessness in the novel. More parts were added to the film that were useless and had no meaning. For example, when Kurtz spoke to Marlow at the end of the book, and Kurtz snapped a monkey neck and killed him. This kind of just ruined everything, it didn't make any sense to me that ever. Therefore, I suggest that you do not watch the movie, but just read the book. You will understand more and better understand the story. <br /> <br /> ~ Chris K.
