To be honest, the only reason I took this film from Blockbuster was because Aaron Carter was in it. Well, first thing first. Do you notice how ugly Aaron Carter has become ?? I mean, he was so cute, but now .. with this lanky body and patchy skin - EW. I think he should continue to sing, and the filmmakers could find a much better looking guy who could keep his lips in sync. No offense, though. I thought this teenage movie was basically lame - and it comes from me when I myself was a teenager. The "mean girls" are extremely predictable there, the acting is so amateurish that it sometimes makes you cringe (especially from Aaron), and in general I just didnâ€™t like it. Although I give points for the storyline - everything was in order, but not at all realistic. In any case, stay away from this film, by all means, unless you have bundles of cash and you have absolutely nothing better than 94 minutes of your time. It is not worth $ 6.50 !! <br /> <br /> (P.S.; this my review may not be applicable to children under 13 years old!)
