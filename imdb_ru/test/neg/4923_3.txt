The fact that the film is on DVD does not guarantee that its quality is very good. The fact that the quality of the film is worn does not mean that you should not buy it. This review actually refers to two films paired on one DVD. <br /> <br /> The plots of these films do not matter much. They are of interest only to people who collect Holmes films ?? Would anybody who just want to get some of the best deals would have succeeded if they had bought some of them made by Jeremy Brett? or, in extreme cases, Vasily Rathbone. There are several other very good Holmes films featuring good actors at a time ?? for example, “Seven Percent Solution” or “The Privacy of Sherlock Holmes”. In any case, these films are much less worthy of evaluation. <br /> <br /> Here we have a couple of films featuring the best actors who have played Holmes, even if the results are disappointing. It seems that this is the only disc with these films (although the Lethal Necklace) appears in the same version on other discs. <br /> <br /> "(Sherlock Holmes and) Lethal Necklace" dates from 1962, although it does not look and does not sound. Some who have seen this may be surprised to learn that it was made by Hammer Studios. Not that Hummer didn’t really work like hell, but as far as Christopher Lee was concerned, they usually did better. Print direct transfer of a rather shabby 1: 1.33 copies in black and white. The color quality suggests that the original may have been colored, and the severed ends of the film aspect suggest that it could initially have been 1: 1.66 or more. <br /> <br /> The film is set at the beginning of the 20th Century ?? it is possible that Holmes was still working then (and in fact did not die until 1957). However, the script is not adapted from any true Doyle story. It includes an Egyptian necklace, and Professor Moriarty appears as a world famous archeologist, as well as a prince of crime. The plot is melodramatic and banal. <br /> <br /> The biggest disadvantage of this film is that ?? for some incomprehensible reason ?? Hammer filmed this in Germany. It was nevertheless filmed in English. It was then rewritten in German, and then renamed in English. So what you hear is not about Lee and other actors, but about a group of unknowns ?? not that outside of Lee, I doubted that anyone would recognize any of the other actors. This is very bad, since Lee (see His “Hound of the Baskervilles”) makes quite a decent Holmes. In fact, his double voice is indulgent and simple, like bread pudding without raisins or cinnamon. <br /> <br /> The music for this film is mainly jazz, in a possible attempt to become a “period”. It is a pity that no one thought about ragtime. As such, music is not related to what is happening on the screen, and is often at odds with the action. <br /> <br /> Another film - “(Sherlock Holmes and) Specland Band” of 1931 starring the young Raymond Massey. The quality of the image and sound is fully consistent with the level of effort of 1962, and in fact a bit better. Messi makes a fairly respectable Holmes, although he certainly does not own a role like Rathbone and Brett. Other tragedians who take part in this production are unlikely to be of interest to modern readers. Actions ?? how true for many films of this period ?? owes much to the post-Victorian scene and silent films. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that, although the Death Necklace is available on DVD, the Speckle Band is available only with a former film. <br /> <br /> There is still little to say about this movie. The settings seem like a strange combination of the 1890s (horse-drawn carriages) and the 1920s (electronic devices such as a primitive voice recorder). In general, this is an interesting surprise and a sufficient incentive to buy a DVD with pairing, and not a DVD with the Death Necklace alone.
