Wow, God, I don't even know where to start commenting on what they called the movie. I seriously don’t know what the hell David Bradley started smoking after creating Difficult Justice, which I thought was a pretty good movie after the American Ninjas. I haven't seen any of this guy's latest films since Cyborg Cop. Fortunately, I saw them on Amazon for about 5 pounds each, and I can safely say the following: if I threw 5 pounds to the wind, which I spent on Total Reality, crisis and waiting for death, I would be happier than needing Sit 90 minutes that lasted each of them. My God, how can HECK label anybody as "movies" ??? And why are martial arts / martial arts actors knee-deep in the most pungent horse dung when they reached their peak? I mean, David Bradley is not Oscar, but his first films were quite interesting. Cool, cool guy with a pretty good martial art, who put the banal lines, but at least entertained fans of militants and militants to a certain extent. But I would really like to know what happened in this guy's head after “Difficult Justice”. His last 3 films, frankly, must be PEACE that I had to worry about. As I mentioned earlier, I would like to get my money back on the 3 DVDs I bought. The crisis was the epitome of sleepiness, “Total Reality” was harsh, but “Waiting for Death” is just complete nonsense. I bet the director was either mega-petrified when he did it, or he just shot urine from every David Bradley fan who sat in that pile of crap. The plot revolves around the doctor (Bradley), who is developing some kind of Virtual Reality game in which he simply kills different people one by one. Sorry, but I just could not take this guy seriously, playing the villain with this chic hairstyle, glasses and gray pants, and he is absolutely ANY physical fight (to be honest, his best asset). The film is even worse than any of these Saturday B-films, because the acting is ridiculous, the direction is terrible, and several fights in the film, well, what can I say ... The actors look like they are training with their buddy in the gym. We have a dumb muscular cop who starts showing his combat stuff about an hour later in the film and fails ... the French hairy version of Van Damme, who just can't fight, act or talk to save his damn life and Bradley, the alleged main a hero playing an evil doctor for whom I was really happy when he stopped doing this type of unnecessary garbage. I even think that he did not throw a punch in this film, probably due to the fact that his heart condition had already let him down. For the BBC actor, I have to admit that I really liked this guy, his style, build, fighting skills ... But I am very, very glad that he stopped acting after this monster, because I honestly , could not sit another ninety minutes of similar material. Avoid at all costs, even if you are a David Bradley family, you will be glad you did, in short.
