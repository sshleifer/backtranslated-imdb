As an early conception of the turmoil of the 1960s, Diane Arbus (Nicole Kidman) can be justified as a child of an early flower. The film itself does not deserve such breadth. The lack of character development, motivation and justification for the character's behavior makes the film very disappointing. I sat and watched in anticipation of some explanation of strange actions, but found that Sheinberg allowed me to look into a story that must have been someone in a joke. The fact that several of the facts presented were not very consistent with the life of Diane Arbus did not help clarify the situation either. <br /> <br /> The blurred “Art Guide” in Dian’s “normal” life was pleasant to contrast with the bright colors of her “awakening” of life with Lionel. And the staircase with the hatch was a good demonstration of Diana’s attempt to introduce her new life into her existing family (however, I don’t see how this hatch in the ceiling of her dining room could directly connect to Lionel’s apartment, which was two flights of stairs from her). <br /> <br /> Perhaps my analysis is too literal in seeking development of a character and understanding of relationships that goes beyond one sentence or one comment. I would also like to see at least one of the photos of Diana. I will not wait to continue.
