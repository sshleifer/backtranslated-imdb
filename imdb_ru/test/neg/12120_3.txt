Most of the positive comments posted here are as verbose as the movie! It is assumed that in order to evaluate a verbose and boring film, you need a boring occupation. Some simply call the film "contemplative", which means slow and devoid of plot, however, one Dutch reviewer hit the nail: this important event turned into a boring film, the tone of which is set in the very first scene. Here, a young couple shows an apartment to an estate agent, who, as expected, speaks without a break and no matter what else is going on. The same can be said about every other character! <br /> <br /> The only silence in this picture is a sequence of dreams - fragments of Soviet propaganda of the 1930s, and they are also its most interesting parts. It tells you something about how watchable the rest of the movie is. <br /> <br /> The device for shooting most of the scenes in extreme close-ups — as if you were looking through a crack in the blinds — is aging quickly.
