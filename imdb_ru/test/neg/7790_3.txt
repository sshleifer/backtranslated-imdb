I once talked to my parents, who told me that British cinematographers checked the country of origin of the film in the 1940s and '50s before watching it. It doesn't matter what the plot was or who was in it, if it was an American film, people would want to watch it, and if it was the British people, he would not want to see it. This may sound like a ridiculous generalization, but after watching “A HOLDING HEART,” I can understand why people in those days preferred American cinema rather than homely variety. it shows in this film. Everyone speaks English, which makes the British royal family look like working class scumbags, and it pushes away most of the potential British audience, who would certainly prefer to watch Jimmy Cagney in WHITE HEAT, because people would not this, of course, cinematographically sympathized with the cruel gangster more than any high-class English in 1949. This is entertainment, the reason people go to the cinema. Even the names of the characters seem strange - Leonora! How many Britons called Leonora in 1949? And the main characters drink cocktails. And they use words like "strict." You feel that it was not for sale to the mainstream British audience in 1949. But why do this if the majority of British moviegoers are queuing up in cinemas to see much more interesting American imports? <br /> <br /> Watching ATSONISHED HEART in 2005, I was surprised at how outdated everything was, in fact, so outdated that I thought it might be a fake from the Harry Hard And Endfield show. What did not surprise me was the fact that these types of films approached the drowning of the British film industry, an industry that did not gain momentum until American money was invested in people like ZULU, ALFIE and James Bond films.
