The disappointing comedy-drama with a sentimental covering made Michael J. Fox ideally play a former children's star who now runs a talent agency for teenage children Nathan Lane and Cindy Lauper, his assistants. It all sounds like it can't be missed, but too much of the script is transmitted by bright Christine Vidal as a street guy who Fox thinks will be the next big thing. They quickly block heads, and a joking dialogue leads them back and forth to an uninteresting conclusion to the formula. Fox and Lane are both attractive, but the energy of the early scenes gives way to molasses. Lightly produced, but ultimately stale. * 1/2 of ****
