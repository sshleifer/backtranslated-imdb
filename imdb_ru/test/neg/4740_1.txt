This film made me watch Paul VS Anderson's AvP1 and enjoy! I'm not even going to dream of comparing Requiem with any films from the Alien or Predator series, this is a HORRIBLE TEENAGE FOR TEENAGERS OF TEENS IN THE US LITTLE CITY, NO ANY CARE. at least in the films heaps of handicrafts were cut out, there were bags of sweets in it that were not in any of the original films before, but it was spoiled by unconvincing characters / actors. <br /> <br /> Requiem feels bad to act to the lowest level imaginable, and he also lacks in every other department ... it's blasphemy to include alien and predator suits in this type of garbage.
