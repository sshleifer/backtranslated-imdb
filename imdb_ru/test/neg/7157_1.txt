Contain spoilers! These guys are a complete scam, they made "The Lost Scrolls of Judas," saying that Judas was a great friend of Jesus ... And now this? This is clearly an attempt to destroy religion, and it must be illegal. They have no evidence, it can be clearly a setup. How can we know and trust these people? What if they cut the tomb and "said so"? And in the end they seal the tomb forever so that no one can go there to explore? How stupid do they think we really are? Should we believe that they are trustworthy people? Who really found the tomb of Jesus? And how can you strike all Christians like this? I think this documentary should never be made a non-religious person. This can be done ONLY by a Christian, and I mean DIRECTION AND LETTER. It should be illegal for Jews to make a documentary film related to Christians, especially if the documentary film accuses Jesus of not being the “Son of God Risen” (nothing against that, they can be Buddhists or atheists, anyone except Catholics). /> <br /> For me, this is a complete deception, a clean documentary scam. They sealed the tomb so that people would not “think” about checking things. This documentary is a complete failure, how stupid do they consider Christian people? What about the Lost Pages of Judas ... it was also a complete scam, they said seriously at the end, something like: "We know several people who could make fake scrolls like these, and no one would know it was a fake "... My God, they just said it ..." Dude, we could do it "... This documentary should be illegal, this is a blow to all Christians and Catholics, behind which they should be behind the bars !! I am not a fanatic, I am a former Jew, now an atheist, but I have the valor and I will always respect the religion of others her. That, when Israel orders permanently seal the tomb was PRECIOUS PRECIOUS !! !!
