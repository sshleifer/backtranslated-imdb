Starting from where the last AVP stopped, the "dead predator" of aliens emerges from the dead "Predator" on the Predator spacecraft and forces the Predator spaceship to crash into modern Gunnison, Colorado, where it multiplies by several other aliens who start to cause chaos. The Predator Race sends a lonely, highly skilled and armed Predator to “restore order”. Our human characters are at the center of an intergalactic battle. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem in this film is the tempo. This movie is moving too fast. The opening credits just fell out, and already the ship Predator crashes into the Earth after the Alien reaches full height, the hunter and the son appear, but before we know their names, they are both killed, then we see the Predator Homeworld and the main Predator flies away, to fight alien infection, and it all happens within the first five minutes. This unnatural pace haunts the whole movie; The National Guard enters the city, but within two minutes everyone is killed, not even looking at a single person, the pizzeria manager gets one character development scene that can only be killed the next time we see him once again, without even knowing how his name is, random vagrants, a waitress and a cook in a cafe are being killed again, without recognizing their names. In an instant, our main characters are at home, the next run through the city, the next in an arms shop, the next in an armored personnel carrier, and this random set jumping over and over again simply never gives peace of mind to the audience, not calming down leaving them to cling to a straw. <br /> <br /> Another problem is settings and time frames. The film takes place on the modern day of Gunnison, Colorado. All other films "Aliens and Predators" were filmed in exciting conditions, such as industrial spaceships, tropical forests of a partisan war zone, alien planets and underground labyrinths. Now comes the AVP-R, located in a small modern American town, with many "highlights", including a sporting goods store, parking, pizzerias and bedrooms for little girls. I mean, did they really try to make the film as boring, drab and uninteresting as possible ?! It is difficult to see these monsters as frightening creatures when they stand next to a shelf full of Reeboks, or hide in the bushes behind the bedrooms of little girls. <br /> <br /> Continuity is a big problem in this film. The series "Aliens" began in the future. Not a single person had even heard of the Alien before the first film, and the Aliens had not only never been on Earth, but if they ever reached the Earth, humanity would be destroyed. This film destroys this whole concept, being established in the modern era, when “Average Joe” sees newcomers everywhere, and by the end of the film humanity is not destroyed, not even suffering from what can be considered minor losses. It infuriates the whole concept of other films. Attempts to maintain continuity are undertaken with the help of a huge Deus Ex Machina. It happens that Predator carries with it a bottle of an unlimited amount of magical blue liquid that just melts any bodies with one drop, and the army at the end of the film turns out to be taking excessive drastic measures and dumping the nuclear warhead, which simply conveniently erases all evidence of aliens, despite the fact that there were many survivors who are witnesses, and many more unsuccessful attempts are made to fill it is impossible to close the gaps in the conspiracy. <br /> <br /> In addition, for the film "Poems" has an unrelenting bias in favor of the Predators. For most of the movie, the lonely Predator succeeds in killing dozens, if not dozens of aliens, all in a shallow radius of action, barely taking a single scratch, while the aliens are simply killed from left to right and in the center like clay pigeons, just waiting for them to be killed by a Predator without making any effort to protect yourself. This film should not be called “Alien vs. Predator”, but should be called “Killing Predators”. I mean, how can two species struggle with tension and tension, when one is portrayed as far superior to the other? <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are some of the biggest flaws. They not only fade in comparison with the characters from previous films about Aliens and Predators, but even as a separate film, they are boring, dreary and even sometimes unworthy. The characters in this film consist of: “I'm not kidding,” horny couples who want to be laid, boys delivering pizza, bimbo blondes, hooligans in high school, children, and frank work on copying and pasting, ripping off Ripley and Newt; worst and most clichés of possible ideas for characters. Not only this, but all of the above characters act as teenagers. Although casting adolescents is an obvious attempt to entice a younger audience, its only effect is to make the movie look and feel like a typical teenager with actors who are too young to learn to give convincing performance with them, mostly with completely empty ones. facial expressions that provide a monotonous dialogue. Not only that, but these characters do some of the most cinematically backward things, such as using Predator weapons, commenting on powers, when it was for several hours, following stupid plans to get out of the city, and not just get out of the city a little quickly, and so many other stupid things, the film actually made the audience in my theater sigh from disappointment. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film is just a terrible movie “B”, something deserving of direct transfer to the DVD category. The fact that this film was a theatrical release surprises me, as each part of the film just takes an amateur job.
