If you're in the mood for laughing at a really bad movie (bad in the sense that only Ken Russell is at worst), you should try this one. He managed to make you feel like you just landed in a .25 porn booth, and you can just smell urine on the field. Kathleen Turner is having fun in a bright wig, enjoying the "pretense" that she is a double prostitute (she has really good solid work in the clothing industry and has suffered so much from men that this is the only way she can connect) and Tony Perkins plays a hysterical "priest" who can kill her (another film in which Tony Perkins ends with a dredge). Annie Potts appears, and she is not given a single gram of her ordinary mind, which is reason enough to hate this film. A pervert likes sex scenes, so rent a version without a rating in the RED box so you can see how Turner tastes the policeman for his Billy club (I had to stop the VCR before we stopped laughing).
