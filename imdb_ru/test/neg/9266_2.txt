My grandfather gave me this DVD. With friends like these. The front cover looked pretty scary, even though I watch it. What a bloody mistake. <br /> <br /> In essence, the film tells about three people on the bus and what happens to them with friends. <br /> <br /> The first story is about a guy who buys a car that talks to him. The second tells about a guy who wakes up to find a clone of cassarola in his fridge. And the third is about a woman who is engaged in online dating, but it turns out that he has a robotic arm. <br /> <br /> The DVD player rated this movie at 18, but even a 5-year-old child can watch it and not be frightened to have fun. The film should be rated at 12 points for minor scares and curses.
