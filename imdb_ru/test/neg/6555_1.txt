I told my friend about the time when my grandfather actually chose this terrible piece of shit so that we once saw him in the theater. He never chose another one! It was so bad! Anyway, a friend of mine then told me that her father made some notes for this garbage. I thought she was joking. It turns out she was serious. In fact, she had never seen this, and she said that this quickly stopped her father’s writing career. I told her not to waste her time. But, if she really broke down and looked at it, she would see at the first minute why this ended her father’s days as a writer. I mean, even for the 1980s, this shit is poorly described. I mean, Joe Frazier as the Terrible Tucker? And why in the world are two policemen taking care of a house full of ghosts? A movie poster? Ghost with tongue sticking out? What is it about? Nothing makes sense. Well, I told my girlfriend that this shit not only put an end to her father's writing career, but also put an end to the careers of everyone involved. Or, at least, none of them have ever fully recovered from being in this trash of the film. Let's just say that I’ll make fun of my girlfriend forever because she revealed to me that her father was the author of this film! This alone must tell how bad it is!
