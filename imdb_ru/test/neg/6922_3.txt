Seeing that this film got a theatrical performance anywhere in the world, it only serves as a reminder of the career of those worthless ladies like Denise Richards and Milla Jovovich. It is also a special film that seems smart, funny and original, although it is poor in all aspects. Full blame can go to Brian Burns, who wrote and directed this action movie. His script takes a completely unoriginal situation and is not going anywhere. Situations develop completely without any internal logic, except a desperate screenwriter. Characters are thinner than cardboard cuts, behaving foolishly and without any real motivation. Nowhere is this more obvious than with the inclusion of Mrs. Richards. We do not believe that her relationship with the character of David Krumholz for one minute and how her return to the game after the hour mark is especially pathetic. Why would anyone fall for an egocentric, obsessive, arrogant b ** ca, like this, first, and especially the second time? Especially after having allegedly found him ... his ... true love? And if any of these things are not enough to completely sink this film than the central couple. The connection between Krumholtz and Jovovich is only slightly more believable or developed than Richards-one, but it is useless. There is no chemistry, there is no spark, there is nothing that we could take for a believable pair. Worse, these two main characters are especially annoying and annoying, doing annoying and annoying things in which the viewer is finally not interested. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very bad show. Even die-hard rom-com fans might want to skip this one, as there are dozens of movies shot with great skill or great charm.
