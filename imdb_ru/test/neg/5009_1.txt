Candy strangers outplayed in all the wrong contexts, situations arenâ€™t ridiculous with foolish voices and a bad time with a low eyebrow comedy game, an obvious attempt at dry / black / dark humor is obvious, and she is not able to convey all the elements of a good joke. <br /> <br /> With a high deterrent and a low coefficient of laughter, I was shocked, this show went through the first season, I personally like Scrubs, The Office, 30 Rock, Trailer Park Boys, Pulling, Peep Show, The Simpsons, Family Guy and I know that you think these shows are not at all strange, so I saw some more good shows: Jam, The Darkplace, Garth Marengi, The Book Group, Asylum and Snuff Box, which are original with dry / black / dark humor / satire and all of them at least 5/10. <br /> <br /> The dark place of Garth Marengi looks especially cheap, replays and strange, but the context is thought out and works to make it really there and entertaining too.
