This film not only disappointed the horror / suspense lover, but everyone who saw it. Wow. I thought this movie could be funny, because a guy with a huge head. However, he was filled with a long and protracted conversation that was not needed. There was so much sex that I now hate women and men. This film was not only boring, but there was no substance. Wow. Wow. In addition, each scene looks as if it is lit by one light bulb, and I think they used the same set for two different lawyers, a restaurant and an airport. This film is not for a movie lover who loves bad movies, because, after all, it looks like lost time. Watch the movie! <br /> <br /> - party
