These films shocked my will to live, why this abomination is not included in the list of the 100 best, which I do not know. <br /> <br /> My life was saved by the healing power of Danny Trejo. <br /> <br /> Worst movie ever, I dare you to watch. It's like a 90-minute commercial, only much worse. I rather watch the blue screen it is so bad in fact
