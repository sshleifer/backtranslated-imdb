I've always been a fan of Bottom, collecting as many videos about the show as possible here in the states. The chemistry between Rick and Ada is always brilliant, and the combination of clever writing and completely stupid humor seems to work without a glitch. So I sat down with great zeal to watch this film ... and was very disappointed with its end. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 of the film can best be called boring and ill-directed (sorry, Hell!), but with some absolutely brilliant moments. Unfortunately, these ludicrous moments make you realize how witty the rest of the film is. The blind begins to be funny, but in the end it gets a bit boring, only with perverse sexual jokes to keep things humorous. <br /> <br /> The end of the film (the “green” scenes for those of you who saw it) was ... perhaps the worst end I have seen in the last decade. Fair. It was one joke, repeated about thirty times, followed by a sudden ending, which made no sense (which did not bother me) and was not funny (what happened). <br /> <br /> To summarize, I was very disappointed with this film. I will cling to a few brilliant moments in this in order to preserve the warmest memories that I can ... but I must warn you if you are going to overpay for a NTSC conversion tape from a local importer, do not. There is much better to spend money.
