One of the many silent comedies in which Stan Lorel participated was before he teamed up with Oliver Hardy, “Mud and Sand” - Hochumsky Hochum. The story is very fragmented - although this may be due to the modern edition - and the humor itself is not at all inventive. <br /> <br /> Potential storylines begin and are ignored; for example, Stan’s promise to force Filet de Sole to pay for what she did to him is never fulfilled. Stan’s character doesn’t seem to be too centered, but this is the usual criticism of his work before he developed the Stanley fame of Laurel and Hardy, so maybe I just expected to see this flaw. <br /> <br /> I firmly believe that all silent films should be stored and viewed, and I am glad that this film is still available. It's just not a good movie.
