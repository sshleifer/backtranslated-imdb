This is almost all I can say about this flat and boring remake of a 1979 Carol Kane car. Camilla Belle is not an actress, and she does not bring energy and vitality to the role of Jill Johnson, the nanny who is being pursued by an anonymous subscriber. <br /> <br /> But if you're looking for a great one, this film offers more ideas for home architecture and interior design than inspiration for everything you see on TLC or HGTV. Jill spends nearly 90 minutes wandering around the house of the rich doctor and wife for whom she provides her sit-in services, looking for sources of strange sounds and things that continue to “stumble” at night. While she is hiding in the corners and peeking through the corridors, we see a beautiful main bathroom with his and her sinks that looks like a Roman bath, a huge kitchen with incredible lighting of glass racks and a resistance object, an autonomous aviary and a shy pond with an automatic irrigation system. <br /> <br /> Since the film is not so convincing as to attract us to Jill's fear, we are distracted by the greatness of the house, which is not something special you have to do when you are watching a thriller. Despite the fact that Jill pursues a faceless maniac, we cringe because she breaks valuable things and spoils the pond, not because she is going to be killed. <br /> <br /> The movie unfolds as predictably as most teen-slasher films do. and the ending is not at all original. By the time it was over, I just wanted to know where the hell this house was and if it was real. Never mind Jill and the children she nursed. <br /> <br /> 2 stars - both for home.
