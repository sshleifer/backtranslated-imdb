From the very beginning of this film, with his “Lost Boys,” ripping off the initial sequence, to poor wire work and an even worse end of the dialogue, this film slid forward at the speed of a snail. The “testament” was highly recommended by some of my colleagues, who, I am convinced, played a joke with me. At least, I hope that this was the intention, and their taste is not so bad! This film was not much longer than an hour and a half, but it felt much longer than that. The story was so simple that it could be summarized in a maximum of 15 minutes. They could, at least, fill the rest of the film with some interesting scenes of magic or combat, but someone decided (maybe the director, but I don’t know if anyone really “directed” this film) that it will be filled with some poorly executed “fancy” camera shots and meaningless scenes of “boys” swimming and making bar fights. About halfway through this film, I thought that maybe hitting my head against the wall would be more exciting, and partly to get rid of this terrible dirty feeling that I felt while continuing to watch it. So I hit my head on the wall, and I liked it more than the movie! I watched it all until the very end, hoping that it would ultimately bring me more pleasure. No, my efforts were rewarded: “How about I make you my Aitch!” I vomited, and then I was just embarrassed by the writer and regretted the poor actor who had to deliver this nonsense. The game was really not as bad as other reviewers thought, but even the most talented pianist could not save this work, and the work he did was on my nerves! I give films a chance, even bad ones, because they usually offer some form of pleasure, and it really was not the worst film I've ever seen. After it was all over, I wanted to watch the film “Stealth” again, and WOW was much better this time! Oh yes, in this case, do not worry about this film, though not. Watch a few episodes of "Charmed" and see "Lost Boys" after drinking enough alcohol, and you will become much better. If you have fallen into the same trap as me and watched “Testament”, try to keep all sharp objects away from yourself, you thank me for it.
