How pointless, disgusting characters and a boring movie. Saved by the short sex scenes, the insane witch, the gorgeous desert island and the body of Brooks. The plot is insignificant, the characters are small and unlikely. Having said that I managed to watch it all, mainly because I was completely shocked by the swaying and the hope that her character would eventually become good. The film was well shot, well directed, but maybe the actors in some way let it down. . Unsatisfactory. Indeed the review in the first line is summarized, but this site requires that you need to write at least 10 lines. It would be better to spend time watching another movie.
