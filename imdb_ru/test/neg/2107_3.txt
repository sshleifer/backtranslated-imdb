To their credit, this is one of their more competent pieces of garbage, and that’s because there’s pretty good blood and an interesting way of picking up Snakes on an airplane. But, if there is still some example of inconsistency behind the last Asylum robbery, then these are two characters at the beginning who are illegal immigrants and can neither understand nor speak English with a person from Texas who steals them across the border, but when they get on the train and meet a friend, they begin to understand and speak perfect english. <br /> <br /> In addition to the rather poor description of the Hollywood formula, “Snakes in a train” are extremely boring. At least with Snakes on the Plane, we were given the opportunity to watch comedians and try to be remotely interesting. The film “Mallachi Brothers” presents some of the most boring characters I've ever seen, from an electrical engineer (well, I wonder how it will come in handy later) to some surfers masons, up to our two main characters trying to fight from the serpentine curse that lies in the husband of the wife. <br /> <br /> “Snakes” never entertain, and even when they are very bloody, they are never as good as a chance, because “Snakes” could be a fun short film, and instead would take myself too seriously and never stop him at any time. Instead of taking their small budget and making original films that can set a precedent, they instead force their small budget to work against them in these fakes. While the Mallachi brothers seem to be trying, the train looks incredibly artificial. <br /> <br /> It looks like a scene with these inconsistent and terribly soft decorations, which are desperately trying to look like real railway cars, while it shakes from time to time, the background of the windows is blurred, and the sound effects are turned off from time to time to let us know that they are actually on the train; not to mention the fact that in such a large long train on it, it seems, only about ten passengers. In addition to the fight on the train and the lingering sex scene, we are forced to undergo a plot that does not make sense. And even the directors can not get around the fact that the "deadly" snakes who walk in this train, look far from poisonous and not dangerous. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film stops only at the minute slaughter of snakes. and the bad plot of the former drug that is trying to pester the passenger. All this boring exposition ends with a truly ridiculous climax, in which a badly generated computer snake (I saw the best animation on Super Nintendo) is completely swallowed by the entire train, and then distributed according to the method that should have been used from the very beginning, the Refuge again gains points. <br /> <br /> Refuge again clogs up with a beaten, lazy, horribly directed and boring robbery of another best movie. “Snakes on the train” take themselves too seriously, and therefore never entertain or remember.
