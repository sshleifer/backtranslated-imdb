I watched this movie, not knowing what it was about. I was intrigued for the first hour. It was a great thriller. Very talented cast and good dialogue. Then it all fell apart for me at the sight of the first vampire. I could not believe my eyes. The great thriller was flushed down the toilet. The rest of the movie from that moment on was absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> I gave him 4 stars for a brilliant start. I think it's a bit generous, but I was entertained for a while. I'm not a fan of vampire and zombie movies at all. If so, you may disagree with my opinion.
