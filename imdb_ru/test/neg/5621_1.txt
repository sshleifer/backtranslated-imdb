If you watch an additional documentary, you will notice that the director is completely inexperienced and was actually an employee of Quentin Tarantino in the video store. Connect two and two, and you will understand that Quentin does a favor to his old rudiment, despite the fact that he is rather inept. Was it harsh? Well, watch this movie and you’ll understand that it’s not. Too slow in the beginning, too pointless in the middle and too slow to complete. It is about summation. Eric Stolz and Delpies were the only ones who showed charisma. And Kemp actually set good results. But the rest was very bad. One example of the stupidity of the conspiracy was when the “lead robber” accidentally took off his mask during a raid. So what happens? Well, the other robbers decided that they too could remove them! What a great mindset. The violence was ruthless and insane. But not "cool." Rather, in the farce. Interesting, is it a comedy? Another fool Tarantino for the fact that his good name is associated with this garbage. More fool me to look for it.
