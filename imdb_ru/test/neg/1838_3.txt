I was looking forward to this film because everyone spoke of it as a good horror film, and finally a European one. So perhaps my expectations were too high. <br /> <br /> It all starts with a nice quiet horror / shock sequence, but immediately brings you to the following scenes, where the plot begins, how the actions and motivation / life of the characters is revealed no better than any drama "Made for TV ". So it remains to the very end. <br /> <br /> As for the terrible part of the film, this is certainly a good idea, a different one, but ALL of the scenes were “seen before”. <br /> <br /> Overall, my idea for this film was that he had a good concept, which was inserted into a mediocre story, a bad game and less acceptable plot holes. <br /> <br />
