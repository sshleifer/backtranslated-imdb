When I first watched this film, I thought it would be good for a rally, because it was my favorite actor of all time. He demonstrates a great game, although it is clear that he did not need more than half of his life to make it work. He is the only good thing about it, unless you are in the explosions and the trash can of the American working-class dream (which I am not). <br /> <br /> I do not understand. How can this movie get away with so much naf. It's a little bit with saving a little boy, I mean, come on! You cannot tell me that he would have been saved without the fireman wearing any glasses (I know for sure that there would be completely black and you cannot see you more than a couple of feet ahead) and without respiratory equipment would have suffocated in 2 minutes!). This movie was just bad, ok? <br /> <br /> Why Robert? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY ???? !!!! <br /> <br /> Sorry if this is your favorite movie.
