When I was little, I absolutely adored “The Swan Princess”, she relived the same tales of Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, the princess and her prince who save the day - this is an eternal story that will never die, well, I hope. But I thought that I would like to see the sequel to “The Swan Princess” to see what they look like, and, unfortunately, this is a typical sequel to the cartoon that more disappoints than entertains. The only character I found still very funny was the Queen, she was very funny in this film and played the best part. But with the changes in their voice, they were noticeable and also disturbed me a bit, I don’t want to be discriminating, it was just too strange for me. This story has also been more or less borrowed from the first Princess Swans, just the villain in this film follows in the footsteps of Rothbart. <br /> <br /> Odette and Derek are going to celebrate their anniversary, but Derek was too busy fighting for his kingdom to keep him safe. As his mother's birthday approaches, he forgets about this, as a new villain appeared in the city, Clavi, who hopes to go further and further than the Rothbart forces stretch and kidnap the queen on her birthday. But Odette must turn into her swan to help Derek fight him and save his mother. <br /> <br /> “Swan Princess-2”, of course, is more than good for children, which I do not mind, it is a good pure pleasure for them. The reason why these sequels are disappointing is that, as a rule, they are intended only for children, for the audience they are aiming for, but it is much nicer when jokes and stories can please everyone. Now there are a few laughs and giggles here and there, but, in my opinion, it was not so clever for the first Swan Princess. I would recommend it for children, but if you are looking for a funny cartoon, I would recommend to stay with the first swan princess. <br /> <br /> 4/10
