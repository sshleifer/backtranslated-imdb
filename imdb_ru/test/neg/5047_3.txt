I do not think that I ruined someone’s experience of this film by telling you not to watch it if you have something better, for example, to remove it under the stove. There is dirty under it, and you have to clean it sometime. <br /> <br /> I think the film suffers from a lack of sex and violence, although there is one car chase trick that looks so dangerous that it could only be made in a country where life is cheaper than beer. The gargoyle's heart is in the right place, but its aspirations are conservative. This is at least not pretentious. But I had a great time playing in it, playing an eternal idiot in a horror film that says, “What a hole?” And dies for its arrogance. Plus I have to meet Michael Pare. Every movie lover should work on one of the main films at least once before he dies. And Romanians are the sweetest people I met. Literally the most beautiful. Walk down the street in Bucharest: if 7 out of every 10 women are not quite beautiful, you are walking along a street that I have not encountered; and being comforted by the fact that at least 5 out of 10 are available for drinks. <br /> <br /> A part of the film was shot at Casa Radio, an abandoned unfinished building of the Classic Communist bloc-Georgian nightmare, originally intended to house propaganda ministries of the KGB, that is, Radio Non-Free Europe. The building is five floors high and occupies a city block; best of all, its façade exudes the solidity of Bolshoi Brotersky, it is located near the city center, like the post-apocalyptic ruins in the jungle of burdock and hemp, inhabited by dozens of gypsies and many wild dogs. Construction at Radio House was suspended when Kachescu and his wife were executed on TV in 1989, and there are still gaping holes that fall from the sun-baked top floor (offering surreal perspectives to the modern quarter of a mile concrete roof, decorated with protruding armature and old car parts overlooking the crumbling ancient city) down to the damp, eerie basement (which doubles in the movie about the gargoyle den). No American-style fencing or warning signs for Bucharest. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, several non-union films have been filmed at Casa Radio, including Highlander III. This is attractive to manufacturers because it is a cheap location, massive in terms of scale and accessible space, of fancy appearance and without insurance headaches, since it is still state property. In addition, no one complains that you do not clean up after production: everything that remains in place is interpolated into the construction of the real gypsies in the slums of the city of real gypsies in the real urban jungle. <br /> <br /> During the filming of “The Gargoyle,” a wild dog bit a bloody assistant director. Apples, delivered by catering, were thrown into the service of actors and crew as projectiles to keep stray dogs at bay. I was also bitten by wild dogs in Bucharest, once at the bar (!) And once at the city park. I also survived two car accidents in two weeks, both in a taxi, and neither of them was seen by drivers as a reason to stop the car. <br /> <br /> GICA NOTE: the sci-fi network or channel or something else was one of the patrons of this film (the lower the budget, the more producers on the set), so it’s a little strange that no one there were problems with the original name “Gargoyle” until it was almost time to show it to the network, although Sci-Fi already had an unrelated series with that name. The name was changed sometime relatively close to release, as I have a copy with color correction marked with the previous name.
