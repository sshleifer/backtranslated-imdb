The bad news: Maple Picturesâ€™s Canadian version of Beast In The Cellar was of poor quality. Dark and blurry, it seemed erratic from a VHS tape. He even misses one moment due to missing frames. <br /> <br /> Good news: this film is so bad that the poor quality of the DVD distracts me a little from the pleasure of watching. This horror movie cannot create stress and lacks fear. This is a horror movie without horror. While most scary movies have limited dialogue, Beast In The Cellar is a gabfest so much so that the character repeats what we just heard, said by two other characters. Presumably, all chats act as a filler for a very budget, unimaginable film. Unfortunately, the dialogues are not polite enough to be worth seeing.
