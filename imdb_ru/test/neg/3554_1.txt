One of the most boring movies I've ever had to watch, it's completely stereotyped. Just a clipping from a movie, you can predict every scene in a movie, just by knowing the genre, since this movie is nothing new. Dialogue is never funny, interesting or clever. The acting is weak, and the soundtrack is annoying - basically everything looks as if it were made by an amateur director. Nothing fresh, memorable or fascinating in this film, combined with the fact that it is LONG, does not give him anything good. Sorry fans. <br /> <br /> Overall Rating: F
