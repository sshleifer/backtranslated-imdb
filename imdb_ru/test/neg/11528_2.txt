What a fool! <br /> <br /> This MUST be made for television or cable television. <br /> <br /> Look: forget the script - forget a bunch of unforgettable actors. Excuse me? Continuity? NSA / NIA / regardless of who he is (agent), takes off on the F16 - this is shown on the F18, which throws fists up, and later the plane shown on taxiing is F4 Phantom! Oh, I wish I was such a gentleman. <br /> <br /> In addition to male actors (!?), women are OCA: blue-eyed and long-legged and, eventually, begin to cry for heroes save them. Even when a solid weld can save a large part of space astronauts, the blond throws a welding tool. Spirit! <br /> <br /> Like SF film one of ten. Like the movie itself: 1/2 (that's half a point). They should have left the space station and headed for Mars. <br /> <br /> Large raspberries.
