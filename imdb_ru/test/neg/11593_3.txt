This movie is hilarious, what better than watching two creatures fighting each other? GIANT cgi versions of these animals that fight! However, I need one of the pistols used in the film. Because, apparently, they use cheats. Count the number of pictures they use before ... oh wait, this is correct, they will never have to reload. No matter how many shots ... it's fun. <br /> <br /> The sound effects used in the Komodo film range from tiger to elephant. Oh, and I forgot to mention that, obviously, these giant Komodo dragons are secretive as hell? Because for some reason, even when the actors look in the direction from which the beast appears, they are surprised when it appears. <br /> <br /> When someone dies, you can say that he comes, because everyone is preparing for this, they put their hands. take to the air and cross them to save yourself ... it never works. <br /> <br /> The last treasure is that the brains of these writers are just iron, full of knowledge. With “facts”, such as both of these creatures, amphibious commentaries, such as “helpless animals,” they are just full of fun facts.
