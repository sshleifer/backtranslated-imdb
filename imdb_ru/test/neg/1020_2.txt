He is the only reason to watch this movie. It gives a very good performance - much better than this crap deserves. He is very beautiful and very talented - he deserves better than this. It is also depressing to see Malcolm McDowell in this. He is another talented actor who deserves better, but, like Esai, he plays very well. So, if you are fans of any of them, you may want to watch. Otherwise, stay away. Another complaint - didnâ€™t we have scenes with shirtless Esai?
