The plot here is simple. Country boy Lem (Farrell) goes to town to sell a wheat crop, falls in love with waitress Kate (Duncan) and marries her, leading her home to a hostile father and a group of women greedy for women. There are shades THEY KNOW THAT THEY WANT AND MUSHES AND MEN here. Grooming, occurring in two long sequences set in a restaurant, takes the first half hour and goes at a lethargic pace. Lem is so weak that he allows his father to mistreat his wife, whom Mack (Richard Alexander), one of the reapers, offers to leave with him. Duncan and Alexander are the only good things in this tiresome cauldron that lack the insight and cinematic beauty that we expect from Murnau. Farrell's character does not have a ridge, so we still cheer on the “real man” (Mac) to distract Kate from all of this. With the distorted sympathies of the audience, the film loses its narrative development. Father’s address at the end of the film is unrealistic and unbelievable, which leads to a far-fetched outcome. This film is intended only for fans of stars and the director - the general public does not need to worry.
