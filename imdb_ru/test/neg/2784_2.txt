Direct to the video and for good reason. It's like the neighborhood kids playing in the backyard, but worse. A young man, (Don Digiulio), inherited a farm in West Virginia that had not been used for several generations. He decides to take some friends to check the property. This agricultural land was used to produce good crops, even during the Great Depression. The secret is that the owner killed people and watered them with blood. Then hang their bodies like a stuffed animal. The special effects are pretty lame, and the terrible dialogue is full of funny one-liners, and the banter is so ridiculous that the sound is better off. Cheap blood and the pretense of horror. Together with Digiulio in the cast: Jeanie Chick, B.V. York, Booty Chuning and Jessica Dunphy.
