Fred "The Hammer" Williamson delivers another cheap movie. He could set a new standard for himself. Look for the painfully obvious mortar cannon with special effects that is visible on the street during the chase scene. You do not see it only once, you see it several times. Look at an unfocused shot taken in one scene and the camera operator will try to fix it as the scene goes on. See it with a group of people and create your own Mystical Science Theater!
