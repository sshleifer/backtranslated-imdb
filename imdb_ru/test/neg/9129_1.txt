Dear reader, watch out! This film is not really a film, although its creators have the audacity to call it that. If you have not been warned about its content, here it is: the film is just a series of imaginations that continuously flow and try to convey a certain feeling, a concept. Therefore, they can be called symbols. Images are accompanied by sound, the purpose of which is also to create an atmosphere. However, the images chosen by the director can convey feelings only to the American audience, because in the overwhelming majority these are American icons. Although the film is intended to express the idea of ​​"civilized war", it cannot do this not only because of the general chaos, but also because it is too long and tedious, and I firmly felt that many scenes were not to be done with whatever the concept. In conclusion, I was greatly disappointed with a documentary film that is not a documentary film, a film that is not a film “something”, the only strength of which is the exclusive use of image processing technology.
