well, let's move on to the chase - I just can’t give anything except 1 out of 10; and yet you must see it! The action is bad, but nothing is as bad as the scenario, which pales in front of production values. Cardboard axes? yes, we have then. Are the salon mats painted silver and used as armor? here it is! <br /> <br /> The film itself is pretending to be artistic, but simply cheap; the same shots are used repeatedly - especially in protracted battle scenes; The dialogue (fortunately!) Is very small, and there is a lot of "artistic" music to drag home the horror! <br /> <br /> And yet this horror is terrible - you have to watch it to the end, so you can say you have seen it. I didn’t even get to the barren scenery, the “plot” or the perilous special effects; it really is a “how not to do this” film school. You need to look at it - spread the word, and let the whole world unite in thinking about what happens on earth at the end <br /> <br /> But the best thing is that they did a sequel.
