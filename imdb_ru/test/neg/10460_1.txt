Trying to build a large mall or complex or something, the rich landowner ignores the ancient Indian artifacts buried on the ground and releases the Bone-Eater ... a creature that walks around and kills people in search of their dead friends or something like that. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this film was supposed to be the original of the science fiction channel. If this is not the case, then the director should never again lead. The effects in the film are ridiculous at best, and the monster Bone Eater is nothing more than CGI animation added to frames later. Actors don't even look so scared when they see this thing (probably because they really don’t, and they’re just terrible actors). However, this is a great comedy, even if it should be just horror.
