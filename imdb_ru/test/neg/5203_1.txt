As a big fan of the original Delta Force operation, I thought I would pick this movie. I figured it couldn't be too bad. However, here is a list of things that I learned from watching Operation Delta Force 4: A deep mistake. <br /> <br /> - Delta Force, despite the fact that it is the elite in the US military, most of them are overweight at a later age. The 30s and the beginning of the 40s. <br /> <br /> “Delta”, despite being the elite of the American armed forces, is carried by standard police pistols or AK-47 submachine guns to perform their most important tasks. <br /> <br /> “Delta Force”, despite the fact that it is the elite of the American armed forces, did not understand that during stealth missions wearing bright red ski jumpers from a springboard and running in open spaces did not exactly leave you in sight. <br /> <br /> - When you throw a Molotov cocktail in the tank, it explodes outside like a grenade. <br /> <br /> - When fire hits you from a tank, you can escape, although the smoke can cause slight breathing difficulties. <br /> <br /> - You can die from one standard shot, but you can also live, despite the fact that the sniper rifle hit the AK-47 several times several times. <br /> <br /> - In hand-to-hand combat, members of the Delta forces, despite the fact that they are the elite of the American armed forces, regularly beat up railway workers. <br /> <br /> - If the bad guys approach you when you are on a slow train, you have nothing to worry about - between four of them they cannot figure out how to make automatic weapons shoot automatically, not to mention to hit someone from 5 meters (16 feet), with at least 50 attempts in between. <br /> <br /> - If you have few actors, just recycle them - the bad guy from Operation Delta Force 1 is played by a good guy named Mac in Operation Delta Force 4, and the one who played Mac in Operation Delta Force 3, now playing Skip Lang, another good guy. <br /> <br /> - Delta Force cannot shoot an unarmed terrorist, even if he is trying to reload his weapon to kill you. <br /> <br /> - Grenades explode on impact with the ground when they are thrown by members of the Delta Force. When they are thrown by non-Delta Force employees, they explode at the exact point where Delta Force members throw grenades back into the bad guys. <br /> <br /> - Tanks can move faster than standard trucks. <Br /> <br /> - The militia and personal armies use the same helicopter that the United Nations used in Operation Delta Force 1. <br /> <br /> - When a helicopter arrives, the bad guy in this helicopter will not see you if you are lying face down. <br /> <br /> Shooting someone several times in the chest will cause minor damage. If you strike this knee, it will be killed within 5 seconds. <br /> <br /> - Delta Force is stealing cars from older people to move while abroad, because the US military does not provide them with any means of transportation. This may also explain why they caught public transportation. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is not the best moment in filmmaking, but it’s good for laughter.
