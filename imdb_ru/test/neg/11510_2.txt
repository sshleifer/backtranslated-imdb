I first saw an ad for this show when my sisters watched the movie “Kim Possible” In an advertisement, Sadie and her friend discussed the meaning of the word “nothing.” This is one of the silliest commercials I've ever seen. In fact, they go back and forth with lines like "Nothing is a thing, so technically nothing is something." When I saw this, I thought it would be another unfortunate blast of Lizzie Maguire Disney. But I had no idea how bad. <br /> <br /> Fast forward in 3 weeks when my sister turns on T.V. Naturally, Sadie was in place. What I saw was to be one of the most unintentionally fun shows I've ever seen. How was it? Something like this: <br /> <br /> Sadie, a vegetarian, is hugging a tree, incredibly unhealthy, obsessively in love with Owen’s very monotonous and ill-acting role. For some reason, her friend Margrethe decides that Owen needs to be “checked” to see how good he seems. What exactly do these tests include? Well, the one thing they do is put a cockroach on her notebook. What for? So she can be squeamish and ask her monotonous knight in shining armor to take him off. How is this test? Because if he compresses it, he is angry and indifferent and does not believe that mistakes, as Sadie says, "are also innocent animals." THEY SPREAD THE DISEASE AND PESTILANS! THEY LIFE TO BE REMOTE! But, of course, Owen just cleans this window, and Sadie is still in love. But that's not all! Margrethe says he needs to challenge again, something that "no guy can pass." This includes pushing scarves down your pants (yes, you read it right) and walking around, buying it to see if he notices their big asses. As expected, he does not notice, and we see Sadie in her strange and strange world of laptops. Sadie decides that she wants to be with Owen forever, start a family with him and, as she puts it, “live like wooden ducks with her brood”. This is simply wrong. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: this is the strangest, craziest show I've watched. For those who like to make fun of nonsense, you will like it. For everyone else, skip this show.
