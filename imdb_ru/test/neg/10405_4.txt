This is another variation of the often told story of two people who marry and are forced to share their children. WITH SIX, YOU GET EGG ROLL by director Howard Morris (from television), and he shows because this is the type of fairy tale that plays like a half-hour comedy about the situation, supplemented by the duration of the film - but with a lack of laughter which would be possible within the half-hour limits of a television show. <br /> <br /> Doris Day decided to call it a cessation after this film - and it's pretty easy to see why. Even the presence of some fairly reliable actors in the cast does not help. Brian Keith, Barbara Hershey, Pat Carroll and Alice Gostely do their best, but the script is a real problem and it could not be left untouched for the big screen. <br /> <br /> Nothing special can be said in his favor. Skip it and see Miss Day in any of her more significant films.
