I love Das Boot. I was hoping for something similar - a realistic military film depicting soldiers and civilians on both sides of these people, with joy and pain in battle. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Stalingrad seems to be written by the third class at the direction of the fifth grade student. The main fragments of the film simply disappear, leaving it completely incoherent. The dialogue in translation is ridiculous, but in the native language it does not look better; You only have to look at the faces of the actors during the bad moments of the dialogue in order to understand how bad this film is.
