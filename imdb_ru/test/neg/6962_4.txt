I approached this film with the understanding that it was one of the worst films ever. I sat down to look at it with this attitude and was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> This is not great. It is not even that good; in fact, it is rather poor. However, this is not as bad as it seemed to me, with a long-range strike. This is rather inappropriate, and, obviously, as a cost-cutting measure, many personnel from the warehouse are being compressed in service, many of whom are not clearly related to the narrative. <br /> <br /> However, this is a very personal film, shot by a man who clearly did not have the skills or means to justify his idea. Before you discount _Glen or Glenda? _ Hand-to-hand, test your own artistic skills. I would like to draw, but everything that I try to draw turns out as little men. I would like to sing, but all I do is scare the little kids. <br /> <br /> Wood had an idea, and, unfortunately, he didnâ€™t have what it took to work. Nevertheless, it was an incredibly brave film for the Puritan 50s, no matter how exploitative or disjointed it might seem at first glance.
