I'll be honest - an extinct purple plane with Snoop Dogg at the helm - a funny visual gag. It would be a worthy concept for a 30-second commercial or maybe a 3-minute music video. But the producers took the long-standing concept of comedic sin - to stretch 30 seconds of material for an hour and a half of the film, and the results are predictably unpersuasive. The remaining 89 minutes are filled with a typical range of racist and sexist humor and farting jokes that are offensive and, worst of all, painfully unfunny. A worn plot shouts under the weight of its tricks. It is best avoided if you are not drunk or stoned.
