This film was basically set to fail the studio. One of them, Ann Rice (the author of the book) offered to write the script, but the studio refused it. Secondly, they tried to insert two detailed novels in a two-hour film. <br /> <br /> I adhere to the only way for these two books - the vampire Lestat and the queen of the damned - to work in the form of live action. go through the mini-series. First of all, one “Lestat the Vampire” occurs from the 1700s to the 1980s and has many characters that are vital for understanding the plot of the main character, Lestat. The whole book "Vampire Lestat" describes the events of the second part of the "Queen of the Damned." Without this complete understanding, the film’s premise is shattered. <br /> <br /> Lestat was not cruel and angry for everyone, he did not want to keep up with the plans of Akash, Marius did not make Lestat, Lestat did not like Jesse or make her, Lestat could not remain unharmed by light for David and vice versa, each character was completely misrepresented, in particular the same names, another story. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a movie about vampires, fine. Even if you want to be inspired by these novels, fine. But do not go back to the cinema from the success of the great novels and characters of Rice, just to destroy what her loyal readers loved. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t read the book yet, you don’t do it to understand the film. If you read the books, you’re offended. Nevertheless, I am such a big fan that I had to watch a movie, knowing full well that it would be so, and still went for it. Catch 22, must see it, I will hate.
