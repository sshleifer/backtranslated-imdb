Harmony Corrine - do you hate him or hate him? On this evidence, hate can be the best word. Not he, of course, just everything he does. But things could be different, because the first ten minutes of this film promise so much, including the fantastic idea of ​​imitator Michael Jackson, in love with imitator Marilyn Monroe. Fantasy. And set in Paris! This can be great. But, unfortunately, Corrin can cause a strange decent idea, but since he is a terrible writer, the story fails at all levels, and the audience in which I witnessed for about an hour is proof that he is the most boring and pretentious film of all existing, Obviously, the output at its premiere at Cannes in recent years has been quite shocking. Instead of focusing on the two main characters, he stupidly switches history to the borders of the castle in order to introduce a group of other imitators who make this whole experience tedious and fruitless. When will an independent cinema stop funding this upstart?
