After an intriguing start, this little drama quickly descends into the ranks of pure mediocrity. At the beginning of the film, two women (Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner) meet, waiting for their boys to return from vacation. Natasha Gregson Wagner is a beautiful actress and she plays Louise; sweet girl whose favorite boy is a versatile artist; music, movies you call it, he does it. While she tells another girl, Carla (Heather Graham) about her wonderful boyfriend, it soon becomes obvious that the similarities between their two male friends are too great ... and it is obvious that two girls meet the same guy. Oh my God. Enter Robert Downey Jr., in a purse with two girlfriends, while some poor fellow must go somewhere without her. Downey plays the guy the ladies love, but the men find repulsive irritation; he is essentially a mom's boy. The worst kind too; all the time he calls his mother, constantly drenches his girlfriends with ambitious (albeit empty) promises, etc. It is enough that a normal guy gets sick. <br /> <br /> The film deliberately tears off an excellent tripartite love triangle of films such as Jules and Jim. This movie does not work though; mainly due to the fact that it is an incredible story. Seriously, if two women just found out that they were dating the same guy ... they wouldn't have talked about it. Another reason why he falls is that he is so rude. There is no end to the possibilities for the outcome of the situation this film presents, especially with the claustrophobia of fitting it all into a small apartment; but everything that makes a film is lost in the mass of dialogue; poorly written and poorly delivered dialogue, that is. The film also massively overzealous; it is simply unbelievable that people will behave as they do in this film, finding themselves in such a situation. Robert Downey Jr. - One of the many things that wasted in the film. With Natural Born Killers, he proved that he can give brilliantly entertaining shows, and this is what this film can do. The two women were not in vain, because no one expected anything from them, but Downey could certainly be used better. Overall? Waste of time. Don't worry, see Jules and Jim or Natural Born Killers. This is my advice.
