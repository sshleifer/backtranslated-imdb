After a while, I realized that this is just my IQ, slowly falling. Frostbite is one of those pitiful films where no one, and I mean, no one even tries. I was rooting for the silly hero to die in this trash can (how could he even fit in there?), Traci Lords, the queen of B films, was terribly unfunny and ripped my friends and I off without showing her tits once. <br /> <br /> “Characters”, although I use this term loosely, people are so exaggerated and one-dimensional that they could use cardboard cutouts. “Jokes” (I also freely use this term) are just ridiculous. Fart guy causes earthquake. Roflcopter! Our “hero” gets an acupuncture butt from the Traci Lords. Oh god i can't breathe! Blind constantly uses the word F! It's too much!!! <br /> <br /> Say what you want from acting, but I thought that Adam Grimes did a good job with the role of a snowboarder with mental problems. In addition, the only source of entertainment value here are boobs. I think I counted three, maybe four pairs throughout the film, scattered about five minutes of screen time. These are five minutes worth seeing from the 83 minutes of unfunny trash. Don't watch it. Watch “Barbed Wire” with Pamela Anderson - at least there was a lot of nudity and action in this disgusting film! (No. 26)
