Drifting on bootlegs, sometimes considered a legend about urban comics, the first FF film is almost as bad as everyone is afraid. I think that Marvel Comics is now pretending that it does not exist, as in the 2005 version of theaters at the beginning of this year. But this is there, a reminder and the last of the first wave of bad, low-budget adaptations of Marvel superheroes (Captain America, The Punisher, most television films). “Low budget” is too simple a description for this FF photo. Due to the lack of funds, the Super Quartet’s ability to display was limited to very fast shots (Mr.Fantastic), quasi-animation (Torch) and fading (Invisible Girl - the easiest thing to do). Thing was a nice suit and probably half the budget; part of the face was especially nearly convincing. Actions? Alex Hyde-White as Reed is pretty good; the other 3 are fine, although Jay, since Johnny occasionally behaves like a cramp to boast his “fiery” character. The dialogue is made in the style of comics, and this is an auxiliary cast, which eventually hesitates, trying to make it work. Doctor Dome is a melodramatic and unintentionally comical character, and his two main minions are an example of how not to behave and not write dialogues. <br /> <br /> Story? Not too good. He was quite faithful to the history of the origin of FF (more so than the later version with a large budget), and although off-budget, again, limited display, for example, the actual emergency landing, he retained the main components of how they found their strength in isolated areas are the best part of the picture, although you have to wait half an hour. I also found the music strange in some places; when the four bathe in these cosmic rays, a church choir is heard, as if it were a religious experience. The rest, however, is hopeless. Even without a budget, the story could do without a jeweler character (resembling a villain from the book “Man-mole”); he spends too much time with him and his underground gang, as well as blind Alicia. These sections are a waste of celluloid and very boring. The climate struggle with Doom and his people begins well, but it degenerates into a terrible mess when the Torch drives a laser beam (cool animation, but in a cartoon). Fans can make fun of the bad FF FX and the mediocre plot if they don’t get depressed and resent the first.
