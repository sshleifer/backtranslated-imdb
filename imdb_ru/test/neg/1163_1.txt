All the great horror films of the 70s, 80s and even the early 90s from “Psycho” to the Texas chainsaw massacre (original, not heated by WB shit) to “Silence of the Lambs”. The characters in these films were based on the crimes of Ed Heine. Writers and directors have taken advantage of the real story for inspiration in creating some of the greatest * fictional * film killers of all time. <br /> <br /> Old horror films were great because, although the crimes were based on freedom, the facts of Ed Hein's case were truly fictional and far from the real story. <br /> <br /> In this film, they created a fictional horror film in which they tried to capitalize on the true story in order to sell a cheap, bad acting love story between two characters that no one needs. In fact, in a * good * horror movie, these two characters would be great sacrifices. <br /> <br /> The end of the lecture ... <br /> <br /> In short, this film was like wearing sticky cold clothes while sipping a cup of chilled vomit.
