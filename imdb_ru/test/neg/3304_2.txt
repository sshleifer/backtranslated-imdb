I have no idea who these others are, but this film is just awful. They should support Joe Sands when he is a minor character. The film "Bait and Switch", as in the studios with Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey, and so on. The DVD, which I watched, says: "This vague stone revolves around the MOB character Joe Pesci, the hot start of the war", etc. Joe, he doesnâ€™t even carry a weapon, plays a naughty character and gets a SPOILER - (beaten). So much for the film revolving around Sands. The only half-memorable scene was the unfortunate attempt at a comedy when they were driving through gas, waiting for the bill. If you watch this movie after reading, I warned you. Please stop and do not lose 87 minutes of your life.
