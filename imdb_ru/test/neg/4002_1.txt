A piece of trash would give him 0 if I could. The animation is good, but not good enough. The storyline is absolutely the funniest I've ever come across, and that says a lot! This “movie” tried so hard to be interesting, but failed miserably. It is almost as if the writer began one story and then got a different idea and tried to combine them. Do not waste your time on it; Believe me, you will be as annoyed with yourself as I am. The only actor in this business was James Woods, and his role was, at best, secondary. I'm all for doing things that are sharp, pushing envelopes, but it just didn't cut it.
