I speak badly about GIZH .: TM mainly because I think he lacked the fact that GI Joe was. Yes, there was something that GI Joe didnâ€™t have celebrities like Don Johnson and Burgess Meredith, but I think GI Joe. In the film there was no passion for the characters, whom GI Joe TV series was. Most of the voice over the artists really sounded like they were a dead frying pan, and they were going to die at any time. This is a good film, but I would not say that it was the greatest film in the world. IMKH.O. :) <br /> <br /> Although the violence is what GI Joe was based on the fact that I said that the Serpent hit the Duke in the chest is not the best way for the character Charlie Adler. None of them had seen Golobulus reminding Commander Cobra why he was chosen to lead the Cobra forces, and then he was terribly mutated after he could not deliver what Cobra-La felt by right. for gi Joe, the show, to go out, but it's better than nothing. :)
