An overpriced comedy crowd. Directed by Demme makes the actors pause after a few funny lines so that the audience laughs and do not miss the next line. It seems strange - this director made “The Silence of the Lambs” - now there is a way to use pauses! Casting seems off. Matthew Modine is too young for an FBI agent and Pfeiffer's love interest! Dean Stockwell with squint makes Jack Nicholson, and he gets a nomination for it! Plus, should we take Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians? Charles Napier as a hairdresser and Al Lewis as a mafia attorney are underused with one line each - they must be clumsy hoods. Chris Isaac's song is completely out of place — better for a movie like Pretty In Pink. Make this movie again, it's worth it, but with the right casting and director, and satire, the time will come ... even the often repeated "Forgery".
