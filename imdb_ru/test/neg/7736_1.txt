The message of the Hero is quite clear: the idea of ​​Greater China is more important than the death and suffering of millions. At a time when China hangs up its military toys in Taiwan, it’s unacceptable for Western viewers to approve this piece of overproductive, government-sponsored, dogmatic garbage. <br /> <br /> Especially surprising is the promotion of this ad. film liberal media. Roger Ebert from Chicago Tribune, David Edelstein from Slate, Charles Taylor from Salon and many others sincerely supported the Hero. At the same time, they unconditionally legitimized his reactionary political thought. The only critic (whom I know) who saw through the glossy facade of the film was J. Hoberman from The Village Voice, who wrote about “sanctimonious traditionalism” and his “glorification of the ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of national greatness.” his name under the last statement of Hoberman: "The hero is nothing but fascinating fascism."
