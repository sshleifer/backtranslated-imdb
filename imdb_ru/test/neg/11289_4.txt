Tai Cobb is by far the most interesting and belligerently craziest athlete ever to live. His baseball career was unprecedented in absurd statistics, brilliant strategy and sheer violence. Every game he played was a spectacle of human ability and cruelty. So, of course, the film about him has nothing to do with this, but focuses on the writing of his biography by the author Al Stump. Now this is not such a terrible idea in theory, since Cobb himself has fallen into more paranoid dementia over the years, and the stories of his crazy outbursts even at an older age shock even by today's desensitized standards. But instead of focusing on these events, which I thought were just too interesting, the film is a pseudo-fictional road film with an encrypted plot that will make any knowledgeable Cobb fan cry for the vinegar tears. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones copes well with the naughty Cobb, but somehow he manages to surpass his cartoon supervillage. Most of the stories about Cobb are hardly plausible, but making it even more insane seems both impossible and unnecessary. Robert Woole, depicting the writer Al-Stump, is a dark maelstrom of nonexistent talent. He sucks the life out of every scene, trying to make this film his own Nagasaki. There is a reason that we no longer see him as the lead man (Arliss doesn’t count. This is just a show). Even the inevitable, inevitable "change of roles" Cobb and Stampa toward the end is compounded by his sheer inability to pronounce words that do not look like a bad book about the voice of the narration on the tape. <br /> <br /> For all the terrible scenarios and unpretentious film production, there is one sequence that far exceeds the rest of this failure, that it is almost impossible to take it from the same film. A hyper-stylized sequence of memories that demonstrates Cobb's irresistible psychology and brutal athleticism while playing baseball is pure sheen. The camera moves in a strange way, and the whole event seems like a dream thanks to the unique style of the monster Cobb. Each slide, punch and projectile becomes even more powerful thanks to the improved sound, and Tommy Lee Jones OWN the master player intensity. This forces the viewer to drool over the possibilities of a real biographical film about Cobb in his prime with the same actor. It’s worth watching a movie for these incredible few minutes alone, just to see what could be. <br /> <br /> I may be a little unfair to this film because of my own knowledge of Ti Cobb and the desire that he was something that he is, but to make such a boring castrated film about it maniac meaningless. I'm glad that since then Ron Shelton's career has declined.
