For a while I avoided this film ... because I considered it as an unnecessary part of the series, which should have only 2 parts. But after reading some pretty favorable reviews ... from some IMDB watchers ... I spent $ 1.50 and rented it at my local video store. Do I need to go further ... when I say ... it was a lost dollar. This film is one of the 10 worst films I've ever seen. First of all ... I understand that no one wanted to see the 33-year-old Makio in this film ..... But, why they could not have Miyagi read the letter or something from Daniel-san ... perhaps explaining what happened to daniel ... damn, they could at least quickly mention daniel or something like that. But no ... and to put together an already bad script ... they added these stupid monks ... I thought the monks took a vow of silence ... I think these yapping monks do not take their vows seriously ... hehehe. The training that the girl went through in the film was hastily and stupid ... and the paramilitary group of young men ... was at least a confusing concept ... it was not even a martial arts film. ... with a girl who fought only briefly in the final scene ... and then she didn’t even come close to being hit at least once ... from a man fighting her ... give me a break ... she got I’d think it would be shocking to see a man beating up a girl in this movie, I think, the writers and directors thought it would be shocking. I could go on and on ... but basically ... I will finish by saying that this film was just awful ... even the girl they chose was not good even to watch (it was sorta ") Butch" looks ") .... I can only remember a few films that I watched ... which compare with how terrible this film was ..... DO NOT LOSE TIME ON THIS ONE .. ....... .
