Back in 1995, Barry Sonnenfeld shot the film, which made it to the lists of the best critics by the time the results of the year were printed in entertainment publications. It was the movie “Get Shorty,” in which he starred in the lead role of John Travolta and became the second hit in many years after Pulp Fiction put him back in front of paparazzi lenses. Based on Elmore Leonard’s novel, the film focuses on Chile’s wise man Palmer (Travolta) and his attempts to enter the film business. For example, I was completely captured by various characters and a clear dialogue of the original. So much so that when I heard that there would be a continuation, I seemed to give up my usual shivering, which arises when the studio tries to rephrase what was a good idea ten years later. A sequel, also based on Leonard's novel, this time directed by F. Gray Gray, the Italian work in 2003 was one of the highest-grossing films of the year. Combine this with the cast, which is now expanding: Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Cedric Fun, Rock, Vince Vaughn and James Woods, and you have all the possibilities of a great continuation in the exploits of one of the most interesting characters of the 1990s. This time we meet when Chile (Travolta) leaves the film business, being disappointed both in himself and in the industry for participating in the creation of the continuation of his first successful film. Thanks largely to his friend Tommy Athens (Woods) and the misfortune due to his death, Chile decides to look into the lucrative and dangerous music industry. This first leads to the famous club Viper, where Chile meets singing sensation Linda Moon (Christina Milian), who as the leader of the upstart trio can play tunes such as Whitney Houston (that is, Whitney before Bobby Brown started bringing home small packages with sugar). Linda contracts with Raji (Vaughn), who, along with her overly obvious gay bodyguard Elliott Wilhelm (Scala), plans to ensure that Linda fulfills her last five years of the contract, even if it means that Chile is on the ice. Thus, with Linda’s future in balance, Chile is weaving an interesting network that will include a record producer (Thurman), a gangster sound mixer (Cedric), a Russian mafia, police, Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler and a bunch of vicious pointing weapons. Woo-wheee! It sounds exciting. So why not? Be cool trying too hard to be cool. But the result is a film that, unlike the original, has neither heart nor soul. Instead, Be Cool feels like it was being directed by producer Saturday Night Live, because there are some scenes or parodies that don't fit in the whole movie. Take, for example, the scene in which Travolta and Thurman dance together for the first time after “Pulp Fiction” when the Black Eyed Peas performs live in the background. The scene was forced and had to end on the floor of the cutting room. Instead, it is linked between two other unnecessary chapters that do nothing to advance the story with any real impetus. Aerosmith's concert and The Rock's trip to the shoe store are also prime examples of individual moments that do not make up most of the movie if you put them together. But these are not the only problems with the continuation, which could probably be renamed to Product Placement with the number of bilateral and dietary Pepsi, which seem to look more closely at you than Chile’s serious look. The story contains almost every imaginable stereotype, and each of them has enough screen time to become slightly offensive or embarrassing. Whether it's the entourage of gangsters or a gay muscular guy with a poster of the movie "Rhinestones of Sylvester Stallone" on the wall, not a single character can offer us something that we have not seen many times before, and in much better films. With the magic almost gone from the first movie, we get the worst product, which is the second movie in the last six months (13 - “Ocean”, the other), which squeezes a bunch of stars into the tent just to become a movie that no actor will not bring to the open audition. Be cool was a big disappointment. I so wanted it to be Shorty's new millennium, and I ended up making a film in which the plays were supposed to be gasoline, but the experience left me smelly.
