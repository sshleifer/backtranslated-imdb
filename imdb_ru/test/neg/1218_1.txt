This is the worst Italian film, perhaps the worst film of all time! Joe D'Amato is certainly not a cinematic genius, but many of his films are interesting and watchable. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. Its cheesy and boring .... wahaaaa boring. If you want a movie for MST3k, get Troll 2, if you want the movie to put someone in a coma, get some blood!
