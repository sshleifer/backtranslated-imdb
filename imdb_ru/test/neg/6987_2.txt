This movie should be the worst movie I've ever seen. I just watched about half an hour, and I just turned it off. The cars in this film look like the two front ends of a geo-metro, broken together. This movie is not even a good laugh. The only time I laughed was when Dante continued to say in a ridiculous voice: "No one can defeat Dante, Muhwa, hwaa." I said holy god and turned it off. Bad, Bad Movie. 2/10
