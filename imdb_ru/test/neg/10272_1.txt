Simply put, this mini-series was terrible. Let me count the ways. 1. Absurd plot. 2. Excessive action. 3. Scattershot approach to characters. 4. Annoying narrative. 5. The inability to cause interest in the viewer. <br /> <br /> This film cannot even pass the test “Soap Opera for Dummies”. Sorry, I did not read this award-winning novel, so I only rate it as a film, but it really stinks. Imagine that you are going to a party where you are shown dozens of snacks. You look at the variety and want to try them, but suddenly they are withdrawn, and you wonder where they went. This is similar to this film, in which too many characters are presented and never drawn out. In this film, there are enough stories and characters to create a series of 20 episodes, but we are given only four hours to digest it all. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris has more facial expressions and reactions than you do. I will find on 10,000 monkeys. The pace is unusually slow. <br /> <br /> Dennis Farina and Helen Hunt are so burned out that their characters are not credible. The character Joan Woodward is one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Constant river metaphor becomes commonplace. <br /> <br /> And, perhaps, the most ridiculous part of the film is a cat. This evil and vengeful cat that follows the hero around to scratch him and his seat covers - well, come on now - this is not even good Stephen King! <br /> <br /> Probably the most interesting character in the film. And the one who is poorly drawn is John Voss, a worried boy, whose last act of despair explains the only plot that works in this film. <br /> <br /> Almost everyone in this movie is incredible. <br /> <br /> To summarize, there is little that inspires. Drama is a bad melodrama. This is just a terrible effort.
