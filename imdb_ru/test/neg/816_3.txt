I'm a fan of Bormann, but this is probably his least successful film. Comedy has never been his forte, and here his attempts to joke are clumsy. Nevertheless, in the opinion of Burman, it is almost worth paying attention to talent: this is one of the first main roles of Uma Thurman, and, as always, she is adorable. (On the sad side, Borman wrote the script along with his daughter Tel≈°che, who died a couple of years ago.)
