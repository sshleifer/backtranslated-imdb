Firstly, the very idea of ​​remaking classics, such as Psycho, is simply ridiculous. Much time and effort was wasted. I'm sure they are smart enough to know that they could not improve the original, so they had to pay tribute to Alfred Hitchcock. However, the idea, which began as a tribute with good intentions, leads to the fact that it becomes a slap in the face to the master of horror. Let's start off with. The original classic stands by itself, even after 40 years. The case of the return of Hitch from the grave and the persecution of people responsible for this piece of garbage is unlikely, but in my place I would sleep with just in case open one eye. Do not waste your time.
