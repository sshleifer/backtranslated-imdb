Roy Rogers (as Roy) and assistant Raymond Hatton (as Grow) join Toughdy Roosevelt's Rough Riders. Soon, they were removed in order to "collect" partner Eddie Acuff's killer (like Tommy) in Mexican-USA. borders; they discover creepy golden runners in the process. Pay attention to how Mr. Rogers, even being suspended, can force the Rough Riders to participate in his round! <br /> <br /> This is not one of the best westerns of roy rogers. Battle scenes look like choreographic dances. Rogers sings / yodel "Ridin 'Down the Trail", one of two relatively ordinary songs; and an outstanding moment, in general. <br /> <br /> ** Rough Riders Review (03/13/99) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, Raymond Hutton, Lynn Roberts
