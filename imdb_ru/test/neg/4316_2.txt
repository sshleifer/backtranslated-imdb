Pro warning spoiler? It is not "may contain", it contains spoilers. Readers, be careful. <br /> <br /> Okay, first I need to know that I am not beating the actors. They simply work with what they are given. The problem was in the script. It was terrible. There was nothing believable in that. Of course, when you have a movie based on a homicidal hitch, here and there will be a blunder that will put you in a terrible terrible, film worthy situation. But these girls just made a stupid decision after a stupid decision. The only girl who was smart enough to ever try to call the police was added to the end because he had already killed one and knocked the other down with a car. Speaking of knocking her down with a car ... what the hell did she try to overtake the truck and not run aside like a normal person? In addition, does the one who wrote the script believe before God believe the police will not investigate the door covered in blood? Honestly, it also did not bother. The only concern I felt was disappointment at how backward the girls were. Well, this pompous work lasted longer than I expected for such a bad film, so I will not touch the end, except that it is unrealistic and unconvincing.
