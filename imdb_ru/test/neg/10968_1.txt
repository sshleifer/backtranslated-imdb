Looking at the ratings, we can assume that this is a classic, but again this is just another example of how poor independent directors are trying to increase interest in their film. Are they not even smart about this 10/10 in voices? I assume that to break the curve and shift all 1/10, he will get. Is it better than any decent zombie movie? <br /> <br /> Acting, trite and useless. <br /> <br /> Sound effects, cheap and unpleasant, if not for what the actors were looking at, you would not know where they are going. from. <br /> <br /> Cinematography. These people act as if they had borrowed a camera from their dads immediately after viewing the matrix. Less is more, but more from this command is absolutely unimportant. <br /> <br /> Zombies are rubbish too. I have no doubt that most of these people will never be heard again, and this will be for a good reason. I hope that zombies will eat their eyes, because it was 90 minutes that I wonâ€™t get. <br /> <br /> And falsification of ratings is only a million times worse. <br /> <br /> One reviewer said he was one of the best horror films he has seen in the last 30 years? I can only assume that his recent corneal transplant was successful then. <br /> <br /> Watch the trailer that warns how bad this movie is.
