STMD! it's not a horrible movie, but it's pretty easily forgotten. The lighting is intentionally bad in many scenes and unintentionally bad in all the others, so you will probably get out of view with a headache or eye strain. The special effects are creative, but obvious. Of course, along with archetypical teenagers, there is a gift of nude that is necessary for teenage slasher films, but the entire film simply does not stick together. Some more lively dialogue and more mocking humor was needed. <br /> <br /> I canâ€™t recommend you spend time watching this movie. I often nod in a film based on only one or two scenes that demonstrate imagination or humor, but unfortunately this is not enough in this film.
