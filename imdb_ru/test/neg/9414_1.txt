I did not have high hopes for that. Before seeing this, this story shouted "stereotype" at me. I mean ... come on! This is such a stupid storyline about an innocent android that understands that the people who created it are immoral and then decide to change everything. <br /> <br /> I had to see it three times. The first two times I fell asleep, because I was incredibly boring. Very rarely films tire me so much that I fall asleep during them. The third time, I forced myself to look at it, just to be able to warn people about it. <br /> <br /> I got the clear impression that the people responsible for this mess tried to take all the cool / tidy things from other fantasy / action movies, and put them together to make a terrific movie! They took an android / robot, a lot of action, a fine story, stereotypical characters and a big fight in the end, and threw everything together. Unfortunately, the film sucks. The game is so wooden that you can build a house out of it, the plot / plot is absolutely ridiculous, camera work and installation are terrible, there is no direction, and to top it off, everything is so cliche and ridiculous that it just annoys you damnably. <br /> <br /> I have a feeling that I could spend time watching how he does something more creative, for example, cutting his nails or watching the grass grow. ,
