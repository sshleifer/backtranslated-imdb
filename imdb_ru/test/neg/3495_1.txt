I went to the cinema, expecting to see a great movie based on words and amazing reviews. as soon as the initial sequence began, I realized that I was in trouble. music and credits struggled to evoke the emotions that I wanted to vomit. all I got from this movie was the clich√©d characters, the invented dialogue and the non-emotional script. the director / writer Paul Haggis' managed to get great reviews thanks to his manipulative, self-righteous letter, but that does not deceive me. some indicators were good. Don Cheadle is always good. I think Terrence Howard is a bit overpriced, but he was decent. it was funny too on the nose. he should stick to rap. Brendan Fraser was fine. Jennifer Esposito did not leave any impressions. I do not find anything interesting in it. Sandra Bullock is always the same in every movie, she's just fine. Matt Dillon was very good, and I liked to watch him work. Ryan Philip was good too. but as for the screenplay and lousy directing, this is actually one of those films that are so terribly bad that I even found time to write about it. I would not recommend this film to anyone, which is a waste of time.
