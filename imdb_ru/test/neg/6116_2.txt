Worst Restlemania in history. <br /> <br /> There should be no fights, and a lot of shit. It happened in Las Vegas, and WWE forced its employees to dress like Egyptian gods! They even changed the name of Howard Finkels to Finkus Maximus, which probably means nothing. The vision of Jim Ross in this terrible dress still gives me nightmares to this day, and I'm 21 years old, so you can imagine it when I was 7! Bobby Hyann was fun. <br /> <br /> In the number of matches: The Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzalez in a bad match, Headzinkers against the Steiner Brothers in a worthless duel, Doink against Krush in a comedy and boring match with Ramon razor against Bob Backlund. Hulk Hogan teamed up with Brutus Beefcake to fight Money Inc. You could see clearly that Hogan had a black eye. For story purposes, Ted Dibias and the IRS beat Hogan when he played poker or something like that in a casino, which is a bad storyline, but in fact, macho Randy Savage hit Hogan because Savage thinks he is like on Hulk (not a pun)) is not a fighter, but a film character. <br /> <br /> The main event was that Bret Heathman Hart met with Yokozuna in a very boring match of the main event. Mr. Fuji threw salt on Hart's face, and Yoko won, but not before Hogan came down and crushed Yoko in 21 seconds. <br /> <br /> Overall Grade - E
