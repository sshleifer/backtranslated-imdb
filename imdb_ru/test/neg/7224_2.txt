The only quality of this film is that it shows the bands and their music when it changed in New York during '81. As for the film itself, it has at least three major flaws. First, everywhere in the film is a story, which is not at all necessary. In the few places where there is some explanation, simply adding a little dialogue might be important. Secondly, there was no obvious attempt to synchronize any sound, in fact, it is quite obvious that most of the dialogue was recorded later, without trying to match the film. The third flaw was in the final. I will not give up the end to those brave souls who would suffer torture while sitting in the film, but this is a cardinal sin in the script. It is not worth the money or time to see this, if you are not a fan of one of the groups represented.
