I have a question for the authors and producers of Prozac Nation: what is the root cause and what is the solution to the widespread problem of personal depression in America? In the touching role of Christina Ricci as Liz Würzel, the film depicts a young woman with unlimited potential as a Harvard student and as a writer. But this is not a success story, but a story of self-destruction, when we see Liz bringing suffering to the lives of all who face her. The film looks at divorce, family dysfunction, drugs, alcohol, and prescription drugs as possible causes of Liz’s unhappiness. But none of these superficial explanations are satisfactory. <br /> <br /> At some point in the film, it would be useful to assume that Liz should take responsibility for her life and her problems. No one shed light on the fact that the film is said to be an unrestrained problem in the “United States of Depression.” In this story, Liz had a caring psychotherapist (Anne Heche), a caring roommate (Michelle Williams), a caring guy (Jason Biggs), and a restless, but caring parent (Jessica Lange). In the key scene of the film, Liz lies in a hospital bed and watches the Challenger space shuttle collapse. Instead of equating Challenger with Liz’s life, the film should have used this image as a starting point for her healing and recovery. <br /> <br /> This film reminded me of the general film "victim", prepared for transmission to the Lifetime Network. An excellent cast was wasted, especially in the serious performance of Christina Ricci. The real Elizabeth Würzel obviously found the resources to cope with depression and become a successful author. Unfortunately, the film could not offer us the slightest look at her courageous spirit.
