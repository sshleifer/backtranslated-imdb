I like to watch Robert Forster. That was the main reason I shot this movie. I also wanted the story to be set up in the middle of nowhere, where the characters could work very well from each other without distractions. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film seemed boring to me. I could not be interested in characters. I could not get interested in a story that seemed not to go away. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie for an hour, I turned it off. I rate the film 4 out of 10. This is well below the required 7 points, which makes the film worth seeing.
