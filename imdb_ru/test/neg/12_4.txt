Blake Edwards tried hard to change the image of Julie Andrews in this film. He tried to make her sexy, not realizing that she was already. I think both of them were still a bit annoyed that Julie was not chosen for the filming of her Broadway success Camelot, and was considered not sexy enough. Unfortunately, they chose this car to try to dispel this conviction. So much so that it is almost ridiculous to see Rock Hudson, who, as we all know, was gay, kissing Julia every 2 minutes throughout the film. Now it seems that they not only tried to make you believe that Julie was a fatal woman, but that Rock was direct. Unfortunately, they have absolutely no chemistry together, and endless kissing scenes start to get bored. Another mistake they made with this picture was that they did not know which film they were shooting. This is almost three separate films. There is Julia's drama, like a German spy trying to get military secrets from Rock. There is a film about the air war with a lot of filming vintage airplanes of the First World War, and there are stupid attempts at humor, which Blake Edwards seems to think he needs to insert into each of his pictures, whether it is appropriate or not. In this case, not It was. The only truly redeeming qualities in this film are to look at the always beautiful lady Julie and hear her singing in this crystal clear bell-shaped soprano. Of course, if you love her, you can ignore the weaknesses of this film just because of her. After that, you can always tell yourself that this is damn better than sitting in STAR!
