Oh, man. How do I start on this piece of mucus? This is one of the few truly high-budget films on my list, which I actually found it wise to give 1 point, and this is not for production figures that are quite high. This film has absolutely no respect for the description in the Bible and regards the whole story as a ridiculous fantasy. I could not recommend it to anyone except how to see how low we became a society ... <br /> <br /> Firstly, Noah was absolutely not friends with Lot. Anyone who actually read Genesis could tell you that Abram was who they were thinking about. The authors simply tried to complement the story with the whole plot of Sodom and Gommore, and this seems out of place, because it is so. Noah is considered stupidly stupid ("You kissed! You kissed!"), But at least this is a step forward from Vojt's funny replay in Anaconda. <br /> <br /> However, these insults are pale compared to the heretical attitude to God in this film. God is portrayed as a petty, incomprehensible creature who changes his mind at the slightest whim. (“I’m forever perfect, but I could be wrong.”) What? Where do they get it from? That kind of God ... no one should ever pay any attention, much less worship, praise or love. What the director says in this, I do not claim to know. I just know that the responsible handling of Noah's Ark should not be such an easy way out. Shame on these people.
