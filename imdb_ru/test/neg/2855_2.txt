This movie is just dumb. Do not worry about it; believe me you are better. <br /> <br /> In short, the plot: the lawyer represents the person who killed his son and other children. Protecting her, she faces a Pinnochio wooden doll. She takes the doll home. Pinnokio is obsessed and starts killing people. <br /> <br /> This film is moving very slowly, but its end is so weak. The plot is very bad, and the musical accompaniment of Dennis Michael Tenney is pathetic. The story, written by Kevin S. Tenney, is simply meaningless and does not cause any horror or fear. This is far from his work on Demon Night and Witchboard, which are decent walks, but nothing special about it. His direction is fine, but with such a bad story no one could have made this film a good one. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: 2 out of 10, perhaps the most boring, most boring movie I've seen in the whole year,
