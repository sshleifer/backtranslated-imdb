I love documentaries. Andy Goldsworthy's document was great. I was looking forward to it, but I was very disappointed. I knew about Cana and was intrigued by the idea of ​​his lonely death in the men's room at Penn Station. I must have mistakenly thought that there should be a story. The only story here is about sadly deceived women who had a relationship with an ugly little famous married man. In the absence of some sort of explanation for this guy’s horrible behavior, we are given endlessly repeated clips of Kahn walking around and painfully long - supposedly contemplative - pictures of his soulless buildings. In fact, some of the buildings are interesting, but the push The film asks us to think about the guy himself. The overloaded soundtrack refers to an emotional jerk that is completely absent from the film. The obvious gifts of Kahn do not justify his behavior and do not torment his mistresses. It seems that this film wants to give Kahn freedom for a great artist, and thereby make the director and his mother like cute figures - I don’t buy him.
