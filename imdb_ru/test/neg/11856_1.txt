So bad, this is interesting, especially during the cocktail hour, and, believe me, you will need a beer, a drink, or whatever, to get through this turkey. Where do they get financial support for such “horrible” clicks behind the numbers? The funny thing about this film is to predict which characters will be eaten and in what order, and destroy the so-called “uniform” worn by “military” jokers. By the way, predators are not those predators we met in the “Jurassic Park”, but related species. (Sorry, there are no spoilers. You will need to look at it to find out for yourself). Do not expect the plot to make sense, however simple it may be, just hit the road. You can make it a game ... drink again every time you hear a certain sound ... or better yet, every time someone crunches a "predator." If you're lucky, you do not even remember how you watched this film "C-class", created for television!
