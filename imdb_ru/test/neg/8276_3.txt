The title of this review is about how I feel about this movie. I can't imagine what the audience would be for this thing, if it weren't for the die-hard fan of the slasher films of the 1980s, who just need to see everything from that era. Otherwise, don't even waste your time on it. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to most films of this type: with one of the characters in the debut scene, something terrible happens that inspires the bloodthirsty killer to go for a murderous frenzy. Been there, done that. In truth, none of these 80s slashers were known for their originality, so I see no reason to use this film just for that. <br /> <br /> But the failure of the film is in his expectation. and murder. I saw some pretty scary slasher films from the 1980s, which had a much lower budget than this one. This one simply cannot create any real expectation. The director adds some good camera angles and some semi-professional directorial touches here and there, but they mean nothing if you are not scared. The blood is also pretty tame, so anyone who watches these things with the intention of seeing some cool makeup effects from the 1980s will be sadly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film manages to be pretty boring. To be honest, the key component of almost any slash is hard stimulation - you need to quickly promote things and regularly plot murder plots, because let's face it, we don’t watch these things and star plots. But because of the script or editor all the time off. The killings are spaced out at odd intervals, leaving us with some intricate scenes (no doubt intended to create a “character”) that serve only to tire you and make you pray for the next kill (which, as I said, usually Equally not so good). <br /> <br /> As for the killer, do not expect anything original or even frightening. He (or she?) Wears a tracksuit, a fencing mask, and his (or her?) Main weapon is a sword. I bet the writer just thought that he had come up with an original, "cool" murder weapon, but the idea just seems impractical and stupid. Also, not much attention is paid to the character of the film "whodunnit", as if they either forgot or did not want to put red herring in the mix to confuse us. <br /> <br /> I have a feeling that the people behind it tried to do something decent and respectable, and sometimes it shows that their intentions were probably a bit more sincere in terms of creating quality film, unlike countless other fakes from that era. But, alas, For the most part, this attempt failed. However, there is a pretty good game (at least for this type of movie). There is an attempt to characterize, but none of them ends up meaning something in the end, so ... What a waste. Here, all he manages to do is freeze the plot and make the murder episodes feel that they cannot come soon enough. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you're really in these old 80s slashers, by all means, check it out, if only to say that you saw it. We are all full. But don't expect to be torn down or anything. What we have here is a very boring slasher film that leaves no real impression.
