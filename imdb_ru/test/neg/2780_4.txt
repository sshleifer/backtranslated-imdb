Dark Harvest is a very low-budget production, created by a group of fans, which manages to become a kind of semi-professional film. Unfortunately, bad effects, a wooden game and a non-original story make it, at best, a very mediocre horror killer. “Dark Harvest” is by no means the worst horror movie I've ever seen, it's just that there is nothing special in it, and there is nothing in it that could serve as a basis for a second hour or hope for a continuation. You know that the director has doubts about their own horror film, when a) there is some senseless nudity and b) the film is so short that they add pretty boring pictures in the final credits that nobody really needs because the film was not so good! The slightly better film I could not help but feel was the inspiration for Dark Harvest - the film of the eighties “Scarecrow”, which is a good film, but still quite average. <br /> <br /> Dark Harvest is not as bad as some other comments say it is, but I don’t think that you will be entertained too. One thing I also have to comment on is Angela's character with a terrible English accent! What is the point of this ?! Maybe give him a certain touch of class? Yes, right! The British DO NOT say “WAAHTAAH” when they want to say “water,” and I don’t care what part of England they are from! If you can't find a real English actress or a non-English actress who can put on a brilliant English accent (not many of them are about), then DON'T BUM! Sheesh! Final score: 4/10
