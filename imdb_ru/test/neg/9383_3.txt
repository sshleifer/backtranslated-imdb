When Jan Swankmayer lets his imagination run wild, be prepared. You like dark, heart-rending films such as Alice and Little Otik, or short gems such as Into the Cellar and Jabberwocky. All of these are wonderful films that, at best, represent exciting, surreal cinema. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, when Svankmayer tries to make a political statement of any kind, you are advised to leave the room in a hurry. Swankmayer’s films in this vein are, as a rule, both teenage and preaching, with a capricious image of a straw man repeating his pseudo-brilliant intuition. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, “Madness” is the last type of movie. Cartoon ideas and characters stretch to paper for a terrible two hours. There are a few moments that arouse interest for a while, but these several oases are separated by huge desert boredom. <br /> <br /> If you found Swankmaker’s terrible, monotonous short film “Et Cetera” brilliant and funny, you probably like “madness”. If you have never seen Swankmayer before, please start elsewhere.
