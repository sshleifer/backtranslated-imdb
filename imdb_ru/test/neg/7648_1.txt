Political messages are usually broadcast on television, so if you are a big fan of environmental correctness, keep an eye on the content. Most people go to the movies to have fun, not to sell some political nonsense. The hook here is a cast with a big name. Unfortunately, the sum of the performances is equal to the whole film, which has come to nothing. The two best plays, Chris Cooper and Richard Dreyfus, have minimal screen time. In short, “Silver City” should be avoided as entertainment. This is nothing more than an undocumented, incoherent political disclosure about illegal immigration, environmental pollution and many other reasons that have nothing to do but on a small screen. - MERK
