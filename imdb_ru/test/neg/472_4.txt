A person with a screaming brain is a story of greed, betrayal and revenge in a small Bulgarian town. William Cole, a rich industrialist, ends up replacing part of his brain with the brain of Russian taxi driver Yegor. These two could not be more different, but they are united by one thing - both were killed by the same woman. Returning to life as a mad scientist, William and Egor form an unlikely partnership to track down their common enemy. <br /> <br /> Bruce Campbell returns to the horror film “B” genre, which gave him cult status, this time not only in front of the screen, but behind the lens. Unfortunately, this time the laughter is not delivered, and Campbell has to resort to what he does best to fill the gap in this film. <br /> <br /> As a Campbell fan who has movies, books, and action figures, I was hoping to add another hit to my collection. Although, having watched this movie before buying it, I am glad that I have no “pleasure” to add it. <br /> <br /> At first, the film does not go as it seems at first glance. like a harmless fun, but it turns out to be a boring stretch. What is sad to say, because it was written by Mr. Campbell himself. Comedy never really sounds, it only makes us scratch our heads. It looks like Campbell’s fun stuff ended, as a result of which viewers saw what we already saw ... he struggles with himself. <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi, brother of the director of Evil Dead, Sam Raimi, is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. He brings to it a fresh and interesting time when the film really needs it. It helps if you are a fan and followed these puppets from the Evil Dead to Xena, so I felt obligated to love this movie. <br /> <br /> Campbell’s experience as a director, ranging from directing television episodes to the Hercules TV series, is obvious. Campbell makes the film work quite well, even with a low budget. In the end, not so much for this, as one might hope, but Campbell's fans will be left behind, despite everything, unfortunately for this fan ... I will not.
