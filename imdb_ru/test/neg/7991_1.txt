This film is such a waste of time. I can not understand anyone sitting through this piece of garbage. Oh, I would love it when I was seven years old. I think a seven-year-old may have written and sent it. <br /> <br /> There is no script, no action, just rubbish. The best game is fighting cocks. I think I could knock down these ninjas, and I'm not the one you think is tough. It is completely unconvincing and did not arouse any interest. I yawned and laughed towards the end of the first ten minutes of the film. This is the one that will distract people from martial arts films. Great comedy, bad action movie.
