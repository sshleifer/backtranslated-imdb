I made great efforts to get this film after reading the comments on this site. I really do not have time to write reviews, but I felt that it was my duty as a scientific horror lover. This is only the second review I wrote. The other was for Dracula 3000. Now to the point. This movie sucks. Simply and easily. I kept wondering if I watched the same film as those who wrote all these “cute” comments. I saw movies with bad effects, bad game, bad sound, you call it, and I saw it. But it really sucks. I don’t care how much it costs or shouldn’t be done, such films and Dracula 3000 should be banned, and the entire cast and film crew are arrested and imprisoned for murder. By the way, I have already said that this film sucks. I mean really sucks. The plot did not exist, and the game was weak. It seems that the author saw Pitch Black and was upset, because at first he did not think about such a plot, so he decided to make his own ripped version. But instead, the sucking factor took over and captured it. DO NOT LOOK THIS. You will be more fun if you take off your pants and sit on burning embers.
