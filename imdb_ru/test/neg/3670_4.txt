The casting (and direction) in Undercurrent is more tasteless than inspired by this noir-clacker, who cannot get off the ground from the very beginning. Robert Taylor's wooden style almost immediately sets up a checkpoint for the hard-hit Kate Hepburn, and from the very beginning it is bad chemistry. <br /> <br /> The naive and innocent Ann Hamilton (Hepburn) falls in love with the beautiful aircraft manufacturer Alan Garroway (Taylor) and rushes to the altar with him. Soon she learns that she does not know much about her. As Alan becomes more distant, she delves into a dark past, and soon Ann finds herself living in an American nightmare, not an American dream. <br /> <br /> The underwater current resembles several of Hitchcock’s plots, but Vincent Minnelli quickly establishes that he is not a master of suspense. Hepburn is a non-shrinking violet, and it's hard to sell to a character that is more appropriate for Teresa Wright’s or Joan Fontaine’s low-key styles. Minnelli never manages to force Kate to desperately postpone Taylor's limited abilities as an actor. Her attempts seem silent Gish, while Taylor's wide immersion in madness takes on the low-key Belo Lugosi. Robert Mitchum completes the mistake as a sensitive brother. Talk about piling up. <br /> <br /> Filmmaker Karl Freund offers some very stylized noir interiors, but Minnelli and the cast members meekly use atmospheric effects, and the voltage stays cool. With Minnelli away from his forte (musicals) and the role of Hepburn's victim, suitable for her as a bad suit, Undercurrent drowns all involved.
