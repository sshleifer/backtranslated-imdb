Well, after the excitement around the movie and after Surya marked the movie as PATH-BREAKING, I entered the theater, waiting for something big. The boy was disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characteristics in the film are so strange! What wife will do what Kundhavi (Jyotika) did? Idiot, cool cool? And what is the point of her standing in the rain with her child (Little Sreya) after she and her husband quarreled? What was the purpose of this scene anyway? For a start, vulgarly shot "Maya Maya"? The song was not only aesthetically not canned, but not necessary in the script. NOT NEED EVERYTHING! Secondly, the first half had almost no history. The entire first half was FREE. Each scene in the first half of the film had no meaning for the real story of the film. And also, how did Aishwarya (Bhomika Chawla) change so radically suddenly? And how did Gautam (Surya) and Kundhavi lead a happy life together after six years, although they were SO unhappy in marriage with each other? And if Gautam loved Aishwarya as he claimed that he loved, then why did he marry Kundhavi, even if it was his uncle's death wish? WHAT FOR? This is a question you keep asking while watching a movie! And how fair is the ending of Aishwarya? In the end, she was the first wife of Gautam? Krishna, the director of the film, claimed that he worked on the script for this film for two years, but his script is full of flaws and leaves the audience extremely annoyed! Third, the unimaginable pictorial images of Krishna about the amazing Rahman are simply disappointing. Surprisingly, editing Anthony (usually excellent) for the song "New York Nagaram" just sucks! The whole song looked like a slideshow made at Microsoft Power Point! “Munbe Vaa” Rangoli chorus was wasted showing Gautham, FOOTBALL PLAYER !!! Who wants to see how the crazy dude plays football during such a beautiful choir?!? Moreover, the entire film needed only two songs. Manbe Waa and Kummi Adi. The rest of the songs, including "Machakari", "Maaja Maaja", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kaadhal", are simply not needed. Rahman's wonderful efforts are simply in vain for a stupid film shot by an amateur director! Fans of Rahman, you ask why Rahman continues to move to Bollywood. Looking at how his songs are depicted in Kollivude why he wants to stay here? What is even more annoying is that after Krishna decided to include Makakari in the film, the song was cut in half, which is really annoying. <br /> <br /> Surya looks beautiful in her new passions, except for those on college scenes. and packs in such and such work. His expressions in all the songs in which he appeared do not really correspond to the way the singer sings songs. Jotika even starred in the film? All she did was GDC! Would you call all this crying actors? One of her worst performances! Moreover, her new hairstyle does not suit her. She looked much better in Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu. Her costumes during the song "New York Nagaram" are not yet finished. Bhomika Chawla is great during the movie and does justice to her role. Comedy Vadivela annoying. When someone watches him, he wants them to slap him in the face. This is Santhanam, which is theft of the show during comedy scenes. And why the hell did Sukanya even agree to play such a tiny role that anyone could play? And why is her makeup so heavy when she has the perfect complexion? Music by A.R. Rahman is just awesome. Machakari, Munbe Wa, New York and Gillun Oru Kaadhal deserve special mention. Cinema RD Rajasekara is fine and not as good as in his previous films, although the landscapes during the song "Kummi Adi" deserve special mention. Editing Anthony is really very disappointing. The film is just damn creepy, and it can be hard cut. <br /> <br /> Krsna's referral is just crap. Dialogues (AS Duray and Krishna) are too commonplace to digest, especially the part in which Bhomika declares his love for Surya. The script and script (Krishna) are terrible. The film is moving at a more uninteresting pace. And the script of Krishna is just full of inexplicable plots. <br /> <br /> And for God's sake, why is there so much advertising in the film? Pepsi, Maggi, Suzuki, you name it. Did the film producer (K.E. Gnanavel) have a limited budget, or was he just desperate? Overall, Jillunu Oru Kaadhal is a raw idiot. With such a name, you would expect a love story that warms and cools the heart, but in the end you will get a horribly spoiled love story. Indeed, very disappointing.
