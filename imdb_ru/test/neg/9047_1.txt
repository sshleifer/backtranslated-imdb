Snore blood. I saw this piece of horrible, smelly, worthless junk in the Cameo Cinema Hall (now the famous Krobar Nightclub) on Washington Ave. I was 17 years old, and my three buddies laughed at a terrible, rough, piece of trash. The theater was on its last legs, and there were mostly drunk, snoring and sleeping in place. They didn't miss the damn thing. The worst actors in history. These actors deserve an Oscar for the worst, and I mean the worst acting roles in film history. There was a joke, in the theater they showed another Mi Mi Lay (at least a great name!) Vile City. Enough said. If you are under 12 years old, you may catch a little cold. After 12 years you will snore after the opening credits. It's amazing that someone spent a penny to create this film. And to think, this is considered a "cult" classic. YUK !!!!
