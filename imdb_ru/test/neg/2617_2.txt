Retro Puppet Master - full and complete CRAP. In particular, the dolls look stupid and trashy. The game was unforgivable, and the story was rancid. This film dates back to the past, where the dolls were first created, this is not Puppet Master. Retro Puppet Master is rated PG-13, the first Puppet Master rated PG-13. The film contains neither horror nor suspense. The fact that this film was a Puppet Master film is amazing, because there is no bucket of blood, good acting or any entertainment in this game, as in previous films. Do not watch this film, do not shoot it, and do not even watch it on TV, because this film is stale, not violent and completely crappy. out of 10. As a Puppet Master fan, I'm disappointed ... seriously.
