Following the star of Dylan Moran from the charming misanthrope bookshop owner in the surrealistic comedy series Black Books, I could see his comic potential imploring to be used in the theater or on big cinema prospectuses. This first major screening starring (he had a cameo in the role of Rufus, a thief in Notting Hill) had many promises, but, like the overloaded car Steve Coogan, “Parole Officer”, too many folds, which needed to be smoothed out into preproduction. <br /> <br /> The plot is so confusing that I will not repeat the smallest details (in the script, each character does it for us), and the laughter comes from jokes in show business. Michael Kane - pompous, he directed the production of Richard III, updated to the Nazi occupation (one of the few genuine laughter, a satirical attack on Jan McKellen), in which everyone always welcomes Hitler every time they go on stage, Convincing Dylan that Acting must be a conceptual act in itself; these two conspiracies are going to steal money from some fairly harmless gangsters through their acting skills. There is confusion (both on the screen and in the audience), between Dylan and the daughter of one of the gangsters, blah blah blah, there is a romantic plot, and Dylan puts on strange clothes and makes funny accents. Michael Kane offers several choices, and Dylan's comic time for money, so why is this not good? He does have a certain charm that you expect from Film 4, but he also has a premature little girl playing the role of a compass in a confusing and irrelevant plot — no-no in scenario 101. Exposure overshadows everything else. You just want to see how Moran and Kane act like comic foil on each other, as it was at the beginning, but when they are together at the end, the connection loses its charisma. <br /> <br /> Actors are a fun, if not enthusiastic, effort. If he comes to the TV on a rainy Tuesday afternoon, then be careful. Otherwise, you'd better watch your old Black Books videos or rent Withnail & I.
