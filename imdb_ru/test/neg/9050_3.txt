An easily forgotten story in which the mercenary Kerman and the employer Agren travel through the jungle in search of the missing sister Agren. <br /> <br /> Despite its connection to the family of cannibal films, this film is rather the extreme version of Rene Cardon’s “Guyana - The Crime of the Century.” Lenzi clearly seeks to use (at that time) the brutal massacre in a swindler, a smug fanatic with a tendency to bigamy and only a hint of delusions of grandeur (with the ruthless play of Ivan Rassimov), with the result that his motley team flocks to himself inflicted oblivion. their unsuccessful coups, they eventually flee to Green Hell, only to face the locals and their notorious appetites. <br /> <br /> One of a series of violent blood festivals that appeared in the late seventies / early eighties when each new addition seemed to be participating in a one-on-one competition with its predecessor, trying to come up with the bloodiest and most graphic display ever created for movies. , In this lower release, all the motives and tricks of others are used, but with much less success. <br /> <br /> Were the so-called “Amazonian aborigines” who looked as if they were rejected by Bollywood (this film was made on the spot in Sri Lanka), or inept scenes of “decapitation” and “castration”, who seriously weakened the authenticity that was evident in the "Holocaust of cannibalism"? You can decide. Without spoiling the conclusion, it seemed that Lenzi was paying more attention to his shock and the climax of fear than to the basic requirement of a coherent ending, where all loose ends are solved. Very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> As in the case of others, where the scale of the graphic image of violence against people is limited (fortunately), the directors did not spare the extreme, causing the worst cruelty to unhappy animals in their pursuit of the most sadistic upheavals. Unfortunately, the only thing that is shocking in this film is that he appreciates the mention, among other things, that more convincingly affect the subject. <br /> <br /> If there are any recoverable features, Kerman is a friendly, albeit somewhat one-dimensional presenter, and his set of meagerly dressed colleagues (Agren, Lai and Senatore) provide some visual respite from the ruthless murders.
