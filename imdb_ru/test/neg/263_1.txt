This is officially a terrible, boring, banal and ridiculous film ever created. The film tells about a crazy child and his friends, and they get 747. His dreams are very banal and have no meaning, and they are very poorly made. Each special effect looks like it was made without any modern technology, and may have been created by a child who plays a “lead role” in the film. If you watch this movie, it will definitely make you more stupid. I advise you never to think about watching this movie, and if you do, good luck and do not miss the brain cells that you killed. My comment does not even completely cover the terrible creation from hell that was made. The person who wrote the comment before me, did not watch the same film, which I watched terribly, and it is a pity that I never watched. World.
