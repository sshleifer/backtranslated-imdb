I would like to write a short summary of the plot of this film, but ... it's just not there! If you just look at the plot keywords for this title, you pretty much get to know the entire content of the movie: sex, breast, exploitation, nudity of the female and female prison! 80 minutes of pure meanness and nothing more. “Escape of the Island Women” (an alternative name that is not even on the list) clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial classic “woman in prison”, but she absolutely lacks cruelty. WIP clicks are designed to mix graphic sex images with shocking violence, but the violence here has just been replaced by more sex. Directed by Erwin Dietrich, of course, can not compete with experts in this field, such as Jesse Franco or Joe D'Amato, and he should have done the usual soft clicks. The only aspects that are a bit like a cult movie are the likeness of the tyrant-president with Fidel Castro and the gang rape of a (young?) Girl soldiers. The girls, however, are amazing, and the filming location in Ibiza looks very charming.
