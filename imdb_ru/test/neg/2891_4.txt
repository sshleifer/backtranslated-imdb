This film, shot in New South Wales and dubbed “BURNING MAN” and “FLASH FIRE” in various editions, was problematic for producers from the very beginning due to a number of personal conflicts and long shooting times, which prematurely spent the allocated budget, and although The storyline is sometimes well detailed, lower than the standard post-production trim and excessively shortens the job. Tom Skerritt plays the role of Howard Anderson, an American entrepreneur with a “passion for construction,” who is building a tourist hotel in the Blue Mountains region, although he does not suspect that his business partner Julian Fein (Guy Doleman) insured an unfinished building for ten million dollars, far in excess of its real value, and plans to destroy it as a consequence of the usual summer makeshift fire in order to collect a beautiful amount through fraud. In accordance with this illegal scheme, Fein organizes the arsonist to commit an incendiary act, a young man who is also the boyfriend of Anderson’s daughter, and because the future resort is at the center of the critical fire danger sector (one of the many inexplicable script elements) Julian has all the expectations that his mean design will be created without serious interference. Since a local crime insurance company, most of which belongs to Fein, naturally, skeptical insurers, Lloyd's of London, send senior investigator George Engels (James Mason) to investigate the nature of a criminal offense made more sinister by death, the murder of an insurance investigator (Wendy Hughes), who, following the prompts, apparently approached the cause of the arson. The situation for the film is the week before Christmas, the cornerstone of summer in the Antipodes, the dramatic background, but the links in the plot are not complicated, which leads to the presentation of events that are difficult for the viewer to follow, the problem is exacerbated by the erroneous editing mentioned by intensive trimming and poor sound quality Images. Skerrit's semi-comatose and droning style is fatally annulled by this dull sound processing, but Mason is very effective, as always, and enjoys the best dialogue with Hughes, impressive as an investigator issued too early; Doleman wins the acting laurel with his play of evil Julian Fane.
