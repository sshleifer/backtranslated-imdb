I bought a DVD from a large bin for $ 4.99, thinking that I was lucky with some kind of documentary pearl that would actually show an extensive video of the Karakorum mountains and, in particular, K2. Rewinding the film forward, I reached the climax scene, on which climbers first saw ---- Mount Waddington, rising to all 13,260 feet in the coastal ridge of Canada. At least one of the few bozo destined to climb K2 clearly has no idea what a real mountain actually looks like - his friend and climbing partner should assure him that his partner would not lead this freak of the mountain. Considering that one of the provisions of the film is that 27 people died on K2 or so, you might think that the idiot in question could have taken a minute or two to get to know a few basic facts, but the clown seems to think that preparing such scale, although good enough for the likes of Reinhold Messner, below him. To be honest, I did not watch it all. What I saw makes me cringe. They say you get what you pay for. For $ 4.99, I was ripped off.
