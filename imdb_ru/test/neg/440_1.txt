This DVD does not match its name as a Heineken coaster ... This is a great example of why no one should watch a sequel with a different director / writer different from the original. Two hours of this turkey left me, asking the Exorcist 2 to repeat. <br /> <br /> There is NO legitimate laughter. NOT ONE worthy to scare. The script was just a mess, and I felt bad about the actors who had to perform it (they must have had sick relatives at home or because of the habit of calling a monster or something like that). <br /> <br /> The original was the guide for makeup effects. Naturally, the sequel producers thought it would be nice to abandon FX makeup and make werewolves CG instead. These CG werewolves made me laugh much more than any of the comedies. It was just a complete miss. If you want to have fun at night, rent the original again. Or go to a movie lesson and make your own horror movie. You have to do better than these fools.
