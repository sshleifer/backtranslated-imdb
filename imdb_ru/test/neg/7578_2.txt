I don't know, but the film was too similar to the other films I saw. Ring, Eye, Dark Water, they are all the same to me. Don't get me wrong, it's beautifully done, great camera work, great graphics, but this story is too ... too common. In the end, it is exactly the score that makes the wait, you know: screams, crashes. The characters in the film also do not react very naturally, moving very slowly, marveling at what they see. I know some people who love this film, and if you love it, I think it would not hurt to watch it. But if you watched the movie I mentioned above, and you didnâ€™t like it, I would advise you not to worry.
