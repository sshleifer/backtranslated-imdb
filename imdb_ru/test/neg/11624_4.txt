I was disappointed by the sequel to The Swan Princess. I can see what they were trying to do with the story, show how Odette and Derek lived, but the story was not interesting enough to attract my attention and seemed to embrace the same fundamentals as the original. <Br /> <br /> This is not funny. The only thing that seemed ridiculous to me was when Jean-Bob turned into a prince, and then again into a frog, and no one saw how it happened, and he tried to convince them that this was indeed the case. <br /> <br /> The villain is rubbish, and the animation is not as impressive as in the first movie. <br /> <br /> The queen is a very annoying character, and instead of cheering on Derek to save his mother, you hope that the villain casts a spell on her voice box so she can stop talking. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because I really liked the first film, but it didnâ€™t live up to my expectations.
