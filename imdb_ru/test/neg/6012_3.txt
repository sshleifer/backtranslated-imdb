Terrible adaptation of the low-key love story Heminuei. An American soldier (Rock Hudson) falls in love with a British nurse (Jennifer Jones) in Italy during the First World War. What's wrong with it? Almost everything. Hudson WAY from his depth here. He could be a good actor, but not in this film. Jones is too old for his role (she is 21 years old in a book - here she is 38 ... and it looks like this!). Also her game ranged between exaggerated and underestimated! They took a simple low-key love story and blew it all out with all their might. The film is deadly long (just over 150 minutes), indulgent and funny. It seems that producer David O. Selznik thought he was doing Gone With The Wind again. Some landscapes are really stunning (even on a small TV screen), but not enough plot to fit the images. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! The end where Jones dies should be tragic, but the bad play and bloated theatrical performances made me not laugh! <br /> <br /> Worse, the actor Vittorio De Sica overeats to a really embarrassing degree. Swollen, smug, poorly thrown and slow. Pretty badly This (understandably) financial and critical bomb put an end to Selznick's career as a producer. You might want to tune in to some of the scenery at the end, but it's really not worth it. I give it 3.
