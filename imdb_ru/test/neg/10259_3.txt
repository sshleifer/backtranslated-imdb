I just finished this unofficial adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's The Lurking Fear, shot in Louisiana. With the exception of a few changes (names, settings), this follows the story step by step for the first 70 minutes, but then tries to enter your own “twisting” completion that you could see at a distance of a mile. In any case, this is a much better adaptation than the “Hidden Fear” with a full moon. Too bad this is a terrible movie. Director David McCormick shoots this thing with all the talent of an industrial short. I swear, I counted maybe two camera movements. The creature's design is cheap (we are talking about masks bought in the store), but shot in a dark way (intentionally or not), where they are somewhat creepy. The most impressive thing in the picture is an abandoned mansion, but McCormick cannot use it either. This file is a good adaptation, poor performance.
