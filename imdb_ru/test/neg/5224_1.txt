This is quite possibly the worst movie ever made. I know people talk about how awful Ed Wood's films were (Plan 9), but this film makes Plan 9 look amazing. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris acts in a cameo role, for what reason I have no idea. Perhaps ruin his movie career. In addition to Chuck Norris, the cast consists of additional videos in day soap and Mike Norris ... that's true, Chuck's son. <br /> <br /> This director doesn't even have a resume, and I have no idea where the plot or script originated. It must have been the green light of the terrible southern Baptist priest, who for some reason had a third cousin to whom the studio belonged (which, I am sure, has since been closed). <br /> <br /> I really don't know what else to say about this movie. I would like to give you a brief summary of the plot, but I am lost. There is something in Jesus and Satan ... an eternal battle. In addition, there are Indians. And a bunch of fancy children who don't know how to behave ... they are just clumsy and shouldn't be filmed. I don't know what happened most of the time, but I know the film was a great laugh. Mike Norris is somehow pushing his daughter (by bicycle) to the street ... but in the frame he is in the middle of the park. So, somehow, she learns to ride a bike at a speed equivalent to the speed of “Flash”, and a car or a bus knocks her down ... I don't know. But she is dead. In fact, this is the funniest scene in the movie. I know it sounds bad, but as soon as you see how Mike raises his arms in victory, and then holds his head and screams in horror ... you will understand. It does not show that the daughter gets hit or something like that ... you just have to assume that she was hit by a car. But the film is not clear. So perhaps it was completely unrelated, and she died of cancer. Anyway ... after this, the film becomes really confusing, and I have no idea what is really going on. I am a Christian and I have no idea why this film was made. I see no value for this film in the religious or non-religious sector. This is probably the first thing that they show students in the movie "101" ... this is what you DO NOT WANT to do. <br /> <br /> Just look ... you hate him for me and for assuming that you see it.
