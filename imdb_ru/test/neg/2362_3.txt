This extremely profitable hybrid Blaxploitation / Kung-Fu was released in my country by a dubious DVD label, which usually speaks only of transferring pure crap to a disk, so this is not a very favorable messenger. In the same series, several other games were released, such as The Black Six, The Black Gestapo and The Black Godfather, and judging by all their low ratings and negative reviews, none of them belong to the elite The 1970s Blaxploitation deception or “TNT Jackson” is a pretty lousy movie that completely lacks a significant plot, but there are too many funny battle scenes and terrible games to compensate for this. Apparently Roger Korman ?? never hesitate to make easy money ?? instructed his two most loyal assistants to quickly come up with a simplified story that would appeal to fans of both oriental kung-fu movies and modern fashionable films “Blacksploatation”. As a result, Chirio H. Santiago and Dick Miller invented TNT Jackson; the story of a black ass traveling to Hong Kong in search of his missing brother. She quickly discovers that he has been killed by a criminal smuggling network of drugs and vows to avenge him. Mrs. Jackson smoothly penetrates the underground and encounters macho pimps, useful undercover agents, and a multitude of evil kung-fu fighters. Only one thing for sure; they all somehow want a piece of TNT's gorgeous body. I sincerely doubt that film concepts are becoming more elementary than that, but ?? unfortunately - all other aspects sucks too. The battle scenes are too long and, moreover, pathetically posed. Ginny Bell and other poor suckers struggle to look threateningly and take a tough stance, but in the end, all they ever do is kick into the air and stupidly jump over the rooms. Cinematography is terrible, the soundtrack is very disappointing (what happened to soul music?), Several dialogues are poorly written, and the acting performance is inferior. Speaking of this, Ginny Bell is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but still she cannot hold a candle to Tamara Dobson or Pam Greer. In TNT Jackson, there is only one really good and memorable scene, namely the famous battle in the hotel room, where Bell, completely naked, except for the panties, repeatedly turns the light on and off, at the same time knocking out some fools. A funny scene ... I just haven't figured it out yet, thanks to the ingenuity of the light switch or Bell's beautiful breast shape.
