Incredible. Great cast, fair game, interesting plot. <br /> <br /> But in this film there are such graphic cruelties that do not cause tension or thrills, but simply disturbing excitement. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Everyone could see how the freak returns to its habits. And that Robert Englund behaved (was he?) Like an idiot; Prohibiting your daughter from sleeping with a football player, but he is trying to kill an idiot and he likes kiddypr0n - is everything all right ?! <br /> <br /> A policeman whose daughter was kidnapped - did anyone feel that he was a policeman and not an actor? Not me. This film is delayed and ends with the final, which we see in other horror films: if everything was good, part 2 could have been made. Bad, really bad things. It can inspire goosebumps ...
