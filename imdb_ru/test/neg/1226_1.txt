She was waiting for the continuation of the “Lonely Pigeon”, but it was a complete trash. The cinematography was terrible. Shot too hard. Almost examined the Grand Canyon through a stationary telescope. Editing has been cut, cut, cut. Not even smooth. More like a bad student editor. I don’t know if McMurtry was playing on the screen, but the dialogue was terrible. Indeed, as Val Kilmer portrays Doc Holiday in Wyatt Erpe, but what the hell did he do with this character in Comanche Moon ??? I have no idea. It even looked like it was being filmed on a sound stage using old Bonanza sets. How can the director of the original Lonely Pigeon be mistaken with this? Where was his head .............. I can not say much about the acting game. It's a shame that he spoiled such a beautiful Western that could have been, but it’s more like they rushed to this one just to get it in the bank. I read other reviews and saw that others felt the same way. It is even curious to watch the next few nights, because it will be just a waste of time, like the first night. <br /> <br /> (2nd post) .............. .... Well, since there was nothing else on TV, I have to be honest and admit that I watched the last 2 nights of the Comanche moon. And I will be honest to tell you that I have not reached the end in any of the last 2 episodes, because I fell asleep! I can only admit that I watched the two main characters very closely and could highlight some of the manners that Steve Zahn made, portraying the character Duval had handled with it superbly. Therefore, I must pay tribute to Zana for this. As for the image of Karl Urbana .... just dead meat. I can only say once again that I was very disappointed only because I cared so much about the original LD ​​and, like the others ......., defended my feelings of a truly great western.
