This film had very few good moments, special effects and acting were terrible for sure. But it was a film shot with a small budget, so you donâ€™t expect much from him, he has some laughter (although I doubt that they are intended :)). The scene where the old woman bends down and touches the dung that was on the floor, then brings it to her nose and CHUPACRA! in a really stupid hoarse voice was priceless. In general, if you have nothing more to watch and you just want to laugh at a really stupid click, trying to capitalize on the success of the Blair Witch project, then you shouldn't worry.
