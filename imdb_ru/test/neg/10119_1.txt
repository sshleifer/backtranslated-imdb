First of all, I really can't understand how some people “enjoyed” this movie. This is the worst thing I've ever seen. It seems that even the actors are bored ... and I think that says it all! <br /> <br /> However, I have to applaud the creators of the opening credits - this team seems to have a really good future. That's why I recommend large studios to watch ONLY the opening credits and one or two sequences of special effects (if they look outside of this film, it’s almost like a good movie). <br /> <br /> Good luck (or judgment) next time for the producers of this, this ... of this "subject!"
