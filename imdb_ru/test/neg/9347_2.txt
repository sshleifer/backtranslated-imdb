After skipping this countless times at TCM UK, I decided to check it out, given his science fiction / adventure / camp lineage: I knew that a completely stupid trip awaited me - but it was also amazingly bad! In any case, perhaps taking into account the relevant characters, the script separates from many of the science fiction works of the recent vintage - SOYLENT GREEN (1973), ZARDOZ (1974), LOGAN'S RUN (1976) to the extent that it was filmed on some of Homemade sets!), STAR WARS (1977), ALIEN (1979) and MAD MAX 2: ROAD WARRIOR (1981)! <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but not quite attractive: by name we can conclude that there was little water on the planet where it all happens - so our villainous pirated heroes take responsibility to steal ice blocks from tyrannical Templar (!) rulers. Also involved is a beautiful princess (Mary Crosby, daughter of Bing!) In search of her father, the overthrown king; By the way, there is another famous offspring in the cast: Angelica Houston (John's daughter) as one of the pirate groups - fortunately, the actress’s mistake in accepting such a role will soon be forgotten after she won an Oscar (under the leadership of her father, not less) for HONOR PRIZE (1985). Because in Star Wars Peter Cushing was the High Commander, filmmakers preferred to have their own screen legend, 78-year-old John Carradine (who was seen tied to the operating table during his one short scene!). <br /> <br /> The most visible (for all the wrong reasons) are: a foreigner using the toilet; castration machine; awkward antics (including karate-style combat!) of inevitable companion robots; makeup blunt slave / eunuch, worn at one time heroes; repeated attacks of “cosmic herpes” (whatever that may be); the climax in which the characters grow old when they experience a temporary deformation (Crosby gets pregnant, gives birth and sees her son grow up within 30 seconds, while Robert Urich himself as the main character replaces the enduring John John Ford Hank Warden for this scene! ) - By the way, the jumps accepted here (intended to denote the rapid course of time) are not only unsuccessful, but simply annoying.
