I saw it last night at the Tribeca Film Fest, and the holy god was bad ... From script to editing, from acting to cinematography, none of this worked. Not to mention the sets / costumes that were so distracting for that period of time (it covers the years from the late 70s to 2006 or so). Even John Hurt, who is usually a terrific actor, was too funny. Quinten Crisp is a terrific guy from the start, of course, but Hurt was not allowed to work here. I do not know what else to say, except for the audience, which I saw with an absolutely loved one ... so maybe it's just me. But viewers like everything at film festivals when they sit next to the director and all the actors. This is not a very accurate test of how good the film is or how well it will play. Personally, I thought this movie was terrible. On the other hand, it was so terrible that it was fun. Get drunk and give him a chance when he comes out on HBO in 2 years, if he ever went that far.
