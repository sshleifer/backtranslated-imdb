This film looked like the result of deleted scenes from a school cinema experiment. It did not make sense! It worked well, but I only felt sorry for the characters, because they had to appear in this slop. Alien machines were created using Pentium I technology and without creativity, they were crabs! The under-lit and barely visible aliens were frisbees with their feet. WHERE WERE TRIPPODS? Editing by director / writer / producer / makeup artist / invader Latt occurs everywhere, some scenes are repeated many times. Most of this seemed to be filmed after Hurricane Katrina. The next time Latt wants to make a film, he needs to slap him. Only in 2005, he released 11 films! This does not include writing, editing, directing or credits for visual effects in other films. If everyone else is snotty, then he just makes fun of us. It was a confused Spielberg film, nothing more. I look forward to the Latte "BackBroke Ridge", "X-Man IIV", "The bumps have eyes".
