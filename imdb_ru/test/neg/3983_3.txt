The beginning of this film made me doubt that it would be a little more than a typical science fiction film. But, as it progressed, I became interested, and I understood everything to the end. The room is interesting, original, and it has ideas to make a classic. Alas, instead, he turned out to be a mediocre film, influenced by the usual factors that turn a potentially good movie into a bad movie (bad game, low budget, etc.). It is interesting for me to see how it will turn out, if it is redone with good actors and a big Hollywood budget.
