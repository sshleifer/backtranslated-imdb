seriously, if I wanted to make a film that makes no sense, it never will, and in which only lesbian scenes are the only highlight I could. <br /> <br /> David Lynch is the worst, like this film, anyone could have made the best film that would have given at least some answers, and the story was not so slow and wordy. the story means nothing without anything at the end except titles. What a waste of time. I will never return these 147 minutes of my life and hope that others can learn from my mistake.
