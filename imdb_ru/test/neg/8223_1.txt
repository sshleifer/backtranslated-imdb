Garden State was a mediocre movie at best. The film is more like a collection of thoughts that the writer had (Zach Braff), rather than a coherent story. A scattered plot might have been more attractive if it had not alternated with meaningless scenes that were nothing more than "fancy". Coincidentally, these scenes are often transmitted during a conversation (Zack, passing by the cranes, which are included during the passage, a crazy party on the stage, screaming over the gorge, the list goes on). <br /> <br /> The protagonist is flat, frustrating and, ultimately, unpleasant, which manifests itself most often in the scene where he talks to his father, selfishly ignores the problems of his fathers, including his recently deceased wife, and buzzes about his own "What should I do with my life?" The problem. <br /> <br /> The film ends when Andrew (Zach Braff) decides not to return to Los Angeles because he cannot tear himself away from the love of his life, Sam (Natalie Portman), whom he knew for 2 days., Which can only lead me to the conclusion that the ideal I film is that love at first sight cures professional dilemmas ... Of course, you can interpret this as assigning priorities, but if that were the case, it could have been done better. Much better. <br /> <br /> This film doesn’t know what he wants to be. Drama, comedy, teenage waste film or a range of other things. I’m not saying this as a person focused on one genre, but as a person who loves a lot of genre plays, such as those that were mastered by stanley kubrick. The reason I feel that this is not working for Garden State is that instead of mixing genres together, he jumps around; one scene - one genre, another - another, and vice versa, and so on. <br /> <br /> I heard many people tell me to weaken Zach Braff a little, because this was his first feature film, and he debuted as a director, writer and main actor. Impressively, since this was the first film, I have to think that with as much money as he has, he could have done more. There were much better directors of the first feature film (Michelle Gondry "Human Nature", David Gordon Green "George Washington"). Perhaps if he continued writing OR directing OR acting, it would be better. Zach Braff - a talented performer, perhaps his second attempt will not be so tedious and scattered.
