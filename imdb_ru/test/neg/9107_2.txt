Wow ... this is a movie that makes you wonder who it was and what kind of cuisine they are eating now. To say that it was bad is an insult to bad films that we all know and love. <br /> <br /> When I saw the name of Guttenberg in the TV program, I thought it would be a fake ... maybe it should have been, I could make a better movie. <br /> <br /> Look for the scene when they fly in an airplane, when the door is open and there is no wind like ever before. At least they could find a fan. <br /> <br /> Look for several actors from Canada and a c-list in the film. This is a movie that litters cable b-rate stations that you never watch except on a rainy Sunday.
