A scientific experiment designed to create a superhuman being failed. The creators were trapped in a remote desert outpost, pursued by their own creation mercilessly and mercilessly. I called the outpost to help eliminate the horror that is now hiding somewhere in the dark halls. James, along with his son and daughter, are soon trapped inside with others, desperately trying to survive. there is no escape ... "The Outpost" / "Mind Ripper" is very unoriginal. The sets are pretty claustrophobic and have a bit of blood in them. However, like horror, he fails at almost all levels. weak and filled with big holes, and the ending is extremely predictable. The so-called master Wes Craven produced this one - I wonder if he is pleased with this garbage. Joey Gayton directing without any style. The game is terrible, only Lance X Enriksen can act at all. Well, I'm a big fan of horror and was bitterly disappointed. Avoid this like the plague - this is again the same old boring nonsense!
