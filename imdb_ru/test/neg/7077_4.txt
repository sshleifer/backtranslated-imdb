STARS RATING: ***** Missed **** Very good *** Good ** You could go to dinner instead * Avoid at all costs <br /> <br /> The tale of the title Adam (Mark O 'Halloran ) and Paul (Tom Murphy), two drug addicts in the slums of Dublin and their daily fuss in their meaningless lives in search of the next correction that will make their day. Along the way, they are trying to reconcile with close relatives and friends whom they have managed to bring and destroy over the years. <br /> <br /> I know that many Irish people like to drink, but it seems that some of them also have problems with heroin, apparently in this film. I know that there is a small problem with drugs, as in many parts of the world, so another comic look on this subject is not entirely unexpected. <br /> <br /> I don’t know, remember the last Irish film that I saw (the film was shot in a style that makes it stand out from any film that I saw lately!) And judging by this, obviously, I’m not enlightened in their humor, as it might be, the film is rather funny in some parts, but this is obviously another comedy that is not afraid to cause sharpness. The scene in which a mentally retarded boy is robbed along a lane is certainly true of what a couple of drug addicts could do to feed their habit, but nevertheless extremely contemptible, and I'm not sure that it was dark humor in any way but it certainly didn't cause a smile on my face! It also contrasts sharply with their previous actions, when they saw their soft side jiggling the child back and forth. In light of this, some may find the end sad, others just desserts. <br /> <br /> In general, I just did not understand the meaning of the film. I did not see any motivation in the “story” she told. It seems that he just walks without any audience participation. Unlike Trainspotting (which dealt with similar topics!), This is mostly an unsuccessful effort that put me on the verge of falling asleep, even though it has a very short 83-minute work time. In fact, no more pleasant than after two real addicts during the day. **
