Is this "realism"? If Rivette tried to give us a ground-level study about a woman in a certain place and time and how she could influence (and was influenced by) the world around her, he failed. This is especially noticeable because we never understand why thousands of men would follow her into battle. Certainly, the cultural-historical context is not enough to determine the country's need for such a savior, and God knows there is nothing particularly charismatic about Joan, since she is represented here. Unless Bonner’s wooden postures and flat-line testimony should not indicate transcendental faith and determination. Using the landscape is especially boring - we never lose the feeling that we are watching twentieth-century actors roaming the supposedly medieval landscape. As for the battle scenes (which, unlike some commentators, claim to occupy a good 15% of screen time) - they look like certain historical clubs from your local high school, recreating a medieval siege, although children no doubt invest in this more passion. . However, I pay tribute to Rivette for portraying Joan's side, not included in other films: the role of an irritable, naive and narcissistic teenager (in which a woman plays too explicitly, at least twice as much as the character she must be to portray) clearly not able to understand her place in the movement she helps create, or the world that exists outside of her own passions. Joan’s outrage over the fact that her own soldiers swear and wonder at the enemy because of their disrespect and obedience to her is completely unexpected and believable notes (you suddenly realize that such moments naturally had to happen) in a differently unattractive historical "Submission". Unfortunately, they also serve to indicate exactly what is not reflected on the screen - what made Joan SPECIAL? I have to say that I also continued to be puzzled and disappointed by some foreign movie lovers, who equate boredom and lack of dramatic participation with “artistry” and “seriousness”. Does this film really increase our understanding or involvement in the subject? Or with something on this? 4/10.
