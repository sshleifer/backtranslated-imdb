I watched this movie a few nights ago, and it was awful! <br /> <br /> Terribly long - although they managed to miss most of his life! <br /> <br /> Terribly boring - the roles included in them were verbose, and for some reason the director chose to cut off some of the actions and left huge parts of the film inexplicable! <br /> <br /> Terribly inaccurate - the whole “mystical” side of this film was a joke, and the last time I checked, Genghis Khan was not a good guy! <br /> <br /> Terribly acted - it was difficult for me to believe in some characters, they were very two-dimensional, they lacked, and, as it were, depth! <br /> <br /> Cinema became the saving grace of the film. That's why I gave this movie 2 stars, and not the absolute minimum! However, if you want to look at something beautiful, I would recommend to buy a painting instead! <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was a terrible waste of my time and money! Please do yourself a favor and give this Mongolian turkey a miss!
