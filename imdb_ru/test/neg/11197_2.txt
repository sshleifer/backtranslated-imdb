I mean, come on! This film had such good potential, but it looks like they ran out of scripts, and they just telegraphed the entire damn remaining film about 2/3 of the way. Characters begin to set out these films for the whole reason for the existence of other characters who do not ask for information in extremely fragile rooms. They also fall into some kind of stereotypical behavior, because it must be what is expected in this movie genre. This is really very sad, because this film could have been much larger. <br /> <br /> I really hoped it would be a good movie. It was a good game. Mark Hamill does an excellent job until the film falls apart, as does Sally Struthers. It was fun to see how they work and succeed in their craft. Madjandra Delfino was pretty good for a while until her lines became untenable. I was sad for her that she had to say these lines, which simply filmed the entire credibility of the films for any thinking viewers. Brad Hunt does an excellent job. He does have an amazing range of talent, judging from another one of his films that I recently saw, Lucky 13. (that was crap). This guy could be a star if he could choose the right scripts and get lucky with the right director. <br /> <br /> Almost forgot! The music was so heavy that you might think that this project was transferred to some small film school for evaluation. I call this music “Teller Music” because you can just say what will happen next based on the music. Less is better. <br /> <br /> Cut out half the music from this movie, find a good movie editor, a small correspondence or two, and it will be a very good movie.
