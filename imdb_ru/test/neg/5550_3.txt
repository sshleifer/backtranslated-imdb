No matter what you say about the movie “The Wizard of the Mountain”, Herschel Gordon Lewis, you should recognize that from his first films (the dirty Feast of Blood in 1963 and the massacre of Two Thousand Maniacs in 1964) to his last (1972 "Gore Girls"), the man remained faithful to his muse, happily chopping the bodies of boys and girls to trick the camera. For example, in Gore Grief someone cripples strippers with a pasty face and in a test at Tops & Bottoms club, and an unpleasant Ex-Detective Gentry is hired by a hot reporter to help in this matter. Awesome and repetitive background music, terrible lighting, terrible play, disgusting characters, problem sound and, of course, some of Lewis' patented scenes. Thus, one of the strippers pushes her face into boiling oil; her head is torn off; the other strokes her face and cuts off her nipples, and yet another her ass is coated with meat tenderizer until all its back part is covered with Buitoni tomato sauce. (I could be wrong here; maybe it was Ragoo.) The film also throws out a rather weak humor, although some lines are quite funny. For example, we learn that the real name of the murdered stripper Suzy Krimpuff was ... Ethel Krimpuff! The bottle with acid says “Made in Poland” (I don't know why, but I thought it was funny). And some of the lines of the owner of the strip club, Henny Youngman, are of course fun. However, this is not a film to show aunt Ethel or sister Agatha. This is one of the most painful cases that you have ever seen, with only one unmistakable moment pleasing the crowd - the title page in the conclusion of the film, which reads "We announce with pride: this film is over!"
