Ok, enough already. this is a terrible piece of television. camera work is terrible (should I remind you of crunchy gravel, so loud that you can hardly hear the actors say), Lady Bertram has the most annoying voice in the whole world. Anna Massie "acts" in such an incredible way. and the lack of chemistry between fanny and edmund goes beyond. In addition, the bertram girls are not beautiful enough, and the guy playing Henry Crawford is terrible. to say that camera work is tricky - an understatement. I watched this adaptation for Christmas and I think that under any other circumstances I could not bear it, and certainly could not justify the time spent. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Jane's faithful adaptation. thus, I could not endure the adaptation of the film or the recent film of pride and prejudice. but look at any other adaptation instead, even Emma is better than this one.
