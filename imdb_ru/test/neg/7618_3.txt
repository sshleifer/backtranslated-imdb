Once I watched a bit of this film, and it was interesting to see it completely, just to understand why critics give it two stars, as a result I agree. Essentially, the film begins with Kermit Frog (Steve Whitmir) telling all his Mappet buddies that they have lost everything, and he eventually sits depressed (and perhaps thinking about suicide) on the bench. Meanwhile, in another world (in heaven), angel Daniel (David Arquette, who was already in “Kuklah from Space”) is visiting Boss (Whoopi Goldberg, another reason I wanted to watch the movie) to show that Kermit really needs help. Kermit, Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson, not the original and best Frank Oz), Gonzo (Dave Goelz), Fozzy Bear (also Jacobson), Pepe the Shrimp (Bill Barrett) and all the other dolls prepared for many people to see during the Christmas holidays, and it all seems to be going well. But really mean Rachel Bitterman (Joan Cusack) is determined to either close the show or the theater, and Kermit is doing everything possible to prevent this from happening. Of course, Kermit fails for the last time, and Bitterman tells him that they have finished, and she can officially take over the theater. This is the place where Daniel is sent as Kermit's guardian angel to try to help him, but Kermit is not in the mood and eventually ends up saying: “I wish I could never be born”. Obviously, you can recognize the parody of "This is a beautiful life" with Kermit as George Bailey and Cusack as Mr. Potter, and, after all, Kermit obviously understands how much he means to everyone, and returns to find the theater. saved as a historical landmark. Also starring is Whitmere as Rizzo the Rat and the beaker; Goltz as Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Waldorf; Barrett in the role of Dr. Zubov, Rowlf the Dog and the Swedish Chef; Jacobson as Beast and Yoda (the only personage similar to the Oz version), William H. Macy as Glenn, Matthew Lillard as Luke Fromage, Carson Daly, Molly Shannon; Scrabbs Zach Braff, Sarah Chulk, Neil Flynn, John S. McGinley and Judy Reyes, Mel Brooks as Joe Snow; Brian Henson as Scooter and Janice; Jerry Nelson as Robin Frog, Statler, Pops and Floyd Pepper, and Kevin Klash as Sam Eagle. The most memorable moment for me is the stage deception "Moulin Rouge", moreover, and persons known in it, but not fiction. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for outstanding music and lyrics for the song “Everyone Matters.” The dolls were number 47 per 100 of the greatest icons of pop culture. Adequate!
