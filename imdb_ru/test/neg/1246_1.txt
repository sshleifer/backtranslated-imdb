This is probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Whether or not, a solid letter is required. The same goes for directing and acting. I know that these actors can play (I saw them in Sporanos, etc.), but this film is very bad, very bad. Maybe this is a script, maybe this is a director. Probably a bit of both ..... Probably a lot of both! Technically, everything is in order, just bad, bad, bad ... I have a theory that supporters of this film also own poker magazines, because I saw a very favorable review in one of the magazines. "Hey, we did it, so it should be good, right?" Not so fast, Bucky. I know that it takes a lot of hard work and money to even make a film that is much less sold and distributed, and for that I recommend these people. But the final product leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth. <br /> <br /> P.S. I won a free rental and chose this movie from the blockbuster. Tomorrow I will return my money.
