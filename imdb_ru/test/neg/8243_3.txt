I generally liked to shoot Kerry in films, but this one is actually pretty awful. Laughs very little, because everything is so intrusive. There are many talents on screen, and some of them are better than others. June Whitfield, Kenneth Williams, Hattie Jacques and Peter Butterworth are fine, but Barbara Windsor looks tired and Syd James is simply tasteless. Joan Sims comes off well, but in the case of the usually wonderful Charles Hotry it's just sad. When you think of the sad end of his career, the film is almost too depressing to watch. Homophobia in the film is disgusting and it is a very unpleasant experience. The set looks cheap and unlike other films in the series, the film is very clearly set in England. The sea side looks cold, and there are few attempts to create any illusions. It looks like cheap production. You will be surprised at how unhappy you have become to watch this, especially if you liked the show.
