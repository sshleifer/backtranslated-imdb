In the remake of the 1942â€™s major and minor, Jerry Lewis enters the role originally played by Ginger Rogers, but unfortunately, this anemic adventure misses much more than just Ginger. Lewis is trying to pass for a child while boarding a train; he is successful, but deception leads to a series of comic and romantic delusions. Sydney Sheldon adapted the script, throwing up musical moments for Dean Martin (playing another one in his stable from the second bananas) and a subplot about looting gems (which is terrible). Diane Lynn, who played the cunning teenager in the original film, plays the love interest of Lewis here. She is cute; Jerry is not. * 1/2 of ****
