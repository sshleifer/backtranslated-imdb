VERY not Tom and Jerry short. Jerry tells this story, which revolves around cat in love Tom, who loses it because of rival Butch. Tom is Jerry's best friends, and that annoyed me a little. The cartoon is also presented in Cinemascope. In general, I found this cartoon by Tom and Jerry sad and depressing. Instead, you just had to put the “DVD Puss Receive Download” on a DVD, and I would be happy. This experimental animated short film can be found on the 2nd disc of the Spotlight Collection from Warner Brother. This is the last movie on the set, and I hope that Warner Brothers will soon release the second volume. <br /> <br /> My rating: C-
