Funny thing. Charlie Sheen, Donald Sutherland, Sam Waterston and Stephen Lang had incredible performances. Who can forget Sheena as the naive maiden on Wall Street or Sutherland as the cynical surgeon of the Korean War at MES? Waterston and Lang also had successful television and film careers (Law and Order, The Killing Fields, Tribeca De Niro, etc.). So what in this world could any of these beautiful actors do in such a smelly bomb? <br /> <br /> The plot of the Washington coup in Shadow Conspiracy is not so bad, unoriginal, maybe, but not so bad. But with a few changes it could still be interesting. <br /> <br /> The main problem of Shadow Conspiracy is execution. At the beginning of the film, Shin, an extreme political consultant, absurdly and improbably resolves a potential mistake in public relations, blackmailing the congressman. Later, a shootout with dumb assassin Lang, ripping half of what was supposed to be Georgetown, is explained in the news as "gang wars." Has anyone remotely associated with this film ever lived one day in Washington? Sheen about 20 years old is too young, too young to be so senior in the White House administration. Tire's reaction to preventing a political crisis is so overwhelmed with false courage that it looks as if he was studying at the David Hasselhoff acting school. And when was the last time gang wars spread to Georgetown? We are talking about the Washington area, where citizens voted against the subway stop so that they can maintain their exclusivity. <br /> <br /> I agree with another reviewer that this film would have been unbearable without the fast forward button. , A year ago, I shot it with HBO, and then I looked through three separate views. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: do not buy this film. Don't even make this movie. If you see it in Blockbuster, run as fast as you can.
