What is the meaning of this movie? It starts as one film, then changes the track, deceiving us in the resolution for this film, and ends as another film, which is nothing but a pale, pale imitation of so many other horror films of shlok that you have ever seen. The overall impression is confusion in all respects and great arrogance. Tarantino's screenplay, directed by Rodriguez, the two guys who had previously shown talent, but now seem to believe in their excitement and believe that everything they do should be good only because THEY did it. But it is not so. You are good only when you continue to do good deeds. There are so many questions to ask: What are George Clooney and Harvey Keitel doing in such a meaningless fate? Does Clooney initially make an intriguing bad guy ?? completely ruthless and efficient ?? and it would be interesting to see where it goes. But, of course, we never do. And Clooney's film about vampires turns into a completely different character. This is not clever or witty, just bad, it does not work well. Keitel looks completely uncomfortable, and it is not surprising. Nobody in the studio looked at the script before this project was approved? Tarantino is extremely unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviant (and why, as a writer, he suggested that we find rape, horrible murder and the murder of an innocent hostage ridiculous). At each level ?? except technical ?? this film stinks. Avoid.
