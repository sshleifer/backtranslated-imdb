This film is terrible - honestly. The game is terrible, the script made me cringe, the effects are completely lousy (which I usually do not mind the old films, but this was done only two years ago), and all about it just annoys me. Several friends go out to Halloween in the forest and meet the witch and her cannibal son. Of course, the phrase “Do you really believe in it?” Stretched out for some time. Ha ha ha, it's just a story. ” The man-eating witch’s son was mentally retarded (I don’t know if it was for a comedy or to make it creepy, but this film failed in both). He has minimal blood and lack of nudity, which made a bad film worse. Gosh, the only good thing about this film is the scene where the legs are eaten, and even that could be better. <br /> <br /> Honestly, don’t even spend time watching it on cable, and definitely think about buying or renting it, otherwise you’ll beat yourself for the time you spend to do something more constructive or interesting.
