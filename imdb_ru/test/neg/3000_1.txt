This is the most boring, pretentious and stupid film that I've seen in a long time. I saw this at the Academy in Beverly Hills, and there were quite a few people in the lobby who left the show and sought refuge there. Everyone solemnly shook their heads and looked as if they were at a funeral. What a waste of time and money. Even worse, the critics who gave this pretentious view good reviews. What's wrong with them? Are they simply afraid that they will not be considered "hips"? Bribed them? This movie is amazingly bad. Do not settle for a date, expecting later deep discussions to begin at the Cheesecake factory. If the idea of ​​seeing this movie was your idea, it will intimidate you and hold you for the rest of your life.
