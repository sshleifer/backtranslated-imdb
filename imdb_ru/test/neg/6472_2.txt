This remake is called “That damn cat,” but D.K. the cat is more a side line than the main character. Patty Randall didn't like this remake either. She reminded me of one of those Gothic idiots in high school you read about who were angry from the day they were born, so they once opened fire on the rest of the school. The federal policeman, Kelso, was fine, but not as good as the original. I believe Disney tried to turn Christina Ricci and Doug Doug (or some stupid name that he has) into stars, but they don’t hold the original Hayley Mills and the candle. I am an animal lover and a cat lover, and I do not blame D.K. for the fact that the remake is much inferior to the original film. In the end, they almost cut him out of the whole movie. Overall, a very bad remake.
