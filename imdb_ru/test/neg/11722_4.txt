I saw this film for one reason: the slogan "Upset your head ?? and you're dead!" Cracking. No wonder that this stupid horror comedy exhausted itself even before the tape came out of the box, but it vomited several laughter from its strange premise and character set: a radar with human eagle eyes, a huge powerman, and a big all magnets an armchair that is not happy that his family is being blackmailed by a murderous scumbag. It looks like a promising mixture of ham and cheese, before it becomes clear that the characters are one joke miracle, and the plot is pretty ordinary if you ignore the gigantic head.
