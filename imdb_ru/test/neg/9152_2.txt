This film, based on a rather best-selling "bestseller", like most other films about life, looked more like a reconstruction than a real movie. The only difference here was that Meredith Baxter was not in it. Women at this age do not age even for about 20 years, and the acting is generally rather bad. <br /> <br /> All characters were cliché and one-dimensional. The story was a cheesy nature. I would not advise, but people who loved the book and people who constantly watch this network think that it’s great. I only watched it because my friend wanted to see it so that she would not have to read the book that her sister lent her. This was not done for someone like me — my friend cried a little at the end, so she didn’t think it was as bad as me.
