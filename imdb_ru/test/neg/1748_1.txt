I was so offended by this film that I had to write something about it, so please joke with me. <br /> <br /> His only atoning virtue, besides a good game, is that it does not continue after 107 minutes. Even this length is about 30 minutes longer. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with brilliantly dark “The Grifters” were made here, but I don’t see it. These are two different films. The closest "Fraud" comes to the existing film "Sting", filmed in 1973. He borrows (excuse me, STEALS) from this magnificent "entertainment" of George Roy Hill, which is what it was. I enjoyed it because it did not pretend to be anything else. <br /> <br /> There are so many red herrings in the “Fraud” that it seemed to me that I was in an aquarium. This is very confusing, but it is only one of many problems. The main one is this: if you make a film where everyone lies to everyone else, where everyone cheats, we don’t have an anchor to ground us. The inevitable result is a hodgepodge of very sloppy seconds from other caper clicks. <br /> <br /> Almost everyone in this movie is insidious and undesirable. Of course, the main class of Film 101 would tell us that the audience should take care of someone. We can not take care of anyone: they are ALL pigs. It may have worked like a terrible comedy, but it plays from start to finish. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, do not read further. GREAT SPOILER Sorry, BUT I HAVE TO DO IT. <br /> <br /> There is so much fake blood and so many fake murders that it does not bother with gullibility - it destroys it. The ending is absolutely ridiculous - "murder" in a crowded airport, which in fact is not at all "murder"? And the “killed” guy soaked in blood just gets up, shakes off and leaves, does fake blood drip with prey? All the time, the police and crowds of people are watching, and no one is interceding? The director should have many roommates if he thinks we should buy it. Noirish B-movies from the 1940s have done better. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of European films, but this confirms that Schlok does not always come from Hollywood. As for “Fraud”, my opinion depends on a famous line from the often mistaken producer Samuel Goldwin, who knew everything about the slok: “Turn me on.”
