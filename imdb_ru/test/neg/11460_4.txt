Unfortunately, this film is typical for watering a good film with numerous sequels. Universal made several serial monster films in the 1940s, which were a pale imitation of the original. Clever Egyptologist Imhotepa replaced nursing Frankenstein in mummies, which has no signs of intelligent life. This film is entertaining in some places, but if you saw The Mummy (1932), you will be disappointed.
