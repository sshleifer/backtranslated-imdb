A boring movie about an unfortunate loser ... this is in short the Factotum. Matt Dillon plays Henry Chinaski, the alter ego of author Charles Bukowski, on the basis of which the film is based. When we meet Chinaski, he may be a writer, but he is definitely not successful. He swims through life, he is fired from one black job after another, and he doesn't care. The fact that he is always drunk may have something to do with his indifference. He meets a woman, Ian, played by Lily Taylor, and this is followed by a relationship. Chinaski moves to Yana's apartment, and now instead of getting drunk, he can get drunk with someone else. Good times. In the end, he was already tired of this relationship, so Chinaski struck on his own. Unfortunately, he still can not stay at work, so soon he broke. At this point, Marisa Tomei appears, and for some reason her character, Laura, decides to save this unfortunate drunken loser who she does not even know. Soon we meet some of Laura’s acquaintances, and the film turns into a kind of strange world with this rather eclectic bunch. Soon Tomei and his friends disappeared, and again we were left with Chinaski, his drunkenness and his miserable little life. More time was spent with Jan, but basically it’s just being drunk as an unemployed loser. And then the film is over, and not too early. 94 minutes of absolute monotony and seems to be infinitely longer as the film drags on. Nothing has happened. Nothing happens. If you want to spend an hour and a half of your life watching Matt Dillon drink, then this film is for you. If you are looking for an exciting story, well-developed characters, or some entertainment value, then you are in the wrong place. Dillon's performance is actually not bad at all. It is a pity that the film that surrounds it is actually quite bad.
