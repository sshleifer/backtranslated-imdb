Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie. Minus 50 billion out of 10. If you want hard-boiled actions not to be rented! If you want a good independent movie, look elsewhere! <br /> <br /> I never thought that I would see Bert Reynolds in such a shitty movie. He has the thinnest storyline. Van Damme must win the Academy compared to this one. <br /> <br /> Rob Lowe proves once again why he is not the hottest actor in the world. Even Hasselhoff would be a better addict than he. I donâ€™t want to bore you with a lot of facts about this shit movie, except that you better rent Hulk Hogan or Dolph Lundgreen. This should prove my point if you understand me. <br /> <br />
