My wife invited my son and me to watch it on cable television on a lazy Saturday night, thinking that this might show an unusual role for Juliette Lewis. At least on this promise, the film delivers: its character is ineffective, sticking with almost every cliche of a horror movie like a slasher. Like the movie. Cataloging his learned commitment to them would be an exercise in memory of something that I hope to quickly forget, so I will not do it. In fact, it is a bastard, heavy on red herrings: everyone seems guilty, and not just the two suspects from the very beginning. The rule about bad horror movies works well on this rule. The only surprise that influenced me was his final receipt of an indefinite final cliche: would Jane keep her meeting with her attempted rescuer, who would tell her (obvious to the audience) the identity of the second conspirator, pushing her to another round of hysterical victim game. Fortunately, I will never know.
