Great game, excellent staging quality, good direction. <br /> <br /> But the scenario begins with a big pace and interest in the first half, and then falls apart in the second half. We clearly understand the nature and motivation of the first half of the year, but then in the second half of the year many questions remain unanswered. <br /> <br /> The conflicts that arise are incontrovertible, but their subsequent actions are weak. For example, it is quite clear to us that Rudyard Kipling is a supporter of the war, but we do not know whether this philosophical position will change during the film. <br /> <br /> It is this picture that makes me want to see the facts in history books. I do not feel that I can count on the film to get a clear idea. <br /> <br /> The image of the war itself is incredibly accurate, although the lack of enthusiasm for women does not reflect military hysteria. it swept Britain at the time. Perhaps this is historically accurate; like so much in this film, I just don't know.
