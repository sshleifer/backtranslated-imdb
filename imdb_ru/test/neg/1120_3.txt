Sorry, randy. I like your comedy, but in this case you really laid the egg “Golden Turkey”. <br /> <br /> The plot was thinner than one layer of my skin, it was more wooden than a giant red forest, and I think that the direction did not exist. <br /> <br /> Of course, there were miserable attempts to make other films, Jaws and European Vacation, except for two. <br /> <br /> If my memory does not change me, Idle Edle played the same type of character in Nat Lamp European Vacation, but much better. <br /> <br /> I’m wondering if Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelot approached this sequel. If so, then they probably knew what they were doing when they refused. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, no one can improve Chevy and Beverly in their roles, as the Griswolds and Randy Quaid have perfectly complemented them in earlier years. films. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid had to leave National Lamphun while he was ahead.
