After his widowed father died in an accident, the young Tom Berlinler (as Jim Craig) remained to manage his Australian farm "Snow River", and only a gifted, with spiky legs, scout Kirk Douglas (as Spore) helped. The times are tough, so Mr. Burlinson goes to work for the rich, silver-haired brother-rancher Mr. Harrison, also played by Kirk Douglas. When a lot of work comes up, gray-haired (older?) Douglas feels that Burlinson is too young and inexperienced to go ahead; So, Berlinson is left behind and falls in love with the boss's boss, Sigrid Thornton (as Jessica Harrison). <br /> <br /> The least satisfactory aspect of director George Miller “The Man from the Snowy River” is a weak storyline. See, for example, the sequence of events "Jessica is lost." The girl is lost during one of these "strange" storms, running away. Her agitated father gathers drunken men to find her after predicting bad weather. Maiden "Jessica" rolls to the edge of a comfortable looking cliff. Father and suddenly sober people are not checking out the Burlinson farm. Hero Berlinson discovers the damsel. After lighting the fire, he decides to kiss her. <br /> <br /> Romance is played too innocently for men and women as attractive as Burlinson and Miss Thornton. Worse, the Douglas Brothers have a “dark story,” which is revealed before any secret is created on this issue. Here the main attraction is the Australian landscapes. <br /> <br /> **** The Man from the Snowy River (1982) George Miller ~ Tom Berlinon, Kirk Douglas, Sigrid Thornton
