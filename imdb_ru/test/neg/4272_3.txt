I always try not to be harsh, criticizing what I did not like, but after watching this mini-series I was so disappointed that I could not restrain my irritation. On the one hand, is it true that the series remained loyal to the novel, and, of course, I found it very good, but on the other hand, the terrible cast, the bad game, especially the key characters ?? as a “ridiculous price”, the impression of a theatrical production, I mean the theatrical mode of action, which annoys you from beginning to end. I am sure that with this budget, even if it were low, it would be possible to do something much better and more worthwhile. You should watch this series, but personally I do not advise you to spend time on this disappointing film version.
