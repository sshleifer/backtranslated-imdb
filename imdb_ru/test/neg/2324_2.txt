In need of work, straight man Bad Abbott (as Jack) and comic partner Lou Costello (as Dinkel) get a job, looking after the self-proclaimed “problem child” David Stollery (as Donald). Young Stollery finishes reading Mr. Costello's favorite novel (see if you can guess the name), in which Costello puts to sleep, hoping that he and Mr. Abbott are reliving the story of “Jack and the Beanstalk” (you guessed it). br /> <br /> Sepia color switches to color for most production. Apparently, it was an attempt to do something else for a duet, a colorful children's fantasy. It fails, but it is here that you can see Abbott and Costello in color, the silent film superstar William Farnum (as king), who played the role in his last performance, Buddy, brother of boxer Max Baer, ​​and Stollery before the Disney “Spin and Marty” . <br /> <br /> ** Jack and the Beanstalk (4/4/52) Gene Yarbrough ~ Lou Costello, Bad Abbott, Buddy Baer, ​​William Farnum
