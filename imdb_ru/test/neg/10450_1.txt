I'm not quite sure where to start. From start to finish, bad, smelly, bad, like a step into port john a day 100 degrees. If you force yourself to look at it like me, keep some Vicodin on hand for pain. I will never understand how this bad film passes by the cutting room until the whole drum is on the floor. The film is a cross between Gumby Rides Pokey, meets the terminator, meets Wally Beaver, who plays cowboys and Indians without cowboys. I have seen the best animation in the original version of Blob. You will get more entertainment from watching Gone with the Wind, suffering from vomiting and poop. Bad play and hockey lines will make you squirm and want you to rent a big Top Peavy or watch every episode of Gilligan Island back to back. Ugh .. I'm going to go cut my wrist now.
