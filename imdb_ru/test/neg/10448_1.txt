Finally, the film to compete with “El Padrino” and “Falls Darkness” in terms of pure and absolute stupidity. In fact, this is the first film I ever gave 1 out of 10 on IMDb, and for good reason. <br /> <br /> Firstly, this film is nothing special. This is usually not a problem for me, except that the only character that is interesting or different from everyone else is Harrington Grand L. Bush. Secondly, the production evaluates poor quality - television science fiction, such as Stargate, has more convincing sets, and all the underwater scenes, NOT processed by SFX teams, are filmed on dry shooting particles that are not very convincing, This film is literally "dry dock." Worst of all, this movie is boring. For the first 45 minutes, I felt that we were circling: "This is a prehistoric shark." "Bullsh * t." "Not really." "Bullsh * t." "I do not invent it." "Bullsh * t." "Here it is now!" "I have not seen anything". "Let me guess?" "Yes. Brad * t." After that, he picks up a little for twenty minutes or so. Then we will return to the running dialogue. Dialogue is not a bad thing, but that's all there is to this film. The characters are talking. This is also not bad, except that this film is not very good at it. The dialogue is often fictional and cliché, and it is not very interesting to listen. I see no reason to slander special effects; this film has the worst qualities. <br /> <br /> Sets are small and unreal. Valid subparagraph. The script - oh my God, the script - worse than the garbage sci-fi television. It makes you wonder where the budget of this film was or was. <br /> <br /> Another terrible, terrible addition to the Megaloadon film series (there are about four of them). Bring Steve Altena, please ...
