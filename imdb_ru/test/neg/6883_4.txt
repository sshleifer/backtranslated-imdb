It is difficult to comment on this film. This is one of the few films that Dimension hasn't really put on the shelf (it's hard to find the reason why), and he was rushed to 500 impressive theaters on the day he opened it. Perhaps Dimension was afraid of how people would react to a marsh creature, using his tow truck to divide the house into parts. <br /> <br /> Ray Sawyer is just a tow truck driver until he can save the voodoo priestess from a bad car accident, and in response he is attacked by a bag full of snakes and drowning. In the morgue, Ray returns to life and pursues a group of teenagers who witnessed a terrible crash. <br /> <br /> What is confusing this film is its thin paper characters. I didn't care about any of them. In addition, the dialogue was less than ho-hum. In addition, it was very predictable. Characters made typical stupid horror movie characters, such as checking out squeaky sounds, shouting out people's names, and riding a cliff during the pursuit. I could also immediately choose who would be the last girlfriend. And why did the camera have such fast white flashes when someone died or when they showed the killer? <br /> <br /> What is good? Well, there is an impressive waiting scene, when the killer goes under the swamp to get to his victims, and a tense sequence where the last girl has to disguise herself with a bunch of other corpses while the killer is watching. <br /> <br /> But besides this, this is another disappointment in August / September. I was looking forward to it, but I did not get what was expected.
