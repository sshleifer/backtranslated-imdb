I watched this movie with high expectations. A flash on the back indicated that it would be unpleasant. But it was rather boring and a bit unsatisfactory. Violence was something that I had not seen a thousand times before, the level of blood was only average (note that there was probably more than what Hollywood had seen in the last 5 years — perhaps more) I feel awkward even scared. Again a CAT 3 movie with big wrappers that doesn’t justify the hype. <br /> <br /> Be sure to rent this movie, but do not meet any expectations. I am so eager to get on the whole Asian horror scene, but I constantly get disappointed. I really loved Ichi and Audition, but again, Miike is alone now. <br /> <br /> Please inspire me ..... there is a large group of exhausted fans who lack the quality of horror!
