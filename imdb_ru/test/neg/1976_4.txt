So, after the initial disappointment in the first Final Fantasy film, which seemed to be almost nothing like the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children appeared before a warm welcome and now has become a fan base. And the reason for the success of the films is understandable, as it has lush graphics, fast-moving combat sequences and some cool ones, like hell. without prior explanation, and you can get lost in the plot, even if you played the game. Secondly, there is no character development, without prior knowledge of the game, your opinions about the characters are limited to "cool" and "not cool." Of course, for FF7 fans, the film is almost guaranteed to entertain, at least for nostalgic reasons, and it's great to see all the characters you love from the game in some rather amazing computer animation. One final complaint, the film, at least in my opinion, tried to squeeze in too much in less than two hours, and so the last half hour or so seemed terribly in a hurry. If you played and enjoyed FF7, then this is a decent watch, although nothing special. If you have not played FF7, then it is better to first play it before watching this movie.
