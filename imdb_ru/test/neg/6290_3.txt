KK should stick to singing - this whole film was a big bore. I can't understand the depravity of guys and romance between Miles and KK - Sex scenes were also not inspired. The ending was terrible - unresolved - there must be a reason for the kill. And the boy's whole voyeurism was strange ... the mother always fought with the boy - don't you think that he will get a little Freud with her? And why hasn't someone taught K.K. to talk with inflection instead of monotonous? <br /> <br /> Glad I paid only 1 dollar to rent this. <br /> <br />
