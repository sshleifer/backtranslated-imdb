Okay ... she's in a boat with this guy, realizes that he is going to kill her, knocks him out, and then finds the reason he is trying to kill her, this is the drive that killed her colleague. So what would any sensible person do? Maybe hit him again to make sure he really is missing ?? Tie him up ?? Listen, Sandra, dear, you have a chance to escape while the guy is away for so long. Until you know how long it will take for you to escape, make sure he cannot chase you. I hate these stupid female victim roles. The rest of the film was just a series of turns, which were completely confusing and too unbelievable to remain interesting.
