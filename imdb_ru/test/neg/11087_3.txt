Let me start by saying that I love Japanese cinema, literature and culture in general. I have seen many Japanese films and enjoyed them, but “The Portrait of Hell” (aka Jigokuchen) makes itself ridiculous. The two characters that dominate in action are the “evil lord” in his preferred bubble and the “stubborn, crazy artist” are pure types with zero subtlety or nuances, and all their actions come from cartoon extremes. The film wants to show horrific scenes of violence and unbridled emotions, but many of these scenes are so crowded that they actually become ridiculous, and the overall feeling is a film created for television that has gone off the rails. If this rarely shown film falls into your hands or falls into your city, spare yourself and give it a pass.
