Everyone knows the so-called plot, so let me go to the chase. <br /> <br /> Forced frivolity. Performers work the wrong way to assign roles difficult to enjoy, so you can have fun. Brilliant Meryl Streep is trying hard. Pierce Brosnan is just confused. Inexplicably set on a Greek island. A lot of screaming, screaming women. Lot. <br /> <br /> It was a stupid musical with a jukebox on stage, now it's a big, dirty, poorly filmed musical with a jukebox. If you like ABBA, so-so. If not, this is an attack on the feelings and insults of any intelligence that you have left when you leave the theater. I readily admit that I really did not want to watch this movie and went with some friends who did, but for the love of God. Why does my floor squeal and squeal to convey delight? Ever sat next to a table of women who had too many to drink and were absolutely determined to spend a GREAT evening in the city? This feeling of the whole project. It was just so good when it stopped.
