I have no idea how accurate the image of Flynn appears in this film, but even as a piece of art, this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is everywhere and leaves you wondering how it got from one scene to another - you just don’t give the minimum information necessary to maintain some continuity and understanding of its current situation, and it’s hard to understand the motives of Flynn and other characters behind some of their behavior. br /> <br /> Add to this series of stupid and implausible situations, and you have a film that seems to you one of your dreams, which seems to make sense during sleep, but when you wake up and try to remember it It's just strange, incoherent and completely unreal. <br /> <br /> There are many long, boring musical sections of the film, which for me are either bad leadership or a bad director trying and not knowing how to be artistic. /> <br /> None of the characters is even cute and the character of Flynn is a mercenary liar, a thug, a thief, a robber, a murderer, a fist with a bear fist, a gigolo and an impostor who will to realize their dreams, and somehow, despite all this, great opportunities seem to miraculously fall in on their knees. <br /> <br /> This film is in no way interesting and satisfying, and, apparently, even historically accurate, so why watch it? To rub salt into the wound, the DVD had one of the worst programs I've ever seen, it wasn’t even in widescreen or Dolby 5.1, it had a terrible wobble and many, many artifacts from what looked like a movie film it is dusting and scratching somewhere.
