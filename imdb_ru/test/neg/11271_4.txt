Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps best known, at least in his homeland, for his Japanese gangster films, the series with which this film has a number of characteristics. Violence and political intrigue are the themes of both the Samurai Shogun and the Battle of Honor and Humanity, and both have a protagonist who believes that his loyalty is challenged by betrayal. Both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have no special purpose other than to die, and, since so little is done for their development, their death has little effect when they come. This film has other drawbacks. The make-up, costumes and sound effects are distractingly poor, and the battle scenes were also of poor quality, yielding to other samurai films of earlier years (I recall Seven Samurais). <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba plays Sonny Chibaâ€™s character in the film Samurai of Shogun, a swordsman who wanders the film and frowns threateningly. What a guy; he can even wear an eye patch. If you expected to see the legendary Toshiro Mifune, you may be disappointed; his appearance is a little more than a cameo, and as soon as it seems that his character can do something interesting, he disappears forever. <br /> <br /> In general, the strengths of the film are its history, which is much more understandable than these gangster films, and the problems associated with the traditional concepts of good and evil. The two brothers contest the throne of their recently deceased father, who may have provided some help with his exit. At first, it looks as if we are confronted with a pair of characters who cannot be more clear of good and evil; In the end, the older brother stumbles and has a birthmark, a sure sign of a villain. Ultimately, however, it becomes clear that in the struggle for power, in which the winner gets everything, there are no heroes and villains, only winners and losers.
