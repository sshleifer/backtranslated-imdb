A piece of trash that only Full Moon Studio could do with a group of college children living free of charge in an old hospital that nobody knows about, because a demonic creature with two faces (the entire film is barely visible because of obscure lighting) passes through the walls to kill everyone a member who has a certain sheet of paper with ancient marks. Some of them (it will not be so difficult to prove, but a small turn is not so inspiringly revealed and executed limply that you will simply scoff) is the inspirator of the one the animal kills and needs to be revealed before he kills everyone. /> <br /> A cheap, badly acting mess has "Is this all ?!" a kind of weak end that will make you angry because you just spent your time. Tanya Dempsey, who could not get through the wet paper bag, is acting as the heroine as the newest member of the cleaning team at the college named Clark. Oh, and the name refers to the sound that the beast makes before attacking its next victim.
