The film tells you to be conscientious and conscientious. It also destroys everything and everyone, the Bible claims that this is true. For people like me, the first episode was interesting, and the second - catastrophic. This was called "blasphemy," and this is so if you are a believer. It is sad to hear that many consider this a good continuation of the Bible. Nevertheless, the film shows you a lot of things and objects that can be interpreted as a cinematic version of Revelation. Some of us think that such things cannot be abused. The good thing about the film is that it strongly encourages ethical understanding and makes you think twice about your actions. It seems that the director simply forgets that some people act in this way, based solely on the fact that they believe and love, as prescribed in the Bible ... Why try to change this if you are not the devil?
