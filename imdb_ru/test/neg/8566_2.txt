The only good thing about this movie is its final twist. For 97 minutes of the film, we can save only one idea that was completely wasted in this film, I must say! For more than 90 minutes, this film is simply a collection of clichés, bad actions, stupid ideas and disclosures, complete lack of expectation, stupid deaths, terrible special effects; all this in a pitiful and unoriginal plot ?? until the last three minutes, where, finally, a good idea! There is nothing outstanding or an extremely original idea in this, but at least it was a “decent” good idea, the only one the whole movie has! I will not spoil it, but I must say that I think that an idea with a better plot, a better FX and, of course, a better game, will turn into a good film. If you watch this movie and are able to endure it to the end, you will know what it is ??
