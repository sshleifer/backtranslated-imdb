This movie is terrible. He creates characters that are not in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. Including a nasty little Jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl. Not to mention Yiddish talking elves. The book was a simple story about faith, and this film is a dark, ugly and unnecessarily scary film about nothing. <br /> <br /> The animation is great, but the story is ruined by Hollywood. > <br /> It's good that this film will bathe at the box office, and perhaps producers will learn not to interfere in a story that does not need to be improved. Hanks overdid it, and I do not understand why the voices of other actors could not be used.
