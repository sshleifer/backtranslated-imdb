Was this supposed to be a comedy? Black cloak and skeleton mask funny. There as a plot of zero. The film begins with an archaeologist and his assistant. They make a slight mention of the fact that their excavations were cursed. And then, lo and behold, in drops, the Halloween Costume Man, dressed in a shiny black cape, with a skeleton mask and an ax. So he kills these two people. Then we cut off in the forest with a poor imitation of the Predator, only commandos hunt Halloween costumes, who are now riding horses! More commandos appear, but these people must be disguised as a hiking group. Yes, the production probably ended commando suits. Can you say low budget? In any case, they encounter a lonely old Indian guy sitting in the forest. He's just too funny. And he starts to talk about something, but you really don't know what he is mumbling about, so they remember how some Indians are killed. None of this makes sense. And then we return to our commandos, where they are killed. And this is really basically the plot. It's so ridiculously bad, you just can't look away, because you want to see how low it goes. You can make the same movie with a video camera, a Halloween costume and a bunch of your friends with fake weapons. Do not watch this thing if you want a horror movie. If you want comedy, maybe? Or just skip it and get something like a real Predator.
