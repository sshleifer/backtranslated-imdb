I read the comments of other users and am glad that someone compared it with the original Kamal “Perumarzhakalam”, released in 2004. <br /> <br /> The original had a difficult history and no loopholes, as described above about the Indian government. not having the proper recordings or even bad snapshots and jokes. <br /> <br /> The story is wonderful, touchy and well described by others. But, unfortunately, Nagesh believes that his own story is a sad thing, and nothing more than plagiarism. <br /> <br /> I suppose it was influenced by the so-called Bollywood “inspiration” syndrome. <br /> <br /> He should at least pay tribute to where this is going. <br /> <br /> I liked some of his old films, but now I suspect that one of them was the original. <br /> <br /> Here is the link in IMDb to the original masterpiece. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425350/#comment I recommend everyone to see the original, even with subtitles, if necessary, to know what a class manual and a cool game are.
