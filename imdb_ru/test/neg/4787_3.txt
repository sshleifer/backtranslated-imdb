After I couldn't ignore the hype about the show, I started watching the first season, and it seemed really good to me, and I got hooked ... for about 5 episodes, and then it started to curl down. What for? First, Ethan Supli is written so that he acts like a complete idiot, confirming this very clearly, spewing out half-random things in high expectations that this will be the next best joke. <br /> <br /> Jamie Pressley looks amazing, but if she thinks she is stretching her lips to explore parts of the face that they usually don’t go to, and makes strange faces to emphasize everything that she says is funny She does not know. Perhaps she thought her character would be too flat, faded, and she wanted to make it bright and spicy, but full of colors, too much spices and a loud cry for attention, and it hurts my eyes, ears and intelligence. <Br /> <br /> I really, really wanted to love this show, as I said, the premise is excellent (coming from the same shelf as Amely Poulain’s “Fairy Mission”), and Jason Lee does a pretty good job here , along with some other actors, but there is no way I could be “pulled in” and forgot that this is just a show, because the surreal, extreme characters of Pressley and Supli suddenly woke me up when they appeared. It is worth noting that their characters and acting skills would be good if it were not a 70-episodic series, and if they did not get so much time on the screen.
