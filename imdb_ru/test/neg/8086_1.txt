This film, in the literal sense of the word, does not have a single ransom function. Characters are one-dimensional, stamped, incredibly misogynistic and stupid. The script looks as if it is laid out from 100 other films, the acting is terrible, and some kind of “rough” humor made me nauseous. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Gregory Poirier, ANYONE would think it was funny or interesting! <br /> <br /> Worst movie I've seen in the last few years.
