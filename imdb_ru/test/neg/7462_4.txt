A slow, strange film that pulls and pulls (I mean really PLODS) along with its disappointing climax. You can expect some zest at the end, but there is none. Both Milland and Snodgress make awkward presentations; in fact, the strangeness of the film is the only thing he has. Usually the atmospheric score has some absurd parts (for example, music that plays during the first appearance of the monkey), and there is a really awful fantasy scene with the participation of ... a gorilla.
