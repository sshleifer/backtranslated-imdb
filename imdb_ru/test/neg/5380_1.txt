What for???? What a disgusting joke about the supposed movie ... from the poster it looked like a cute movie ... what a disappointment ... who the hell is the main character? He looks like an old, backward, retired abandoned cop ... I'm a cop, and I can say ... a man can't act ... go back to being a cop ... without being on the screen ... why they showed him naked ass like he was Mel Gibson, damn it, no ... he ruined the director ... this guy doesn't have a job in the film ... I seriously doubt that women or gays find him attractive ... whoever nor was the film - this is mediocre hacker work that does not put hacker talents in the lead ... it's great that we white guys always get Asian women, but why the ugly white guy, why not Dean Cain or Brad Pitt as a white guy ... Asian women like ugly white guys or black guys in what I see ??? I don't understand .. it must be low self-esteem .. <br /> <br /> The only hot girl who can play in the movie was Kate Holliday. Why among all the others was one hot white chick? ugly asian chicks who think they are hot and can play ??? <br /> <br /> In this film, only two actors are the Lead Poetry at the end of the film and one hot white chick in the massage room .. T.L. Young and Kate Holliday were supposed to be in charge of the film .. <br /> <br /> The character of Asia was funny, it looked like she was trying too hard to be some kind of ghetto / sexy black girl ... The key word here is “try” .. <br /> <br /> Gina .. you cannot act, and you are not physically enough for such a role .. you need to play the role of a character and be more modest in your own presentation .. <br /> < br /> I think the actress is Gina Hirazumi ... I looked at her on IMDb and she is a great Asian actress ???? if so, I don’t want to see what bad Asian American actresses are. <br /> <br /> No wonder there are no Asian American actors in Hollywood !!! if this is the best they have !!! they supposedly won some kind of Asian cinema award ?? let me rest ... it looks like they just made a film in order to put a bunch of Asian girls in them ... they are not even hot .. Gina ... you are not hot ... stop trying .. to play the role of characters and improve your acting game ... you are not the leading female type ... <br /> <br /> If you can make money in this movie, pigs can fly ... sorry for being rude, but I feel that these actors / actresses you need to either get better or work on your craft: with the exception of the two actors I mentioned, who were supposed to play the main role .. I I say this with love to all the Asian leading girls in the film, please do what your parents say and leave and be doctors / lawyers / and engineers ... and act on the side for fun .. I hope that’s what you are doing now ... I am not trying to be evil, but I hope that this will be read and will push you to recover or go do something else ... there was not even an ethical message in this film ... <br /> <br /> I would I was not surprised if the "Soap Girls" were secretly funded by members of the Ku Klux Cl special department of Asian -American hate propaganda Clan <br /> <br />. Otherwise, Asian people should hate themselves ... watching this movie makes me an appreciative viewer for not being Asian ... you guys are pathetic. You have self-esteem, you Asian people.
