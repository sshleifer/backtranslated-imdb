I always rate movies on this site, but I usually do not write comments. However, in this case, I felt obligated to warn others! This movie is bad! This is probably one of a dozen films that I rated as “1 (terrible)”. I know that people say it all the time, but it really was one of the worst films I've ever seen. In any case, it is easily among the top ten. <br /> <br /> When it comes to horror movies, I have very low standards. I'll skip all kinds of crappy filmmaking for a good panic. But this film is embarrassingly bad. Looks like someone bought a video camera at Sears and decided to make a movie with his friends. (The fact that the name of each crew member appears on the cast list, I think, confirms this theory.) This film has lower production standards than the average performance. It is a bit shocking when I see a movie that looks so bad, released on DVD. Special effects are sometimes effective, but at best they are still amateurish. The best thing to say about the actors is that, at least, they don’t remember to look at the camera, most of the time. I can not say for sure whether they are struggling to remember their lines or invent them when they walked together. Any attempts at humor are ineffective. This film is such a huge waste of time.
