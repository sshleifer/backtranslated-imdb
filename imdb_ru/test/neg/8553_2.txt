The terrible click of a "woman in a cage" hits the bottom of the barrel with a movie at midnight, combining meaty debauchery with the hoarse cliche of "girls in the shower." Linda Blair plays an innocent, jailed (we find out unceremoniously that she ran into some guy in her car), faced with difficulties in the Big House with some of the most disgusting characters in this photo of Rhys Meyer. Blair is constantly beaten, beaten, raped, humiliated and persecuted. The four-letter dialogue is disgusting everywhere, and the film does not depart from its violence and stupidity. However, some viewers see this as a classic of the camp, although perhaps his tongue is not far enough in his cheek. * from ****
