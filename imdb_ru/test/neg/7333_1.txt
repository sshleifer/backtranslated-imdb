A man wonders if his healthy colleague is gay. At the sale, he finds a beam gun called "Gaidar". You point to the person, pull the trigger, and he tells you how funny he is. He tries it, it works, and he tries to find out if his colleague is gay, how he ... <br /> <br /> A promising idea, ruined by an unfunny script (after a promising start) and a terrible game. The whole cast is replaying and basically shouts their lines at each other all the time. It becomes annoying and really embarrassing after a while. The grace of salvation is that it is short, there is a cat stealing a scene (she likes to fall out of bed of a kitten), and Charles Nelson Reilly is hysterical in his short story. But none of this saves the film. I can't recommend it at all.
