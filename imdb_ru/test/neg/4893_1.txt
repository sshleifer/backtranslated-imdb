This movie was funny from the start. Let me save you all the time from watching this movie. A woman who sells corn liquor to local people takes her cousin or nephew, and he convinces her to open a cafe downstairs from her house. She and her cousin become close. Later there is a scene where she squeezes her lips with him. Later, the woman finds out that the old guy is returning from prison, and tension arises between them, which leads to a fight in a cafe. A cousin / nephew of a woman is in love with a man. The ending was terrible, the story was terrible, and if I could get back the time spent on this film, I would appreciate it. Certain pass.
