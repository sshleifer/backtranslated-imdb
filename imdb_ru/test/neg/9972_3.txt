This film is about a woman in love with her boyfriend's friend. Since then, she has to divide her time into two guys: Jack by day and Joseph by night. <br /> <br /> This film is like made with a minimum budget. Most of the film takes place in an apartment with minimal furniture. There are only three main actors, all the other actors listed in the credits appear only momentarily. The wardrobe designer seems to have nothing to do, since the actors wear very mundane clothes, and in any case they are bare most of the time. <br /> <br /> The film is very heavy for dialogue. should compensate for the shortcomings described above. However, the dialogues sound too restrained and awkward. At the beginning of the film, most of the dialogue is a person who makes a very long sentence, and then the one who says “Me too.” After the madness of consent, the dialogue turns into a messy and tangled verbal salad. <br /> <br /> The only merit of this film I can think of is that it serves as a feminist release, which conveys that it is not only men who may be unfaithful. <br /> <br /> This film is a big disappointment.
