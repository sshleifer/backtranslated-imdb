The presentation is very shabby. (in my opinion) how often documentaries are. Michael Moore's Dokumenatriya - Fahrenheit 911 is much more convincing, but has too much influence on the media and political influence I can not wait for the Sabbath, when I can see the documentation "Playing their life." The IFC goes to the right of the center. I started a collection of IFC films from the Internet because of "TGOTL" *** of ********** on the "Decade". Want to see good documentaries? Stick to the story channel .. Or try the dokram. You can't go wrong with them, my friend. Can't go wrong. The seventies were ten years of repetition. Or so old times make you believe. Disco is dead and gone forever. When Elvis died, yes, we all grieved
