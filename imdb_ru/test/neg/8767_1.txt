This movie was terrible. You could not fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie. It came to the last 20 minutes of the film, and I literally pressed the eject button right in the middle of the scene. It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Worst of all the films of Dean Kane combined. To begin with, the game was terrible. I understand that the main actors were from the cast of the survivor, but one would think that any television experience would give them a little more talent. Another major problem for films was the visual effects and the poor quality of the films. In the defense of cinema, the theme of the show was good, and the story was fine.
