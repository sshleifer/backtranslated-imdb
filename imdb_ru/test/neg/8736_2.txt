“A research scientist is experimenting with human DNA, trying to create the perfect man. His work has reached such an extent that he can take a human fetus and accelerate its growth to an adult within a few days. the creation is (spoiler omitted), but the side effects from the process (spoiler is omitted) ", in accordance with the summary of the DVD cover. <br /> <br /> Embryo opens with a promise:" The film you are going to see is not all science fiction.
