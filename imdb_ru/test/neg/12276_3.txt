Light spoilers below. <br /> <br /> The prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when the TFW was withdrawn. From the initial scene of European refugees to the final forecast that Nazism will be the death of millions of Germans, this film is a propaganda film just like the films made after Pearl Harbor. There is not much entertainment here, although shots with a dust collector are interesting for those of us who are not old enough to remember this. The rest of the story is pretty easy to forget with Herr Doctor Coburn - with a rather bad accent - and a daughter assimilating to America with the help of Wayne. In addition to scenes with a dust collector, the only memorable aspect of the film is one that is best seen in hindsight. Coburn's speech, comparing Nazism with a malignant neoplasm worse than cancer and describing (then) success as an instant surge of energy from the patient before his death, was terribly accurate, and Dr. Sherer from Varno played precisely to listen to newsreel footage of unrepentant Nazis justifying their actions. <br /> <br /> From a historical point of view, some aspects of TFW are interesting. If you look at it for entertainment outside the perspective of World War II, you have to say that this is one of Wayneâ€™s less successful efforts.
