This title is in search of a movie. This feed sounds beneficial to some head of the studio, and the rest be damned. When this film was shot, CGI had two more things that he didnâ€™t do at all: people and fur. Thus, fluffy people were not destined to look good when they were visualized using a computer. This is the only example that I can remember when the effects for a well-funded sequel made a giant leap back, significantly inferior to those in the original film. By the way, the design of werewolves does not help. The filmmakers apparently could not decide between the four-legged and the two-legged, tried to do both, and finally ended up with the same clumsy creature. The transformations are anatomically meaningless, and the end result with a relatively high forehead and short muzzle looks like a cross between Ron Perlman and a hyena. But back to the dirty part. This is a film that exists EXACTLY to earn on its ancestor. I'm not a fan of Landis' original film, but boy, it looks good in the light of that. If you think that part of Landis's humor was forced, try some of the agonizing attempts here. A chewing gum scene, a corpse humor, a dog that ... you know, you just have to watch it yourself. Thomas Everett Scott is on vacation in Europe with friends and decides to take a break in the "ugly American" and jump out of the Eiffel Tower in the middle of the night. This leads to the fact that he saves a young woman (Delpy - Julie is not worth it, just to become a star in America. Ask Rutger Hauer) to jump to death. It turns out to be part of the cult of werewolves who are plotting ... I'm not sure something is bad. Awful French stereotypes, gaping plot holes, tangled finale. It doesn't matter that the studio cared only that the name would most likely deceive millions of fans of the American Werewolf in London to transfer their cash. For the most part, they are happy to say that they were wrong.
