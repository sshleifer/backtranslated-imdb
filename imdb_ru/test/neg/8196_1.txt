One evening on the independent channel, known for showing films from the wall, this monster was shown. Despite the temptation to turn it off, we looked at it until the very end, hoping to see some sort of redemptive value. Alas, there was not one. Absolutely nothing. The quality of the film was cheap; the soundtrack was dirty; editing was funny. On the other hand, there was very little to save. After a few minutes of Dr. Cameron Mitchell’s story about a patient about him, the viewer is not subjected to any conspiracies, pathetic letters, terrible terrible actions and a complete lack of cohesion and continuity. The rotting cherry on top of this smelly mess was the most terrible "special effect" and "makeup" that had ever confused the screen, even for television. The main character stumbles because of his role in the rubber mask “dimestor” and a pair of dishwashing gloves, which seem to have been dipped in glue and rolled into beads. Perhaps poor lighting and good film quality tried to hide how bad the makeup was to the tenth degree. One can only hope that during this hopelessly amateur video at least one deliberate decision was made. Seriously, a handful of three-year-olds could create a better project. In the end, poor Mr. Mitchell returns (how desperately he should have been for the money!) And pulls out some nonsense that should link this bunch of crap to the AIDS epidemic. Please save you and your loved ones from inhuman cruelty when you sit in it. It was so bad that even Mystery Science Theater 3000 could not have saved it.
