Planet Earth experienced a terrible ecological catastrophe, so humanity is now surviving underground, divided into various religious cults. What caused the disaster? I have no idea ? Why is humanity divided into different church factions? I have no idea . Since the surface of the Earth can no longer support human life, how can people grow crops to feed the population? I have no idea . What producer thought that this scenario deserves funding? I have no idea, <br /> <br /> Shepherd is one of those films that fills cable channels late at night. The kind of film where you consult IMBb to see if he has any merits. The number of people who commented on SHEPHERD on this page has not yet reached double digits, and this film was released nine years ago. Perhaps people who have never seen it are lucky? <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the plot, itâ€™s very ordinary. The former grumpy police officer Boris Dakota, whose wife and child died a few years ago, meets a woman and her child, and he himself must save their lives, almost like a futuristic western. Add a former fighter who is now leading the channel of God, a fascist Christian guy who is trying to pay off Boris, ventriloquist, a little T & A for this, and you get a mess of the movie. I think after watching this Neil Marshall DOOMSDAY, perhaps a masterpiece of cinema in comparison
