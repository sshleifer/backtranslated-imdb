I lived next door to the author in 1980, when he first moved to Portland from Downer Grove, Illinois, with two of his school buddies. He seemed like a normal guy, although he had a lot of artistic claims. For several years, he joined Portland's post-punk music scene with pal Phil and several others, and a band that was definitely not going anywhere, although it made him act a lot, including with Courtney Love in it. Portland fan days. He seemed to think that his musical perspectives were good enough to move to San Francisco, and then N.Ya.K. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to learn that he signed a contract with the publisher in 95 after the group failed. The name of Courtney Love seemed to be decisive. I have no idea how the film came about, especially with this actor, but I doubt that Gus Van Sant participated. In any case, the reviewers here do not seem to be sure if the lack of narrative is intentional or not, so I would simply say that this is the work of a pretty smart guy who wants to be a writer, or artist, or someone else, but not I have nothing to say. Like Kerouac without benzedrine.
