<br /> <br /> I understand that people treat low-budget films in different ways. I also know that John Sales has a kind of glow, this earthly, intellectual anti-Hollywood atmosphere, in the spirit of Tim Robbins, the Coen brothers and Atom Egoyan, which makes him a favorite of critics from the very beginning. <br /> But this is not a very good movie. Sorry, but it is not. <br /> <br /> This is the gyrus. There are too many characters in it. His tone is uneven, the point of view is confusing, acting is everywhere, from naturalistic to excessive. He lingers for a long time with minor characters that we do not care about, and cuts off the intense scenes only when things are going well. <br /> <br /> He misses the mark. <br /> <br /> The worst flaw in the film is that the two closest things to the main character, Marley Edie Falco and Desiree Angela Bassett, have straight veins in characters that don't have an engine. Marley is an apathetic drunkard, immersed in the inertia of her life. Desiree is a woman trapped in her own suppressed pain. When the worldview of your two main characters can be summed up using the phrases “I don’t care” and “I want to leave here,” why should the audience give a rat lust? <br /> <br /> I’ll just say: Sales writes funny dialogues. He is very skilled at making scenes. The problem is that these scenes don't go anywhere. There is no spine for the film. No drive. The film does not cause interest in any of the characters. In my opinion, he also preaches too much that the big bad corporate America absorbs the little guy. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a quality “small” movie, see David Lynch’s “Straight Story”. Pass it on.
