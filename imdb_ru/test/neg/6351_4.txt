I rented this film in my local library and thought it might be good, considering that I like this type of film, and considering who was in it, but boy, I was wrong. Acting smelly, the fight scenes were just as bad, and several famous people took part in them, but didn't anybody play the acting ability to play the main role? I noticed that some people gave him 10. Why did you ever think about giving this bunch of horses **** for 10. You can say that it costs 10 for a clean comedy, but when you vote for a film, who shouldn't be a comedy, you can't give her 10 for a comedy. You need to evaluate this for what it should actually be, and not for what the director did not intend. Perhaps one of you voted for 10 because you thought it would be funny to have this high-rated shitty movie so that people go out, rent it or buy it, because you think it's funny to mislead people. You play with the time and money of people you are not entitled to. If the film is clogged, give it a bad rating, if it was good, give it a good rating, but do not lie. I gave this movie 4, and I'm glad I could check it out for free from my library, because this movie is clogged up and really not worth paying a cent to watch.
