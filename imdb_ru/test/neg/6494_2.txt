DEFENDER. You hear the name. You think: "Ah, this is a crappy Hong Kong movie." Guess what - this is not Hong Kong. And yes, this is crap. This amazingly stupid film about Jackie Chan, destroyed by us, but by us Americans (I'm boiling with anger, oh, I think I'll jump out of this window!) buddy. It sounds cool ... but it is not. Do not spend your money on rent. To prove that he can make the best cop film, Chen created an amazing police story (1985).
