Since Paul Kersey didn’t have enough real relatives to take revenge, in the third part of the thirst for death saga he returns to New York to visit an old military friend. He only arrives to find out that Brooklyn has completely become an impoverished gang and that the young thugs have killed his friend and are constantly terrorizing all the other residents of the destroyed apartment building. Kersi makes a deal with the local police commissioner, wins the heart of his blond lawyer, strikes numerous villains with the help of Wilde Magnum's impressive rifle and gradually trains and inspires the petrified New Yorkers to stand up for themselves. Well, it makes no sense to defend the series "Death Wish" after watching the third part. The 1974 original was a masterpiece that revolved on social drama as well as on retribution, and although it was pure exploitation, the second part still had quite a few redeeming qualities, and at least the events were logically related to what was happening. first. Number three is often felt as a completely separate deductible. Apparently, Quercy is no longer an architect, he is ten times more sociable and talkative than before, and suddenly no one, not even the police, is no longer against vigilance actions? All these changes and some other aspects make it more than obvious that Michael Winner and Charles Bronson reduced their “Death Wish” success to a purely thoughtless and exploitative action film, the number of victims of which increases tremendously with each episode, and the arsenal becomes more and more explosives. and criminals who become more nasty, sloppy, angry and much harder to kill. However, the gentlemen did not seem to realize that the continuous upsurge of violence actually creates the opposite effect, namely this extremely monotonous and much more boring than the previous two. I once read a brilliant review that called Death Wish 3 a clear definition of cinematic masturbation. This description can not be more accurate, as the script wearily moves from one disgusting sequence of execution to another. In particular, the last twenty minutes represent a complete "orgy" of shooting, explosions and executions, carried out using self-made measures of home action. Yi-haaa! This entry in the series has a rather interesting auxiliary line-up, including Martin Balsam (“Psycho”, “12 Angry Men”) as a tired neighbor who keeps machine guns in his closet, Ed Lauter (“Family plot”, “The longest yard”) . “) how a little unorthodox copper and even Alex Winter (from“ The Excellent Adventures of Bill and Ted! ”) in his debut role of one of the goons.
