Tycus is almost as bad as a sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> I can hardly find something good about this film. The rooms are completely wrong. It is supposed that the comet will strike the Moon and cause catastrophic damage to the Earth, but no one believes the scientist who predicts this. A whole underground city plus a launch pad for nuclear-armed rockets is being built in the mountains of California, so that no one will notice. When the comet approaches Earth, the news reaches television and newspapers barely a day before the event. And so on and so on ... <br /> <br /> None of the emotions get on the screen. Is the genius who discovers a comet and builds an underground city, the savior of mankind or animals? The director or Dennis Hooper, who plays the role, seems not to have decided until the film is shot, and in fact it makes no difference, because acting and directing are so confusing that you end up wondering what say this movie. Special effects are so cheap that they not only cannot be convincing in the era of computer effects, but they could not be convincing even in the 50s, four decades before the creation of this film. <br /> <br /> A complete waste of time.
