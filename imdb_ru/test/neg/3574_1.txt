I recently rented this film on DVD and thought it would be an interesting choice, since I am also from the north of England (Bradford), and also interested in making films. However, it soon became apparent that this film lacked a decent level of script development. The characters were weak and often stereotyped, and the plot lacked content. The subject can be an interesting basis for the film. However, the delivery of this was naive and unfocused. <br /> <br /> The ending seemed as if she was judging the characters - punishing and rewarding where the filmmakers felt the need. It was a bit awkward and stupid, and it seemed to contradict the “realism” used in the shooting style. For me, the film touched the characters and the plot is rather clumsy and clumsy. It seemed to me that the writer had already decided how he wanted to finish the story, and began to break everything else to fit it. <br /> <br /> Another point I feel very concerned about is the blurry Ken Loach I feel like there was a movie. I am very upset that British filmmakers cannot see that there is more to British films than "harsh realism." This has become an almost safe option. The film is an infinitely beautiful platform for creative ideas, and British producers do not use it. In the UK, a lot of talent. Unfortunately, most of these people end up either making music videos and commercials 100% of the time, or they leave for America. <br /> <br /> “Love + Hate” would work better if it were reduced to 30 or 60 minutes and presented as a one-time television drama.
