I have never been a big fan of Almodovar, but, as a rule, I always found something that I could like in his films. Unfortunately, I had more problems finding something to get in Broken Hugs than I usually thought. <br /> <br /> I believe that the biggest mistake in “Broken hugs” is symbols and the lack of depth that they display. The film, in fact, is a love story, tragic and wants to engage the viewer in its stories. I found this problematic from the start. <br /> <br /> In the initial scene, our “hero”, director / screenwriter, Mateo, has sex with a very attractive young woman with whom he has just met. His agent enters when the woman shyly leaves. <br /> <br /> At the opening scene, our “hero”, director / screenwriter Mateo, has sex with a very attractive young woman with whom he has just met. His agent enters and rolls his eyes when the woman bashfully leaves. Mateo chats about having to enjoy life as the only thing he left behind. Being blinded in a tragic car accident that also killed his “real” love Lena, played by Penelope Cruz, the viewer can agree with this concept, except that the rest of the film never really illustrates why Lena was the love of his life or anyone or else. the depth of his character or any other. <br /> <br /> Cruz plays Lena, the mistress of an industrialist named Ernesto Martel. From the very beginning, their alliance is rather pitiful, since Martel pulls jealousy towards Lena, and Lena avoids self-doubt, staying with a much older Martel. To skip ahead, Martel funds the film for Mateo so that he can follow the film's star, Lena. Naturally, without any backstory, Lena and Mateo fall in love. And in the world of Almodovar, it's really that simple. Mateo, at the opening of the scene, has sex with a sexy young woman, now Mateo falls in love with Lena, later it turns out that after their romance he had a son with his agent. Her son responds to this information with a laugh and "Oh, good." Again, there is no depth, no understanding for any of these characters, it all just happens. From the very beginning of the film to the end, I did not feel the depth of emotions from Mateo. It is flat and not much different from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> One scene that I really liked was when the producer of the film Martel watches the video that his son recorded under the guise of making a documentary film about Mateo. It is pleasant to see Martel obsessively watching lip reading confirm his worst fears. Later, Lena confronts Martel when he looks at the footage and says out loud his part, coinciding with the footage of her lips during a conversation. Some pretty brilliant moments. Rather contrived, but still very exciting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for me the rest of the film made me feel bored. I could not take care of these characters or their situations, so no amount of ingenuity on the part of Almodovar can compensate for this lack of depth. I think that if you are a fan of his work, you will like this film, but if you are like me, then you will not have enough of this.
