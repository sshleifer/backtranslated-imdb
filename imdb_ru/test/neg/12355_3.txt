Need to add a comment to this !!! <br /> <br /> Firstly, ironically, you need to add a “spolier alert” to match the parameters of IMDb, but there’s absolutely nothing that can be “spoiled”. <br /> There are six characters: a beautiful girl, whose guide to the list of mountains in the "climbing" area, and, apparently, among all the guides (including Mount Everest Sherp) on the planet; her lost love, which disappeared from the title pass two years ago, which the party allegedly seeks but never finds; her friend, the store owner, is also a guide who can be better than a sherpa but does not suit her; a strange lead actor who deals with her services and says they will find her long-lost love in the deal; his only partner, a computer hacker with a supposedly limitless experience, of a level sufficient to enable Gates to turn to him for advice; and his other colleague, a bodyguard, whose, apparently, IQ does not even exceed three digits. <br /> <br /> Of course, vile deeds are taking place, and the secret task of the lead actor is to restore the satellite, which fell in the “passage” and has changing the world and unique data to bring innumerable riches to them. That is what is never revealed. <br /> <br /> Too many scripts. The script looks like something that can get C- in a class for beginners writing (but F, if presented at a higher level), and thespians gnaw each piece of scenery that looks like a crowd of beavers. <br /> <br /> The most interesting aspect of this film for me was the comparison of parts with three other roles or roles that I saw. <br /> <br /> First, the mysterious, undisclosed secret data brings to mind the “Spanish Captive”, the A-List / Mamet film surrounding the valuable corporate “process” that was never specifically explained but better for him. . Definitely not. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the biscuit turned out to be, perhaps, even more resourceful than Rambo, and quickly coped when he was threatened later in the presentation. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, I remember Stephen Seagal (do not remember the name), where he was in a semi-conscious state and remained alive for about 1/3 of the time, and also in a complete coma for another 1 / 3. Despite the fact that I did not seek to look through most of his work, I saw enough to note that, being in a coma, he provided the best job he had ever had, and most corresponded to his laconic person. In this opus, the waking young hacker may have been the most attractive person on the screen, but being unhealthy and incapable during the last part and incapable of emotions, he provided the best game during these seemingly endless two hours. /> <br /> Take a thin, silly basis for the plot here. Imagine that he is compressed, say, in “lbit” by SNL, with Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Martin Short in four roles. They can hear laughter with a few changes in this dialog box. <br /> <br /> The most interesting aspect in the last analysis is thinking about what information could be on a spy satellite in order to cost “even billions” to any of many nations and yet depreciated (according to hacker gurus) if just posting on the Internet, with no visible consequences after that? Even a turkey like this should have a little logic somewhere. This one is completely devoid.
