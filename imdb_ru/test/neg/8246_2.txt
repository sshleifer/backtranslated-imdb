This film is so predictable when you know the modern American dream: do nothing, be a loser, and then suddenly ... oh! You are a genius and nasty, and the world kisses the land on which you walk. <br /> <br /> And surprisingly, all other smart people are losers. They know nothing and are bitter when our miracle solves problems so easily. And what's the problem? They are so complex, but still these professors can analyze the results in less than 10 seconds. <br /> <br /> Any film has something good, and Robin Williams is at it.
