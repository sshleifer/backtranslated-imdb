Surprisingly, this not talented actor Chapa made all these famous stars appear in this dark, pitiful, trashy and far too long film about a low-hit gangster that looks white, but half Mexican, much of the acting skills are bad, and many famous stars in this trashy the film gets a screenplay that seems to be composed by a 16-year-old child, I'm sure this film is the lowest point of a career for actors like Dunaway, Wagner, Keach, Tilly and Busey, who I am sure are very confused that they when - either appeared in this movie turkey. I doubt that many people have ever heard of Chap, and after this terrible film I am sure that he will disappear into oblivion, where he should be.
