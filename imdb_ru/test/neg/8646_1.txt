I saw this movie on the shelf in a blockbuster and thought it looked cool. The DVD case was advertised by many great actors, and I was surprised: “Why have I never heard of this movie?” Then I turned the case over and saw director Lee Tamahori, and so the answer began to be explained. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to defeat the idea that a great cast is equal to a great film, but, more importantly, I think I should explain why this film is so terrible. Well, the script is terrible and full of one-dimensional characters. This is the worst role I have ever seen in the game Chazz Palminteri, and I am surprised that he would do something ridiculous. However, underestimated, but talented actors must earn their money. Palminteri plays a one-dimensional police detective, who looks about as stupid as a mafia hangman. He, along with the lead detective (poorly managed by Nolte), the great but simple Michael Madsen and the late Chris Penn (whose role along with Madsen was completely thrown out) make up an elite squad of detectives from Los Angeles who is tasked to rid the city of gangsters somewhere in the end 30s or 40s. In the film, this squad is represented as police officers who violate every law, so that those who believe that he is above the law do not work in their city. At the beginning of the film, the cops climb into a local restaurant, grab the alleged gangster (William Peterson) and take him to the place they call Mulholland Falls. They throw him off one of the cliffs on Mullholland Drive, and this should demonstrate how seriously these guys are going to rid the city of crime. No difference. It was nothing more than a cheap excuse for using a stupid name created to make you think of Los Angeles and its famous sites. Somewhere later they find the dead body of Jennifer Connelly, and the plot begins. <br /> <br /> On the road, which was just amateur and weak! Aside from the fact that the characters were quality in B-movies, replaying with such characters as Trit Williams, the guy who plays the police chief, and the terrible Daniel Baldwin are just a few highlights that made this film seem like it was Lee The first movie Tamhori. The film does not have any good performances, except maybe Melanie Griffith, who, some may say, was the worst in the film (she won Razzia for this film). In the end, it was her character, which was not so great, and she really had nothing to work with. <br /> <br /> Like any bad movie, it all starts with the writing, and this script was not a jewel. The plot is formulated simply on the basis of the setting of the next scene and never takes into account the motivation of the characters. The way the characters behaved was incredible. Police officers taking the law into their own hands are plausible under the right circumstances (see LA CONFIDENTIAL), but in this case it seemed that these guys could get away with anything, including murder, and never lose sight of cleanliness. I assume that we, as an audience, must assume that no one has seen anything, and that people will not ask questions. Everything in this story is predictable, and it is so well fed that we understand everything that will happen long before the characters do. However, this does not make us feel smart, but rather makes us angry for how stupid the hero is, despite the fact that there are no heroes in this film. <br /> <br /> In the end, the best component of the film was a great David Grusin score. From the very beginning, he called Chinatown, which quickly disappeared when I realized how incredible everything in the film was. It didn’t surprise me that a colossal eleven million were in the checkout. What I say is that this film is worth a look at a few laughs. Nick Nolte's play is like a poorly domesticated landfill, and I laughed every time he tried to be serious. I also almost fell to the floor on each of the slow frames used in the film (I think there are three with one during the key battle scene). When you have to use slow motion in the midst of a dramatic moment, you clearly have some problems. So, even with my negative criticism, I will recommend this film solely for the purpose of luring laughter, that is, if you value good films, such as LA CONFIDENTIAL.
