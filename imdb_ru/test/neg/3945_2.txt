In "Lost," the story is very similar to some Asian horror films, which talk about technology. Some of these Asian horror films are “One Missed Call,” “Ringu,” and “Pulse.” So, the idea of ​​"Staying Alive" is very clear and obvious, but the filmmakers stand behind it. he did not know how to make something new or interesting for cliches in Stay Alive. This movie is totally shitty. But a very big crap. All elements of Stay Alive belong to the worst class of horror films: small characters, worthless, dull “horror” that makes you laugh and stir up violence. It is easy to see that the “director” is unable to create something original or disturbing. I do not want to waste more time writing this pathetic story. Film. I just give you advice: do not watch this movie. I really hated him.
