I remember catching this movie on one of the Showtime channels. What stood out for me is that this film is completely happening in Phoenix, Arizona. I am from there, so I can easily locate. <br /> <br /> Despite this, a ninja kills a scientist because they wear yellow sweaters and golf, which the police are stalking. It takes about half the cops to kill him, and when they eventually kill him, there are no visible bullet wounds. However, his spirit continues to live when a woman finds her and touches his katana. <br /> <br /> Since then, she is periodically obsessed and kills the police who killed the original ninja. Then comes another ninja from Japan to kill the evil ninja. This may be a plot device from the two previous films or perhaps a plot hole. All I know is that this film is very polite, bad and interesting. This is something that you can watch with a bowl of popcorn and a few friends and treat MST3K.
