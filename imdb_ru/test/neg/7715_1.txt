I worked in a video store. I saw this headline in the horror section and took it home as a free one-night rental. <br /> <br /> This film was really terrible, it doesnâ€™t have the quality of the ransom, because it really enjoys a respected subgenre. the film and just talking about its destruction. If the first film was not budget enough, then this film does take the cookies, being placed (mostly) indoors and at night ... therefore avoiding the stage setting of the cost of the first film. In the first 5 minutes of this film, the College The teacher comically goes through an attractive student. Instead of being upset, the lecturer half apologizes, and the girl mentions that, despite the fact that she was thrown through the hood of the car (he accelerated, approaching her), nothing to worry about ... after which he attacks her with a crowbar kills her! If this is not strange enough, he wants to experiment on her, returning her from the dead .... and therefore feels the need to take off her clothes to do it. <br /> <br /> The soft core of female nudity (and pubic hair) is rampant throughout the film and, frankly, the only real thing that attracts the attention of the average male viewer ... like a swimming scene in the first film ... but even saying that this film goes from bad to worse with its bad character play, shit dialogue and absurd plot twists .... why introduce a key character who survived 29 days from a zombie attack, only to kill them for 10 minutes. .. it's just a very very bad movie.
