I didn’t like this movie for many reasons - very boring! It was interesting how they thought what the future would look like, but seriously I was very bored looking at it. There was hardly any action. Although the soundtrack of the Classical Orchestra was very pleasant. The visual effects were very creative. Whenever this film appears on television, I want to instantly change the station. Not because it’s a bad movie, just because I know what I like when I watch it - complete and utter boredom. This is a film that I saw in my youth, but I was never fond of science fiction ... because it was simply not real. Just like this film - very unreal. I still do not understand half of the film.
