Well, to begin with: I love horror movies, even the worst scenes or the most insanely terrible actions will not spoil the impression, as long as there is a certain amount of blood and suspense. Secondly, it is the worst movie of all time. It even beats sneaky guns and assaulted tomato killers. And for that I pay homage. <br /> <br /> However, involuntary humor was funny only until half of the movie was gone, after which it was all so sad. Much to my surprise, the reviews were somewhat divided; and you guys who rated this piece of C-movie-crap from 7 and up; I know you are joking! NOT BAD!! Hahaha Because if there is some reason in the world, and we have only one and the same idea of ​​what quality is; You can't be for real. <br /> <br /> All that is worth mentioning about the content is already summarized, so I'll leave it. <br /> <br /> Small spoiler warning <br /> <br /> But the scene in which the guy in the rubber mask is dragging the woman back and forth in the nursery for ten minutes, with such a terrible musical score and a breathtaking dialogue between they really do it for me.
