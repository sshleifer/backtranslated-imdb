A young woman nicknamed "TNT." for being a virtual dynamite in combat and a knockout in terms of appearance, is sent to the most lawless part of Hong Kong in search of his missing brother Deer Jackson. Upon learning that he was killed, she decides that she will bring the killer to justice only as she can. <br /> <br /> Sounds good, right? Well, in fact, there is nothing wrong with the fact that the main premise is the starting point for the militant / militant militants, which is the goal. Leaders actually turn out pretty good when Jeanne Bell fits perfectly into the role of "T.N.T." and Stan Shaw succeeds as an ambitious, power hungry charlie. Where this fails is in terms of the hostilities it offers. The fighting scenes are absolutely and completely unconvincing and / or sometimes so completely fascinating that they reach the point of absurdity, which does not help at all when the main focus of your film is the heroine of the Kung Fu action movies. In addition, poor lighting, artistic sports accents make them difficult to understand, tricky camera work and sometimes poor sound do not help this obvious low budget. It really brings in one area that can delight some fans, it really offers a lot of T in "T & A", in fact virtually every fight scene in the film is accompanied by some nude scene, and Jeanne Bell does have one extended fight scene in which she is completely naked to the waist. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is not what you would like to return to, because the scenes of the struggle are so pathetic, ridiculously bad.
