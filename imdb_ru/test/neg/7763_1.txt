“Sex and the City” has something interesting. The problem is that he is burdened with a number of negatives that really harm the final rating and review for six seasons. <br /> <br /> The good sides of SATC are that many conversations ring true. life, romantic stories are interesting, and the characters are funny. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is that few women behave like real whores. These four women have so many partners, even in some episodes they become lesbians, that you have no choice but to roll your eyes to complete absurdity. The men on the show are mostly depicted as petty, geeks, liars, cheats, and jesters. The obscene language used by these women far exceeds what normal conversation entails. Why do authors do this? Clear to be excessive and get your attention. <br /> <br /> Another thing that bothered me (without spoiling) was how some relationships ended. They just didn't sound real to me or to others with whom I discussed it. <br /> <br /> But, despite the fact that I gave the show 2 stars, in the end I am glad that I watched the show. I actually watched each season several times. I really recommend the show for anyone who will not be offended by the strong profanity and soft core of pornography. I could have done less with offensive expressions and acts of nudity and sex, but the novel was very good, and the saga ended pretty well.
