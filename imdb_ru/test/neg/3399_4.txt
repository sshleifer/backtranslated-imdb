This is just a long advertisement for the movie “The Tunnel of Death”. While this is an interesting story of Waverly Hills Sanatorium, the whole theory of ghosts depends on your interpretation. More "Ghost Orbs", which you can copy with dust in front of the camera with a flash, and "Ectoplasmic Mist" is just someone's cigarette smoke lit by the flash of the camera. I could not see the "Shadow People" until they had drawn a contour around the blurred image distortion. No scientific explanation of the phenomena was proposed, only paranormal phenomena. Perhaps these are the only events that need to be believed, so be sure to plan a visit to the sanatorium for your next vacation in Louisville, Kentucky.
