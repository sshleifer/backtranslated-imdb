Is it possible that the film will get worse? A bunch of monkeys wandering around, mumbling, acting supposedly stupid, and we have to laugh? There is no plot here to keep you going. Even when women finally appear, there is no sign of improvement; the most anticipated things happen, and by the time the movie ends, you can already sleep. Caution: this is not a trash cult movie, this is a trash period! I can not believe that there is even a continuation of this! <br /> <br /> 1
