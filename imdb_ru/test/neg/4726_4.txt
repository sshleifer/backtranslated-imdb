This is another notorious Mexican horror film: however, although the original Spanish version is quite tame, for the English title version (prepared by Gerald Intrattor, who performed similar duties in THE CURIOUS DR), all sorts of bleeding and nudity were added. HUMPP [1967/71] - and, like the American version of this film, was previously available on DVD via Something Weird / Image)! <br /> <br /> At first I looked at the original, and, despite the absence of strong shocks, it was quite interesting, especially with such a familiar plot as this: the doctor goes beyond the call of duty, trying to save lives. his terminally ill son; he even has a clumsy assistant on his feet (played by Carlos Lopez Motezuma, who played a strikingly similar role - albeit in a more sinister vein - in the Weeping Woman Course [1961]). I know that in several Mexican films the horror is mixed with the genre of “Ray Libre”, but I have never watched it myself; this element is present here - in fact, the heroine is a fighter - but these two styles, perhaps, fortunately, are separated from each other (nevertheless, the sequence of the struggle was done competently, with some movements that turned out to be quite funny). <br /> <br /> The doctor’s son turns into a monster (similar to the Incredible Hulk with mud on his face!) after a monkey’s heart was transplanted to him - but then, when he was replaced with a comatose female wrestler’s heart, he remains so and grows a couple of fangs to boot (unless it really turned into a transsexual ... although I guess it would not be very interesting) !! The climatic sequence on the roof, in which the monster kidnaps the child and meets his death in the hands of the police, recalls the ghost of Frankenstein (1942). My favorite unintentionally funny moments in the film, however, happen when the doctor, trying to reassure his son, tells him that he will soon recover - only to turn his back soon after that on the verge of tears - as well as an impatient look he gives his crippled assistant (because the latter is slowly reeling in the car), when they are going to chase the monster who escaped from the laboratory. <br /> <br /> In the film, alternative nude scenes work (it was actually made by Cardona himself for the Mexican version of the rider called HORROR Y SEXO), but his reputation is largely based on additional material that demonstrates excessive violence, such as squeezing eyeball out of the nest, scalping and even the head is torn off. There are also a few graphic inserts for operations that, nonetheless, lead to stupidity: although it is clear that only two people are involved in the operation, we see that the third pair of hands constantly hold an oxygen mask on the patient's face! <br /> <br /> They say that this film is a free remake of its own black-and-white horror film Cardona DOCTOR OF DOOM (1962), but since I did not watch this film, I cannot say how much of it was stolen during the night of bloody monkeys ...
