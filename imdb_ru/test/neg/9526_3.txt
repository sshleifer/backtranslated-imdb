As a person who knows the filmed ship and some other ships, I can not watch a movie just like a movie. Since there are some wonderful, wonderful shots of the ship in the film, most of them were taken on an existing ship - except for those in the crash scenes, of course, in a certain room below deck. But as for the story and the dialogue, I can only call it big shit. Nothing like this will happen on a real sailing ship. It is not surprising that the film had a bad effect on the existing ship - if I didn’t know better, I definitely didn’t have the temptation to make a sailing trip. Definitely, for Europeans, I recommend turning off as soon as the ship ran aground. After this, a superemotional, very American part begins, which I could not bear. The photos are really, really great, which is not surprising in the film by Ridley Scott, but if you can avoid listening to the text, it will be much better.
