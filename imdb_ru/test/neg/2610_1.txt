This son of a sequel was terrible, to say the least. One would think that the production would be better 10 years after the original was released, but the Retro Doll Master was not directed or written by the original authors and contained a bad story, the absence of any emotional connection with any characters and slowly stretched the scene into the scene. No increase in a strong plot, a very weak climax, you will slowly get nervous throughout the entire film if you can sit through the entire movie. I could never understand why the horror film continues to be filmed in the sequel after the release of their “last chapter”. I hardly suggest watching this movie, but if you need to, I would not advise anyone else to sit with you.
