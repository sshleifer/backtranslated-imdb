Jude Law gives Keanu Reeves a chance to earn his money as the most wooden actor of all, the character René W - straight from Beverly Hillbillis, and the two leading roles have the same chemistry as Darth Vader and Queen Amedaly. “Bad guys” is the worst kind of cliche, and there is not a single fine point in the film. It is incredible that some critics really liked this film.
