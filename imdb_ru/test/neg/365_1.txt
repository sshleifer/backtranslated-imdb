I say "click" because it does not deserve the name "film" and, of course, not "film". I regret having paid the rent, and although I had never gone to the cinema before, it would have been like that if I had seen it in the theater. A society that lives underground in the future (ooo, THIS is the original), a lot of burning drum drums, inexplicable ambient lighting shining through the windows, an ungrateful woman and her shocked son ... the list goes on and on. K. Thomas Howell amazes with the hoarse voice of a stereotypical loner; You know how Eastwood was made to death. He needs special sunglasses to remember his wife and child, but in memories he is of the same age! Talk about bad memory! I watched incredulously when a little boy, Abe, accidentally entered a code on the door, and it opens! No tension, meaningful religiosity (what religion?) Influenced by / overtones ... the sad thing: I expected more from Roddy Piper; <br /> <br /> Quite possibly the worst movie experience in my life.
