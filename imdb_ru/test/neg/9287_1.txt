I usually really like Lawrence, and while in Australia, I didn’t see him stand up, so when I saw this in my video store, I thought, yes, I’ll see. I wish I had seen it now. Obviously, Lawrence had a deep experience that opened his mind, and I think he wants to share this with others, but this was not the time or place. <br /> <br /> This whole experience seemed like a motivational speech in hell that’s true. I believe that the key phrase of the night was: “Drive until the wheels fall”, which he mixed with simple obscene jokes that revolve around sex and sexual organs. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I Do not pay attention to rough humor, but Lawrence lacks the gift to classify him in the spirit of Eddie Murphy, Richard Prior or Robin Williams. Lawrence was just indecent, the only time I laughed was when he resumed his experience with the law and his recovery at the hospital. If there were negative points, I would give them ....
