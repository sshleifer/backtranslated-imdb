* Spoilers are here * <br /> <br /> How to start, how stupid was this movie? "People the size of a mole, living under a garden, attack the inhabitants of a large house" !!! When I first sat down to watch this film, I did not know that the main characters were not poltergeists, etc., and 10-inch goblins, who looked very light to strike hard and far. I continued to watch it, because I like to watch films to the end, even terrible. this film was terrible. My friend, who went to bed for the first ten minutes, except that she had found a good helper in a dream, thought it was funny to me to watch all this. <br /> <br /> Tiny goblins, even in large numbers (stupid thought, I know), are as scary and formidable as a flat stake. They managed to “kill” only one guy and kill the cat before they were blown up, “The End”. I mentioned it sucks, right?
