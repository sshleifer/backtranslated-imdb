When Las Vegas came out, in one review this show was described as “a quote from a harmless fluff”. It goes without saying that after watching a dozen or so episodes, I think this description is right on the money. An assortment of cute boys and pompous models plays out a lot of paper thin stories, all the while trying to pretend to be serious businessmen. One-dimensional characters, in one-dimensional setting, pursuing one-dimensional stories. That pretty much sums up Vegas. I still observe from time to time whether the show is trying to evolve and whether it perceives itself to be a little serious, but, alas, to no avail. Still.
