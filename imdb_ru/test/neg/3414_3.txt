I only bought this DVD because it was very cheap and seemed interesting in its own way (“special”, meaning “retarded”). The film turned out to be rather uninteresting - a boring cinematographic work, nothing really drives history, and, of course, the action is terrible. It was not even "bad" in the marching manner - it was just bad. There are actually some excellent lines of dialogue, but for the most part it is awkward and weak. While I was watching this, I could only think that this film could have been good, if the script had been thoroughly revised (if it had been written by someone who really understood the drug culture), and if some worthy actors were chosen . I would not recommend “Weekend with the Nanny”, unless you are planning a career in cinema and want to find out what you should not do in the cinema.
