Countless historical and cultural mistakes 0/10 <br /> <br /> (1) A Jew named OMAR !!! Hahahaha (2) A brilliant detective shot the least intelligent guy from the movie! (3) Jewish suicide bombers! That was funny. (4) Hitler and his best guns went to watch a movie in the center of Paris !!! With two guards at the door. !! Shoot me. (5) Brad Pitt beat it, and it was painful to look at him. (6) Mr. QT rewrites the story: "Hitler was killed in the theater, really!" <br /> <br /> And finally, someone can tell me how this movie got into the 250 best films of all time !!! Shame, shame, shame, still wondering how someone might like this movie.
