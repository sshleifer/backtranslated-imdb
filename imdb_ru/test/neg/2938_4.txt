However, it must be said that maybe in America, perhaps even more than, say, here in the UK, this can still be a very delicate matter. Just take a look at the entire defeat of gays in the army a few years ago in the United States. It is with “In and Out” that writer Paul Rudnik talks about the mentality of small cities in Central America and how the press in the US (as well as in the UK) does so much in finding a celebrity. You only need to look when Will Young and Stephen Gately of Boyzon come out of the closet. <br /> <br /> The film is about Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline), an English teacher at a high school in his hometown. People are preparing for the night of Oscar, because one of the nominees Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) came from his city and was a former student of Howard. Cameron, who plays a gay soldier in the Vietnamese epic, receives an award just because Howard was gay during his opening speech. This could not have happened at the worst time for Howard, who is just a few days from marrying his bride and school colleague Emily. (Joan Cusack). As you would expect, the media reaction is catastrophic and turns Howard’s life upside down. He not only tries to convince his family and friends that he is not gay, but also evades the messy news reporter Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck). <br /> <br /> Although it was announced as a comedy with a wormhole, it is clear that Mine and director Frank Oz are also trying to be satirical. All you need to do is look at the early scenes in Cerimony Oscar and how the people of Bracets Hometown and the school council react to its release. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film does not match the promise we see at the beginning of the film. This is a rather flat attempt to make a social commentary from a stupid comedy. A good cast is sadly wasted by a scenario that never delivers an incredible amount of laughter and is far from as astute as he thinks. <br /> <br /> Klein gives us the same amazing performance he gave us in his previous comedy 'Dave, turning Howard into an instantly cute character. Cusack is also a good value because Howard’s weight is obsessed with the bridegroom, while Tom Selleck plays very well against the font as a gay news reporter. Bob Newhart is also pleased, as is the director of Howard High School. Nice to see him on the big screen for a change. It's a shame that it should be so. <br /> <br /> The performances are as good as possible; they can do little to save the film from a rather boring novel. While a couple of scenes does offer some fun. This is an inspirational scene where Howard tries to seem more manly while listening to the tape with self-help. There is nothing to enjoy, and when it seems that nothing is worse, the Mine resorts to a disgusting finale, which rolls in excessive mood. I also could not help but feel that my intellect was offended. Mella seems to be too vile a character to become a person who puts his ethics before getting a good story, while Cammeron finally comes to the aid of the climax of the film, at first glance it seems to be too involved in a character, to take a little care of what happens to his former teacher. In the end, it was he who caused all the problems in the first place. <br /> <br /> “In and Out” is not exactly dire. But when you think that such Klines work better, for example, “Fish named Wanda”, you cannot help but feel that this is a great talent, unfortunately wasted. <br /> <br /> Robs rating: * *
