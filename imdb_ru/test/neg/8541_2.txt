The group of adventure seekers goes to the “dark continent” to try to find a lost heirer named Diana, who disappeared many years ago in a plane crash and who is now believed to live with a wild tribe who considers her to be her goddess. <br /> <br /> And again, my search for sloppy European cannibal films led me deep into Jess Franco's territory - seemingly endless cinematic wilderness, teeming with irregular script writing, crawling from crap camera work and abundant with terrible acting game Franco Lina Romei this time receives a prize for her pitiful performance in the role of a sick old woman). It was here, in this hellish place, that I finally came across the Diamonds of Kilimanjaro, a terrible jungle exploiter, so stunning that it took me three nights in a row to finish watching it. <br /> <br /> Tasteless and ruthlessly boring, even by Franco’s standards, this tedious piece of trash fails at almost every level: history is a terribly boring derivative of Tarzan Edgar Rice Burrow, albeit with a female twist; the film seems to have been made in local botanical gardens, although grainy shots are poorly integrated into the film in a meaningless attempt to convince viewers that the action is really happening in Africa; and the scenes of death are almost bloodless (Franco can usually rely on some spray, but, despite the initial appearances, this is not a cannibal film, and it's not so scary). <br /> <br /> Where the director, however, he manages to play sexy young Katya Bienert in the role of Diana's jungle bait. Running and jumping through the thickets only in a scanty loincloth, her sinuous body disproves the fact that she was only sixteen years old at that time, this beauty makes an impression. Franco also adds some more naked courtesy of Marie Carmen Nieto as Lita’s treacherous traveler (who gives us an idea of ​​her wild regions), and Elin Mess as female warrior topless Knobes, thus barely avoiding getting another 1/10 rating from me. (although I am sure that he will get even more in the future - I have a lot of his films that have yet to be seen).
