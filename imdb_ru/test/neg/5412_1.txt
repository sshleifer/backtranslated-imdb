Thank God for the DVR and high speed forward. Even with this, I could not survive this parody. When they stumbled upon an old Indian begging for beans, I gave up and erased it. Is this the best SciFi channel to offer on Saturday nights? How about old classics? The idea of ​​a special forces unit for students was pretty bad. It seems that they wanted to save money by shooting everything in the forest. What else can I say? It was so terrible that I didn’t think I could come up with enough lines to claim a place to consider it. But it looks like another line will do that. Save your time, not to mention your money for this movie dog.
