I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and I must say: I was not impressed, not at all. I support other posters when it comes to good performances, but some good performances do not make a good movie. <br /> <br /> On the discussion board I found a review by an anonymous author who captured some of the main points. It states: ““ Survey in practice ”is a film that raises many questions, but hardly answers even a few; a film that is disturbing and surpasses all categorization attempts; an experiment and a very common sexual drama, despite some shocking scenes. Barbara Cova and Andre Schneider, partly very impressive editing and good camera work (Steffen Ritter) compensate for the gross gaps in the plot and some technical errors (especially in sound). However, the boredom with which the audience has to deal with for 40 minutes remains. " Unfortunately it's true. I was not at all intrigued by this story. The main characters are cold people without ambitions. They use a lot of drugs and a lot of (incestuous) sex. So what? Many times it seemed that the direction was practically absent, not to mention the technical aspect: the poor sound quality was extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> What's the point of the movie? What is the message behind all this? An anonymous reviewer said: “Somehow, Bermann failed to make a clear comment, and so the film remains in the air in the air without a message. So boredom that I blame for this film. The film is restrained and unfeeling, cold, almost neutral, and this Disadvantages will not take long to wait: for long periods the characters of Sean and Ivy are not credible (they clearly have problems with English pronunciation), the character of the dumb brother is not well developed. Some moments are very promising though - in a scene where a call boy takes off his skin (the only true love scene), an intensity is reached at which one wants to watch the whole movie for a long time. As a spectator, you need to regret the missed chances. " Again, I have to agree. I really liked the final scene, especially because of the beautifully captured faces of Gianni Morera and Andre Schneider, but this was nothing compared to the boredom I suffered during the first thirty minutes. (However, the sex scenes were aesthetically staged and beautifully edited.) <br /> <br /> In general, the “Survey Deed” was not my cup of tea - a good, controversial idea was wasted - but it was interesting to see how to make a film with little or no money. Perhaps if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director, it would be a better film.
