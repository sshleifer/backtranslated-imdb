I think today they reward idiocy, because the one who came up with the concept of this film was not shot on the spot. <br /> <br /> This is an idiotic delight. The worst stereotypes in every ghetto and school life movie are stretched and turned into even more unbearable. Each character in this film has a story of crying out of sympathy. Let's pray for a remake where the whole school will be shelled. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** How is the Internet in such a bad school?
