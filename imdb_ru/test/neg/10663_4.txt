As a pleasant joke to one of the above comments: in Mumbai, about two weeks before the release of this film, they approached me — being white — to duplicate some lines of this film in a recording studio. <br /> <br /> Although I speak German, I was kindly asked to do all the duplicate scenes in English, otherwise it would be too confusing for the Indian audience ... Therefore, all Germans in this film actually speak -English! oddly enough, I made a few characters, so if you want to spoil your time a little, watch the movie and listen carefully; <br /> <br /> All non-indian characters are made with just 4 votes! ,,,
