At first I thought that “nasaan ka man” could be one of those progressive new Filipino films. As noted earlier, the film does not look badly made. It is clear that the directors used more expensive cameras for shooting, better viewing angles, better sound equipment, attractive actors and more successful locations. <br /> <br /> However, these improvements are purely superficial. if not all Polish and expensive filters, “nasaan ka man” would feel just like your typical, second-rate local film — hyperactive drama, predictable plot twists, “yes, that's right!” which you could worry about, it all squeezed your throat. <br /> <br /> Several things annoyed me because of this movie. First, since when can you have sex with a foster family? this non-blood argument has no meaning. secondly, didn’t the woman say that she had been raped for 40 years simply because her father told her to keep it a secret? and where the hell are the lights in this movie? I know that the director tried to make things super-dramatic, but I was simply forced to turn on the brightness feature on my TV.
