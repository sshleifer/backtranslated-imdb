I have to say that I really liked the "Blue" and "Difficult to kill." <br /> <br /> Seagal looked at people doing their funny martial arts. <br /> <br /> I was always looking forward to Seagal-Movies, and, unfortunately, I was at first disappointed by GLIMMER MAN, which seemed to me very bad. The foreigner is probably one of the worst Seagal has ever acted. <br /> <br /> Awfully boring, poorly edited, terrible soundtrack, and so on. Dear reader, do yourself a favor, stay away from it! <br /> <br /> Honestly, stay away!
