I wouldn't call myself a big fan of the ingenious nonsense of the genre, so I might not be the best audience for this show. Although, being a critic, I have a feeling of what I personally like or dislike, as this is later. <br /> <br /> Lack of humor is a big turn when it comes to comedy, everything can be catchy, cool and fun for about 4 minutes, and after that you start to get bored, unless it is a badger animation made by years ago (?) boring to be subjected to. Unfortunately, since he did have a big market ahead and great potential. <br /> <br /> Loss of time.
