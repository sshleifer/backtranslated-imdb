When I first saw this DVD in a three-dollar trash can, I really couldn't believe my luck: a Christmas movie with Tory Spelling in the lead role, William Shatner and Gary Coleman ??? Needless to say, I immediately grabbed it and found it a worthwhile investment. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was as bad as any movie you expect Christmas to combine with the three “celebrities” mentioned above. The dialogue was meaningless, the characters were one-dimensional, and the characteristic feature of Carol was completely incredible. The film itself was a lifeless bit of dullness that did not want to end and made me feel like a man when the end finally came. <br /> <br /> My advice: do not watch this film, if there is no need and then only under the influence of some serious celebratory eggnog.
