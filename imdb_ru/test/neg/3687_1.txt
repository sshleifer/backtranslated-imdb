I have never commented on IMDb, but after seeing this film, I cannot be calm. I just created my account here just because this horrible movie. in a nutshell, this movie is CLEAN COTTON. the film does not make sense at all! Nothing makes sense in this film. Watching this movie was painful. I don't understand why Val Kilmer agreed to make this film. He plays a minor role as a gang leader, says a few words, and he is there in just 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> I only bought this DVD because of the name of Val Kilmer on the box and interesting cover photos. <br /> <br /> As stated in another review, Moscow Zero stole my money, and I want it back !!! The name of the film itself gave a hint about the rating that everyone should give: ZERO
