It's horrible. <br /> <br /> A rather brief overview, I know, but it's been a long time since the movie left me in such an amazing state - I wonder how the hell this movie turns out. <Br /> <br /> The last time it happened in last year’s Turkey, “Mission to Mars”. <br /> <br /> Salvatore Coco is a former criminal who tries to improve himself with the help of self-help videos, endless seminars and refresher courses, He lives on the catchy phrases outlined in these courses. <br /> <br /> He stumbles upon a washed-up nightclub singer played by Nikki Bennett and has an epiphany; his new career will be associated with a talented agent - with a singer as his only client. <br /> <br /> With the financing of his paralyzed girlfriend singing in the Gospel, played by Sasha Horler, he opens a store and tries to resume Nikki's career, which leads to disastrous results. <br /> <br /> “Walk the Talk” is the reason why Australians are so scornful about Australian cinema. He is poorly constructed, lame and too long (111 minutes for a comedy that hardly had to scrape off the 80-minute mark). <br /> <br /> Each scene is too long and very repetitive. Audiences do not give a character who empathizes; a vital component in a film like this, ostensibly that the “loser” gives him a boost. <br /> <br /> Poor and frankly bad finals come at the end of 30 minutes of the most insane dialogue and scenes that you have to cry for a power failure. <br /> <br /> This film is a failure at all levels, which exacerbates the Queensland audience because of its liberal and inaccurate use of various places of the Gold Coast / Palm Beach; and the ridiculous use of Brisbane suburban names such as Norman Park and Caboolture.
