After the dull novel Heart of Darkness was completed, I switched to watching the film, which was a complete and absolute disappointment. In the beginning, I expected the film to help make a mosaic of a book. However, despite the fact that I was reading the novel, the film still did not make any sense, so I can not imagine how much I would have been lost if I had missed the book at all. It seemed that the writers chose their favorite roles, put them in the film and left everything that could help the audience in understanding the meaningless plot. This terrible film had no meaning, and I would strongly recommend not to watch it, since it will do nothing except that you will be completely confused and bewildered.
