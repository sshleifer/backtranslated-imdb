This film captures the short moments between mother and son in rural Russia when she dies. <br /> <br /> I’m so torn between being nice to the film or declaring it a test of patience. On the one hand, the film is beautiful, with a rare dialogue reflecting the essence of their feelings. In fact, there is nothing to say, because everything that needs to be said is conveyed beyond words. The son shows so much care, love and patience towards his mother, that I think this is a celebration of unconditional love for his family. It also cruelly reminds me that I may find myself in such a situation, stuck in a bleak place and forced to take care of a very sick person. “Mat I Syn” is a cruel reality. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, “Mat I Syn” is moving too slowly. Do I really need to watch the train passing the horizon for more than 1 minute? With my previous experience with “Taurus” and “Alexandra”, I tempt to put “Mat and Son” among them as a common bore. <br /> <br /> I think you need to be in the right state of mind to appreciate this movie. I certainly see the beauty of it, but maybe I'm not in the right condition.
