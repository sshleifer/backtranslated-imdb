The sound in the film was so mundane and ridiculous that for about 30 minutes they seriously knocked on the door hinges, they really broke their teeth and ached in the head. <br /> <br /> I love bad puns more than the next guy, but come on, "we have no blood," as Matt Dillon’s character says a million times, and when Matt Dillon’s character shoots ass, the main character I can not remember his name, because I do not think that anyone cares, literally gets blood on his hands. <br /> <br /> Background music with a heavy metal guitar, playing in a chord for about 5 minutes, is not my idea of ​​music, come on, by the end this garbage.
