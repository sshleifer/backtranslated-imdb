I really don't know if this should be science fiction or horror. It was confusing, if not more. However, I was really upset by the lack of development of the plot between the characters. <br /> <br /> Sheriff’s 17-year-old daughter (Bruce Boxleitner) (Clara Bryant) was stuck with him for the summer, and they don’t spend 30 seconds together on the screen. <br /> <br /> Hot Native American (Jennifer Lee Wiggins) obviously has everything for the sheriff, but they also don’t spend time together. <br /> <br /> Hot secretary (Kristen Hani) was dead, and she had more abilities than the other two combined. <br /> <br /> A poor developer is an overly used story compared to Native Americans, but I personally like it when evil developers get it when I live in Florida. <br /> <br /> The only reason I stayed with this is creation. It was original. I have never seen anything like it, and I am a lover of new creatures.
