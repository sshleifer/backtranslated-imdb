I entered this movie, set up to please. I usually like dramas such as Wall Street, Glen Gary, Glen Ross, Boilerroom, etc. I entered this film, thinking I would be on the edge of my place. Also, I'm a big fan of pacino. <br /> <br /> What a piece of trash. Quite possibly the worst film I've seen in five years. This makes Pacino routing on any Sunday really looks good. First, half of the film looks like Matthew McConaughey lifts the weight. OK, we got it. You are in shape, Matt. We do not need to see every other scene when you pump iron without a shirt. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how many holes are there in this movie from the plot? Why enter a phone call from Brandon's long-lost father and never answer him again? What is the point that his mother hung on him - why did she even get a call to say that he was sending her too much money - what's the point of that? The guy from Puerto Rico who lost 30 million? In addition, since sports betting in New York is prohibited and illegal, how can they guarantee everyone's bets at the end? <br /> <br /> It was just a very poorly written script. He had potential, but he was deprived of a coherent storyline. I thought that Pacino learned a lesson about choosing scenarios after any Sunday, but obviously not. My God, this is the same actor who starred in the Godfather! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money.
