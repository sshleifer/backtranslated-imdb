I was entertained to see that some of the reviews here were crowned with ** SPOILERS ** with a joke in my family, that the only part of this film that was not given on the back of the box was given a title. Maybe I'm just a solid American 17-year-old who wouldn't know art if it bit my leg, but I prefer films that have at least a few words. This film makes the second half of 2001: A Space Odyssey is directly talkative. This film is so slow that it is not even art, it is just boring. We are following this creepy guy who is following this boy in Venice. The end was incomprehensible until I read the end of the book. The film should not force you to turn to the book, it should be able to stand alone. This film does not have the ability to stand. He doesn't even have the bones of the plot on which to lean.
