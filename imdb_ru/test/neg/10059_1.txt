I have never seen so much talent and money used to produce something so bad in my whole life! As noted in other comments, such talented people as Christopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway, Donald Sutherland and many others were combined in a film that is not recognizable as the story of Agatha Christie. I keep thinking about how this could be with the same composition made correctly. <br /> <br /> The film has even less intimacy than Christopher Reeves’s Superman films. Large cast makes the film even less effective than in these films, because there is not enough time to get to know someone. Dave Brubeck's progressive soundtrack made me wonder if there was a wrong video in the rental case. The music became increasingly offensive as the story progressed. It is difficult to say whether the soundtrack or the annoying technique of repeating information from earlier scenes was more offensive. From someone who saw most of Christie’s films (that’s what attracted me to this, it was one of the few that I hadn’t seen) missed that one. This is not an Agatha Christie film. Golan-Globus is better suited for making films about wrestling, and not about the cozy atmosphere of English secrets.
