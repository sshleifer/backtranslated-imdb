I am in no way joking when I say that this film was worse than any other film. Worse than Batman and Robin. Worse than Manos, the Hands of Fate. Seriously, this is so bad. When people tell me that the movie is terrible, I use the “Two Girls” scale to figure it out. If the film is comparable to the film "Two Girls", I will not watch it. If it’s twice as good, maybe I’ll watch it, but only laugh at the mentally retarded, who paid someone for creating it, because the film is twice as good as this one will still be nonsense.
