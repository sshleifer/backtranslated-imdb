Killing time on Saturday morning, Looking for Lola appeared on HBO. I decided to give him a chance, although the description of the film looked pretty bad. It was even worse than I could ever have imagined. The film was incredibly incredible, and between the leading actors there was absolutely no chemistry on the screen, and I found myself shaking my head almost every 10 minutes. Between Mike Greenbaum (lead actor) in scenes in which he misses an account in a trendy restaurant and where Lola (lead actress) allows him to use his boss's house to fool his parents, thinking he is rich, it was almost as bad as well as his “dreaming” about the people who surround him, who make the macaroons (it was HORRIBLE!) and two actors who were in love in the end. I continued to want to change the channel, but I tried to give him every chance of becoming a sweet love story with a few chuckles. It never happened. In fact, it became so bad that I decided to end it just so that I could argue that I was watching one of the worst films ever made in its entirety, instead of being criticized for "Did not give him equal opportunity." The final scene where Lola is trying to dance was the climax of the film. She comes late after marriage (even the scene in which Mike tells the priest to hurry, and then just takes the papers, claiming that this was done, is consistent with the plausibility of this film), and then somehow “convinces” the judges to look at her. the male judges are already shocked at how late she is. But after seeing her performances on stage (well, she dances well, but not too impressively), everyone joins, including the Lola and Mike families, other dancers present there and * even the judges cough. Bad, terrible, terrible. It was so bad that I had to write a review. Take a look at your own risk.
