It is possible that I simply did not give the film a fair enough chance, because it was so unattractive to me (something like this happened to Triplets of Belleville), but I really had to understand when I put on the film and my roommate, an exchange student from Japan immediately began to laugh at the film, saying that it sounds silly. I do not agree with the fact that it is stupid, the animation is very simple, but obviously very skillful. This is similar to the classic animation with added layers, which add another element of realism, while remaining strictly in the surrealistic world. <br /> <br /> But I don’t like this topic at all. He has an interesting message about stinginess and greed, but it is wrapped in such an unpleasant package that it is hardly worth studying, especially because you already knew him anyway. For example, sound effects, when a person eats loud cherries and cherry bones, are really disgusting. <br /> <br /> There was a very clever animation scene when we continued to endlessly plunge into the hole that a person finds in his head when he pulls a seedling from his scalp, but it lasts so long that it seems to overshadow everything . There is so much material in this one episode that it’s like the whole movie. <br /> <br /> As I already mentioned Triplets of Belleville, this would be great for late night television. a program similar to swimming for adults, or its Japanese counterpart, but a film nominated for an Oscar? I have the impression that, as a rule, the Academy does not have long lists of short animated films.
