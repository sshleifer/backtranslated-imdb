The most predictable film I've ever seen ... extremely boring, I feel I saw a hundred films with the same plot as this one. Acting is fine at best, there is no action really and there is no thrill. Capable actors with a terrible script, I think it could have been better written in 10th grade. I felt like hard housework, because I was hoping that there would be something in this film that set it apart from all the other rubbish, but it fits into a bunch. The whole movie I was waiting for something good, but it never came. I never appreciate films and never review films, but this film was so bad that I had to go here and publish a review to try to save a few poor souls from losing their time (and / or money) with this film. I copied it and would never waste my hard drive space. If I spent 10 dollars to see it in cinemas, I would kill myself.
