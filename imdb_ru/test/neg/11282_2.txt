I am leaving very few movie screenings, and this film has managed to become one of those that I could not watch anymore. As for the awards received at Turkish festivals, then, in my opinion, they are not credible. My only explanation for the Queens festival award was to think that the comedy was somehow “received in translation” because the subtitles helped divert attention from the horrible performances. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the show, which I visited, the host briefly described the history of Turkish cinema and at some point mentioned that the early Turkish cinema was properly called “stage cinema”, since many of the filmmakers and the actors were people from the theater scene. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, this film falls right into this category. Subtitle speakers who speak English may think that Turkish is a naturally loud language, and they are credited with all the cries in the film, but observant local commentators will immediately notice that all the actors are speaking with exaggerated loud voices. You could attribute this to the amateur character of all the actors, but the biggest source of “screaming dialogue” is the main character played by the only professional actor in the film. Not surprisingly, his experience in the theater. I assume that in response to his loud performance, all other amateur actors also raised their voices, which turned the entire film into a series of unnatural performances. <br /> <br /> Put on top of all this a storyline that develops at the speed of a snail, you get an extremely boring movie. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I also have a personal problem with Turkish films, which depict a completely rural life with small uneducated characters. Since Zugurt Aga, one of the best Turkish films ever made, Turkish directors seem to have been unable to avoid the attractiveness of the rural part of the country. This is only interesting in small doses, and if it is as beautifully organized with excellent writing and directing as in Zugurt Aga. Most often, however, this is extremely boring and, frankly, somewhat confusing the local "urban" Turks. Rural communities make up the forgotten, undervalued part of the country, and although it provides good material for comedy, it is costly for Turkey’s image. <br /> <br /> A member of a western audience whose only acquaintance with Turkey is that this film will undoubtedly think that Turkey is similar to Afghanistan. I would like the filmmakers to understand this and let go of their passion for the stories of the “rural man” and remain loyal to the majority of the country who live in cities that disgrace the capital regions of Europe.
