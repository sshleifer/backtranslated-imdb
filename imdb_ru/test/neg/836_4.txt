Undoubtedly, the least among spaghetti westerns I have seen lately: in fact, Leone’s robbery is “GOOD, BAD, and HUMBLE” (1966) with three scattered characters outwitting each other (and sometimes forming shaky alliances) in search of hidden gold . Leonard Maltin rated it like a bomb; although he is fairly harmless, he is also routine and, fatally, the three main roles are stereotypes that are uninteresting: Eddie Byrnes is a bank employee who has ideas about how his party is transported by train; Gilbert Roland is a “legendary” but aging Mexican gangster (his frequent failures in Spanish, when he is excited, rather banal!), Which, apparently, is still irresistible for women; George Hilton as a mysterious bounty hunter is trying too hard to imitate the figure of Clint Eastwood's "Man without a Name." Directed by Castellari, whom I saw at the Italian B-film retrospective held during the 2004 Venice Film Festival, where he was filmed as the most pompous of the cult cinema present! - shows a little sincere feeling for the West (due to the two above-mentioned efforts of Franco Nero in this genre, I ordered his collaboration with Castellari KEOMA [1976] ... I am now keeping my fingers crossed!) and the film is a mocking approach that is equally pitiable.
