The film begins with the narration of the main character, explaining some of the crimes occurring throughout the city, and then we learn that the hero is a policeman who is either suspended or probably retired. I didnâ€™t have the patience or interest to check the above before commenting. If there is a stereotype for narrators to have a deep, sleep-inducing voice, now is the time to put an end to this. I seriously fell asleep and did not even close the film. I'm still trying to figure out what the film was about, and why there was no filming on the street. The third series will have more sets compared to this shit from the film, and I still feel sorry for the actors and producers involved in this huge film nonsense. It was supposed to be produced as a regular television series or even as a local drama instead of putting it on the big screen. A complete waste of time and money. The film should have been in production for a long time, and it would be better to leave it that way. With redundant conversations and dreamy sets, this is the worst movie I've ever seen.
