I don’t know about you, but I’m going to horror movies to be afraid, and it wasn’t scary at all, the film had several chances to be really scary and fail EVERY TIME! Some of these supposedly disturbing moments were followed by some of the worst teams that you will see this year, perhaps a decade! I mean, when I say that cg looks like daytime television, I call daytime television a bad name, I have seen the best things on a science fiction channel. Who I really wish were the actors, (their names are attached to this film), they did a good job, I took care of most of the characters and felt that their performances were pretty good, but it was not enough to get this film out of the gutter . What is really fun is the reuse of some sets, if you have seen the "caster: the beginning," it will be easy to see the reuse of some buildings. However, what I thought was the worst thing in this film, even besides the problems with computer graphics, he was the main demon, he was just not afraid in any case, his form, the way he spoke, he was extremely soft. In general, this film was a terrible experience, and I would have left the theater if it were not for my wife, who wants to see the end.
