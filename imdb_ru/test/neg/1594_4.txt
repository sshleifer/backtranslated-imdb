I have seen most of the films of John Waters. With the exception of a few of his earliest ones that are unavailable, I actually saw almost all of them, so it’s obvious that I’m a big fan, and I’m sure I have a high tolerance for the rude and disrespectful in his films was excessive and disgusting, I adored FEMALE TROUBLE and POLYESTER - two monumental tributes to bad taste and excess, which are really funny movies. So I, of course, NOT disdainful and can take most of what Waters has to offer. However, in PINK FLAMINGOS, he created a film so disgusting, so unfunny and so offensive that I couldn't even stand it. In his other films, which he shot before he became more popular, they were funny. However, there is simply no humor here, as it seems that the goal is to shock the audience and in no way entertain them. I am glad that after creating this film, Waters' sense of humor has improved, as the dog's divine feces (as in this film) are shocking, but not interesting at all. My advice is to skip this film and just pretend that it never happened, and then watch its infinitely best films of the 70s and 80s.
