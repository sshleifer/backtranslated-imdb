Poorly acting and badly headed, the Congo unsuccessfully tries to recreate the feeling of a “Jurassic Park”. But the truth is that the book was not so great. However, the film’s first problem is that Tim Curry’s character was added; the second problem is that a talking hand has been added; However, the main problem is that the cast members do not create realistic characters. I guarantee that this film will not make you think that there are gorilla killers in the world. Also starring Laura Linney (happy birthday, Laura!), Dylan Walsh, Ernie Hudson, Grant Heslov, Joe Don Baker, James Karen and Bruce Campbell; I guess they do not want to emphasize this film in their resumes.
