Film producers are hoping that the name Cameron Diaz will help sell this picture. Unfortunately, nothing can save what has already been captured on the screen. Despite some beautifully filmed European locations and some solid production design elements, the film fails mainly because of the awkward, incredible romance between Brewster and Eccleston. Unpleasant cinematic experience.
