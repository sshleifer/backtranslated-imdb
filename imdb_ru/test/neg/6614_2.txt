I watched this with great trepidation, and it seems my trembling was quite reasonable. What was this movie about? Knight? Season? Players? What kind? It was all over the place all the time. There was no tension in it (sorry, we all knew that Bobby was going to curse and throw things), but Brian Denehi, a fine actor, faced sending out in anger and delivered zero stress. A cheap shot, as in the episode MacGiver. Compare this basic Thanksgiving course with the work that HBO did in the film “Don King” “Only in America” to show how to make sports biographies, warts and all that. Notice that ESPN contributed to this and then never showed it again?
