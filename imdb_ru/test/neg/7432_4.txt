Basically, this is the biography of the lustful Dr. Robert Merivel (Robert Downey), who sneaks into the royal palace in the first half of the film, and then helps the oppressed in the second half, mostly “Catherine” (Meg Ryan). <br /> <br /> GOOD - Fantastic decorations (like the magnificent royal palace) and costumes make this a visual delight. The language is also very tamed. Ian McKellen and Hugh Grant provide interesting support. <br /> <br /> BAD - after 50-60 minutes this film just gets too boring. An hour later, he desperately needed to give some kind of spark, but it happens the other way around: it stretches and continues. The script definitely needed the much-needed “recovery,” so to speak? The film may look beautiful, but it's two long hours to sit ... too long.
