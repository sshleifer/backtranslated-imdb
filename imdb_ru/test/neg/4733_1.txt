When to start?? I think that only three other films prompted me to post a review on IMDb, and they were all positive. As for that ..? <br /> <br /> Stunning, terrible, tragic, embarrassing, disastrous, stupid, annoying, completely and completely beyond the horror. <br /> <br /> I am stunned by this. Not to mention the theatrical release. I think I'm literally in shock. <br /> <br /> I am not a "snob". I did not expect beautiful filmmaking or intense depth of character, but this is really not a joke. We simply MUST demand more from the films we see. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Like the Black Death.
