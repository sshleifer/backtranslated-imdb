What a total disappointment. Forget this terrible movie and get the show instead. What did they do to make the American president relatively sane? ALL politicians had to be clumsy jokes (Peter Cook is good, like the British Prime Minister). He lacks the biting satire of the original, instead she chose a farce with the lowest common denominator. 1 out of 10 if I'm generous! This, unfortunately, is another example of a remake that does not completely correspond to the meaning of the original, the difference with this is that they were written by the same people.
