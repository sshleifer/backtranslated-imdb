This is not a true story. This is the darkest of all the fabrications that originate from events. He supports suicide, a morose obsession with death, a completely useless blow to organized religion in general (and the Anglican church in particular), and generally provides a nihilistic, meaningless worldview from which the filmâ€™s viewers, I believe, intend to leave, richer in their poverty and more encouraging in their hopelessness. <br /> <br /> Extreme debris, although attractively made with an apt throw. The fact that someone might assume that this is a real rendering, however, is a very false advertisement. Do you want a real story? Rent "Fairy Tale". This is a true story. See if you can find any correspondence between the facts presented in any case. I found only one: the girls who took the original photos were pre-pubescent.
