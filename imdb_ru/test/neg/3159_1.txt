Okay, you hippies are probably wondering what am I having against the "educational" and "informative" Barney type shows? Well, I hate it for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. It teaches that it is immoral to have personality and individualism. No one on the show has a personality. All dress the same, speak the same, behave the same and dance the same. Even in the episode called “Being an Individual,” children try to tell Barney what they like, and EVERYTHING on the planet should do what I like. Do you want to teach your child that being an individual is wrong? <br /> <br /> 2. Episode "The Stranger is a friend, you have not met." Despite the fact that the producers seemed harmless, it soon became clear that this could be extremely dangerous for young children. In fact, several young Barney lovers from all over the United States have been the victims of pedophiles, who used the show's friendly message to entice children from their parents. Since then, the episode was filmed, but the damage was done. So-called “innocent” programming errors like this clearly show why parents should watch TV with their children. <br /> <br /> 3. If you are not happy all the time, you are a bad person. It seems that no one shows any other emotions, except happiness, no matter what situation he is in. If the parents of the child are angry or sad for some reason, the child may think of mom or dad differently. Absolutely bad message. <br /> <br /> 4. Magic is everything! It seems that every problem is solved by magic. At least in shows such as Fraggle Crag, this teaches us that the magic CAN retaliation is best solved by yourself. Does Barney teach this? No, of course not. There must be magic there. And the problem is that many two-year-old children cannot distinguish fantasy from reality and may think that their parents, brothers and sisters or relatives can use magic to solve everything, but still they get confused when they CAN'T use magic and think that they are strange. Another slip again pulled. <br /> <br /> 5. Barney makes no distinction between stealing and dividing. He even specifically said that “it is normal to steal if the person from whom you steal do not mind”. Children can learn that if you really want something, stealing is an acceptable way to get it. It’s not that preschoolers need authority figures to tell them. <br /> <br /> 6. “If I have the right thing, I can solve all my problems.” Whenever children have a problem, Barney gives them everything they need to solve it. The message sent here is: “Do not try to think to solve it! This is too much work, and the solution probably won't work anyway. Just use it. ” Because of this, children can stop thinking through things (Barney said that this is too much work) and become addicted to the “right” object. (The right shoes, the right food, the right computer, the right simulator ...) This is certainly a good message for Barney's marketers, but it is not suitable for preschoolers. <br /> <br /> 7. The message that cheating is fine. In another episode, the children participate in a contest to carry peanuts on a spoon, without throwing it. One child puts peanut butter on his spoon and wins easily. Then the child is rewarded for his creative thinking, when the child actually breaks the rules and changes the game so that he can win. This teaches that cheating is good, you win, and people think that you are creative when in real life you are often disqualified, or worse, and much less like other competitors who play by the rules. <br /> <br /> 8. Do the children in this show eat anything else besides cakes, cookies and sweets? This teaches that you can eat tons of junk food and avoid healthy foods, despite Barney’s so-called Healthy Food song. In addition, ALL in the show eat junk food. No wonder that there are so many obese children in America and Europe. <br /> <br /> And finally .... <br /> <br /> Television shows of most other children are taught to creatively solve problems without having to resort to "magic." Barney could also do this, but instead decided to use a method that was A) best for marketers and B) required less time and money for scripts. This is a clear sale, which shows how little Lions Group really cares for children. <br /> <br /> This is my rant for all of you.
