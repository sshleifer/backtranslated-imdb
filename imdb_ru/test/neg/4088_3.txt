Although I am not a very religious person, I still had relatively high hopes for this film, as there is an amazing Steve Carrell in it, and his prequel, Bruce Almighty, was in fact a creative and intelligent comedy on a Christian theme. Nevertheless, Evan Almighty is no match for the originality and freshness of the original, and cannot decide whether it will be a comedy or a sentimental film about faith and family values. If he chose one clear path on which of these themes to focus on, he could realize his potential, but instead the result of mixing these two films would be a film with a very flat and dry sense of humor, a gentle dialogue and motives that try to give the film depth , but instead actually insults the intelligence of the audience, as well as a very confusing and hazy presentation of an opaque movie message. It was quite obvious that Evan Almighty was written very poorly, there are many plot holes and elements in the film that have absolutely no meaning. For example, although a large number of exotic animals from all over the world flock to Evan when he builds an ark to save them from the flood, is it really necessary to turn them on when the only “flood” that occurs in the film is in the center of Washington DC. and suburban area, that is, they are not at risk of being destroyed? The filmmakers seemed to lack originality to modernize the biblical story altogether, and instead it was just happening now, changing nothing in the plot, leaving many elements that simply do not stack up like this, and make this obvious idiotic motifs and letters in the film. Overall, this work is tragic in the sense that the acting talent of Steve Carrell and Wanda Sykes does not manifest itself because of the soft characters they portray, and that it was so poorly written that it distorts and pushes many of the attempts of the film and makes bullying the first movie. Finally, Evan Almighty also insults the brilliant actors in him and any half-intelligent movie lover, because he fails, they both fail miserably.
