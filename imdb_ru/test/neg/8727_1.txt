This mini-series / movie was so terrible that I almost broke and did not turn it off. I am a big fan of the novel, but this film suffers from many problems. The costumes are poor, and many of the more emotionally charged scenes are fiery. Deviations from the novel chosen poorly, significant nuances omitted or rewritten. <br /> <br />
