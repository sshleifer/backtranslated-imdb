In an attempt to make a somewhat comedic but serious film about the art of growing marijuana, Stephen Gyllenhaal (director) did not cope with a good film. While the actors are nothing short of amazing, this film is extremely difficult to watch. The play of Billy Bob Thornton, Ryan Philip, John Bon Jovi, Hank Azariah and Kelly Lynch could not even save this film from failure. It would be wiser to push three $ 1 bills down the toilet, and then watch this movie at a local video store. <br /> <br />
