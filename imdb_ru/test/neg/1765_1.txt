This film was so bad that I thought I would scream in the middle of it. That was all I could do to get through it. The beginning of the film, where they fight, was promising. Only it seemed to me "Saving Private Ryan" ... or at least an attempt to do it. Only we do not care about these people. There was no build up to the characters. The child who dies, I suppose, made us cry ... but for some reason it just annoyed everyone. Then we have to listen line-by-line to the hoarse dialogue, which desperately tried to imitate Wuttering Heights, which, of course, was also quoted in the film. Go figure it out. There was nothing original in this film, it was like watching the most mundane parts of every military film ever made, with a bit of humor added so you hoped it would be better. Unfortunately, this is not the case. After 3 hours I leave the theater, feeling deceived. Anthony Menhill should be shot for trying to reproduce “The English Patient”, which was a good film for that time, but now I wonder ... should I rent it and make sure that I was not caught in HYPE ??? Maybe I was, but I was definitely not involved in the excitement of this film. I really went to the theater, wanting to love this movie. I am a solid fan of Nicole Kidman. Save your money, rent it on a DVD and laugh like me.
