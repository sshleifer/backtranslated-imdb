The original classic Hitchcock received a huge benefit not only from the performance, but also from the "look" of Anthony Perkins. He designed a kind of pure innocence: the personality of a young teen type. He was not an actor who portrayed the villains before; nor was he physically fit for the role that the public could imagine a psychopath, especially in the 1950s, when this ultra-frightening aspect of mental illness (split personality psychosis) was relatively unexplored in the film. That is why his election as Norman Bates was part of this brilliant Hitchcock genius. To put it mildly, the audience was taken by surprise. <br /> <br /> That is why this processing does not work, even a little, despite the fact that it tries to be an exact copy. While Anthony Perkins looked like someone you would never have thought he was a serial killer, Vince Vaughn is easily imagined as one. He lacks the fragile appearance of Perkins, and his acting chops are also clearly inferior, at least in this role (honestly - was there ever an actor who could convey nervousness as sincerely as Anthony Perkins?). Although from the very beginning it was a meaningless revision, the erroneous translation of the most important character in the story completely absorbed this film. <br /> <br /> As a note, I feel Hollywood has a penchant for making great movies. because “young” people refuse to look at what was not shot in color, not only stinks into the heavens of corporate greed, but is also extremely disrespectful to the original work. As for viewers who cannot watch black and white, this is their loss. I hope they will ever grow up, and they no longer need brilliant colors to keep their attention. When they do, they will find that sometimes black and white works much better. With a muted background, the story and actions are much more front and center. And in many cases, the mood or atmosphere created using black-and-white cinematography is simply unattainable in color.
