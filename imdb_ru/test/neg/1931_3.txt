The story comes from "King Lear"; settlement is a farm in Iowa. Here is a test for this kind of thing: if you find yourself asking, “Why is this and that, this is how,”, and the answer is “because this is what happened in King Lear.” that the film failed. Well, this is what is happening here. The father in this story does not live his life, he imitates the fictional. But the movie is not like that. <br /> <br /> Jocelyn Moorhouse is ambitious - much more ambitious than I think she understands. She is trying to take the story of King Lear and reverse the situation. This is a task in itself. The most likely result is that the story of the transplant will die, and no one can understand why (although such successful transplants like West Side Story are worth the effort). But she ALSO tries to retell the revisionist. In the version of “King Lear,” which she wants to create, Reagan and Goneril cause us sympathy, and Cordelia is a villain. This is also a task in itself. <br /> <br /> Success in any task is difficult; success at the same time impossible. In fact, to succeed in one, as well as in the other, is impossible. If we want to look at the same events from a different moral point of view, then the events must be the same events, which means that there can be no interference with the setting. If the story has to be transferred, alive, to another environment, its moral heart must continue to beat the whole time - which means that there can be no interference in the ethical perspective. Moorhouse should have failed not only in one, but in both of his undertakings. And so she did. ... Naturally, one can try to accomplish both tasks, fail when performing both tasks, but by luck, stumble upon a work of art that is good for independent reasons. I mention this because I have not read the novel by Jane Smiley, which, as far as I know, is good for independent reasons. But the film is wrong. If there was nothing bad in it, it would still be impossible to get around the fact that it is so thorough, painful, TUK. The corn fields themselves are even more boring than in real life - and this should not be so, because I can remember four films (“The Wizard of Oz”, “North to the North-West”). "," Straight story "," Kikujiro "), in which corn fields are not boring at all.
