This film began with some promise: a loud cast, good looking scenery, but then it fell apart. <br /> <br /> Most of the time he cannot tell whether this is a serious film or a comedy. In one minute they say that there is no joy to kill, and in the next - a fight scene with funny music and funny banter. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors are pretty bad, mostly from Patrick Swayze and Piper Perabo. She also gets a few moaning lines: “When I get married, it’s about love.” Ugh. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is that it’s just boring. Not enough action, not enough humor, not enough plot, nothing really special. Just a lot of cliches and fun moments. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film with “Dragon” in the title should contain much more dragons than several (and the miserable CGI dragons) that appeared in this film. <br /> Can't the SciFi channel show * good * movies?
