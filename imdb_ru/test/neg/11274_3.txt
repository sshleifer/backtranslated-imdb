Thank God, I have a fast forward. I think this is a movie about a guy who rises and falls. Anything: this is a silly cliché. It does not matter. There is this guy, Javier Bardem, who is building buildings or something like that. It doesn’t matter. He’s beautiful, this Javier Bardem. What's the difference? I think there is a car accident, but I watched it fast forward, so ... who cares? Car accidents and beautiful heroes who struggle with them smell to me like a melodrama. Javier loves someone, but instead he marries Maria de Madeiros. She is gorgeous, poetically beautiful, with a face in the shape of a heart. Then Javier has an oral interface with Maribel Verdú, who for some reason washes the vulva beforehand. You would think that Maribel Verdú, with her washed vulva, would be sexy. No, she is not. This is a tedious story about a group of people who do not interest me. Javier, Maribel and Maria have the top three: how boring. This movie is annoying. I think it might be a small TOPIC of (some) films in Spanish: the growth and predictable fall of a little guy who succeeds in spite of everything. Let me clarify this: this is a high-end melodrama or perhaps a soap opera. It is not worth your time, except for laughter.
