If you're going to watch this movie, then my advice is not. <br /> <br /> For me, the film was not able to get an assessment at every level and was a reminder of how terrible most British (and Irish) films are. An unforgettable scar is the best I can say. If it was on TV, I would leave to do something more interesting five minutes after the start. I watched this film with a group of friends and, after reading a preview for the press, I prepared myself not to criticize, and, I hope, get through a funny 90 minutes. But, oh my god ..... <br /> <br /> Like a comedy, it was not funny, like a thriller, a silly and lazy story. Like a love story is absolutely unbelievable. First of all, as part of the “superbly whimsical,” she lacked neither style nor charm. Gambon and Kane did what they needed to make their money playing uh ... ..... Gambon and Kane. It's just me, besides Michael Kane, besides the fact that I play in the gangsters in the East End and kill the guys, leave you cold? <br /> <br /> For the sake of justice, some of my friends thought that everything was alright, but if you go My advice: drink a little beforehand (or drink) and leave your critical abilities safe at home. <br /> <br />
