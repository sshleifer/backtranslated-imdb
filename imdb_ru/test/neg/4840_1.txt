The only reason I made this film was because Val Kilmer rarely starred in a bad movie. Of course, this is the first time for everything. In many ways, this film proves that making bait is not as easy as we think, especially by foreign directors. The only one who coped with this was probably Sergio Leone, but even in his films there was not enough of what is vaguely inherent in our American psyche and reach. American actors in Clint Eastwood and Henry Fonda really helped. Now I understand why they changed the original name from “Summer Love” to “Dead Man's Bounty”. This in itself tells me that the producers and the director had no basic understanding of the western plot, except for those standard shooter scenes and violent themes. I suppose we can say the same thing about the fact that American directors are trying to make a Polish film, although they fail in this process.
