Naah would have won Razzie for the Worst Film in 2004 (maybe as a whole too) if it were global. When it comes to bad behavior (it also shows attitude / yawning / excessive (un) action), Halle Berry doesnâ€™t fit Antra Mally. While the catwoman had a store line, supposedly a hot actress in a microscopic costume and some action movies, Naah had nothing at all. <br /> <br /> One of those films that makes me wonder why IMDb allows you to rate a movie as 0/10. Once again, I think the film doesn't even deserve 0. It must be something negative or minus infinity. <br /> <br /> Okay, what about the outline of the plot? This outstanding, arrogant, full relationship choreographer meets a useless idler, a slacker who aspires to be an actor's tale. This story is so short that if I just offer another sentence, IMDb can ban me for writing a spoiler. About storytelling? It's like a group (sorry 2 people for the most part) of people moving in super slow motion. Do not try this movie if you bought a new DVD player. Ultimately, you will believe that the DVD is in poor condition or the DVD player is not working. Not his fault at all. <br /> <br /> In the end, you end up giving some credits to the director. At the very least, he realized that Antra Malley and Abhishek Bachchan (at least at the time) cannot speak convincingly, therefore there are not too many dialogues in this film. That way, you can at least get some sleep in the film, with some annoying sounds from these sequences of Antra-Malli songs. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you're new to Bollywood Cinema. After you transfer this film, you can see any Bollywood movie and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> There can be no more than three hours of torture than this!
