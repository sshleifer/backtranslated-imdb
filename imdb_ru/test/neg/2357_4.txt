Is human trafficking just “experience done like this” ?? only this time it is rather weak. <br /> <br /> The main topics we studied are paranoia, male weakness and jealousy ?? but only soft and bad. <br /> <br /> Many films seem to want to emulate Trainspotting (drug culture / "club") ?? but it does not include the low times / recessions that Trainspotting deals with (for example: problems with death / addiction, etc.). Is he even trying to come up with a similar monologue to Ewan McGregor's classic “Choose Life” ?? but `Milk bars on me! Yeah!' ?? what is this fiction ?! <br /> <br /> Characters try to analyze their way of life, but when their way of life is so shallow ?? their analysis becomes boring and repetitive. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack (for a movie that tries to be cool) is pathetic. This includes both Fat Boy Slim and CJ Bolland ?? come on people ?? Good dance music is better than this one! <br /> <br /> Characters become annoying and annoying (especially in the middle of the film), and soon there is a lack of caring for the characters. <br /> <There are a couple of funny scenes ?? but they are few and far between. Mother was catching her son in the bedroom was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> But PLEASE ?? I got sick to death of Star Wars analogy scenes. I thought it was much sharper in several of Kevin Smith’s films (i.e., Clerks and Chasing Amy). According to the characters, Yoda is a drug addict, why is he short and bald? Yes ?! <br /> <br /> My assessment ?? 4 out of 10 do yourself a favor and see Trainspotting or Go instead!
