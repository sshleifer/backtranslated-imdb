I loved the dolls. The Muppets Film, The Great Muppets Marque and The Muppets Show in Manhattan were good family films, cleverly written and fun to watch. I never thought I would see that day when they jumped on a Hollywood scum, but here it is: A scooter like a cage dancer, Pev, making obscene and impressive comments every five minutes is not your father's dolls. These are not Jim Henson's dolls anymore. <br /> <br /> In this thematic movie “This is a wonderful life” there are moments, but not enough to save. I cringed, watching this with my children. I still have hope for their next film, but this one was definitely a disappointment.
