L'Auberge Espagnole is less funny and less interesting than any episode of Dobi Gillis. Where are their Bob Denver? Do they even have Duane Hickman? The Frenchman goes to Barcelona for classes. He moves in with some other students who are no more interesting than himself, and they do and say uninteresting things. This film is incredibly soft. The only bright spot was a pretty French girl who played a Belgian lesbian. She puts her hands behind her head and shows shaved armpits, rather than the usual bunches of dark stinky hair. But bare armpits don't make a good movie. L'Emmerdeur was funny, like La Cage aux Folles. L'Auberge Espagnole and Le Placard make you wonder what is wrong with the French comedy.
