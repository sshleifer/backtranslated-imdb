Many people in the cinema liked this movie, but it only made me feel like a misanthrope. If the smug "intelligentsia" makes fun of their annoying sex lives, sounds good to you, watch it. I was bored, but I am glad that I know such people. The premise of the film was that, as in all societies or great civilizations, they are ultimately doomed to failure. According to the female historical character that tires us with this fact, America is showing signs of its decline (admittedly, she goes into details than I do). The next part of the film is devoted to the senseless, stupid and stupid behavior of her friends and colleagues, as well as various sufferings caused by their libidinal behavior, with an unclear attempt at humor. Many people liked this film, where I watched it. I could not relate to this.
