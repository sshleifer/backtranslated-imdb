In 1976, a mother named Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden). One night they put a box on the threshold of their house, and the next morning they cut the box to open the device with a button that needs to be opened with a key. In the evening, a man with terrible scars on his face approaches them and offers Norma an offer. This man is Arlington Steward (Frank Langella), and he announces that if they press a button, someone in the world that the family does not know will die, and they will receive a million dollars in cash. If they do not click on it, nothing will happen, and the offer will go to another. Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone about this deal, including their son. The incentive for the family to push the button is enhanced due to their financial difficulties. Arthur, who is currently working at NASA, cannot be accepted for a new job for which he is applying, and Norma, who is a teacher, learns that her teaching funding is declining. <br /> <br /> Someone enjoys this weird sci-fi thriller, based on Richard Matheson’s Button Button story, will be determined by how far they are prepared to go on this ridiculous premise. Opening the film is especially problematic in terms of realism in the household. Richard Kelly's previous film "Donnie Darko" deftly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify his transition to paranormal activity and parallel universes. Without the fabulous state of this far superior film “The Box”, the very idea of ​​a device capable of killing anyone in the world is completely implausible. This Norm would also take someone who had almost the same scars as the Two Face of the Dark Knight into her home, and I think this proposal seems no less contrived. <br /> <br /> If this seems incredible for now, then the following is even more absurd, including a plot about someone who was struck by lightning, the possibility of alien life or some other divine influence affecting these situations. Scenes involving gateways opening in public libraries, accidental nosebleeds and senseless UAVs chasing the Lewis family become almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity. At some point, the film can be called intriguing, just to see where it goes. Kelly is sometimes clever in her ability to hold our attention in many films. In one scene, Norma teaches a class, and then a strange boy asks about her leg. He scoffs at her because she lacks four toes. Later, at the rehearsal dinner for the wedding, which Norma and Arthur attend, the same student appears as a waiter and seems to follow them. Yet a possible justification for all these oddities lies in a very artificial scientific revelation, which many consider implausible and difficult to swallow. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing in the film is that Button is surprisingly early, many of the moral consequences that were originally promised are reduced by most of the length of the film. The end, which will not be spoiled here, again raises these moral questions in the hope of repeating the Greek tragedy. Although the similarities can be seen, at this point, given the unlikelyness of a large amount of film and the uneven presentation, there is no reason for concern. Cameron Diaz may not need a southern accent, but surprisingly, Langella is the most disappointing in the film, with a very unconvincingly written role, like a mysterious scarred man who seems to hide a military base that makes Dr. Evil proud. This is really only the shadow of his outstanding performance in Frost / Nixon. For many other actors in the film there is not much work; in particular, Norma and Arthur could not be regarded as characters, but as mouthpieces for Kelly's ideological idea. Underdeveloped and brief conversations, for example, when Norma sympathizes with Arlington about their deformities, as well as when Norma and Arthur wonder if they really know each other if the button kills one of them, underlines this. <br /> <br /> Since 2001, Richard Kelly was unable to make a film that matched the quality and fantasy of Donnie Darko. Although this film may be intriguing for some time, it is too absurd and implausible to be fully used, and, of course, it does not deserve to be watched repeatedly, given the rather illogical revelations of the film. Science fiction fans might appreciate it a little more and draw their own conclusions, but what Kelly is really trying to say under the surface remains mysterious. The box is one film this year that was supposed to be put off.
