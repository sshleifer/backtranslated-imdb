This is my first “terrible” rating on IMDb, and I could not come up with a more worthy film to read it. I was hoping for entertaining trash and found the trash of the saddest, most boring kind. I found a film that no one could have cared about, including its creator. <br /> <br /> Hell’s Journey, directed, screenwriter and Larry’s QT Friend, Bishop, has a simple story about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys, two groups of bikers and a horrible murder in 1976, which to get revenge. It seems that Larry is determined not to tell this story, instead of putting his swaying, strangely wrinkled protagonist in a situation where he can fondle the women they like. He also has a dialogue containing enough horrendous fire puns / metaphors to deprive one of the words “fire” for life. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper avoids total humiliation, others are not so lucky. Sometimes they hit the road on their motorbikes, forcing Michael Madsen to pity even more, since his tall hands seem to add insult to the trauma of having to appear in this film. There is a lot of nudity enhanced by silicon, but quite a bit of action and no humor, which makes you think about what kind of audience they had in mind. <br /> <br /> I assume that most people who watch this movie, including fans of cheatery biker films from the 1960s, will feel deceived. Do yourself a favor and go back to the real thing instead.
