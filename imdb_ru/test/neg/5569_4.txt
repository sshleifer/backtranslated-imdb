I really wanted this film to be liked, because it is refreshingly different from the hordes of everyday clones of horror films, and I appreciate the fact that the filmmakers are trying something original. Unfortunately, the plot simply did not stick together, and none of the characters were cute enough for me to really care about them or their fates. <br /> <br /> Visually, The Toybox was pretty interesting. The director took several risky steps, such as adding small pieces (looking like Flash) of animation in parts and really using some special effects (such as the light from a particular amulet). Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it did not, but he deserves praise for the attempt, and the cinema, as a rule, was of high quality. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, when the same approach threw a lot of things into the wall, to see which sticks were put on the plot, the results were not very good. The film never finds the tone he likes, going from black comedy to a family soap opera, to a film about witchcraft of the 80s, to nostalgia for childhood, to the killer from a family battle. Taken by themselves, the pieces of each of these elements work quite well, but nothing ever comes together into a satisfactory whole. In addition, large pieces of the plot are never explained. I am not one of those who like to be fed with a spoon, and I like films that leave questions to the discretion of the audience, but the pieces that were left in Toybox just seem to have either run out of money before explain them, or they really did not think things out from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the next project of the director, as I think there are a lot of talents here, but I canâ€™t recommend The Toybox essentially.
