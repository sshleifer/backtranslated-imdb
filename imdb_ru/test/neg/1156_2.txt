I'm a big fan of horror movies and I know a lot of information about serial killers. Obviously, the director of this film refused to investigate the film he created, because half of the film was fictional. Moreover, the character Ed Gein was portrayed in the wrong light. I did not shoot the film to worry about the deputy and his girlfriend Erica. I rented it to see Ed Gein and his legendary story. This film was terrible, the only reason I gave him 2 out of 10 is that the blood was not too bad. Action = terrible actors = secondary film = waste of time. <br /> <br /> Great chagrin, but I will not give up the search for a good horror movie.
