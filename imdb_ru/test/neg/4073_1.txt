I had to leave without seeing the film after reading the review here. I watched the whole movie on fast forward and ended after 25 minutes. although it is a low-budget film, it could have been made better. <br /> <br /> The movie starts more like a thriller, and after a few minutes it tells you that you should immediately disconnect. And why did the film get the name “emergency landing” when it was put so well in such a bad climate? <br /> <br /> Without any action, all the characters just move or do like children. <br /> <br /> And do not forget to comment on the joker - the main hijacker, who would be more suitable if this film were a full day comedy.
