Laura Fraser creates her ideal man in a virtual reality machine, and he, of course, unexpectedly comes to life. Oh, that funny Japanese doesn't come on the Britcom flop, so bright, but as bleak as Day-Glo, she makes Weird Science's gorgeous 80s American 80s teen cinema look almost decent. The sex-ridden screenplay was written by The Sun film critic Nick Fisher, a former tiny “uncle of agony” who, obviously, had never watched the episode of Smack The Pony in his life; shame, because then he could at least shout about female characters who were recognizable representatives of the human race. This parody is too clearly manifested from the virtual brain of a person who imagines that he is funny. Suddenly, the thought of a new wave of Iranian cinema is becoming something attractive.
