“No one really knows how the Force appeared. Even the Book of the Curse did not record its beginning, but those who mastered it were always hunted. The Ipswich families formed the Covenant of Silence. ” Entry, we suddenly see Take That. Or was it N'Synch? Backstreet Boys, maybe? Well, I do not know which of them they belong to, but one thing is for sure: the descendants of Salem are a boy band. Can you tell them apart? I could not If you can tell me what to eat, I will be very grateful. These boys from the boys group look so damn similar ??! Seriously now. Is it a horror movie or a teen movie? Sadly, the (in any case, weak) horror genre was abducted by teenagers. And this is one of the youngest that I have seen so far. The film is visually durable, but the cast is so soft, the cast is so terrible that the end of the film is an ordeal. No matter how bad the cast is (after all, boy bands and fashion models are rarely good actors), the absolute “outstanding” in this regard was the guy playing the villain, Sebastian Stan. This guy replays with the worst in the history of the film. I have rarely seen anyone make such annoying and stupid grimaces in such a short time. Worse, he has the most childish face of all the children of the group in the whole cast. I mean, this is a joke.
