This quirky and watchable film is a story of a deceived dentist who begins his mission or crusade to fight tooth decay in the back and because of Patagonia. Coming from Northern Ireland through New Jersey, the main character Fergus views his crusade as a massively important mission and approaches it with all the enthusiasm, vitality, discipline and attention to detail that can be expected from a trained dentist. What adds fun, as his ambitious plans collapse and gradually collapse when he moves from disaster to defeat in the Patagonian outback in the back seat of a tuned bike or its, for example, mobile dental unit. We never meet with his wife, nor with a rich philanthropist who sponsors an ill-fated mission, but we get a solid demonstration from Lewis. Fans of his work will not be disappointed with his highly believable performance as a deceived dentist, who is gallantly adored by an innocent but sexy 18-year-old woman who leads her trip * um *. <br /> <br /> This film is not for everyone, and I can understand why the costumes have not pushed him. It is a low-budget, sometimes charming, always disarming, slightly funny and instantly forgotten film that unfolds with low expectations and is almost successful.
