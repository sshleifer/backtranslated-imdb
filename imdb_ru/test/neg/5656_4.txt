First of all ... I have to say that acting is not very good. Miranda Cosgrove - the main character, but, frankly, not such a good actress. Spencer, her brother is a much better actor. Spencer is my favorite character because he is probably the only one who knows how to act. Carly, on the other hand, is trying her best, but ... sorry, this is simply not good. Sam doesn't even get a loan, I mean, come on ... BRIGHT ... pretty selfish, eh? Freddie is not bad, I have no comments. I have to add that Carly and her puppet Sam change their attitude whenever they go to shoot a web series, they shout out all their roles. It somehow has a bad effect on Carly, because she has a web show, and if the children copy it, she can give her own information, and this is not entirely safe. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is nice is that there are SOME funny parts of the show in it that makes it interesting. At least, this show is not boring, it has good plots, quite strong. Many children will like it because they are not looking for flaws. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a bad show, but itâ€™s not boring.
