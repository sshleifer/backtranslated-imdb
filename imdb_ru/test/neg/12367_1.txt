go get your video camera, your younger brother and neighbor, who will disturb the neighbor who is throwing boiling water into the raccoons; and you got yourself a movie! well, that's how everyone thought these guys. it was so bad that I don’t even remember most of them, with the exception of memories comparable to someone who toured “Us”. despite the really banal title, terrible quality, terrible actors and clichés, I think this movie is not the worst I've ever seen. I keep this slot for everything with Stephen Seagal, Chuck Norris, and Jean-Claude Van Dam. in any case, if you have no choice when it comes to searching for new horror films that you haven’t seen 1000 times (like me), and you are discussing this, I’ll still miss it. he had absolutely no redemptive qualities. This fake serial thriller killer was a weak, insignificant attempt to make even V. a film. If they were really lucky, this could amount to a lot of 4.50 wal-mart. but I highly doubt it.
