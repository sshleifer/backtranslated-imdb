Absolutely nothing redeems in this complete piece of garbage, and the only thing worse than watching this movie is watching it in English lessons. This is literally one of the worst films I've ever seen. He completely ignores and contradicts any topics that he can present, so the story is simply very boring. Thank God that the 80s are over, and God save any person who was actually born as "James Bond III".
