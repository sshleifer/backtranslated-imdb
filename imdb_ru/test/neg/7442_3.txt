Unfortunately, manufacturers do not know when to leave well enough alone, or recycle to such an extent that every piece of garbage that Hollywood generates is ready for rendering in Alpo. It seems that every sci-fi thriller has to endure a sad list of subsequent films, and Robocop is a tragic example. The first film, led by Paul Verhoeven, was a wild, stylish trip, which even found time for a small social comment on what the dark side of biotechnology can turn us into. In this film, there is nothing of this except, perhaps, the story that drugs are harmful to you and can force you to do something that you regret when sober. Robocop 2 lacks a vision, a deeply frightening vision of who we are becoming, and instead awkwardly leads us aboard a boat to how nauseous drug traffickers and their victims really are. Social comment damn it. This one is really big for me. If you don't care except SFX, go to him, my friend. Otherwise, do not waste your time on this unleavened sour cake and keep the accurately measured, heavy weighted pumpkin of the first film hot from the oven. It is so simple.
