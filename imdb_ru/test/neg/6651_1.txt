This film is absurd. Absolutely awful. Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia really had to work on this movie. The plot is absolutely not believable! Michael Keaton agrees to donate the bone marrow to the detectiveâ€™s dying son, but then runs away. He manages to slip away from the police throughout the hospital - I can not believe that he knew so much about the hospital. He chooses an extremely confusing path to get out of the hospital, blowing up generators and a pedestrian bridge (why?). And to top it all, Andy Garcia (the father of the dying boy) and the doctor help the criminal get the bone marrow. The plot is such nonsense! Perhaps the worst film I've ever seen.
