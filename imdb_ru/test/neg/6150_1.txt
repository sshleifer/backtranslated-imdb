HORRIBLE more, I can say that I remember seeing him in a movie (let's see how painfully it crashed into memory), like a 16-year-old boy. Mark Hamill was a skywalker of the older generation and was not very good at it, he was worse at it. Plus a harsh soundtrack to Jericho AAAAARRRRRGGGGGGGXXXXXXX. There is one film as bad as this one that I saw at the Arthur 2 cinema on the rocks. Funny how this question "What is the worst movie you've ever seen?" easier than "which movie is the best?" which, by the way, varies from Italian work (original), untouchables, casinos, entertainment in Denver, Goodfellas (understanding of what I like ???! Please, never watch this film, otherwise it will remain in your memory!
