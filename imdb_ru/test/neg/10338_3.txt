This fourth film in the Angel Offal saga, which is just a few minutes more than an hour (it seems that it is much longer), is also the shortest, which is perhaps also the most unattractive of the series. We, the seller of a department store, are interested in another part-time job. Her colleague at the department store introduces her modeling for porn Meg called "red porn". But when her other employers found out about her naughty photos, they decided to fire her. And she gets some unwanted fan. Oh yeah, and she likes to masturbate .. ALOT. Use of various household items. Wall-to-wall sexcapades hide the lack of conspicuous conspiracy and push it into operation, which is not surprising given that Toshiharu Ikeda is the director ("The Sinister Dead Trap", "Perfect Loot"). Perhaps his sensitivity was simply not suitable for the film Angel Guts. <br /> <br /> My rating: D <br /> <br /> More info on DVD: Comment by Jasper Sharp; Bio / Filmography; 36-minute interview with Toshiharu Ikeda; Original sleeve art; and trailers for this and 4 other Angel Guts films (High School Co Ed, Red Classroom, Red Vertigo and Red Porno), all of them are available in the Box-set from Artsmagik, but for some reason the 6th film "Angel Guts: Red Flash "not in the set
