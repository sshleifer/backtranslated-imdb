We decided to watch this film as an alternative to the Polar Express show in our local IMAX theater. What a waste of time and money! First, it is not cute. The snowman at times looked demonic. In other cases, he was just a zombie. Most of the time, he showed no expression or emotion, and his hollow blue eyes were simply creepy. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Santa first declares that this is a film about the spirit of giving. Santa and snowman, declaring war on each other, is this a film about a cottage? I'm all for a little parody, but it just wasn't fun or entertaining. <br /> <br /> The idea that the Snowman's flute is his voice is different. It is a pity that you will never see or hear a snowman playing his flute ... not even "thank you" to Santa. <br /> <br /> The only funny parts of the movie were the “excerpts” at the end of the movie. film. It is a pity that they did not use them in the film. That would be better.
