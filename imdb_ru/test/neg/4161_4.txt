We are in the not-so-distant future, globalization seems to have reached a peak, languages ​​mingle with each other (although English prevails over the others), races have merged, human cloning is a fact, and the whole territory seems to be divided into two zones: for real and one for invalid ... brave new world (in the style of Aldous Huxley), in which people are genetically taken and blood relations are strictly prohibited (for health reasons ?? this is name- code 46). In such an environment, two souls who are destined not to meet, fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> Winterbottom had an important story with quite a lot of potential. A good recipe that he destroys, giving him such a slow rhythm, telling about it so tiring, removing any emotions ... Coldness, that's all that Code 46 transmits. Cold and boredom. Even the presence of Samantha Morton and Tim Robbins (both of them perfectly fulfill their roles), as well as the visual and sound power of some episodes cannot help save the film. What a pity. <br /> <br /> Code 46: what could have been and never was. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 4/10
