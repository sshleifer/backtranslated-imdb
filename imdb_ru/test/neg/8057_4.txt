This film is about a young man's painful journey to uncovering his sexuality. <br /> <br /> The film is rough and unpretentious. It does not rely on paired sex scenes to attract viewers. Although sometimes the plot may seem incoherent and disconnected, and some events are not explained properly. I can understand it, though, because this film is a collection of memories that are very personal to the director. The plot of his sister and mother probably should not exist in the film, but I can certainly imagine that these are very important events in his life. <br /> <br /> The low budget of the film is clearly visible, It is a pity that the sound effects are poorly made. Narrative and some dialogues (especially the stage in the classroom with a French teacher) have so many echoes that it makes it difficult to understand what is being said. Ambient noise, noticeable traffic noise, is also captured throughout the film. When the scene hits another, the traffic noise level changes. <br /> <br /> This film is probably not interesting, but undoubtedly serves as an insightful diary of a young manâ€™s journey to understanding his sexuality.
