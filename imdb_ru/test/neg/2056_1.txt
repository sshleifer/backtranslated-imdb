Once again, I fell in love with it, in my roots I crave a funny and horrible horror movie, even a vampire. Even if it's stupid, as long as I get my cheerful blood in the mix, I'm a happy tourist, it won't take much. So I saw the cover of “Bled” on a Hollywood video and I was curious what it was, it looked quite interesting, so I decided to rent it. What for? Why do I always fall for it? Not only did this film not satisfy what I needed for my blood and senseless violence and nudity, but I was bored. This movie has kahoonies to say that this is a movie about vampires, and it really isn't! I'm so close to returning to the store and asking for money back, because this is one of those rare occasions when I really turned off the film. <br /> <br /> The artist meets the vampire, I think, I don’t know, I’m still trying to figure out what the hell he was, but his name was Reinfield, so I guess maybe he eats a cockroach who likes to piss people off ? I think I do not know. In any case, he thinks that the artist has a certain flash of darkness, so he gives her the drug to immerse in an alternative fantasy, where does a vampire exist and does he need blood to become alive? I think I do not know. So her friends are worried and decide that they want to try drugs too, I think I do not know. Therefore, after they decided to try the drug, everything becomes strange, fantasies are real, I think I do not know, and the vampire is now enjoying the will with big boobs in scandalously dressed clothes. I think I do not know. But do a couple of girls really become vampires? I think I do not know. <br /> <br /> Sorry for everything "I don't know," this is probably one of the worst reviews I’m going to write, but this is because this film was just awful, boring and confusing. I like to see these actors who, as you can tell, are the waiters waiting for this “big break”. It’s not too clever that they were in the horror genre cliche, sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t, in which case they really should have read the script. Since the film, the look, the feeling, the action, everything in this film was just bad, I really recommend you just skip the film if you see it in your video store. Perhaps it could be an interesting film with a concept from another dimension, but why did they choose this director to show his “creativity”, if there is one at all? It was a bad movie, just stay away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
