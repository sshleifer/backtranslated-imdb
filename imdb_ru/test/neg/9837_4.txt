This is one of those classic films "B", which tells about the exploits of two vagrants. This is done very fun, and the Big Fool runs down from one line, like a cardboard kassanova. But Jack Elam steals every scene in which he plays, like the creepy Jesse (now Jerome!). My favorite scene is a mob of lynchmen, and my father’s voice rises by 10 octaves (“Did you love her?”). Danny, the protege of Big Fool, is surprisingly sillier, but not as disgusting as our leading star. There's also a strange scene of a guy pimp at a diner. Joyce Meadows is a cute, naive cutie and probably the least annoying. And these yellow frills (RAWR!). Yes, and, according to Mr. Stupid, binge is evil. <br /> <br /> This movie is a scream. Look at the MST cover of this and Elama Raven's amazing respect!
