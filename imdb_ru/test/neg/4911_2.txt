Weak direction, weak plot, inexpressive music, I wonder why Udita Goswami is generally present in the world of cinema? she tried to reveal many of her talents (mostly skin), but could not make an impression. <br /> <br /> the music was not so impressive, you just have to listen to one song “Jhalak Dikhlajaa” ..... <br /> <br /> Aksar, name? well, in the end they tried to justify the name of the film, but it did not make sense .. <br /> <br /> There were many undesirable turns in the story that made it more boring. however, if someone is a fan of Dino Morea, please see.
