This film is so terrible that watching it was literally hard work. I wanted to extract it from my VCR and throw it across the room, but I continued to think (stupidly) that it would eventually become ridiculous and then everything would be fine. "You lost, we won, cheers!" This film should be a must-see for anyone who at least once thought that Jackie Mason was funny. After that, beat them on the head with this film until the tape breaks. And if you even think about renting this turd (or, even worse, there is!), I have one thing for you: have you not even looked at the cover? I mean, with such shit, you can tell at a glance how bad it is! "Oi vey!" This movie sucks.
