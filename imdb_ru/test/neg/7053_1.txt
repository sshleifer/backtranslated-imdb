This film was supposed to end as soon as the anecdote about the children of Bebe was told in the opening. I liked Robin Harris and most of his comedies, but the really fun routines were not meant to see the whole family. Be like taking one of Jerry Seinfeld's jokes and try to squeeze the joke as long as possible to turn it into a movie. This film was supposed to be self-serving, because I can not find anyone who would find the settings or antics familiar. The funny thing about this film is the desire of authors and producers to pass it off as something valuable. 1/10 stars, because there is no half a star.
