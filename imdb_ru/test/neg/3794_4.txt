I went to watch it 3 nights ago here in Cork, Ireland. It was the world premiere of a tiny cinema at the Triskel Center for the Arts at the Cork Film Festival. <br /> <br /> “Strange Fruit” I found an excellent movie. It's a bit rough around the edges, but for a low-budget movie that should be expected! In general, the acting (especially from the protagonist of Kent Falcon) is excellent, the cinema and the direction are excellent, and the script is extremely interesting and thought-provoking, with some pleasant settings and a witty dialogue. <br /> <br /> The ending was a bit unexpected, without any conclusions for the characters and events, when the final came to its fascinating end ... but perhaps this was what the filmmakers wanted? It certainly made the film more disturbing. I really liked the fact that the main character never reconciled with his mother on the screen: it makes you wonder whether he will ever be or not, as in real life sometimes these things are never solved. It was a good choice to leave it unresolved, rather than sentimentally wrap it up! <br /> <br /> Tight and tense everywhere, “Strange Fruit” is an extremely ambitious debut, and I have high hopes that writer / director Kyle Schikner will release further. He - and his colleagues - is a noteworthy talent. <br /> <br /> I hope soon “Strange Fruit” will be released more widely, as more and more people deserve to watch this movie, a thriller above average with original and insightful turns of homophobia and racism in the deep south of America. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended: 7/10
