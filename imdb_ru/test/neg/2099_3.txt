Looking back on 2006, I will most of all remember “Snakeamania” on the Internet for a film called “Snakes on an airplane.” But I don’t know if it was a movie with nude movies called “Snakes” on the train! Seeing this, I feel that at best, this B-Movie is below par. <br /> <br /> Plot: <br /> <br /> Husband and wife get on the train and go to Los Angeles to get help from their uncle's husband, who is a shaman. This is because his wife’s family does not approve of her marrying him, so they cursed her that the snakes would "become her." Thought from a sixteen hour trip to Los Angeles and a group of passengers, including a former drug dealer and drug dealers. Will they get there in time before the snakes capture her? <br /> <br /> Kind of movie: first effects: I have to say that although some scenes with smaller snakes look good, the main thing is to take pictures, you have to wait eighty minutes to see! Unfortunately, they are so bad that they completely kill the good memories of the film (the movie makes 198os video games look like T2 next to it!). One of the things I noticed is that there is no script in the film! and the directors make the film so anti-climatic that it destroys the entire film. The final look at the movie: <br /> <br /> The B-movie is below par with an incredibly bad ending.
