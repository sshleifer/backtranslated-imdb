*** May contain spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I had very high hopes for this movie based on a trailer. I knew a little about the real Ed Heine, so I thought it was a mid-budget Hollywood version of real events. Dude, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, the letter apparently came from an eighth-grader who knew little about Ed's story, and after about 20 minutes began writing the script. The film fully conveys the most interesting facets of Ed and his relationship with his mother (not to mention the fact that the real police found in his house) and decides to focus primarily on the young deputy, who looks like he just wandered into the set. . Similarly, all male characters seem to advertise their dialogue throughout the film. I do not exaggerate. <br /> <br /> Don't even start me up with historical stupidities in this movie. Seriously, who the hell led this? It is assumed that this film will take place around 1957, but the police carry modern batons with a side handle, some things in the hardware store look like they came from Lawes, and when the police get to the payphone, he dials 9-1-1 (then did not exist). In addition, Ed was a little guy, frightening, like Anthony Perkins’s character in the movie “Psycho” (which was supposedly based on Ed’s real life), and not the lousy dude who looked too much like the bad guy black. /> <br /> Another thing that really bothered me was that the creators of this film shot it all in an abandoned three-story building. Because of the "smart" camera angles, you will never see the real city, and the interior of the scenery looked like old, long abandoned shacks. Put the cash register on the sawmill and bang! - household appliances store. <br /> <br /> I usually condescend to low-budget horror films. All you had to do was turn on most of the real events (even decorate them!), Pay five good actors instead of 15 lousy ones, and for Pete take 5 minutes and think about the time from time to time. My advice: Google Ed Gein, you will be much more fun.
