A “puffy chair” is a huge waste of 84 minutes of my life that cannot be extracted and spent on it in a more worthy way (even the “Blair Witches Project” made better use of the precious moments of life). It should be called the “Puffy Chair” because only the “puffy” chairs could accommodate extremely “puffed up”, important brothers for themselves, who let him out of the house for public consumption; and, obviously, they are so full of themselves that they assumed that the public would really want to drink their drool. The “puffy chair” made the “Woolen guys” look like a cinematic masterpiece! "Valley of Dolls", "Over the Valley of Dolls", "Pink Flamingos", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Night of the Living Dead", "City Cowboy", "Drop" - all this is better to use your time than to watch "Puffy Chair" . The characters depicted are either too predictable, or they lack normal emotional reflexes to even come close to being pretty or believable. In addition, at some point in the film, although it is assumed that the characters are in the same small town, if you look closely, you can see that one part of the city seems to be in the south of the United States, and the other half located in Maine. This is a city, eh?
