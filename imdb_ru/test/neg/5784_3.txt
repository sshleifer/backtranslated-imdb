Navy Seals is an ignorant, racist and smug film that thoughtlessly uses the conflict in the Middle East as a backdrop for an action movie designed for a comfortably hidden American audience in the Midwest. The conflict, as well as those involved in it, is used simply as cannon fodder for glorifying photogenic young Americans who proudly kill Arabs for the good of “freedom”. But the worst thing is that the action scenes of the film are handled carelessly and uninteresting, which prevents the Seafishes from working even as a meaningless exchange of fire. <br /> <br /> Hero Charlie Sheen (Hawkins) is disgusting, nasty, ignorant, reckless and, above all, racist. He calls the Middle East a "hole", and its inhabitants - rags. Throughout the film, the Fur Seal heroes are glorified by the use of Lebanese natives as cannon fodder. They indiscriminately kill these people without consequences. There is even the tasteless murder of a young Lebanese boy who was shot by Hawkins; Hawkins makes fun of his tongue before shooting at him, making another humorous jester. In addition to being tasteless, this should be unacceptable. The extreme (albeit predictable) pro-American stance of the film is also disgusting. This can be seen when a Lebanese-American journalist tells Hawkins that terrorists cannot be made to talk, because "they are religious fanatics." Then Hawkins replies: "Yes, and we are seals!" It is understood that fanatics are meaningless next to American military power. Moreover, even after insulting this journalist’s racial heritage and treating her as a sexual object, the script demands her inability to resist this disgusting thug, and she still ends up sleeping with him - because he is the All-American maritime seal. This marginalizes the character of the journalist, making her submissive to the "excellent" pro-American position of Hawkins, despite his abusive behavior towards her. In addition to ethics, this plot twist also believes little as drama. <br /> <br /> The script is also amateurish. Most of the scenes are simply linked together without any thought about the mood, plot, or character development. For example, a “music video” scene on a golf course is just an edited eye candy. And the two scenes where Charlie Sheen plays the reckless hero are also meaningless. In one, he jumps off a bridge from a moving car to show his comrades how strong he is, and in the other he drives a tow truck on a pushing bicycle and drives away from him. Neither scene has a subsequent anti-climax, both are highly unlikely, and neither has anything to do with the plot as a whole. They are simply sweets, designed as a means to demonstrate cheap Hawkins' all-American heroics, and are a bad substitute for character development. Most of the other scenes in the development of the plot are also poorly filmed and poorly written, since in reality this disaster affects the entire film. In addition to the African-American fur seal and his wife, as well as the characters Michael Bean and Charlie Sheen, all the other members of the team seem unknown to the audience, so that when climatic scenes take turns around, no one seems to be rooting for anyone's death to mourn. <br /> <br /> In such a movie, action sequences can potentially save production. But here they do not. They are poorly directed, poorly lit, and demonstrate poorly executed stunts. In fact, their direction is so bad that they are almost incoherent with the viewer, which leads not only to inconceivably difficult scenes to understand, but also to the complete absence of fear and uncertainty. Poor lighting only increases their powerlessness. The explosions are false, gunshot wounds are inconclusive, and one of the most daring stunts, including a broken Mercedes over a tank, looks like a trick put into the background, and then badly edited. <br /> <br /> The end of the Navy Seals puts the coins firmly in the eyes of this product. First, it is the obligatory slow scene “running away from the big bang that was supposed to kill me” when Sheen carries Binah on her back. Obviously, it was the default scene intended to be the star of movie trailers. Then the very end comes when the submarine rescues the remaining seals in the crew, wounded and swimming in the ocean. This submarine actually returned home long ago, but, of course, miraculously returned at the very last moment. To top it all, despite the brutal and strenuous testing of seals, and despite the fact that many of their colleagues have just been killed, and some of them are still bleeding heavily, they all manage to laugh heartily, while loudly blessing America. . Predictable? You can only imagine this ending by watching the opening credits. <br /> <br /> This film condescendingly uses the Middle East conflict as a means for macho-all-American tendencies of photogenic young movie characters. Arabs are treated indulgently and scornfully, and their killing in the film is used as a foothold for glorifying the use of American military power against a “minority” minority group in an environment free from consequences. The events of 2001 indicate that such smug and self-assured banalization of conflicts of such minority groups is certainly not a consequence of free time. The Middle East can no longer be written off as shit filled with rags knocking each other down (quoting Charlie Sheen here); Now this is a place in which participation can lead to serious consequences. Today we are reminded that the consequences of such arrogance can be quite close to home. Therefore, at least, seals look pretty silly these days; but it must be kind. This is a very ignorant film whose production values ​​and professionalism are equally suspicious. Seals - ideologically and artistically - a complete insult to the intelligence of their audience.
