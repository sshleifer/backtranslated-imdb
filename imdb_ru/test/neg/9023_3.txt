While much of Wayne B's effort is entertaining in a fun way, this film is so casually edited and written that it is stupid. Only the first ten minutes show how Wayne and the bandits in the night scenes intersect with shots that were clearly filmed during the day. Dwair is playing half white, half Apache gangster with a strong Mexican accent, and he seems to have no nationality! I give it 3.
