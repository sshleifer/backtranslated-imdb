This film is on my list of the worst films ever made. The story is disconnected, and it is difficult to understand what is happening or the reason for the actions of the characters. All films should have internal logic, but this film simply does not have it - the story does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> Seeing Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer and Diana Quick spend their talents in this film is a crime. Faye Dunaway is happy because she plays the victim and is killed early in the film. On the other hand, Donald Sutherland must be a terrific actor because he manages to look good, despite the bad direction and bad writing; his performance is believable, and he manages to remain in character, no matter what. <br /> <br /> If Dame Agatha Christie was alive, she would die laughing! This is a bad movie!
