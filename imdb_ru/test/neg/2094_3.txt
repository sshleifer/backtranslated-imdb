Make no mistake, as Samuel L. Jackson's widely publicized "Snake on the Airplane" car; "Snakes on the train" low budget, without actors (if we talk), but with pretty decent visual effects. An attractive young woman (Julia "Rayanne" Ruiz) does not want to marry someone else's choice for her husband; therefore, she is subjected to the powerful curse of Maya, in which snakes hatch from her body, slowly devouring it from within. Her only hope of survival is a shaman living across the border in Texas. Time goes to her; and she is put on a train from El Paso to Los Angeles. Soon, the snakes leave her ruined body and quickly grow in size. Passengers on board the train are now trapped and will soon be snacks for snakes. The final sequence is without a doubt the best of this 91-minute film. Also receive a valid loan: Albi Castro, Al Galvez and Giovanni Bejarno.
