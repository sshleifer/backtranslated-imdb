It’s better than Cronenberg’s early horror films, but no more than your main story about what’s real. The theme of video games has been told before. Nothing original remains, except for the strange atmosphere of Cronenberg (which is not so strong here) with funny sex links and the gloomy score of Shor. History never attracts your full attention. It is just a flow ahead event by event with a boring pace. Rating 4/10.
