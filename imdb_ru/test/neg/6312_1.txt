In this film, one of the worst acts that I have ever seen. Dennis Quaid acted in high school. Although it is difficult to portray a character like Jerry Lee Lewis, it can be done. Just ask Jamie Foxx (although Ray Charles had a greater depth of his personality and musicality than Lewis ever had). The image of the Phillips brothers belonged to the Dukes of Hazzard, and Alec Baldwin, who plays Jimmy Swaggart, is a bit like Donald Duck, performing Shakespeare. When Robert Duval played the preacher, I bought it. Baldwin never made me believe a word. Vinona Ryder had the best part and she was mediocre. (And can anyone figure out how she was 13 when Lewis met her, and 13 more - more than a year later?) Some of the tests on the Internet show that the essential facts presented in the film were true, at least at least no more cheated than in most Hollywood bio photos. This film did not do well at the box office, and so it should have been.
