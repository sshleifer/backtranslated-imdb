Katie Ireland: the body of a goddess, the face of an angel, the voice of Smurf. <br /> <br /> And the acting talent of a shovel full of calcite. If you don't believe me, check it out: “Alien from LA” actually depends on her to act during the 9/10 of the film! Of course, it ends in a beautiful red bikini top and a wrap-around skirt, but it’s too little (so to speak) too late. <br /> <br /> Ireland seems to be playing the daughter of a famous scientist who falls to the center of the earth to find him. On the way, she falls in love with a guy named Charmin (yes, like toilet paper - make your own jokes) and learn how Mad Max rejects life. Did you know that people who live deep in the land have Australian accents? So do I. <br /> <br /> This is bad (after all, it was MST'd), as well as the production of “Golan-Globus”, but after all that is said and done, Ireland basically looks lost, as if she is trying find where the photographers are so that she can do a photo session instead. <br /> <br /> And I do not blame her. <br /> <br /> One star. And if you insist on it, do it with the sound turned off - save your eardrums.
