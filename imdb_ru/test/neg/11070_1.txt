If I could give this excuse for a film 0 or a negative rating, I would. I was stupid enough to take this DVD in the store, read the ad and think that it sounds good, I will spend 10 pounds and buy it. all i got at the end of it was a 10 pound coaster. Absolutely awful, I don't even know where to start. I have no idea why someone gave it more than 2 stars, because I can't think of any good things to say about it. <br /> <br /> The plot basically, 7 people enter an uncharted cave, one of them is a reporter. nobody knows they are there. When they get to the cave, they can't get out and the monster kills them one by one. There seems to be no reason for a reporter. One of the characters has several past demons that his former girlfriend was drowning in a cave 2 years ago ... it seems that there is no reason or reason for this either, I just think that this is just a garbage attempt to build a character? In any case, the monster turns out to be a guy who, like an ordinary little child, wandered into a cave and lived there all his life. This all of a sudden makes him a superman capable of glowing, seeing in the dark, taking bullets, breathing underwater, being in two places at the same time and possessing insane power (able to move boulders, carry adults as a dead weight, etc.) .). <br /> <br /> In the final scene, two women remained alive, they wake up naked, simply covered with some kind of carpet or something else. Then they find a photo of the child. Then the monster bursts through the door, wrapped in a rug with some animal skull overhead (says that in the directors' comments it was a crow's skull, if so, it would be Frekina’s biggest crow I’ve seen in my life) literally sounds like "Raaahhh" like a Halloween babe. I watched it with my boyfriend, and at that moment he literally laughed. Then the guy sees his child's photo and remembers how he sat under a tree with a burnt face, and then got up and wandered into the cave. This is the prehistory of the prehistory of why it cripples people, and it makes you feel a little deceived in history. Then the monster kills one of the women and brutally rapes another, cutting credits. I know that the rape scene was designed to be shocking, but as a woman, she just made me feel bad, and that was what influenced me the most in the whole movie. He could kill her, cut her into pieces and eat her, and it would be less terrible than the rape scene. <br /> <br /> In the end, there is so much left without an answer. Besides all this, the scenes where there were minutes at the same time were just black, and nothing else annoyed, and the constant nauseous camera angles where everything is upside down and you can't see what is happening, turn me on so much almost turned it off. Absolutely horrible movie. With the same success, you can get the money that they were going to spend on it, and set it on fire, it would be better spent money, as some intelligent person would write above me, as soon as you saw it, you can't see it. .
