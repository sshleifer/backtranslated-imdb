I think this work will be released on DVD sometime before Christmas. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible. The timeline is jumping everywhere. It would not be so bad if there were some waiting until the end. It was completely predictable. The bitches are chosen by outcasts, the outcasts want to know why they hate her so much, the bitches die a horrible death, the outcasts go home and look crazy. Creepy child understands what is happening. Oh, and the younger sister is not good enough for mommy, the sick mother sends the younger daughter to bring the golden baby home. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there were wonderful moments here and there. First of all, Sarah Michelle Geller's character dies in the first few minutes. A definite plus. I did not expect this. I also did not expect that my wife would pour bacon over the fat on her husband's head. If the film had retained such a thrill, I would have liked it. The beginning showed so many promises. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because I liked the first one. It made me jump, I didn't expect much of what happened, and although I questioned part of the film, it was still a fun time. I did not watch the preview for this sequel, because I wanted to be surprised. I was, but in the wrong direction.
