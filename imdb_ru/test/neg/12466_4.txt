The name of the film - Pie <br /> <br /> Date of viewing - 05.26.02 <br /> <br /> Year of the film - 2001 <br /> <br /> Stars - Dominic Swain, Brad Renfro, Bijou Phillips (hardly ), Melanie Griffith (barely) <br /> <br /> NeCRo rating - 4 skulls out of 10 <br /> <br /> May contain spoilers <br /> <br /> Plot <br /> <br /> “Outcast” Dominic Swain wants to be with the “in” group, and therefore she leaves her real friends and joins them ....... there are a lot of annoying conversations of rich people. Acting <br /> <br /> ugh, I probably got what I wanted, because Dominic was fine, but the man, the rest of the cast, except maybe Brad Renfro were bad or at least least interesting or cute in general. I know that some could say that others were good because they made me hate them ... believe me .... I like unusual characters, but this group is unattractive because they cannot be convincingly bad people. <br /> This shows that the only other people for whom I received this were hardly even in this, and this is Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips, but they had little time. Melanie said maybe in 2 lines, but at least Bijou was a good character, albeit a small one. <br /> <br /> Violence and blood <br /> <br /> My mind was constantly attacked by a terrible dialogue and very very annoying characters. Enough violence !! well, there was one cudgel with rock that was fine. <br /> <br /> T & A Nudity Factor <br /> <br /> Hahaha, they couldn’t even add nudity to revive this film, probably because no one would like to carry their bodies for this nonsense. If they are going to expose themselves, they should do it in a film where they will be remembered as their character, and not “oh, hey, I heard that in this she is undressing.” <br /> <br /> General view of the film (review) <br /> <br /> well, well, I know that I am proud of what I like most of all, if not almost all films, or at least they find something good about it. Well, this film is one of the few that I really struggled to find in it something worthwhile. The problem with this movie is that it’s pretty damn annoying. I already have a deep hatred for the moods of rich people, and this also did not help. In fact, this whole film is just a bunch of rich people sitting around in depression and stupidity. I can not stress the irritation factor enough. In this film, an attempt is made to rephrase the proven “In Group” storyline, which can usually be done without any problems. <br /> <br /> Why don't I have a photo from a movie or a box cover? Well, I felt that this film does not deserve this fame, so I decided to describe the reason why I rented it, and this is nothing more than Dominic Swain. Yes, I also took care of her in Lolita and thought that she was so good that since then I decided to check her out in any film in which she appears. At least I keep my promises and yes, I have seen most of her films, except for a few that are hard to find. She herself is a great actress, and I would actively defend her, but in a man she chooses some of the dirtiest films to star in this film. This film and Smokers are in the same boat stupidity, but at least Smokers had a great idea for the story and even some really good scenes. <br /> <br /> In addition, the DVD box is trying to trick you into thinking that there are stars in this film by putting the names of Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips on the front of the box. If there is something that distracts me from this, then this is a film that sticks the names of the stars on the box so you think: “Wow, _____. I wonder how well ___ in this film I saw ___ in this film and thought it was great! only to have big names in the film a total of maybe 10 minutes between 2. The bijou was actually the part that meant something. Melanie, on the other hand, has only 2 lines about .... Of course, Melanie I don’t really like, but this is about ethics, not about acting. <br /> <br /> Of all this mess, though the props should go to Brad Renfro to play with Dominic. Brad may be one of the very tangled children in real life, but at least he can act. So the only reason this film got some skulls is that I got what I basically wanted is Dominic Swain and Brad Renfro. In addition, I got the extra pleasure that the underrated actress Bijou Phillips made me love her even more. Therefore, despite the fact that it annoyed me, I still had some positives, although this time it was rather difficult. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you ONLY see this if you have seen Lolita and know how good Dominic is. or if you're some kind of unusual Brad or Bijou fan. Uber Melanie fans will be depressed. In addition, if you are a fan of such shitty films like me, do not think that this will be a reason for pleasure, because you will feel guilty in order for the money spent on buying or renting. <br /> <br /> Some films are “so bad that they are good,” as they say. What they forgot to add was "so bad that they are good (to refuse)." <br /> <br /> NeCRo
