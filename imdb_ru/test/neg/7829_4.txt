The film star Olivier Assayas - "Asia Argento" as a woman who had a relationship with Michael Madsen. Madsen is a businessman who has financial problems. In desperation, he is going to sell his share of the company's business called Golden Eagle, a company from the Far East. When Madsen begins to leave his company, Argento returns to his life. The couple had a hot love affair that included her business favors for Madsen (with the indicated Golden Eagle). As Argento enters the film, the film follows her, when we see the intricate web she has woven, and how complications get out of control is dangerous and cruel. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan. In fact, I was pretty bored, as the film seemed to move from pillar to post for most of the first hour, during which I kept wondering what was the point, apart from providing a meaty role for Argento. Argento, the daughter of director Dario Argento and the director herself, a unique actress. Sometimes amazingly good, she often is not going to give you a fancy unique image of a damaged person. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. I don’t think it works here mainly because the script is too “complicated” to support it. I didn’t care what was happening, so her wounded girl just rubbed me wrong (she seemed more crazy than everything else). I do not blame the actors, and the writer / director Assay, who once again created a complex story in which the actors like to play roles, but which make the audience scratch their heads because they really do not work. <br /> <br /> If you need to try this on cable
