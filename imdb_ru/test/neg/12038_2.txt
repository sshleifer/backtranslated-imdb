Chicago couple Dillon and Dougherty are falsely accused of killing their daughter. People are starting to wonder if they did it. Police are investigating and finding suspicious evidence. The couple slanders the public and is accused in the press. The police suggest that they are Satanists and ritually killed their own daughter. They are charged and tried. They are represented by advertising advocates who give them bad advice and bill for $ 100,000. The evidence against them is distorted or hidden by the police. Fabricated hints of sexual abuse are presented. Their other child is taken from them and placed in a shelter. Dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to find her child removed. The verdict, she did not do it, but he did. He is jailed with a sentence of 45 years. <br /> <br /> In the last third of the film, in which Dillon is in prison, and Doherty wonders what to do next, we see that people who were antagonists, now slowly come to the defense of the couple. Witnesses confess that they have lied. Other facts are revealed, which ultimately leads to the release of Dillon. The killer was never found, although the film gives us the full credibility as a plausible offender. <br /> <br /> This is a cry from start to finish. It seems that nothing is suitable for a couple. Oh, there are a few happy moments, maybe a party where everyone is happy to be together and burst of joy, or there is some point in their favor, and people hug each other. But it is not long before someone rushes through the door with more bad news, and all the faces are frozen in tragic unbelief. (Gradual fading usually follows.) Not necessarily something is wrong with moving tragedies, although I cannot imagine how much pleasure we get from how people suffer. In Shakespeare, too many tragedies. I suppose all that we find interesting in tragic stories is how they are told. "Oh, but I am a fool of fortune!" Romeo cries after killing Juliet's brother. Here we see Dougherty running in a dressing gown through the hospital corridor and shouting: “Where is my child ???” There is no ambiguity or irony in this story - I am sure that in real life the events on which it is based occurred. People here are good or bad. Or they are bad, and then they become good. <br /> <br /> The film is not intended to explore people's quirks or how things work out. It aims to tear tears from the audience. Actors provide first-class role models. I can't remember the last movie in which I saw so many tears. There are streams of tears. Rains of them. Cascades of them. The real Niagara of them. Lake Lacrima of them. <br /> <br /> Okay, I’ll give one example of the effectiveness with which the film is created. Dillon and Dougherty hire a Chicago police officer who works on the side as a private detective (Ed Asner). Asner sympathizes with them, but in fact he does not achieve much. He seems to be in the film not because of his importance for the cause, but because he can give the injured couple a kind of philosophy - “Learn to live with it”, which is normal - and because he suffers from colorectal cancer so we can observe as he takes the medicine, bends in pain and finally dies. <br /> <br /> In the film, it is frustrating that, by focusing so strongly on the sufferings of the couple, he bypasses one of the more important questions that he raises - the function is woven in regulating personal life. <br /> <br /> Gossip is really a strange thing. If we call it “gossip,” it's bad, but if we call it “public opinion,” that sounds acceptable, at least. Of course, we all have beliefs on issues that may or may not be justified. (When I write, Michael Jackson is again brought to trial on charges of mocking a young boy, and I wonder how many of us are excited by the news and immediately assumed that he is a pedophile.) But gossip is not all bad. It is like water. When it is properly controlled, it is an asset to the community. We need gossip to keep in touch with each other. This helps us maintain public order. But, like water during a flood or tsunami, it destroys a village when it gets out of control. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie if you are not looking for too much on the way. understanding of human nature. This is done so cleverly that, given its purpose, it is difficult to argue with that.
