This is definitely one of the most pretentious films I've ever seen. This is a slap in the face of some Indians who speak English and look in the mirror. disgusting. The 1970s chewing gum version of the North Indian Plains. the message - an educated English-speaking Hindu tried to save Indiaâ€™s poor beggars seriously. he ignores the fact that poor beggars are also capable of saving themselves. <br /> <br /> Like a love story, this is normal. the problem is that the love story and character development are based on a completely fraudulent version of politics.
