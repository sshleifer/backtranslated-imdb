Full disclosure: I was born in 1967. First, sending me tickled me - after all, if you were a teenager who grew up in the Reagan era, the trip to the memory lane was worth a laugh or three. Pop Rocks, Atari and Rock 'Em Sock' Em Robots? They were loved, not despite the fact that they were stupid, but because they were stupid, stupid and funny. But when VH1 decided to make the TV show “I love last Tuesday,” I realized that was enough. Goes, Hal Sparks, is there nothing better than reading from a teleprompter like idiotic Slinky? (Wait, let me check ... hmmm, no. No, he doesn't seem to know.) Snarky, snot-nosed super-hip posing has its place, but enough is enough!
