This “film”, and I freely use this term, reminds me of the first joke that my daughter wrote at eighteen months: “PW, smelly pupsies!” <br /> <br /> Like this joke, this film may only like very young, very immature or very stupid. <br /> <br /> However, there are some bright spots. <br /> <br /> The effects that most of the estimated $ 100 million cost are kinetic and persuasive — I mean, as convincing as the kinetic effects of CGI can be. CGI's baby effects are small, but I think it is very difficult to do well ... although for a hundred million dollars they could be better! <br /> <br /> Elk, the dog from "Frasier" called in his usual exemplary performance. Stephen Wright succeeded with a small part. Alan Cummings was, well, Alan Cummings as the villain we saw before, and Bob Hoskins in the role of Odin was unrecognizable, but pleasant. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays Mrs. Avery was, as one would expect, pretty, and Jamie Kennedy was smelly, as one would expect. His best role so far has been in the Creek trilogy (not to be confused with the Lord of the Rings trilogy) and Three Kings. Perhaps he should stick to more subtle forms of comedy. Jim Carrey, he is not. <br /> <br /> Writing and directing were, in any case, worse than Kennedy’s. I almost remember one clever (albeit clever seven-year-old) line that I would like someone to accurately quote for the “Memorable Quotes” section. Something about the fact that the costume proposed by Avery was “the crap shit in Kraptown” was a second-rate joke, but in a sense, ridiculous in context. <br /> <br /> In general, since there is nothing lower than “one” I give this film one.
