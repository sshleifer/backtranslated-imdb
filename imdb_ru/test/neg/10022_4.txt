1980 was definitely the year of bad slasher films. “Friday, the 13th” and “Flaming” may have been the best, but, as always, there were a few stinkers, keeping up with people like “Don't Go Alone” and this one. But, frankly, "Extraction" is not as bad as "Do not go into the forest", but still it is not so great. Firstly, it's just boring, and the acting is not very good, but much better than DGITW, and there really are some attractive girls in this film, all three leading roles of the woman were amazing. One thing that happens to all these meaningless shots about wildlife, just seemed meaningless, and it looked like the director used it to just use it to fill some space of time. <br /> <br /> So, what could this film like there? Well, there were some ridiculous high-profile moments with cheese - I couldn't help giggling when the last girl made a strange type of moon walk back to get away from the murder, and there were some good murder scenes - my favorites were that the girl choked from her sleeping bag; and a strange look. <br /> <br /> In general, “Booty” is stupid, boring, and the killer I didn’t find at all scary, this film could be much better.
