Jane Eyre with full frontal nudity! I was not surprised to see that the woman had a hand in this terrible "female picture", and I mean this in the worst way. The problem is that it would be so good if they did not take into account the material of Jane Eyre and were carried away by much more interesting scenes with the participation of Spanish / Portuguese Jews in the early 19th century in London. When the music on the sound track is better than in the movie, you know that you have a problem. When you rewind the video forward, because you can't stand the movie, just to make sure you didn't miss anything, you still have big problems. This film will fall on the romantic TV channel, where it rightfully belongs.
