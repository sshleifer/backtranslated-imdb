It was so bad that I could not even reconsider. Therefore, I will write a few sentences about what I have witnessed, and it's up to you. <br /> <br /> Captain Kirk with a blunt and large intestine is climbing in El Capitan Yosemeth. Spock meets him halfway on a floating skateboard similar to a skateboard. Kirk falls. Spock flies down, catches him a few centimeters before Kirk drops his head to the ground first. <br /> <br /> Later that night, Spock, Kirk and McCoy eat beans by the fire. Spock loves beans. Then Kirk and McCoy sing "Row Row Row Your Boat," and they want Spock to join in a trilateral harmony. Spock does not want to sing. And later that night, he disagrees. "But life is not a dream, captain." Should I go further? <br /> <br /> Good ... The renegade volcano, which is Spock's stepbrother, is leading a rebellion on a sandy planet - taking hostages. The crew of the company lands on the planet, and Uhura, pushing fifty-five and weighing more than two hundred pounds, lures the natives with their bare legs. But they cannot fool a brother who claims to be able to find God. <br /> <br /> He kidnaps the team and the Enterprise. They are sent to the planet, where a large bearded phenomenon, claiming to be God, spits out fire on Kirk, Spock and McCoy. Brother Spock, realizing that this is not God - but in fact is his form - or something - joins the appearance to destroy it and ... sparks fly. <br /> <br /> Then, after something too complicated to explain, as for the Klingons, similar to Lorenzo Lamas ... <br /> <br /> Three Amigos - Kirk, Spock and McCoy - returning to Yosemite (did I really mention, Kirk was wearing a GO CLIMB A ROCK t-shirt?). With Spock playing some kind of cool guitar in Vulcan, they sing "Row Row Row Your Boat", this time all three harmonize as the credits move.
