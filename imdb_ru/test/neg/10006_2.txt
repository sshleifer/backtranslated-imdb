Being a longtime fan of Japanese cinema, I expected more. I can't worry about writing a lot, because this film is just bad. This story can be the cutest and most romantic one that ever existed, it’s a pity that I could not stand the terrible game, the mess they called “stimulation”, and the standard “bizarre” Japanese history. If you notice how many Japanese films use characters, scenes and turns that seem too “different”, forcibly avoid this movie. Seriously, a 12-year-old could tell you how this movie is going, and this is not a good thing in my book. <br /> <br /> Takeshi’s “Beat Fans”: his role in this film is really no more than a cameo, and if you’re not a fan of rabies, you don’t need to suffer from this film waste. <br /> <br /> 2/10
