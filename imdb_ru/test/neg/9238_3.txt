**** It will probably contain spoilers **** <br /> <br /> After a successful attempt to attract attention (I would not call a guarantee that you will get help before you die “unsuccessful suicide attempt”) , Joey finds out that she is pregnant, and begins to see images of spirits. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film was a bit slow, but interesting enough to watch it all. For a horror movie there were only a few minor creeps and thrills. Halfway, however, there was a really good scary scene (although I will not give it away) :) I watched this movie because I really liked the previous movie The Eye. <br /> <br /> I was a little embarrassed, however, to determine that, besides the fact that the film “Supernatural Expectation” from the same creators, “Eye 2” has nothing to do with “The Eye” * what it is *; a different composition, another story. Eye2 doesn't even have anything to do with eyes: \ <br /> <br /> The film had several questionable scenes: Joey commits suicide 3 times (4 times, considering that the witnesses say they saw Joey trying to commit suicide ). jump in front of the train), she is associated with the brutal damage of the attacker, she is worried in a restaurant, and witnesses say that she “attacks” people, and nevertheless she is allowed to go about her business freely, even without mental assessment or put her in hospital for reasons not related to her pregnancy). <br /> <br /> The film was not the biggest horror film, the story was rather far-fetched (even for a fantastic film: P) There were few spirits and / or nothing that we had not seen before. However, it was an “interesting” story, and when you learned that the “truth” hides “truth”, it was an interesting twist in the “shadowy” story. <br /> <br /> I rate the movie 3 out of 10.
