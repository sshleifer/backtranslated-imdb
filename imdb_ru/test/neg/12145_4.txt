GOLDEN RIDERS (1951) <br /> <br /> A dismal western / comedy feature in which Three Puppets (including Shemp Howard, which I have always used as a third puppet) performs their usual jokes, and the director usually reliable Edward Berndz, who also made some of his funniest classic shorts â€” so you need to ask yourself, what went wrong this time? The most likely answer is that what worked well as a 15-minute two-speed machine turned out to be too large for a 55-minute feature film. Unlike many of its classic short items, GOLD RAIDERS should not be revised. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
