The film tells about the day in the life of a woman who goes mad. To show that she is mentally ill, she overdoes a lot, and the narrator tells us that she is "going crazy." Along the way, she meets up with a fat guy who looks like he might be Orson Welles' brother, and later he removes the heading from the building at one of the few interesting moments in the film. <br /> <br /> This is a strange little film that is made very cheaply - and it definitely shows. The film was made without sound (probably using an 8 mm or other cheap type of film), and some sound effects and a powerful narrative added later were added to it. In fact, the narrative was the most intrusive and unintentionally ridiculous of all that I have ever heard, and it says so stupidly and excessively that you just need to hear it to believe it. As a result of these cost-cutting actions, it is not surprising that the film is bad, although the idea of ​​creating such a film was quite original. Plus, it's VERY difficult to do through the whole movie.
