Technically, I'm a Van Damme fan, or I was. this film is so bad that I hated myself for spending the 90 minutes. Do not let the name of Isaac of Florence (Undisputed II) fool you, I had high hopes for that, depending on what I saw in (Undisputed II), dude ... was I wrong ??! all the action movie fans wanted a great classic action movie return, but I think that we will not be able to see it anytime soon, since our hero will continue to go along with them (going to the border - far, far-away-and-kill) "bad guys than returning home) movies that I mean for God's sake, we are in 2008, and they insist on making these frustrating films at all levels. What for ??!!! Do yourself a favor, miss it .. seriously.
