God, it was very boring. the lead man (Christian Schoien) must be the worst actor I've ever seen. and one more thing, if the character in the film moved to America when he was ten years old or so, and lived here more than 20 years, he would have spoken much better in English than what he uses here. or say it in my native language "Skikkelig Gebrokkent". But it's great to see the Norwegian guys in a movie made in Hollywood. just damn embarrassed that they are worthless hacks. The plot itself is below the mediocre. I have a suspicion that Christian Schoien appeared in this film only to make the dream come true, as he clearly does in the film, beating one beautiful baby after another.
