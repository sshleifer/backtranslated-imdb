The plot of this film is dangerously thin and the only "star power", if you can call it that, consists of Joe Esteves. I do not know what is shocking. The fact that this film was made or the fact that some people actually gave good comments about it. If you ever see a video cover, you can read them. Someone even went so far as to say that an actress / writer could be the leading lady of the 90s. Yeah! And Joe Esteveza could have more money than his brother Martin. If you still want to check it out, I strongly recommend to see its version for MTS. At the very least, you'll laugh a lot without going crazy.
