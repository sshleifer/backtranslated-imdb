Death Wish 3 is the cinematic equivalent of a shooting gallery. All the characters (except for Paul Kearsey Bronson, of course) exist simply to be killed, either as “provocation” (good guys) or as “retribution” (villains). The director just pours senseless violence (people even burn alive and explode), turning it into an urban version of the Commando (and Charlie, like Arnold, rarely tries to protect himself from an enemy shot). Fans of this shortcoming (and, apparently, many of them) will like it, others .... be careful. (* 1/2)
