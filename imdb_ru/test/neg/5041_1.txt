There is only one way to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> so bad it is funny. <br /> <br /> the acting is so bad that I kept joking. The male character in this movie trying to use a gun is so ridiculous that you might think that he was trying to copy a toy figure, I know it sounds ridiculous, but when you see it yourself you cannot disagree. <Br /> <br /> the monster is like the guy who is trying to recreate the clay monsters you saw in the old Sinbad films. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is only good for one thing - a big laugh at how bad the films can be. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a bad acting script and bad special effects, <br /> <br /> THIS IS A MOVIE FOR YOU
