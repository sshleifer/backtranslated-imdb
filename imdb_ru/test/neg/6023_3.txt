Promotions for the Bedbug project are an attractive film based on the club scene of the 1980s. As a result, we get a movie with identity issues. The plots end with the fact that they take upon themselves what the audience considers the main plot, so the main attention in this film, mainly about the "club", turns out to be in a ditch. <br /> <br /> Boxing, depression, self-loathing, gangsters, bouncers and drug dealers — all this hastily dragged on in over 90 minutes. In no less than 4 cases, I had to check the time of the film, as there was growing concern that this film should have disappointed. <br /> <br /> What club scenes we see, soft and repetitive, with the participation of About 3 extras dancing in what can hardly be recognized as a “club”, hardly capturing the atmosphere of the day. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a film about the club scene of the 80s, something like what “Human Traffic” was doing in the late 90s, forget “Clubbed”.
