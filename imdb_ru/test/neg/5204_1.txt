**** SOME SPOILERS **** <br /> <br /> There’s nothing in this movie that you haven’t yet seen on the Internet. There is nothing shocking about this movie. In the film, a man sodomizes a goat, decapitates a bulldozer, and the face of a lesbian burns. All these scenes of “extreme violence” are so false that the question arises why someone wants to come to the surface again. I just can't believe that I spent the hard-earned money on what should surely be the worst movie ever made. Do not let the reviews fool you, this film will be a disgrace for ANY possession ... except maybe the prisons who want to torture prisoners. For a REAL classics of exploitation, refer to bloodsucking freaks or even to a later generation of doom. The Island of Death sinks to the bottom of the toilet and needs to be flushed.
