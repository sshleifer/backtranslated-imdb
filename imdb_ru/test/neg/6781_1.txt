One of the worst shows of all time. The show would begin with clever comments to each other, which would be completely outside the wall and irrelevant. The fat computer geek was incredible, the biblical gangster, the bad girl, who are these actors ??? Never heard of any of them except Cole, who was absolutely incredible in this part. Every time he opens his mouth, you expect to hear: "You see children ...". Pulling the plug was a slaughter for this terrible show. The stories were as unbelievable as the actors. Lame would be the best way to describe it. Somehow, this show makes a slug-like Ice-T more believable, like a cop, and he wrote the worst song about cops ever recorded.
