This is what this movie is. My God, special effects suck in this film. It's hard to suck anything more than the plot of this film, but special effects manage to do it. Let me explain how bad this film is. <br /> <br /> First, there is the plot. In the forest in Duluth, Minnesota, there are four teenage dirty bikers who ride through the forest. One of them is stupid and makes a ridiculous leap and breaks his leg. A medical assistant comes to his rescue, but gets stuck with them when the helicopter breaks down. Then all five of them understand that there is a forest fire, which, as we see, began with the fact that some guy threw tons of gas into the forest. All they show us is his shoes, and they show offstage, when the guys' shoes go around, throwing gas and making fire. Meanwhile, teenagers are trying to avoid a fire, but discover that their boots somehow managed to outrun them (while they raced through the forest on dirty bicycles!), To dump gas throughout the territory they were driving, and to start more fires. He does this several times, and the paramedic finally catches him and lights. I will not spoil the finale, but this guy's stamina will make you scream: "WHAT, SLEEPING HEAT?!?!" on the screen. Anyway, they are now surrounded by fire, and their only way out is through a mine, which is filled with methane gas. Yes, methane gas. I will not even try to describe the final, because it is too ridiculous, and you will get more pleasure if you do not see it. That you will not, because you cannot expect what will happen. This is because of the second major problem with this film: consistency. <br /> <br /> Is it too much to ask for a similar consistency? Apparently so. I can't even count the number of broken limbs in this film (they break arms and legs, breaking bicycles). I think that each character breaks at least one limb, and a little more than one. Then they limp until the scene ends, and then forget that they must have broken limbs. There is one scene where three of them, whose legs were supposedly broken, begin to dance. But then their injuries suddenly return when the plot needs them. <br /> <br /> Finally, CGI. If there is hell, it consists of watching the fire in this film. All they did for the forest fires was the CGI fire that leveled the dirt paths. You can clearly see that the only CGI fire is along the paths, and all the trees, more than two feet from the path, remain intact. And then they zoom out and show the whole forest engulfed in flames. It is difficult to describe in words how ridiculous it looks, but I assure you that this absurdity is impressive. <br /> <br /> This film is one of those bad, good types. There are some cases when he falls into the category of painfully bad, but for the most part he remains above the line and ridiculously inept. I can't wait to watch other Nature Unleashed movies that came out with this.
