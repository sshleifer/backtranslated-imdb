Plot: A group of young people with ludicrous names (Hutch, Swink, Finay and October) came together after the death of their equally ridiculously named friend Loomis. After the funeral, they decided to share the things of their late friend. Among them is a video game called Stay Alive. The group decides that there is no better way to show their grief than to take part in a little virtual bloodshed. But the more they play, the more they realize the connection between the game and the death of poor old Loomis. <br /> <br /> Production: this film is just another entry into the latest Hollywood hobby for low-budget PG-13 Horror, designed to cash out young people. The weak direction, to say the least, is associated with fast music-style music cuts, which complicate the process. The dialogue is so bad that it actually kills brain cells. The plot itself is so full of holes that we don’t even know where the game came from or why those who play it die. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this film, although not entirely original, had some promise. But the poor performance on both sides of the camera makes this big punch. <br /> <br /> If you have ever had a craving for “killing someone in a video game, then he becomes dead in real life,” a horror movie. listen to my advice and skip "Stay Alive" to get an excellent mental scan.
