National Lampon Christmas Holidays 2: Adventures of Eddie's Cousin on the Island (2003) Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Dana Barron, Jake Thomas, Sun Hee Lee, Eric Idle, Fred Willard, Ed Asner, D: Nick Mark. Incomprehensible live video flop - his cousin Eddie and his family are on paid leave in the South Pacific for his boss, hoping that the dumbass will not sue his company after being bitten by a clever lab monkey! Idiotic motivation can not be compared with any of the films about the holidays (even with the European holidays!), With the question of whether the filmmakers consider the script really funny. Even Quaid, Willard, or Asner cannot make it remotely observable. 83 min., Not rated. *
