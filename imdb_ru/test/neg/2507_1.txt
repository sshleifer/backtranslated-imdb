The discovery was theft from "The Octopus Freaks", a film that is all that this is not. Stilted and pedestrian - words that apply - along with others that can not be repeated ..! Drifter returns to his native (?) City, meets with old friends, and so on. D. .... a normal annoying child, a single mother, a local talker, and so on. Bad special effects, an alien ship, atmospheric disturbances, the director sees "Close contacts"?). Good game? Good story? Good camera angles? Good cut? Not here! Do not rent if you do not share the cost and you have a lot of beer on hand. Do not watch on TV, instead drink a lot of beer - you will like it more!
