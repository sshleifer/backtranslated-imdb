... from this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was shown at the Cleveland International Film Festival. There were no subtitles in our copy, so I asked the festival team if there was a problem with the resulting print. "Not so ..." I was told. "The director wants it." <br /> <br /> Again, sorry, my French is hardly a high school (more than 3 decades ago). Most of the initial dialogue is conducted in French, so I'm sure I missed the nuance and many details between my understanding of several keywords. <br /> <br /> I rated this value as “1”, mainly because of the irony of the director who once worked on subtitles, refusing to insert subtitles into a film that the American public would see. Sorry, even if the majority of Americans will not know where Europe is on the map, even the audience of the film festival should not know the “native language” of this film. Even if some of us do not know Finnish, I would still expect subtitles for those few “jerks” who are not experienced enough to have experience with 37 languages ​​represented. I accept this ego from David Lynch, not from Litvak.
