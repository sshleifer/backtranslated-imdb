This is still the worst rubbish I've ever seen. So annoyed that I even complained to the Blockbuster for supplying it. I and some friends shot it, looking at the back cover, thinking that a good horror film is waiting for us. The plot line seems to change during the film, and there have been many inappropriate additions. The film ended rather suddenly, I think they ended. The sound quality was terrible, and the first female character had a very strong Spanish accent, although she still spoke complete nonsense. The guy gave a little sweet, until his strange assassination attempts take place. Having spent all the time on an in-depth discussion about the workshop and its many power tools, he prefers to put a plastic bag on her head. In general, on a second thought, I think you should watch this film to really believe that it exists.
