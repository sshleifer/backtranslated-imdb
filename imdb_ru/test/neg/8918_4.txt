I just saw "Today you die." This is bad, almost very bad. <br /> <br /> 1) Direction and editing are awful, just awful. Almost made me turn off the film, Fountleroy (the director) has no idea what he does, he seems to be shooting things at random, and some scenes have no meaning at all. In addition, I hate when the same scene is used again in the same film, in this film some scenes were used 3 or 4 times. Pretty bad. <br /> <br /> 2) The dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes terrible. I like the fact that they wanted Seagal’s character and Trach's character to look like the characters in “Deadly Weapons”, but it didn’t work simply because some dialogues DON'T MEAN, and I speak English very well, not that so that I do not understand the words, it was a fact that the jokes and lines of dialogue had no meaning. <br /> <br /> 3) The script is pretty bad. Why are they always trying to complicate DTV fighters? Segal's wife has extrasensory abilities in the film, why? Is it useful for a movie? NO. Seagal eliminates a whole group of people who work for the guy who betrayed him, and he knows these people without even meeting them in the film. STUPID. History sometimes goes astray and rolls back for no reason. The story is sometimes dirty and meaningless. They had to keep it simple, and it would work. <br /> <br /> 4) In some action movies, this is not Sigal, but its counterpart. You can tell, because they just take it off from behind and never show his face. He also defeats the guys with the martial arts in the movie, and not real, like the aikido Stephen knows. The trick uses double punches and kicks. <br /> <br /> 5) Stephen is good at film. 90-95% of the lines are pronounced with a real voice. The rest is dubbing, but it's not that bad. It was good. Also Stephen seems to enjoy in the film and more in action that he was in Scuba Diving. He loves Treach as a partner; at least he doesn't seem to love him. In addition, he seems to have been in better shape than in some of his recent films. I hate the fact that he wears clothes to hide his body, but in the same clothes he wears on the DVD cover, he looks more than normal, and he had to wear these clothes most of the film, and not a stupid long leather coat. I really think Segal wanted to make a good movie. The fact that he was late and left early from the set of Two Movies, directed by Fauntleroy, does not look like a coincidence to me. I think that he understood that the team was lovers or only in it for a quick dollar, and he did not give a damn anymore. <br /> <br /> In the hands of the best company and team, this could be a damn good fighter for Seagal. Something like For Justice or Above the Law. I truly believe that. But the people who made the film are not very good at their job, or they didn’t have enough money to do the job properly. It's a pity, since I liked Stephen in the movie, and Treach was cool (Ice Cool) too, but the rest was bad. Hey, at least it gives me hope for Black Dawn and the Shadows of the past. I think that a mercenary can be just as badly treated. But hey, Stephen seems to have returned to the same mood he was in when he was making his best films, and at least THIS is reason enough to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked it, but it could have been SO much better. 4/10
