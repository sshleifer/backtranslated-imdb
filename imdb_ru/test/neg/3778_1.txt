Over the past 5 years I have shot some bad movies ... quite on purpose. You see, I strive to be a film reviewer, and, as we all know, horrible films are released every year. Anyway, about 3 months ago I rented this one. I watched it all the time ... and wept profusely. This is one of those films that are so terribly bad that I want to vomit. It really makes me nauseous. I've seen a lot of bad movies (Mystery Science Theater 3000 anyone?), But this one shoots the cake. The plot was difficult to follow, the lighting was terrible, and the sounds were barely audible. If there was a negative rating on the scale here, this film would be at the level of -11 for me. This may seem strange, but I highly recommend it. This is something you should see for yourself ... but do not say that I did not warn you. I don’t think this review could be more accurate, so I’m ready. <br /> <br />
