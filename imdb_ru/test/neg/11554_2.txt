Having lived in the mid-1990s on Michigan's Upper Peninsula (30 miles from Eskanaba), I really wanted to see this movie. It starts quite promisingly, with some superficial understanding of the values ​​and quirks of W.P. a life. But Jeff Daniels was obviously not satisfied with the restrained approach, which would be appropriate, given the place and people. Instead, it introduces extremely rude humor and some wildly inappropriate mystical / supernatural elements. Although this is a virtually unknown region of the United States and you need to make a good film, it is NOT so.
