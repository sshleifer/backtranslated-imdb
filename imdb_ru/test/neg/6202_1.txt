If you plan to watch “Partner” and read reviews about it on IMDb, you have already spent too much time on this stupid, idiotic, horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible, terrible, terrible copy of the movie "Coupling." I prefer to ignore all the other warnings and bad reviews I heard about this film, and wasted precious 20 minutes on it - I thought that in the end it was David Dhawan who makes him, and he has Govinda - how bad it is may be ? But after 20 minutes of watching this nonsense, I could no longer tolerate it and turned off the computer. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the movie beat, stupid dialogues, a waste of time - I gave him a 1-star rating, because this is the lowest level you can do. If I could go lower, I would give him a rating of -100.
