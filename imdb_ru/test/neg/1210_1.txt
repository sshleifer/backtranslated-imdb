As a retired MSF of the United States Air Force (Aviation Service), it must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. the fact that a teenager could ever get on the flight line, much less get into the F-16 is ridiculous. the military spends millions on every pilot to make them the best in the world, and this film makes the air force and all its members stupid at best. Yes, I know that this is just a film, but it conveys a message to young people that we are all idiots, and, believe me, this is not so. Logistics involved in the creation of any type of mission is very difficult, even in the eighties, military computers were too safe to be hacked by any teenager, and other shortcomings of this film make Peter Pan more believable. sorry, for me this movie has no entertainment value.
