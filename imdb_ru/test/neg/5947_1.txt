Tom Selleck plays absentee son for senile "pop" Don Amech and tired mother Ann Jackson, compensating for his carelessness (we can assume) and accepting them after Ameche burned his motor home; Meanwhile, Selleck's work was defeated by FBI, his assets were frozen, his wife and children left him, and his disgusting sister and her little ones remained. The brightly drawn comedy about ailment is as divorced from reality as the evasive old girl Ameche. Perhaps a serious first draft (with scenes like Ameche going into a traffic jam with two babies) was included in a more stupid second or third version (with Selleck poked, beaten, pushed, and eventually lost a toe and testicle! ) In any case, this is a painful experience, and Sellek's sudden devotion to his father has little meaning; he wanders around and howls in pain, but keeps his heart a mess. This movie is mash-up. * from ****
