Well, this is a film for children, and this is not the film that adults will also like. However, there are some unintentionally funny moments, most of which are related to holes in history. For example, a child needs a computer part to bring his father to a normal state, and he has no money. So he asks his father for the dough? No, he steals it and hits it. Children, if I ever become invisible, I will increase your allowance, okay? In addition, while this child is in the police station (without a doubt, he is accused of hooliganism), his beautiful blonde teacher comes, announces who she is and where she works, and then hacks the child because of a fly in front of the COPIES! Worse, instead of quickly running away, they sit in the parking lot of the police station and laugh at their achievements. You know, I hate to choose, but the child stole something and had to face the consequences, but perhaps participation in this film is enough punishment. You will avoid it!
