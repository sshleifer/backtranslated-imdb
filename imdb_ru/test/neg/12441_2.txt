It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. I can not believe that people actually a) write similar scripts b) have a budget for making a film c) actually expect it to be successful. Words can't even describe how awful this movie is. I like my big share of movies for teens, but this is not even close funny. In fact, it was funny for the sole reason that it was so terrible. I can probably count one (maybe two) parts of the film, where I even managed to squeeze out a laugh (except for laughter about how bad everything was). <br /> <br /> To remove this was one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made. It has been a day since I watched the movie, and I'm still shocked by how awful it was. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> 2/10
