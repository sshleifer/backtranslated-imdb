Young writers, young writers, young actors, many producers, what could go wrong? Everything. Even a lame description is too good, which suggests that three of the four legs were functioning, although in fact none of them worked. Barely enough reworked storyline for a television hour of 48 and a half minutes, stretched to ninety minutes. The audience spoke back to the screen, such a bad story. Dirty cops are stealing drugs from an evidence locker. How many thousand times has it been done on television? Bad cops make good cops. Again, how many times? In all this mixture there was no original shred. Giovanni Ribisi made every effort to support the absence of the script, prompting a single mixing of the entire film. And the thought that he and Claire Danes are working on a real script with an adult director and were photographed by a real cinematographer, intrigued me. A note for screenwriters: buy one of those story generators. It can't be as bad as picking up bad television. Note to the author: pictures are available to you, except for close-ups. Even the pretty and interesting face of Claire Danes eventually becomes a tiresome close-up. Note for the filmmaker: in a few years, learn from a professional - you have something to learn. Note to the color timer in the lab: at least try to convince the author and the filmmaker that they do not know what they are talking about. Note to Claire: I hope this paid for your new apartment. It is time to get professional management and start reading scripts before entering the system.
