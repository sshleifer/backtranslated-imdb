It was, without a doubt, the worst film I’ve ever seen, but as soon as I started it was like a really bad car accident on the side of the road - you can't help yourself, you just have to watch. My eyes !!! The acting was terrible, the production was terrible, the shooting was terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible. I was glad that the priest was split, he would like to do it himself because of his bad play. I mean sucks, acting up to the tenth degree. I would have been glad if Chris had just ruined them, and then turned on himself. And what was with this damn wig from hell on his head ?! I sincerely hope that no one was paid, I mean that if it was about getting paid, they would have to pay to never try again to make another film project, to everyone who participated, never, never, never. It was just a huge piece of trash, which I was embarrassed to say that I just had to keep looking until the very end. Do not look, it's about an hour and a half of your life, you will never come back, and then you have to spend time registering on this site so you can write a comment, as I do now, what you have to do as a catharsis to survive the shocks after watching of this film (and here I freely use the term “film”).
