Although it hurts to some extent that I’m trying to baptize the comment board for this new series - mainly because I don’t want to create a false impression that there really is some sort of public interest in it - I feel compelled to add my chips on this. <br /> <br /> Simply put, I had never before felt so convincing as to support the quick and merciless cancellation of a television show based solely on the merits of its promotional advertising. And if you're interested, I'm a dude. <br /> <br /> Listen Comedy Network: although your original programming is already, politely say, of “dubious” quality (I look at you, “Girls will be girls”), you really surpassed yourself in this. Whoever highlighted this thing in green, he could not be further unaware of what is cool now. <br /> <br /> Good luck.
