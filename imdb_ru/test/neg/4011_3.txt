I watched it last night at Sundance. Altman should be the most visible director of all. This show, despite its “star power”, is completely unconvincing, and its political views - with which I, as a proud liberal, in no way agree, - are superficial and clumsy, and seem torn from the headlines of “Today USA” to the fact that it comes from the lips of such a respected person as Mario Cuomo. The drama itself is not very dramatic, and the comedy is not funny. In fact, the only places of interest are how New Yorkers live their lives, and the loyalty of the team and film crew that puts together a series that insists perseverance has a cult after 1988. Sometimes it seems that the only contribution of Altman to the cinema was art, when all your actors speak at the same time, and this leads to a depressing feeling that they are strangers at a wedding.
