This film was so bad, so cheap and so banal that I found this film one of the most boring slow films of the early 80s that I have ever seen. I like the cheapest 80s horror films, but I would never rent them again. It just doesn't make any sense. A family who lives in the forest invites their son, his wife and their daughter to spend time with them on vacation, and during the film for some reason the mother and daughter-in-law do not get along with each other. We never understand why almost until the end of the film, but until then all we see is that the mother has some form of ESP, and the daughter-in-law has nightmares and memories of the disaster that will happen to the unfortunate victims of this “Things” that we have no clue about how “it” looks, all we see is a bright light signaling its approach, and all we hear is a cheap interpretation of Darth Vadar’s voices and soundtrack stolen from horror movies. Then, when we finally found out what and for whom this is all, I just laughed. This "murderer" turns out to be some kind of alien Japanese warrior from the time of the Second World War, who apparently returned to life to demand a mother and her family. And all that the mother is doing is standing there in front of the living room, shaking with lit hands or something like she falls into some kind of convulsion. This movie is pathetic! Avoid this, not even worth renting.
