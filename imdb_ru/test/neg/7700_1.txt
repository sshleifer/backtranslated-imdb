There is nothing good to say about this movie. Read the Revolution For the Hell of It or any of his other works. Abby was often called the clown-prince of the 60s, but he was a man of ideas who used his mind, sense of humor and pop culture, as well as his bright personality to draw attention to his ideas. The media too often focused on the person, not on the ideas, and this is the problem of this film. Later in his life he suffered from depression. But this click is similar to the Abby version of the National Enquirer. He deserves better. If you don't know Abby or his time, this film will not help. <br /> <br /> This movie is lying. I give it a zero. <br /> <br />
