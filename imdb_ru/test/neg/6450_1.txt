Tug-3 is absolutely right. Although I am sure that Mr. Osmond wanted to make a sincere, heart-rending Christmas movie, this movie is as cynical and creepy as possible. The religious significance of Christmas is forgotten and replaced by cute children, ignorant adults and drugged villains. Production figures show that this was filmed by small or really inexperienced directors - I suspect that the latter is unfortunately. The worst part, oddly enough, is really music. You might think that someone with a long musical career might do better than the title song, but you are wrong. Even my mom didn't like this movie, and she likes Osmonds and juicy things.
