Actually it was a pretty boring movie. I think the problem with the French horror film is that the French should be easy to scare or something like that, because this film was not just frightening. The special effects with the ghost of the mother looked like they were not even in the film, as if someone had put them in post-production to revive them, because the actors barely reacted to them. <br /> <br /> The plot is just kind of tortuous, which is the opposite of real storytelling. I guess it was based on a French television series where they were to translate it into a two-hour film. <br /> <br /> The plot is such that the mummy is taken out of storage in the Louvre, which, apparently, has such a weak security that this girl and her boyfriend can hack it several times. (So ​​this is how people continue to steal Mona Lisa!) The guy and the policeman from the version of this 1960s film get together and try to exorcise the demon. <br /> <br /> So I’m not sure if Mom was supposed to be a bad guy or not. During the film, he kills two guards, but he just wants to get into the afterlife.
