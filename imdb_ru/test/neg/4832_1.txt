This is plagiarism from cellular communication. <br /> <br /> Bad casting ... <br /> <br /> Bad direction ... <br /> <br /> Bad music ... <br /> <br /> And the list goes on ... <br /> <br /> Well, there was no direction, as the plot, scenes and scenery were shot straight from another movie. <br /> <br /> Even the combat sequence is copied. The one with the mace was from the movie "Kill Bill" and the other with the fire hose was from the movie Jet Li or Jackie Chan (I can't remember the name of this movie) ... <br /> <br /> Keep away from this cheap imitation and try to see the real thing ... <br /> <br /> You canâ€™t expect anything original from any of the Bhatts !!!
