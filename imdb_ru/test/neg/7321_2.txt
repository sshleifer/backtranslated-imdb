I saw this movie on video with a couple of friends in the role of triple comedic humor, along with Dorm Daze and Going Greek. Obviously, we were not following the quality, but the dizzying entertainment and gags. In general, we got what we came for, but the Wild Roomies really stood out: for being terrible. <br /> <br /> First impression, cover: on the Norwegian cover were depicted covered with chest and a bunch of seemingly "crazy" roomy in the background; Brings photos of drunken half-naked teens who do a bunch of funny things, right? - “Mad” neighbors on the cover were not even depicted in the picture. And what are the funny things that you think they will do? - also absent. <br /> <br /> This film was called a comedy, which is a bit strange because it is not even funny. A relationship drama would be more accurate. <br /> <br /> In short, the film tells about a young couple who inherited a luxury house in Los Angeles and was forced to look for some neighbors to make ends meet. These roommates end up testing the patience and attitude of the young couple, because they are so “wild”. The problem is that it is not. And here lies the problem of this film: a couple of the main characters are so anal-restrained and neurotic that they manage to evoke zero sympathy. In the middle of the movie you will be rooting for antagonist neighbors. Add a mediocre game, sloppy dialogue and a boring guide, and you will get a movie that you don’t want to show. <br /> <br /> See something else.
