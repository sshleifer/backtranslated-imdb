My first impression of the trailer for the film Saikano: Live Action (available for viewing on YouTube) was "Wow, this could be one of the few best adaptations of anime on the air." <br /> <br /> This time I was just wrong! Simply put, a live Saikano film was an enigma that lacked pieces; collect them enough to get a vague idea about all this. <br /> <br /> * STORY * <br /> <br /> The film history vaguely repeats anime and manga, but the film history is just a car frame, not a full car. It seems that many parts of the story originally in the anime were omitted, altered, or completely changed. In fact, the ending is completely different from the endings of manga or anime. <br /> <br /> Characters especially; many have not considered or felt otherwise. The link between Fuyumi and Shuji comes down to the fact that Shuji knows her because she is a woman from the video store. The character Chiz felt already too strong and only a few times uttered the infamous sorry in the film. The same can be said about Shuji. We lost a shy, but at the same time high, male leader, a song he sings, and his frequent share to call Cheese stupid. Other characters, such as Tetsu and Akemi, had a different, relaxed feeling. Perhaps the fallout and softening of other characters should have focused on Cheese and Shuji, which was done. Too much. Expect a lot of sweet action movies like in a trailer? Well, do not! Those who are in the trailer plus a few minutes, this is the only number of actions that you get. The film says so much that while I was watching this movie, before watching it, I thought I had received the usual Asian romantic drama. <br /> <br /> The beat was too fast. In the film, we see the famous Chize scene, armed with small wings and chained weapons, just a few minutes before it begins. Very little time to get to know the characters and connect with them. What they had to do was to divide it into two films or even a trilogy. If there were not so many things, they would have to be changed or discarded. <br /> <br /> But again, the film behaves like a frame. The anime was rather a finished car, because even if all these small details and such minor details, they can really add up. <br /> <br /> * PRODUCTION * <br /> <br /> -Visuals- The visual effects were disappointing, so many special effects looked pretty silly, especially CGI. Unfortunately, they were similar to those that can be found in science fiction channels. They are tolerant, and this film is not for effects. <br /> <br /> -Music- Music was average. In many ways, it was orchestral background music, except that it wasn’t really that. The film shot an exciting song that Shuji always sang in the anime. A noticeable piece of music is the final song, which can be heard in the trailer. Not a bad and somewhat beautiful song. It is a pity that he was not included in the film either by itself or in the orchestrated version of the song. <br /> <br /> Casting-Casting Saikano was also so-so. The main star was Actor Maeda, “Chises” actor, who is best known for his role in “Battle for the Royal” films. The actor who played Shuji was pretty good, but they took points from the original character. Oh yes, and Tetsuo looks like Lupine 3rd. <br /> <br /> Unlike what I’ve heard from several others, the live performance of Saikano wasn’t that bad. Most likely, I am to blame for the fact that the story was laid out and squeezed in the series in a two-hour film. <br /> <br /> * What can be learned from Saikano's live action: * <br /> - CGI- I really want the CGI in Saikano not to be so bad. But even with this we could get some more fight scenes! Probably the most anticipated animated live action adaptation of the Neon Genesis Evangelion will most likely not suffer, as they are currently assigned WETA studios to create effects. <br /> <br /> -Modernism- Fuyumi owned a video shop. Cheese used an audio cassette to listen to music and gave Shuji a mix tape for his birthday. What for? This film was made in 2006! Not only that, in reality, the movie they can create such a thing as Cheese, so it can not happen in the 90s! The future is the age of CD, DVD and MP3 players. We hope that Shinji will have a Sony Walkman MP3 player in Evangelion. NOT one that plays the tape. <br /> <br /> -Story & Pacing- As mentioned earlier, the Saikano film moved too fast and forced the story to release a lot of detail. It was a smart move for ADV Films and any other to turn Evangelion into a solid trilogy, which would allow more time to retell the story as plausible as possible. <br /> <br /> -Characters- Leave the most out of one character design and let these classic quotes be said! What if Evangellion didn’t have live Aski "What are you, stupid ?!" or Shinji "I must not run away!" Sometimes these little quotes add and show who the characters are. <br /> <br /> * CONCLUSION: * <br /> <br /> In general, the film about the live action of Saikano had potential. It really is. Those who are not fans and watch this movie: you don’t want to run anime or manga (so don’t watch the movie first!) People who have watched anime / manga and loved them do not lose hope in this. Studies show that you are most likely to be disappointed. It was still fun to watch the anime come to life on the screen, but it could have been a lot more. <br /> <br /> I reluctantly give live action to Saish Heikki Kanjo (Saikano) 2 of 2 out of 5. <br /> <br /> As Chiz says: “Forgive” <br /> <br /> ~ NekoTakuto
