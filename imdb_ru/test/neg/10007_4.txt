"Tokyo's eyes" tell about a 17-year-old Japanese woman who falls in love with a man who is hunted by her big brother, who is a policeman. This unsuccessful click makes up about 50% of the filler and 50% of conversations, conversations and other conversations. You will see a less than three-person cast: they talk on the bus, talk and play video games, talk and cut hair, talk and walk, walk and talk, talk on mobile phones, hang out and talk, etc. when you read subtitles, expecting something to happen. A thin piece of history is not enough to support a film with a low final production value, a meager cast, no action, no romance, no sex or nudity, no heavy drama ... just incessant fights. (WITH)
