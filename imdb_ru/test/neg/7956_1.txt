Deepa Mehta, Arundhati Roy and many other so-called intellectuals get the title of intellectuals because they like to portray India and Hinduism in a bad light ... and Deepa Mehta still makes money on it. In any case, the Indians are too soft or scared to protest against the protests of Muslims, so anyone can accept any freedoms with Hinduism. And it is a fact that in the 1930s women in the west were also mistreated when they were widows ... just no one likes to point out something bad in the West or anything other than India and the Hindus. She draws the wrong image of India and the position of widows there. Nowhere is it mentioned that child marriage is illegal. She finished the film, saying that there are 34 million widows in India. Of course, among the billion people there will be so many widows. But how long does the life that she portrayed in the film live on? Deepa Mehta finally sells India and poverty to earn dollars. What a pity....
