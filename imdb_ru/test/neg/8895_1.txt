I was a fan of Buffy and hoped that it would come to an end when Angel had only one more season. But when the end approached, I was excited to see it. And what did we get? This episode entitled "NOT FADE AWAY" was the most recent. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with this episode. This is absolutely the worst path to this series. Why can't there be a happy ending? Why did some of the main characters die? Why didn't the Angel become a man and reunite with Buffy again? Not. The angel must sign this bloody sheet of paper so that he never becomes a man. So silly. <br /> <br /> And the end is a fragment. <br /> <br /> What could be worse? The buffy show started as cool as that of Angel, but the hole in the universe ended so badly. Someone has to cast a spell on the person who wrote the script for this episode, and make sure that he got lost in hell. <br /> <br /> So don't worry about it, it's so bad, it hurts! Only 1 out of 10.
