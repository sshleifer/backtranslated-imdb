In the last few years of Ron Miller’s reign (Walt Disney’s producer’s son-in-law), he has been releasing live shit on a stick, often in the lead role with the very boring Dean Jones, whose entire career was based on this light, empty fare. Other horrible films of the same period include Dragon Pete, The Last Flight of Noah's Ark, The Unidentified Flying Crank, and the dreaded Condorman. I will not mention the Throne, because I thought it was ambitious, and Miller was only an executive producer, so he had nothing to do with actual production. However, he was in full force when this terrible piece of human garbage was expelled from the depths of creativity. Herbie goes to Monte Carlo. The second sequel to the love story of Love Bug finds Herbie in love with another car, which also has a brain and a heart. There are races, a few bad guys, a diamond and Barney Fife. Filmed in France, the film is actually beautifully photographed, and the countryside is beautiful. But one idea comes to mind that the film was made so that all participants could have a three-month vacation in France. The rest of the film is a crash. Prat falls, clumsy thieves, evil German racing rivals and pretty bouncing feminists all fall under the category of stocks. The biggest insult to the film: trying to develop the personality of Herbie's lover with shakes, beeps, flashing lights, and movements pointing to an excited seventeen-year-old Disney writers unfairly treat our sweet little VW. On the other hand, I would have thought that it would be difficult for someone to beat Helen Hayes, who led Herbie around the ledge of a skyscraper in the second hike.
