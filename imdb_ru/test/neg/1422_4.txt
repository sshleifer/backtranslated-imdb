This is a standard action movie, which we have already seen many times. Not a lot of action in this, though. Again about the guy defending the president. He is macho - as usual, and at the same time soft and melancholic - as usual. He has the courage to take a bullet for the president ?! And then there is the girl and the usual conservative flirt. Stereotyped and predictable until the last minute of the destruction of the toe.
