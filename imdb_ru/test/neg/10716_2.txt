Do not liberals like Alec Baldwin understand that they lost the elections of 2000 and 2004? Funny lame strikes on WalMart, union workers, George W. Bush and the stock market, not to mention the deliberate accent GWB that Balvin’s character uses in the film, just makes him look stupid and bitter on screen. As the credits advance, sour grapes continue, and Ken Lei and other CEOs from Enron, Tyco, WorldCom and IMClone express "special thanks." Let me tell you something - if you invest all your money in the shares of one company, you are an idiot. We do not need this reason for the film to tell us that. What a waste of Jim Carrey’s talent — from the trailer I was expecting a completely different film — what I got was a 90-minute DNC commercial about how to scare people so they don’t invest in their future, make them stupid and keep them addicted from the government, no wonder Hollywood was in trouble and couldn’t make a decent movie anymore - you guys could come up with an original idea and show it on the screen at least once ... although I shouldn’t be surprised because Jane Fonda was filmed in original.
