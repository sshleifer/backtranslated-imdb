In a world full of films - such as "You Got a Service" - that hit the imagination with a huge amount of mistakes, you would never have thought that movies would be worse ... until now. Ron Hall's Vampire Killers do more than just kill you. This KNOWS that you are angry at this. First: there are no killers in this movie. In fact, there is only one good guy in the whole movie. Second: the place ... basically one place: the house of some donkey (or basement. It is up to you). Third: special effects (directly said) can kiss my ass. Fourth: the acting game surpasses "Plan 9 from space" in the category of the worst actions in history. Ron Hall cannot act to save his life. Finally (and definitely not the smallest problem): EDITING. The person who edited this film is better to hope that I will never find it. Cuts and shots HORRIBLE !!!! Other issues: coverage (virtually none), the fact that the guy on the cover is not even in the film, and the fact that this film exists. <br /> <br /> To summarize, let's just say that I tried a copy of the DVD before returning it to the Hollywood video (don't worry! I used MVP membership, so it was free!). NEVER SEE THIS MOVIE !!!!
