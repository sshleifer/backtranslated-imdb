When you watch horror films on a low budget as often as I do, you get to where you can tell who participated in the making of the film, as each director adds his or her taste for cheese. This is the case with Jack-O. When I watched this really awful movie, I had an undeniable feeling that Fred Olen Ray was involved, maybe not as a director, but somehow, and when I researched, I discovered that I was right. Only Fred and a few others could write something so pathetic, and this film just smelled of Fred Olen Ray. If you do not like Fred Olen Ray (and God only knows why someone will) avoid this movie. If you're going to rent a picture of Olena Ray, rent a Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers, this is the only bright shining star in the dark cheesy universe of the horrible Olen Ray films.
