It was the most uninteresting horror movie I've ever seen. The room is clearly forgotten after about 1 minute. The game is terrible. The worst thing about this movie is when two guys kiss, disgusting! What did film festival judges think about when they gave this “best film” record to this garbage can? The only reasons why I did not turn off this film were to see what NOT to do as a director, and whether it is possible to continue the storyline on thin paper as it is. I was not disappointed with this last concept. There was not even nudity or blood to interest the kids! In addition, I thought it would be foolish to use about 3 minutes in Resident Evil 2 in the film ... Was this supposed to be filler? because it was the scariest and most interesting part of the film.
