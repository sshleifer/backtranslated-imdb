Where the hell did VH1 find a screenwriter for this movie ??? From high school? This film tries hard to sympathize with Michael Jackson, but instead turns it into a horrible, tasteless caricature. All lines are cliché-filled, but surprisingly, the game was not bad. As usual, this is a bad movie with pretty good actors. The actor who plays Michael Jackson, hell, I feel sorry for him! I think he did his best with a weak script. I did not mind that Flex was not like Michael Jackson, I thought he did everything he could, but later, when he had all that white make-up, oh, he looked disgusting! The other actors who played Debbie Row, Priscilla Presley and Elizabeth Taylor were pretty good. Except that the actress who plays Liz Taylor looked too young and healthy to play Liz. The actress who plays Diana Ross is not at all like her, and I could not understand who this woman was, much later in the film. <br /> <br /> This film does a disservice to everyone who is on the side of Michael Jackson or against Michael Jackson. It does nothing to change one's opinion. In fact, the only opinion that everyone will have after watching this film, oh God, this film really, really sucks! And where the hell is the wonderful music and songs of Michael Jackson? There is nothing to find in this movie. In any case, I like the soundtrack for this film, and maybe I'll buy it if I can. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is a very funny, obscene movie! It’s a good waste of time if you want to see something light that will not disturb your brain too much. I will probably look at it again, because it is so funny!
