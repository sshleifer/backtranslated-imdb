My friends and I often joked that the films were going in real time. But this film is really ... They will literally show a 4-minute shedding nothing but a guy digging in the mud with their own hands. He has no plot and an incredible amount of free screams. I honestly do not believe that he received a reward for the expected wait. If you are like me and watched the first film, and you liked its terrible cast, randomly funny liner and widespread low budget, it does not matter; it's so bad that bad memories can even rub off and spoil any of your good memories of the original. You would be more entertained if you were looking at a blank screen.
