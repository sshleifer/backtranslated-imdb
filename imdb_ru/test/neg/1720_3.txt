Oh boy, this is another comet film. Within a year or two of Deep Impact, Armageddon, Space Cowboys and other stupid films with rap stars in them, you might think that people would burn from this concept. Apparently not, since I rented it, hoping that it CANNOT be terrible: after all, Dennis Hopper was in it, and he was a good actor, right? <br /> <br /> I forgot something important: along with Peter O'Toole, Robert De Niro and several other respected actors, Hopper has a tendency to appear in horrible films. Not only that, but he seems to be preparing for them, taking lessons on how to forget. His performance in Tychus is so terrible that you expect the Divine or Edith Massey to appear in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know what else to say about this garbage, except for the cases when you crash into the earth films, watch a deep impact, and then Armageddon and space cowboys on a banner. Forget about the others. This is really the bottom of the pile.
