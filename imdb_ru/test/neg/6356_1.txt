My first question is not about terrible action, not about terrible writing, but about directing. The choice made with respect to cinematography is one of the worst decisions I have ever seen. Why should EVERY ONLY bad guy die in slow motion? I was going to beat myself with a rubber hose. Camera shots make it so that you cannot see what is happening. I was just about to turn off the movie because of the accent of Jalal Merhi, when he got to the sex scene, so I thought that it could be better, well, it is not. If you rate special effects on the A, B, C grading scale, do I have to put them around W or so, and did I mention the acting game? Wow, that was bad !!! And the worst part of the whole experience “Expect death” is the blatant misuse of the phrase on the cover, namely: “THE MATRIX JUST GOT DEATH”. Comparing this movie with The Matrix is ​​the BEST comparison I've ever seen. If you have not seen this film, do not do it, unless you are looking for a good reason to beat your head against the wall.
