1st viewed 07/19/2003 - 1 out of 10 (Deer-Brad Sykes): a funny 3D movie that largely follows the plots of many 80s killer films. Stupid children go to the famous camp of the murderers, they are hunted by an unknown person in a mask, and then we try to find out who, if anyone, is going to live. We really do not care who is behind the mask, but even it is not difficult to see if you have seen any of these films. What a waste of 3D-viewer, despite the rather decent 3D-effects.
