There is something about this show that makes me look and hope for the future. In the letter, jokes are rare and far from each other, and the plot lines are boring, so I suppose it should be a physical comedy and visual effects. <br /> <br /> I really like the movement of the camera, the scenery and the wardrobe. This is in funny contrast with the dullness that prevails. And Iâ€™m pretty sure that every time I laughed, it was due to the physical comedy of John or Molly. The two of them make up a sickeningly cute couple that makes me laugh and want to vomit at the same time. <br /> <br /> So, I'm going to sit down again on Kat and Kim tonight to see which way this production will decline (or increase depending on the circumstances, expecting positive results).
