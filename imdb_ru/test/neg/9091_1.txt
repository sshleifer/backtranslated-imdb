I was pretty disappointed. The first Tetsuo made me an instant fan of Tsukamoto, from the first 5 minutes of the movie. It was fresh, innovative and simple ... different. I prefer the film to be in front of you and push all these buttons to “make you wriggle.” Tetsuo did just that, where for me there are few films. <br /> <br /> For those of us who like to breathe in the fresh air, those who appreciate these unusual styles that make indie films so worthwhile, Testuo II will most likely suit the dissonance. If you are looking for this intuitive “HYPER-KINETIC” view of the first film, skip this one, since all of this has been removed. Tetsuo II for some strange reason, just a typical Hollywood action movie. I was pretty embarrassed. However, it still stands in my opinion, for any inflexible Tsukamoto fan.
