After reading the film, I read the book, and I didn’t care, because it was somewhat dirty; but crappy books often make good films, and this one certainly could have. The story of a teenage girl studying her attractive power over boys, which she finds just as compellingly stimulating as suspiciously controlled, and which holds her more tightly than on an ordinary girl, because she influences her through her werewolf - this story would have an obvious attraction for a young audience for which films are made: the attractiveness of one kind for girls, and the other for boys; and I don’t understand how the filmmakers can be blind to this and turn the story into one that is little addressed to anyone. <br /> <br /> To begin with, take the title (which is the best in the book): it is taken from the quotation from Hesse, also used as an epigraph, about a person running from fear and trying blood and chocolate in his mouth, one of which is bad as the other. This is a great metaphor for the state of the heroine: torn between her human and wolf sides, savoring each, but equally afraid of both. There is no epigraph in the film, but instead it tells about the character working in her aunt’s chocolate shop! I can understand how the title of the book could offer the creators of the film erotically charged candies “Like Water for Chocolate” and make them want to associate the same symbol with werewolves. But they did not; so why is it in the movie? In the book, the characters are in high school — either inside or outside, like in the Five, a teenage gang that prefers black jeans and T-shirts and falls somewhere between the heroine’s heroes and her favorite blisters. In the film, they became decadent twenty-year-old club lovers. In the book, the heroine is 16 years old, she is only for that age, in order to understand how her sexuality affects the boy she wants, as well as herself; it is she who initiates the contact, then retreats, re-initiates, and so on. In the film, she is no longer a girl, but a woman, and this guy is no longer a high school poet living on the edge of campus life, but a fugitive from the law (and a comic book artist, moreover), it is he who comes to her as unattractive as at her wormy cousin. She puts it off at first, but then gives up, as he is sure that she will: hey, you know what you want. I would think that a female director would use the proposed book to show the female heroine in an inappropriate, proactive role; but no. <br /> <br /> In the book, the heroine clan was driven out of the house because of the five's offense; In the film, this is because she went for a run (!). She is a great runner, prone to the fact that they are beginning to knock her down from the walls of a building, and she and her clan comrades in one place scale buildings; very similar to the heroes of martial arts films and very unlike wolves or something similar to them. In the book, they do not turn into real wolves, but into something more than wolves; in the film they are just ordinary wolves. In the book, they turn into a "howling" style with a crunch of the spine; this is one of the things that makes a heroine aware of the pain that her body brings to her, as well as pleasure. In the film, werewolves became magic acrobats, making great swan dives and turning into the air, shimmering yellow like Tinker Bell; it looks cool, means nothing. <br /> <br /> In the book, the clan is a slightly snow-white family that moved from West Virginia to Maryland. In the film, they live in Bucharest, but they all speak in different accents, not one Romanian. In the book, almost the entire package wants to lead a normal life and agrees that to ensure this - and, indeed, their survival - it is only necessary to keep their true nature secret from people. And so the characters continue to talk in the film; yet the head of the clan is a kind of underground boss - but obviously not a criminal boss, as he despises the criminals - and has a regular deal with the police, who supply him with "meat" for the pack. This seems like a big exception to the rule of not letting people know; but perhaps the police are considered safe because of their known tolerance for eccentricity and cult murder. <br /> <br /> At the end of the book, the heroine finds out that she cannot be who she is not, when she tries to live a divided life, she is stuck between human and animal states, unable to be all this or that. Her boyfriend is not sure or not strong enough to accept her for who she is, the pack can not risk when he is near, and they are forced to leave. In the film, she saves him, like Lassi, and they leave for Paris (why Paris?), In the final, which looks smiling, but not very happy, because the conflicts between their nature - between _her_ nature - remain unresolved. br /> <br /> But the difference in the film, which most of all interferes with pleasure, is that, although the characters of the book behave traditionally in the sphere of novels for young adults, the characters of the film for some reason became as annoying as it is possible. Any other line is a threat or some other kind of skill: you will regret; you do not belong here; you will not get rid of me; I gave you your chance; etc. I prefer to stay away from people who do this. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of good vampire films, but there were never any good werewolf movies. If this book got into the book, it could be the first. <br /> <br /> But no.
