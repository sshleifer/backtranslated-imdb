Thursday, June 9, 6:45 pm. Broadway Concert Hall and Saturday, June 11, 13:45. Broadway Concert Hall Bless the independent director. Without them, we would see nothing but Spielberg, the Farrelli brothers and films based on old comedies. They are risky. They reap the rewards of success and fail. Max and Grace will definitely fail. Michael Parness deserves credit for being there and doing his first function, which, he claims, led him to bankruptcy. Perhaps it is better to stay on stage if this film is an indication of what to expect in the future. Despite the fact that everyone warned me, I still went to Max and Grace, hoping that I could find something that they did not have. It all starts quite well, a party for Max in his parents' house, shot in a warm, muffled light, the camera floats in interesting angles. As soon as we see that Max hanged himself, the obvious robbery of Harold and Maud, everything happens right in the tank. How could he make it unnoticed in the middle of his birthday? In that case, how did two mentally ill and dedicated psychiatric patients decide to get married and do so with the blessing of all the parties involved? In the Q & A after the film, David Krumholz suggested that the whole story was the surrealistic dream of his character Max. This story is so poorly written that the comment sounds more like an excuse. The film does not look as if it was made on a small amount, and this is another reason why he is so disappointed with the results. What is intended as funny is not so, but instead it is insultingly bad. The continuity is intermittent, the lighting is terrible, and the effects look cheap and forced. BPH accommodated less than three hundred people and was surprisingly full, but in the first half hour I saw at least thirty or forty outlets. One day, Grace, played by Natasha Lonn, mourns her inability to die. I found myself thinking about the same thing, since I never quit before the captions. If Krumholz really thinks that this is “one of the best scenarios” he has ever read, it sounds as if he needs to catch up. A terrible waste of talent and resources, this is the worst independence I have seen since the days of Bubba Ho Hope.
