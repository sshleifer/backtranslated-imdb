Disney entertainment with some non-Disney moments of graphic violence and sexual references. Lousy comedy along with moralizer, imbued with cliches. Noah, like Abraham, Lot, like his evil mate. Ludicrous special effects. Replayed with a bad time. Sodom and Gommor were destroyed before the flood? Strange turns and too many subplots that the Bible does not mention. God is like a doubting father who just needs to be entertained, whistling, before deciding that the world should be saved from disaster. <br /> <br /> The director of the BBC film, John Irwin, adds another failure to his useless list of poorly managed films that seriously lack the plot and direction.
