For many years, Ed Woodâ€™s Plan 9 was considered the worst film in history. Forget about it. The clip with the blade seven is infinitely worse. The cast is composed of famous brothers of people and almost well-known or were actors and actresses. The plot along with the budget and the script are missing. The lead time was not compiled in the classic style of Ed Wood using video. Instead, there is an endless slow motion and repeated action. As for The Roller Blade Seven, there are not even seven of them! <br /> <br /> You should watch this movie to find out how bad a movie can be. Giving hope to independent filmmakers everywhere.
