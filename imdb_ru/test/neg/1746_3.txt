We'll see. In this film, a lot of things for different people. For the Finns, as the comments show, it can be normal, terrible or boring. For other people, it may be something else. First of all: if you do not speak Finnish (I know), you will understand half of what is happening, as the subtitles are terrible and even the title is translated incorrectly (“Paha-maa” will probably be idiomatically translated as Badlands in British English). <br /> <br /> Why didn't I like it? Because this is a Tarantino movie: it just takes a very harsh reality and throws it back at you, as cruel as possible. However, I am not an American, and thus I don’t particularly like this process, because all he does is that the director really has nothing to say. Technical skill (camera work is great), the script (not so original) does not save this film from where it is located. If you want to see a Finnish film, then watch the Kaurismaki film with talent and directorial skills, with very good actresses and actors. <br /> <br /> This director has to reconsider his intentions and priorities: none of them was understandable, and therefore this film failed. Despite this, you do not miss much.
