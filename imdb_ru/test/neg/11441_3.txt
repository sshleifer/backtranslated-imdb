Not as bad as the Nails of 1992 (where Hopper plays an “unstable” cop), but pretty bad. How can a movie with such a great composition play so wrong? This film manages to find a way. The story was rather silly, and it seemed to Hopper’s leadership that he had never directed before. All long shots at the beginning were annoying. Lots of meaningless scenes with lots of meaningless conversations.
