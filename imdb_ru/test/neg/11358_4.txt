I'm a big fan of zombie movies, and it's just a pathetic attempt. I believe that the best features of zombie films are a sense of solidarity and the need to survive. This film is more focused on watching "Let's just do it well." <br /> <br /> The film was full of bad games and even worse special effects. When zombies rise from the floor and kill the guy, blood splashes out of the hole. I did not know that the holes in the planes' floors bleed so much. And the real zombie lady, Kelly, or something like that, showed the worst game I've ever seen when she woke up and started to feel bad. I laughed pretty much when she died. I deserved it in all possible ways. <br /> <br /> I was a little embarrassed about why Dr. Kelly could talk after he became a zombie, but the other zombie didnâ€™t say anything because irritating shouts and screams. And they seemed to kill zombies quite effectively by shooting them in the stomach, but when Dr. Bennett was pushed from the plane into the engine, removing most of his lower half, he could still live at the end. <br /> I kind of felt like they changed things to make a "good" scene. When one of the bitchy girlfriends (I didn't find the time to find out their names. They played a meaningless role) was in the bathroom, she was attacked by a zombie behind the mirror. Was it a double sided mirror to watch Mile-High Clubbers? I have never broken a mirror in an airplane (bad luck and all that), but I doubt that there is so much space behind, with the insanely limited space of the actual bathroom and everything. <br /> <br /> Few redemptive qualities were too small, too late, unfortunately. One thing that the film was going to do was hot smoking flight attendants, yet they felt the need to kill all but one. And I admit that I laughed too damn when the old woman squeezed Frank's hand, and he said: "She's chewing me to death," or something like that. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I'm sad. wasted my nine dollars on this film. The fact that I bought him as a minor redeems this, but still ... He failed on many levels. Stick to the dawn of the dead and 28 days later.
