Bad adventure in the genre of fiction / horror, which takes itself too seriously, is remembered only for (a) beautiful Matilda May, wandering naked in chaos and (b) a terrible mistake. It has some horrific effects and amazing moments, as well as some unintentionally funny scenes, but mostly it's a waste of time.
