This film is so bad that it is worth watching. In this film, viewers leave a coma for the first 10 minutes. It all started when a bunch of writers came up with the idea that the plane would be hijacked, and a passenger who could fly on a small plane should land the beast. However, they know that this has been done before many times, so to do it differently, let's do it very badly! Major Masters got his name from the 80s film "Live and Die in Los Angeles". from the character played by Willem Dafo. This saved 10 minutes of writing and production. The aircraft must be a Boieng 747. This aircraft has a unique silhouette, even in the dark, with a characteristic front hump at the top. Just ask the late Ronald Reagan, who mourned this moment when these Russians shot down KAL 007 in the eighties. And yet, when the plane takes off, it is clearly not 747, but more like 767. This well-studied film also forgets to turn the engineer’s seat into the cockpit and replaces it with two comfortable rumbling seats. There is no need for flight engineers on this complex aircraft! The heroine is played forever puffed up Gloria Lynn Berg. After tying up the hijacker, in spite of several people loaded with buses on this gigantic plane, no one bothered to watch this guy who almost killed them all. He just has to have fun. <br /> <br /> A shattered plane, from which all the hijackers are leaking fuel, will not return to Hawaii, so Masters will attempt to land at the Air Force base located on the island. Only a runway of 300 feet is too short. Four army guys with small Bobcats (the one you rent to take all day, carrying horse manure to the back of your barn), in 20 minutes will overcome a strip 200 feet wide and 300 feet long! You don't need a bulldozer here! Where can you find these guys? These guys could drive through the highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in 3 hours, equipped with only tablespoons, a compass and a duck! <br /> <br /> After this hellish obstacle is eliminated, Masters will try to land the plane as a heroine sulking away. The hijacker giggles to herself, and without supervision gets freedom to make more problems. Finally, he is depressed in the most backward way, which I cannot tell you. But YOU CAN say “Moby Dick”? <br /> <br /> There are so many backward scenes in this movie. The wounded captain is parked on the bench of the plane, while the Masters, who, presumably, can barely fly, places the plane in banks at 60 degrees and falls from a height of 20,000 feet per minute. During these complicated tricks, the pilot had to kiss the ceiling in French, but did not move an inch. <br /> <br /> I think that if they chose different actors to play the roles, this move could be much better. If we need a puffed up heroine in the film, why not choose the better-known actress Bernadette Peters, who also seems to be constantly sulk? In addition, she can sing, and busty, well-aging Peters can show some free pictures. Now with the angles of singing it could be the hijacking of the film "Let's land the plane" MUSICAL! Starring Luciano Pavarotti as a pilot. They can sing a duet in the cockpit before hijacking the plane, and there is no chance that the fat tenor will fly up to the ceiling when Masters puts his magic on this big bird. In accordance with the musical theme, Masters could play Andrei Bocelli, with whom Peters can sing while landing on the plane. He is not only completely blind, but knows only a few words of English. Now this is the plot! Think about what you are discussing in your chair between the Masters (Bocelli) and the air traffic controller: <br /> <br /> ATC: “Sir, please turn off the gas 180 degrees, the flaps are set to 25 degrees. Maintain course 230 "<br /> <br /> Bocelli:" What? "<br /> <br /> ATC:" Sir, now lever spoilers, confirm the braking pressure at 250 psi. inch. Maintain a drop at 500 feet per minute. ”<br /> <br /> Bocelli:“ What? ”<br /> <br /> The deceiver could be played by the late great Rodney Dangerfield, who can spew many of his liners when he sits, tied and unguarded: “I do not respect. My wife has group sex. Yes, she screwed up in front of the judge and the jury! “Get the idea? <br /> <br /> LOST POSSIBILITIES The film has your standard crying and moaning passengers who never develop. Woody Allen may have been back there, offering one of his neurotic monologues:“ She said that I I sleep very well in bed. I told her that I often practice myself ... "Now this is a movie! <br /> <br /> Also, in accordance with the similar film" Executive Decision ", in which Stephen Segal's lazy look graciously killed at the beginning, which gave this film a chance, the 747s have massive attics at the top. The em was introduced in 1969, so who knows what has accumulated there for almost 40 years? My uncle has old clothes, sleighs, magazines and all sorts of different things. It would not be cool if Masters opened the door and saw Chevy Chase at tears in his home the dressing gown of the woman who watched the old Super 8 films of her childhood? Just a recommendation. <br /> <br /> So give him a chance, and as you regain consciousness, imagine how great you could be this film, if I had a hand in it ...
