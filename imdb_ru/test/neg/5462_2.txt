I have to agree that many other reviewers have concluded. The plot, which could cause reflections and shed light on the reverse double standard, failed miserably. <br /> <br /> Rape, a crime of violence and control, the scene here was mostly miserable. It would be the best idea to take a quick look at what is happening and allow viewers to present an action. And the victim's laughter with the police when he interrupted the police complaint seemed as sincere as the police. No awkwardness, no hesitation just join. I don’t know if it was a bad acting game or a bad director, but someone completely missed the point. As for his half ** of the alleged search of his attackers, pathetic. They should have missed most of the sex scenes - another monumental failure in themselves and made him meet with Colin Friel when he first went to the police. This story could then be developed through good dialogue and random memories — and saved by the excellent play and presence of Colin Friils — the only reason I watched this film — brings to any project he does. <br /> <br /> The only concrete revelation of this film is crap.
