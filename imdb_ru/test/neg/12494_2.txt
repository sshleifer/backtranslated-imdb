This film was obviously made with a very low budget, but did it have to be made so obvious? It seems that they did not put an effort to make the “future” look at least futuristic. For example, the first scene takes place in an office building from the 1980s, and all of the blown-up cars belong to the late 1970s (I guess they didn’t want to blow up cars worth more than $ 500). In addition, it is pretty obvious that Don "The Dragon" drives his personal car during the film (after all, he partially financed the film). Finally, they indicate at the beginning of the film that all kinds of drugs are now legal in this new cyberpunk society. Not only does this never become important in the film, but later, when Don needs an operation without anesthesia, why doesn't he just go out and get legal heroin or morphine? The entire film is careless and completely anti-climate, as Don easily blows up the “unstoppable” cyber-tracker about 25 minutes before the film begins. However, if you find this film cheap or free, I’ll watch it, the last scene is almost worth bringing out with this film.
