... what a porn movie would look like if you took out sex and just left in a bad dialogue, cheap sets and bad actions, you would be Galaksina. <br /> <br /> This film was released when Original Star Wars proved that there is a science fiction market. This, in turn, led to the appearance of some gems, such as the Alien and the bustling Star Trek. Unfortunately, this also led to bad films, and it was obviously one of them. (I say, obviously, because I didn’t even hear about this film a few days ago. I missed it when it came out in 1980.) <br /> <br /> This is the main problem. Dorothy Stratton could not play, so most of the film they did not even give her a try. I understand that her tragic death gave this film the status of an undeserved cult, but I cannot understand why, apparently. <br /> <br /> It’s clear that the film was trying to deceive Star Wars, Star Trek and aliens, but they clearly don’t understand that when you cheat something, it must be funny! In this film there was no, or at least there was no ridiculous time for jokes, which could have been ridiculous. Science fiction is ripe for parody, as Spaceballs and Galaxy Quest have proven. This film, however, made it bad.
