They argue that the cops, when they cannot find real criminals, always blame the parents and accuse them of having sexually abused their children. These films always portray the press as a group of animals, and parents go out of court to feed the press with hunger to humiliate those suffering from grief. No one ever heard of the backyard of the courthouse in these films? Here you have a psychic who accurately tells them what happened and WHERE you can find the body, but the police do not report, and no one listens to his conclusions. <br /> <br /> Police are portrayed as boobies who do not know what they are doing, and there is always a third-party detective like Ed Asner, who is late in the case, believes in parents and unravels the secret. <br /> <br /> In addition, after the parents are cleaned, they do not spit in the face of a stupid policeman who put them in jail, took their child away and accused of killing their own child. <br /> <br /> It looked like I had seen this film MANY times before.
