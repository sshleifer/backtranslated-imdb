It was probably the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Forget that it is clear that no research has been done on Detroit (forest in the center of Detroit! Bwahaha !!). The letter was terrible, the premise is completely implausible, and, frankly, the characters were embarrassing. I can’t understand forever why experienced actors would go down to that level and participate in something so terrible. I have never seen the original, and I don’t know whether this film renders it in its original form. As I understand it, the original was not installed in Detroit. Why they will deviate from it, without exploring the details of the setting, only tells me that it was more than the actors who wanted to pay the rent. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this garbage, unless you are from Detroit and you want some comic relief.
