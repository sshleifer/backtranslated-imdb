I work in the office on weekends, and there is a TV that receives only one channel. So I do not have the opportunity to turn to something better. I hold it, though, because it provides a little background noise. Sometimes I get a decent movie / show. Not today. Today I received a "Breaker Breaker". The city looks like the third tariff set (which, of course, it is). All the actors and the bad guys look like theyâ€™ve just finished stunt school. I have seen the best drama productions at the carnival. Special effects (the flame at the end of the film is more fake than Michael Jackson's masculinity). Even the horse at the end of the film was a terrible actor ... Badly filmed, poorly filmed, poorly written cinema.
