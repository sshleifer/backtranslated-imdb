I would like to read more reviews and more opinions about this film before I rented it. Waste of money. Waste of time. Very little dialogue. The dialogue was difficult to understand in all respects. The storyline and plot were both weak. The only thing that was good was cinematography. <br /> <br /> The characters were interesting. At the same time, due to the lack of dialogue, you will spend so much time trying to figure out that you will be rewinding the movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. It was a mess, and you will feel like a mess. <br /> <br /> You say, what the hell, when the movie ends?
