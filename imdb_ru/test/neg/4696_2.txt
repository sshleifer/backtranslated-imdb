The plot summary of IMDB mistakenly makes it sound as if it were a film by Noah Taylor, when Fairuza Balk is the central character. It is incredible how such an cast could be in such an amateur, nonsensical, non-film. Balk breaks up with Boyfriend Taylor, sleeps with the Devil (I think Dempsey plays him) and accidentally kills Taylor, who chases her to the end of the movie like a ghost. Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen.
