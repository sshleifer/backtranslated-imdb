The filmmakers were clearly on drugs. This is the only explanation I have. How else can you explain this parody of the adaptation of Jane Austen? Northanger Abbey - a parody of the Gothic novel. But this film was made as if it was a gothic romance. The bizarre sequences of music and dreams are prompted to me by drug-induced hallucinations, rather than a naive, innocent girl with an excessive imagination, like Catherine from the novel ... <br /> <br /> The actress who played Catherine just stands around looking constantly Peter Peter at least 10 years older to play Henry, and in fact he seemed a little fun to me. I see no attraction between him and Katherine. The image of John Thorpe was rather strange, but in fact Isabel was not so bad. But nothing could save this film PART OF CREP! One more thing - this film invents a character that is not in the book, the French friend of General Tilney "Marquis". Why they added it, outside of me. It must be drugs. She looks scary incredible, with a white base, red lips and black lines, randomly painted on her face (dimples?). <br /> <br /> You think that it will be at least amusing in “so bad” this is a good quality, but unfortunately it is not. This is just bad.
