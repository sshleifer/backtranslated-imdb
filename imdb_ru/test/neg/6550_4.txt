This film is about people living in a trailer park. later in the film it becomes apparent that these people are comedians without work, mostly elderly men. well, more or less they sit around the whole movie and talk about the damn. but no action ever happens, only those people say. At first, I thought it was some kind of cool perverted little girl, but after a while it got boring. I mean, how many versions can you say about f *** ing, d ** k & c ** t? Of course, it can be funny - for half an hour, not 80 minutes. but it was fun to watch people trying to act. I am sure that they often read their text on some sheet during the game. but it doesn't interfere with the movie, it's cool like that. because these people seem so poor, awesome, dejected, that the style is completely appropriate. Their wooden, helpless reading of texts creates a pretty good atmosphere, I fell a little in love with the characters. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler ahead *** later in the film, damn some comedy shows (rhyming about how to yell) with ourselves as spectators and imaginary applause. then they get advice on eviction, and so they decide to protect the trailer park and enter their rooftops — armed with some kind of weapon. then they got shoot. fin. sounds like an action, but it is not. just a crappy home camera shoots. *** SPOILER END *** <br /> <br /> but the film is fully consistent with its style, and I am sure that this is exactly what the director wanted to have. This is a portrait of these damned people in an untidy home-style camera with characters who can’t act but seem like interesting personalities, so it's nice to look at them. but the lyrics are about - you know that - it's getting boring all the time. <br /> <br /> A rather young director who also seems to be an interesting person because he played some of the teenager’s stuff in popular movies / TV shows, but now he’s caught in other horror films that are more likely to be his cup of tea. and this his first direction of effort will now spread through thromium. I don’t know anything about the release, I received it as a "preliminary screening" of this year's cann, which says "for bootlegging purposes only".
