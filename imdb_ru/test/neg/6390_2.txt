This film has just arrived in Mexico, and since I read very good reviews about it, I decided to go see it with my friends and girlfriend, but I was very disappointed, I do not understand how people can rate it 10/10 I I mean, the directing script was great, but for a good film as a whole, you need a good story that this film lacked. <br /> <br /> I liked several dramatic Asian and European films, but they had a good story, watch this film at your own peril and risk, if you are not Eastern European or orthodox, I donâ€™t think you will like it. <br /> <br /> Half of the people in the theater left, including my 4 friends who were waiting outside, because they were really bored. I always wait until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it was very slow, with a lot of time-wasting scenes, the whole story could be shown in no more than 40 minutes, but they did it longer, having scenes from a monk receiving coal, which is like 15 minutes of the whole film plus panoramic views, etc., until they turned it into a feature film, really boring. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you listen to me, if you are still watching it, go back and rate this comment as useful after the wards to help people avoid this waste of money.
