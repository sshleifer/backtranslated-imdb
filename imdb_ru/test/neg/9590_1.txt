When King Kong took it off the top in a remake of 1976, I caught my breath. I don't know how many times I came back to watch these films in the hope of seeing more. Jessica Lange was not a great actress then (she became her), but she was so hot! I went out to see “Sweet Dreams” when he came out, because by that time Miss Lange was a great actress. It looked like a wonderful story. And it is always nice to see her. <br /> <br /> I never left the movie faster. My wife agreed. <br /> <br /> When we got into the car, I turned to her and said: “If you told me, I would be bored to watch Jessica Lange take off her clothes, I would say that you are crazy got off I just got tired of watching Jesse Lange take off her clothes! "How bad is it?
