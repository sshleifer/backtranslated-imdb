This is the "Land of Battle" mini-series. There are, with some exceptions, all the disastrous components that are doomed to this film, and he will follow him to the grave in the Indian cemetery. Both of them are an adaptation of books with an endless number of pages, which the scriptwriter and director turned into a complete mess (in this case, they are the same person), who clearly don’t know what they are doing, I also have a copycat messiah, who It does not deliver like a hero (in this case, he is played by a guy who looks like Mark Hamill, but unfortunately the strength is not with him.) and a bunch of stupid bad guys who love to betray and ruin each other's life, they both contain scenes stolen from the best productions and they are both cheap pr duction, who are trying to look expensive to some (often poorly made) computer animation. The exceptions that actually exacerbate the situation are the terrible work done by the lighting maker, who doesn’t even have the skills to turn on the lights in his own living room, working with the camera, which does not work under any conditions. but most of the time is flat, like a pancake, extremely cheap and a small set of deserts, which contains only a bunch of sand against the background drawn in the form of a desert, which very quickly becomes very old because it appears in almost every scene, and bad the costume designer's idea of ​​trying to imitate the Fifth Element fashion madness with the stupidest hats ever made. Stupid moments to keep in mind: 1. Every scene with guys from the guild that looks like the MST3K watch guys, but with silly hats. 2. Irulan appears at the party, dressed in a butterfly dress (why are butterflies? - was it with the stuffed parrots in the cleaning lady?) With a suitable silly hat, along with a couple of guys in stupid hats with balloons. 3. Paul is a comedian. 4. Baron Harkonnen in excessive overload, shouting "I, I am alive." 5. Each scene with a background, because it is newer corresponds to the foreground. 6. Each scene with fake religious ceremonies of the Freemen, especially the “water of life” ceremony. 7. Battle scenes where the same guys kill a couple of times and the same things explode over and over again. It’s a lot more, but it’s a limit of 1000 words, so I'd rather stop before I get carried away.
