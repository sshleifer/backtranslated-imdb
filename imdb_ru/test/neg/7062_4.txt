Some of the early conversations survived to become classics. The Flurry of 1929 is a classic, but it's not as planned. Melodramatic in its plot and plot, today it seems ridiculous, especially in the role of Myrna Loy in the role of Nubi, a seductive gypsy woman. Imagine that Nora Charles breaks up with a young couple and makes a young man steal. Outrageous! However, as many know, when Loy first arrived in Hollywood, she performed many such exotic roles as temptresses. <br /> <br /> According to the play “Squall” it concerns the aforementioned gypsy who is now in the film in Hungary (Spain in the play), running away from her cruel master and inviting herself to the house of the Layos family (Richard Tucker and Alice Joyce), mostly appearing at the door. One by one, Nubi seduces men of the family and farm who speak their Pidzhin English (“Nubi, not bad! Nubi, don't do anything wrong!”) And share hints of nice gifts. The son in the family Paul (Carroll Nye) is engaged to the beautiful Irma (Loretta Young) and can not wait to marry her. He loses interest when he meets with Nooby. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the beautiful Alice Joyce, Zasu Pitts as a woman who lives in the family, and the stunningly beautiful Loretta Young, acting is equally terrible. Loy was stuck with signs of her character - poor English, nagging and hysterical. With her darkened make-up, peasant clothes and curly hair, she is not only beautiful, but also straight from the 1980s — quite modern, although Richard Tucker, putting his hand on his forehead, reminds us that we have just emerged from silence. TCM's Robert Osborne commented that this film is one of his secret pleasures. Despite the fact that it is very bad, it is not so bad to relive again. It’s just bad — but a great example of how far we have come and if someone didn’t understand Myrna Loy’s sense of humor, how limited her wonderful career could be.
