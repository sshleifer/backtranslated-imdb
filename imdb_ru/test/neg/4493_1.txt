The scene was pretty good. But for the plot of the film I would give it a rating of 1 out of 10. Doesn't the producers and directors of this film seem to think about it carefully? <br /> <br /> This is not the case. does not attach much importance and values ​​to its viewers, except for violence. The whole story was about revenge. The boy who witnessed rape and murder. I would even recommend banning him. Those who watched it just lose money. If you are thinking about viewing it, see something else. I would ask for a refund if I were at the cinema. So for you guys and girls, you read this article there. Please do not waste time.
