Horrible movie; badly written, badly received, stamped, beaten, petrified. The idea is so good, and she has the opportunity to talk about black cowboys, but the film is really awful. This is a curious mix of a bad Randolph Scott film from the 1950s and a bad western spaghetti from the 1970s. The villains are cardboard, the memories are ridiculous, the dialogue is painful. <br /> <br /> Deliberate anachronisms (such as “Victorian” rap singers and modern swearing words, such as “motherf **** er”) irritate the extreme. <br /> <br /> A Frankenstein monster who died on a lab bench.
