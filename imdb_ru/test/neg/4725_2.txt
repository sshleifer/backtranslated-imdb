The next “review” is the wrong side of the tracks, meaning two things: you will not hear anything but praise from me and you will not be deceived by my rating. I could also say that there are no spoilers in this review, but technically ... this is a lie. <br /> <br /> Well, ... Screw Review. I'm just going to wander around a bit. It's been a long time since I had so much fun with such a bad movie. And if you can't enjoy this piece of nonsense, then you simply have no sense of humor. First of all, this film should have been taken seriously, and this is the main aspect from which the fun comes. Story? The son of a doctor is mortally ill. Daddy-Doctor decides that deer transplant should be the only way to save his son. Thus, in the true style of a mad doctor, he decides that the heart of the gorilla will do its work. Of course, the gorilla's heart is “too strong for man”, so the son turns into this disgusting Monkey Man, who immediately breaks free and continues to kill and rape fun (because it's just what any horned beast would do) right? ) Makeup of our Monkey is hilarious. There is simply no other way to express it: a guy's face looks like a poop! I'm talking about human excrement, solid brown form! Beautiful! The blood in this film is also wonderful: in addition to real shots with open-heart surgery, we also have incredibly fake (but rather unpleasant) looking effects of blood and blood: decapitation, eye swelling, tearing of the throat, scalping someone's skull, ... it's fun, and, really, completely incomprehensible why NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES got on the notorious list of British Video-Nasties, because all the unpleasant things depicted in this film are just too ridiculous to be serious Oh, and by the way, there too only one bloody run simian. So it goes without saying that LA HORRIPILANTE BESTIA HUMANA is a much more accurate name for this terrifying and convincing story about science, which was terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> When you don’t try to shock with poorly organized acts of bloody violence or accidental In this film, depicting a female nude, it is very interesting to have fun with such ingredients as meaningless dialogues, cheap cardboard sets, stupid plot, and an incredibly bad game. Maybe just a few random examples? About the sets: it is clearly seen that the set designers simply and again used the same walls, doors, windows (and so on. D.) To create different interior sets (for example, one side of the hospital room - the side of the window - where the unconscious struggling lies the girl looks suspiciously similar, like the window side of the basement lab, from which the ape-man runs away; the designer decorators also took one of the side windows from the lab, made it a bit bigger and just put it in the conference hall of the hospital; all the walls in they are also gray; ...). Then there is the setting of the park. Clearly shot in the studio, you can see (several times) that the grass is loose. Whenever some kind of fight / fight / rape occurs, the grass just shifts and shuffles, and you can see the gray concrete from the studio floor below it. <br /> <br /> Just a few random lines that come from the actors of the mouths: <br /> <br /> - In the conference room, where all doctors discuss the disappearance of the Unconscious fighting girl (disappearance, which, of course, would mean bad publicity for the hospital), the dad-doctor intelligently says "We are in a difficult situation." <br /> <br /> - During this discussion, the colleague doctor deftly remarks: “Lunatic! Any lunatic rises ", thereby providing a weighty excuse for the disappearance of the Unconscious Fighting Girl. <br /> <br /> - After our investigative detective, through the amazing process of his own logical inference, makes a conclusion and tells his boss that the killer must be half human / half animal, his boss answers that this is absurd, adding the line “It’s more likely that lately, more and more, you’re watching many of these pictures of terror on TV” ... Truly one of the best lines of the film. <br /> <br /> Other sources of laughter: < br /> <br /> - In two scenes were the dad-doctor and his Igor-like help nickname, kidnapping a gorilla from the zoo and the Unconscious wrestling from the hospital - these well-designed acts of abduction are like kidnapping of sweets from a child. <br /> <br /> - Daddy Doctor talks with God a lot, doesn't he? <br /> <br /> - Sonny-boy several times called dad-doctor "Dad". <br /> <br /> - The old woman shouts "Aaaaaa !!! Dead man Dead man Dead man !! DEAD MAN !!! ". <br /> <br /> - The plot periodically stops in scenes of the struggle of women, only to continue and do nothing with this concept. Of course, the daddy-doctor replaces Sonny- The boy's gorilla’s heart a second time with the soul of the Unconscious , but do you think something exciting will happen after that? For example, does a male monkey grow chest or something else, this time trying to rape men? Our leading living wrestling beauty (Norma Lazareno)) does not even participate in the climate the fight against ape-turd-man near the finale of the movie ... but ape-turd-m an really starts to show some maternal love closer to the end ... almost (and I say "almost") in the true KING-KONG style (i.e., the upper part of the building and the people on earth pointing and screaming). <br /> <br /> Okay, I think that's enough. I scored more than two cents here. Vomitron's rational rating for this dreary piece of fun-filled dragon: 2/10. Vomitron's rating on the wrong side of the tracks: 8/10. Watch this movie, people. worth it!
