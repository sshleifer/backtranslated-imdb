Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are great movies, but this last part of the trilogy is a major disappointment. They are too carried away with stock photography and photography, so little content. The executive producer puts his own image in the film ... It's just pretentious. Maybe if they had more than $ 3 million, maybe it would be something. I really thought Stephen Soderberg directed this because it was very bad, but Godfrey Reggio, director of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, directed it. I must assume that they simply did not have the budget to make a decent film. You would think that Francis Ford Coppola would like to be part of this film and help raise more money together.
