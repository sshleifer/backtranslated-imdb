This is the film that 50-year-old schoolteachers love and people who consider themselves to be knowledgeable about social issues, but in fact have no clue. The actors - I think that all of them - lovers - are doing everything possible, but the script is so full of cliches and stupidities that they cannot save it. <br /> <br /> Although the worst thing is that the scool cabaret kids work on - returns all your worst memories from acting classes at school. The text in one of the songs sounds something like this in a quick translation at 2.30 am: "I am a society dwarf, an emotionally crippled person." <br /> <br /> Please!
