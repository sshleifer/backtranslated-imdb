For any Nickelodeon fan who watched the network in the 80s and 90s, there was always something good. You had some fun activities like “You can't do it on TV.” You had strange but good shows, such as Pete and Pete. You even had cartoons that taught morals like Doug. But, like Disney, Nickelodeon collapsed into a pipe, restricting their demographic coverage to small guys and giving us bad reasons for creating new, innovative shows. When I tried to watch Zoey 101, I only shook my head in disgust. <br /> <br /> Setting could not be more fake than this. Each character attends a boarding school called Pacific Coast Academy, which has everything that a spoiled child wants. Sushi bar, laptops everywhere, flat-screen TVs in every room, cool dorms to hang out, etc. Children on this show are rarely in class, and there are no real teachers. This is more like a place that you would spend on a pleasant summer vacation, and not to work and study while preparing for college. <br /> <br /> Characters were also a factor that pushed me. Each episode consists of the boy's problems, the situations that they themselves have caused, and the problems that need to be solved. Each character is a stereotype. Zoe (Jamie Lynn) seems perfect in everything she does, and each of her friends asks her for help when they feel they are in grave danger. Only leading her not to have another side. I was at school and I can tell you, nobody is like that. Chase is dumb. Logan plays the arrogant tough guy. Quinn plays the nerd who is very unrealistic in what she does. Michael idiot Lola is a clone of Nicole. Dana is just a healthy person. Why not use originality? Is something unique to these characters different from other personalities? Is stereotyping the best that creators of this show can come up with? Instead, these actors are boring personalities with the feeling that they lack a creative approach to their roles. There is nothing surprising or surprising. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but the show is clearly aimed at adolescent children standing in front of the stage on which they must develop as a child. to be an adult. During this period, they must learn to learn independently, make their own decisions and do what suits them. Zoey 101 does not contain any of these values. In this case, we must believe that looking good and having a stereotypical personality is all you need to succeed. Sorry, but this is simply not true. People cannot expect to be given something, as the actors in this show do, and just leave these things there. If I had expected something in Zoey 101 to happen in real life, I would live in a fantasy world locked in a dream house. Nothing in this show applies to those who are faced with health and money problems. This also does not apply to children who want to learn something meaningful. <br /> <br /> So in conclusion, Zoey 101 is a Nickelodeon show that is unsuccessful. It shows a terrible message for children, and I believe that the show itself is simply not suitable for them. Of course, there is no painful violence in him, but he teaches everything to make the child act and look silly. A terrible sight that needs to be forgotten along with the rest of the rubbish that Nickelodeon has been making in recent years. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10.
