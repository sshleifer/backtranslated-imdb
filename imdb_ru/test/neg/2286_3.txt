Connery climbs aboard Moore's mock train in this bitchy movie. Rejecting everything that made Bond successful in the first place, this film degrades Bond's character even more, throwing him into the category of inspection gadgets. Get Smart is not. There is no style here, only second-rate actors performing on cheap sets. It's a shame that Connery could not give an element of class here, but it does not collide. Everything here smells of mediocrity, including a bad Connery wig. Perhaps if I were snowed and got a choice between watching Never Say Never and Howard Duck, I would choose the first one. If you want a real James Bond, take any Jan Flemming novel.
