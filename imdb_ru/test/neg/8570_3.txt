The headline describes it for sure. This episode of the film was nothing more than a typical “group of teenagers who killed someone accidentally, now that someone was stalking / killing them 20 years later,” nonsense that was thrown into our throats for decades. The only turn — instead of an angry former classmate or a sweet psycho / loser, it was a nun. The nun wants to get rid of the girls' sin, blah blah, girls accidentally / intentionally drown the nun, blah blah, the nun pursues the girls, people die, the film ends. The only thing that made it available for viewing were death scenes that were pretty cool (especially the one where the elevator door tore the hands of this fat lady), but even they could not make this great film. Brian Yuzne should hang his head to join this trash. I am sure glad that I rented it and did not buy it, or I would be beside myself with rage. If you want a movie about non-proliferation to like your feelings, check out Demonia or something like that. Stay away from this trash.
