Steve Martin always respected me for being a very funny comedian and a pretty good actor, and I liked “Planes, trains and cars” and “Baufinger” - but “Demolish the house” is definitely not among the Martin. the funniest works, and it doesn't even seem like they are trying to do it, which is just sad ... <br /> <br /> I don't know; Maybe I didn’t like this movie because I shot it with Harry Potter and the Secret Room and the Phone Booth, both of which are great movies, or maybe it’s because I’m used to this is much better from Martin, or maybe it is just because I have a hell of a bad mood today ... Despite this, this film was not very funny or interesting, and I never managed more than a smile or a faint laugh The movie jokes, which is really a shame, since the previews are comedy were so promising! I expected the Destruction of the House to be a total comedic hit, and I certainly expected more comedy from farce and interracial laughter from Martin. Instead, we are "treated" when we see Queen Latifa moving around the screen, trying to do everything possible with her completely uninspired character. The funny thing about this claner is Eugene Levy, but even he does not get the time he needs on the screen. <br /> <br /> I would really like to enjoy "Household Disassembly", but I wouldn’t and it would be very difficult for me to recommend it to anyone other than the most persistent fans of Steve Martin. Skip this and rent a "Planes, trains and cars" ... <br /> <br /> You will have much better.
