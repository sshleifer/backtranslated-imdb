Audrey, I know that you truly treasure the memory of your husband Ted, but PLEASE trust his legacy and listen to his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his life for a very good reason. We ask you to stop preying on his stories, images, fantasies and characters. They become the gutted forces of Hollywood and Broadway. The children of tomorrow will be stuck in these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever defile the loving warmth and innocence of his books. <br /> <br /> This is really your property as you wish. I would just like you to listen to the advice of others for a bit. Keep what is left of Dr. Suze. Thank.
