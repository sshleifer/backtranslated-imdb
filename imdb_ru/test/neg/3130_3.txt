The Dakota incident must be one of the strangest westerns I've ever seen. Not good, but definitely weird. <br /> <br /> A stage without a driver is going to Christian Flats, all passengers of which are killed. This is planned to continue, but very few, for obvious reasons, want to risk the Cheyenne on the war path there. But Linda Darnell, Regis Toomey, John Landa, Whit Bissell and Ward Bond have their own reasons for continuing. And Dale Robertson, who killed John Doucette in a shootout after Doucette and Skip Homier were shot and left to die in the desert, wants so much to go that he is ready to lead the team. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Cheyenne attack is a fearless group of passengers, if it is forced in a dry wash for cover. Who will live and who will die, so is the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The incident in Dakota occurred at the very end of Republic Pictures, before Herbert Yates cut off his little studio. Westerns were their specialty, but, as a rule, such as Roy Rogers did. This would not be a Rogers product. <br /> <br /> This is actually incredible. Characters are not wedged into any reality. Whit Bissell takes ore samples from his application, but Robertson discovers that it is iron pyrite, fool's gold. Toomey is a cynic playing a guitar that goes crazy with thirst. Darnell is hunting for her cheater, but he really doesn’t know what to do when he finds him. Lund hopes to attract Robertson, who committed the crime for which he took rap, but should return him alive. For this, he will need help, but it will not be provided. <br /> <br /> But the worst is Ward Bond, who is the senator of the United States on his peace mission in the Cheyenne. In real life, Bond was the rightmost man, and I’m not sure that this is not a caricature of what he will perceive as a liberal. He's actually a pretty stupid fool, but I think it could draw him to the role. <br /> <br /> I tried to get to Dakota, but could not. And the finale was, at least, a strange fantasy. <br /> <br /> Give him three stars for the cast.
