After the Kenneth Opel inspirational story brought me back to the pleasure of reading in elementary school, I had high hopes for this series. The story of how an outsider bat traveled across the country to reunite with her colony, captivated my imagination and resonated deeply with my burgeoning imagination. Hearing about this series, I began to browse the Bardel Animation website and I liked what I saw. The character design looked impressive, and the fast-paced plot seemed to be stretched in a respectable way along an arc of thirteen episodes. Then I was very disappointed when I decided to see the restart in the early morning. <br /> <br /> In the introductory episode, our hero, Shade Silverving, pursues the tiger moth in the deep hours of the night. A chirping echolocation song, we see a graceful, if the coarse CGI effect lights up a moth, and the chase takes a violent twist, as the tiny insect creates a multitude of illusory copies of itself that really deceive their pursuer. As a lover of biology, I had a decent understanding of the principles (tiger butterflies can feel the sounds that their predators use for echolocation and rotate the sound envelope for themselves), but without such exposure I would probably have been lost. A little argument, I thought. Surely they director us for a moment to fill. I waited in vain. <br /> <br /> As soon as our main character meets some of his comrades, we are interested in the most boring dialogue I have ever seen on television. Chinook, Shadeâ€™s childhood rival, begins to mock a miniature hero with the silliest lines I've ever seen on a show. I can understand the authors who do not produce Shakespeare, but one would think that they would have some social contact in their lives - of course, enough to make communication natural. Oh, how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> Voice acting, although not terrible, was hardly a vivid example of human achievement. "Oh shadow, you broke the law!" Shade's mother sighs empty. "You must come with me, young." grunts Frida, the withered elder of the Silver Wing Colony. The actors try, but it hardly matters at this stage, as the story becomes less and less attractive with every minute of the passage. <br /> <br /> Although each episode is devoted to the problem of the week, which is typical for most television series, comprehensive story arches permeate the saga, getting better and worse. While the main point of the story is Shade's reunion with his family, later episodes affect other story arches, including cannibal bats from the southern jungle and the imminent war between birds and animals. Script writers try to do too much at the same time, trying hard to squeeze as many promising ideas as possible in the hope that it will attract the interest of the audience enough to continue the bloody show. Unfortunately, these attempts are useless for everyone except the eight to ten years that this show is aimed at. <br /> <br /> While it is nice to see that Canadian media is perpetuated, it would be much nicer if the enjoyment of the series was not limited to the immediate family of animators or the chanting fans of Kenneth Oppel's books. Your children may look worse than Silverwing, but there are better programs. Go through mediocrity and read books instead.
