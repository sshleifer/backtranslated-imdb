Wow, this episode began on the premise of STOOOOOPID! "Enterprise" puffs when suddenly, Abraham Lincoln flies in space and welcomes "Enterprise" !!!!!!! Is it just me, or is it really a stupid idea ?! Lincoln climbs aboard and they greet them. Abe invites them to descend to some barren planet, where they meet other famous dead people - both good and evil. It seems that a truly audacious rock monster gathered a team of GOOD and EVIL people to fight for supremacy. It all seems really stupid and inherently unfair, since the GOOD side is burdened by a Surak - a Vulcan, which makes Gandhi look like Rambo !! Despite the absolutely terrible premise, the action is quite good, and it is great to see throws on top of the obvious doubles fighting this offense in this match. But do not take it for high art or deep science fiction. The bottom line is that the series was in the last stage as a series of the first launch, and it really looked as if they shook this turkey and shot it regardless of the absurdity of the premise.
