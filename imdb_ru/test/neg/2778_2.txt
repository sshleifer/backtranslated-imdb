Every time a dwarf or dwarf appears in a prominent role in a film, the probability that the director throws him is 10 to 1, because he didnâ€™t know what else to do to make the film interesting. In this case, the ostentatious little guy is not so bad - he manages to preserve his dignity in most of his scenes (except for the part where he drags the lead person down the dungeon stairs), but the film itself uses it as a little dog to chew on a toy. <br /> <br /> The problem that arises here is common for low-budget films about exploitation - there is an embryo of a worthy idea, but the director and screenwriter do not know how to develop it. A good director would take various elements of the story - brain transplants, crazy doctors with secret laboratories and a dungeon, car chases, fist fights, stupid monstrous assistant to Frankenstein's style, mind control, betrayal and conspiracy, etc. ... and did an exciting, including a movie full of cheap thrills and fun. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a group of people stumbling around and arguing in the doctor's lab, then a stupid operation in which the patient bleeds tempura paint, after which some of the same people stumble and argue. even in the doctor's lab, followed by another subgroup of the initial group, which goes and gets into an accident, followed by the escape scene from the dungeon, in which, mostly, the woman puts on shoes and then the chase on the roof (actual high point of the film), accompanied by an intricate series of events where everyone in the film apparently runs away from everyone else, followed by a wonderful walk in the countryside, where everyone either stalks, collides, attacks or runs away from everyone else AGAIN, followed, well, not much more. <br /> <br /> A terrible blonde with peroxide, dressed in white, well-understood heroic type, a pretty looking three-foot technician, a large piece of molten rubber glued to one side of his face, a child, is located here somewhere who wonders in the middle of the film to provide more "Frankenstein's factor", a brunette who seems to fall in love with the hero for no apparent reason, and the crazy doctor himself who should be the happiest man in the history of evil supervillains because nothing was going t according to his plan, but still everything turns out for him ... and all because he remembered how he stuck the electrode into the transplanted brain at some point in the operation, <br /> <br /> This was by no means the worst movie , which I have seen, or even the worst film about exploitation, which I have seen, or even the worst, poorly made film about exploitation, which I have seen, but it just lies there oozing cheapness and inattention to details at any point, and even among poor fans the movie is no real reason to watch it.
