If it was nominated for the WGA Screenwriter Award, the Professional Writers Association, then it’s time to hang up a word processor. Amazingly inept writing, directing, production at any level, even for a television movie. There is no cliché in this amazingly bad movie. What were they thinking about? Does anyone really believe that children are stupid enough to watch this?
