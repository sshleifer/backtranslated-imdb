Roots and horror, I was not surprised that this short show did not make it. I lovingly remember how "Tales from the Crypt" tried to use these banal episodes, as if they were really scary. Combined with bad acting and lousy music, I was surprised that this dirty show was intended. It never appeared again, and one can only be grateful for this circumstance.
