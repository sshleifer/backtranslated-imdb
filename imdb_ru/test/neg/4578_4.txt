This film defines the word "confused." All actors remain true to the script. More pity, because acting is good, but the script is a tangled mix of pseudo-psychoanalytic random ideas. The effect is slow and slow, and cinematography with soft focal lenses quickly acts on the nerves. I give it 4 out of 10.
