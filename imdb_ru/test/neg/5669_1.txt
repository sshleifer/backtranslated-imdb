If you think Hannah Montana or Lux Life is on the verge of a comedy series, then you've obviously never watched iCarly. No doubt iCarly is the worst show I have ever seen. From lifeless acting to low-budget performances, the show smells cheap, like Chinese food last week, left to boil in your overheated car. <br /> <br /> The show revolves around a cute, funny and “must be” funny girl named Carly when she and her friends broadcast live from a website called iCarly. Carly lives alone with her older brother, who seriously needs some advice or something else, because he has several cells smaller than his brain. <br /> <br /> The plots of the show are very ridiculous and unbearably annoying. But looking at Carly and her friend Sam, their little show iCarly inside the show, is even worse. They mostly show weird pictures and stuff things while the track of laughter plays over and over. I mean seriously, every two seconds the track of laughter seems to appear without a reason. <br /> <br /> So what's the point of this review? You can ask. Just making fun of iCarly? Well, yes, but I also warn you to beware of this show. Because seriously, if I had to choose between watching iCarly and Barney? No questions, I would choose Barney.
