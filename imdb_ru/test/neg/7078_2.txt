I saw the film yesterday and stopped it during the break because I felt it was a waste of time. The idea of ​​making a film through the eyes of the director — one of the “evil guys” in most science fiction and medieval films — is great and offers many possibilities, but ... the film could not catch any of them. I didn’t feel to any of the characters, the plot was too predictable (to the extent that I followed him), and the second time jump in the storyline made me go. Those who expect a deep understanding of the emotional situation of the headman in the Middle Ages, a social outcast of that time, may be disappointed.
