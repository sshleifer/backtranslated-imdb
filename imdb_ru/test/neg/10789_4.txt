I must admit that I am at a disadvantage here; when I learn more about the film from other reviewers than I watch it myself, then this is a problem. Although the plot of “The Man Who Knew Too Much” is usually simple, the film allows too many mysterious elements to interfere with what could be a satisfactory mystery. By the time we got to the place where the woman, who was witty, ascertained the secrecy of the “first stage of the sevenfold beam,” I did not know whether to laugh or rewind to see if I had missed something. <br /> <Looking back, the mysterious note taken out by Mr. Lawrence (Leslie Banks) from the shaving handle was a cleverly written message leading to a dentist named Barbor and, finally, in Albert Hall, a place, not a person as indicated by "A. Hall". But for all the intrigue, it was never clear why the murder target was eliminated. So Louis Bernard was killed because he knew about the plot to kill a diplomat named Rop, but why did Ropa become a target? If you think why the note was even written and secured with a shaving brush? Did Bernard have to refer to it from time to time to remind himself of what was going to happen? <br /> <br /> With its scattered scenes, “The Man Who Knew Too Much” is hard to follow, and he is a little disorienting, but I commend Alfred Hitchcock for these early efforts. In the future, I will have to watch some of his other works from the same epoch, although this film definitely cannot hold a candle over his later works, such as Psycho or North to the North-West.
