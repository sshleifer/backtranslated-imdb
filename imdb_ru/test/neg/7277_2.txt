the hills have eyes, this is not a very good movie, if you look at it with some kind of strained imagination. for one, the villains look almost normal, not at all as one would expect from crazy madmen. for the other, from time to time it goes very slowly, and there are many scenes. The characters are repeated. I mean that the film has a lot of filler, a lot of aimless running. The film did not have a clear direction. The plot of the film is hardly original, even for a time. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was released a few years earlier and is a much more effective film since horror of horrors. The film is not much scary, and the drowning soundtrack just served as annoying and distracting. Once. I believe that music was used to hide the fact that not much happens during most of the film, although it didn’t work for its intended purpose. I basically kept looking at the time every few seconds, hoping that something would happen or it would end. when something finally happened The film was destroyed by simple chaos and a loud noise. I watched it because I like to give the film a favor of doubt. Yes, there are some loud cries, and yes, people are dying, but who cares. Too slow If you can call it that. My buddy enjoyed it, so at least one of us got something from it. The hills have eyes, this is not the worst movie we could see, but I doubt I will watch it again. This film was remade in 2006, and I will also have an overview of this version. In any case, this film was painfully slow, while other times were chaotic and repetitive. If you don’t like to watch the paint dry, sometimes interspersed with someone running around your block, shouting your head, stay away from this movie. The best bet would be the original Texan chainsaw massacre (1973) 1.5 * out of 10 *, which is generous
