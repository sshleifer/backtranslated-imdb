This film is poorly written, difficult to understand, and shows bad performances and dialogues from leading Jason Patrick and Jennifer Jason Lee. The premise, believable, but weak (the agent under the cover of drugs is inferior to the criminal world of drugs) deserves better than this flop Lily Feeney Zanuck. The competent cast (Sam Elliott, William Sadler, etc.) turned out to be not enough to save this film. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film also contains the worst “love” scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the soundtrack is greatly overrated; in particular, disgusting, juicy, without substance, "Tears in Heaven" of the legendary Eric Clapton. <br /> <br /> “Rush” is completely unpleasant from start to finish. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
