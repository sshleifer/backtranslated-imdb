If they had a zero out of 10, I would have entered it. Anyone who participates in this film should be ashamed of the fact that they take money from the public. I do not know how such films produce Video or Pay Channel. I am disappointed in Vincent Gallo. Val Kilmer stayed there for about 8 minutes, so I can't get mad at him. Only the person who listed it to be a star in it. It's like Marlon Brando in Superman. There is no conspiracy other than Gallo, who searches for and finds his friend in the catacombs. Why they were looking for the gates of hell, only the director knows. They should have kept this film in Moscow and burned it on fire in order to warm all the homeless at night. There is nothing more to say about this film, which was written by all the other reviewers. I would like to forget this film, it hurts my brain.
