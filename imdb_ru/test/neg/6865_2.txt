I can not believe that I spend my time on comments, but this film is strangely bad. If 20 different directors were attracted to the filming of different parts of the film, with no idea of ​​the plot that other directors are shooting, this is largely the result I expect. <br /> <br /> I also think that some scenes were not spliced ​​together in order - it seems that things do not always evolve in order. The film behaves as if we already know about half the characters. <br /> <br /> And Steve Guttenberg is trying to film a maniacal comedy a la Robin Williams in this film. Ewww. And the very premise of appointing a former prisoner responsible for a group of children simply does not seem realistic in our time.
