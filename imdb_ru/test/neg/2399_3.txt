I am sure that the people who made this film think that they are doing something surprisingly politically correct, because they manage to criticize the US wars in Afghanistan and, in particular, in Iraq, suggesting that the United States is at war well, but not clean up later, therefore, sow the seeds for future trouble. In addition, they do this without making the Islamists an enemy and not making the Republicans enemies, since it is the Republicans who are in power and do it, supposedly, a great cause, destroying the USSR, secretly supplying the war in Afghanistan. <br /> <Now, seriously. we really want a film that repeatedly says "let's go, kill some Russians!" How is this the greatest thing that a red American can do? And should we consider this congressman charming because he surrounds himself with women with big hair and frank clothes? Even his supposedly intelligent assistant, who is always dressed professionally, continues to look at Charlie, as if he is simply the most wonderful, most handsome, best guy of all. As if she is Nancy Reagan of his Ronnie. Julia Roberts copes with her role perfectly, but mostly women are really humiliated in this film, and this is really annoying.
