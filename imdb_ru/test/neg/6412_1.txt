Destiny prompts Walter Sparrow to master a mysterious novel, which has terrible similarities and connections to his life, based on number 23. As the story unfolds in real life and fiction, Sparrow must find out his connection with the book. and how the story ends eventually. <br /> <br /> “Number 23” offers an intriguing premise that is destroyed by a weak execution. The film simply fell through on many different levels, which is pretty disappointing because there was a lot of potential in it. The script was probably the worst. It was filled with silly sequences and a ridiculous dialogue that only killed the mood of the film. It seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn’t know how to design it to stretch it for ninety minutes. In the second half of the film there were few ideas, the turn was pretty obvious, and the ending was awful. <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is in charge of one of the worst films in history, and he bought a bit from “The Telephone Booth” and several other films, but “Number 23” reminds me that he is still capable of bitch. He has a movie in style, but he just can't focus. He moves the film at an awkward and slow pace. He switches from reality to what is actually happening in a book that quickly became annoying. The real book in the movie called “Number 23” is a terrible detective story, and the public gets stuck listening to Kerry tell it, and I'm just bored to tears. When Kerry finally finished with the book, we got stuck watching him running, trying to solve the mystery. At the moment, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We look forward to the film reaching a terrible end and flimsy explanations before celebrating that the film is finally over. <br /> <br /> The acting was mostly average and rather memorable. Jim Carrey clearly just moaned during his speech, and he did not even try. In some scenes, he was either completely overloaded, or simply very wooden. His narration was a complete bore to listen, and he did not put life into his character. Virginia Madsen did everything possible with a limited role, but she needs to choose the best scenarios. Logan Lerman was pretty soft, like Danny Houston. Overall, “Number 23” was a terrible thriller that offered more laughter than expectations or thrills. Rating 3/10
