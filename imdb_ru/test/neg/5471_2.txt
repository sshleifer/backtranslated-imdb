How can you go wrong with a film that combines the refinement of Peter Cushing, the determination of Donald Placensen and the bust of Luan Peters? Calmly, you give them a terrible script for work. <br /> <br /> Peter Cushing, in an evil role, leads a satanic cult that captured a couple of friends of Donald Pleasant. Donald plays a determined but alienated priest who wants to find his friends, but needs the help of Fred from Scooby-Doo to find them. He calls for help from the New York Bloodhound, who dresses like a cartoon hero in his assignment. Meanwhile, a friend of one of the missing, Luan Peters, joins the search. If all this sounds interesting, then you, like me, were deceived. <br /> <br /> The trio didn't take long to sniff out baddies, but their methods of bringing the bad guys to justice are stupid. In addition, women will consider it a shit. Every time they follow the trail of the bad guys, our two male heroes tell Luana to stay at the hotel, although she does better than the squeamish priest played by Pleasence. <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (the script really brings us. No tension is established. There is no decent dialogue with the stars, and you will need both hands to calculate how many times Luan Peters is told to stay and let the men work as men. If you are interested in seeing the minotaur on film not worth it. We get a statue of a minotaur who spews flames. VIOLENCE: $$ (There are some attacks and a few victims, but those of you who drool because blood will disappointed). <br /> <br /> OPERATING: $$ (Despite the fact that in this film eats There are three of my favorite actors, there is nothing that can be exchanged. Peter Cushing has not much time on screen, Donald Listening clearly realizes that he is on the set, and Luan Peters is not used as intended. It should have been much better given the talent, but again, J. nkees loses the game here and there too. <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $ (Loan Peters takes a bath, but you see almost nothing. She is not so mandatory here, as in the "Show of flesh and blood").
