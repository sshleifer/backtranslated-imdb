I am amazed who loves this movie. I never leave the cinema, but my friend had to physically prevent me from leaving the theater during this insulting disaster. white symbols are holy, and Asian symbols are practically absent and useless for history. they exist only as objects, wonder. characters of other races live much better. turns were ludicrous and predictable. but if you are reading this, you already know it. Paul Haggis is a hack. Hollywood can't even make multicultural films right. do yourself a favor and watch the more honest attitude to races, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle!
