This film succeeded at the box office, and the producers of this mess thought that the stars had such good chemistry that they threw them into a much darker farce with a baseball, “Arbor”. Honestly, I am shocked to see all the positive comments on this ridiculously prepared funny comedy. Both protagonists have a seven-year maturity and are much less interesting for spending time. Veteran support, including Fred Clark, Harry Morgan and Eva Gabor, provides excellent support. And, thanks to the beautiful cinema, the rich countryside of Spain seems lush. And there are four or five really funny scenes with two wise scenes and a whole bunch of recycled and unfunny mess. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend "It starts with a kiss."
