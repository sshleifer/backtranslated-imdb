What gives Anthony Minghella the right to destroy two unusual works of art? At first he destroyed the “English patient”, which was bad enough, but now I found that he had slaughtered the “Cold Mountain” - had killed it !!! <br /> <br /> I had such a strange reaction to the "English patient." My son and I went to see him on the first weekend, when he was released, and I was very disappointed, but I told my son that I felt I needed to read a book. I went straight to Barnes and Noble, bought it, read it and tried to find out what the critics are saying in the world when they say that Minghella trusted the intellectual public enough to give them a great movie. This is something that he definitely did not do. <br /> <br /> Usually I don’t read a lot of fiction, but my friends recommended the “Cold Mountain” so much that I had to read it. I did not see the movie “Cold Mountain” when it was shown in cinemas, and this was due to what Minghella did with the English patient. But, like a fool, I rented it today, and I was so upset, I had to pour out my disappointment and, most importantly, my sadness that someone could take this beautiful story and turn it into something almost as beautiful on the screen, and now they will never be. <br /> <br /> READ A BOOK AND GIVE A ROT FILM ON A SHELF. I will never again be involved in the Minghella project. I think he may be one of the worst directors working today, and I'm tired of the praise of Hollywood on his head. Nobody in Hollywood must be reading anymore. This film has no resemblance to the book, except for the names of the characters. Minghella's ego should not know boundaries, and if he does not like the book, then why did not he write the original script and did not leave the book alone. Even if I had not read the book, I would still consider this film one of the worst ones that I saw in 2003; and I saw almost everything that was released for viewing in the USA. <br /> <br /> Elaine, you won't like it either.
