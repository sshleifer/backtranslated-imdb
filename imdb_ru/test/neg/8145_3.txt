Two years after this short film, the last short film, Our Gang, was released. Seeing this, you wonder how it lasted much longer. The quality of Our Gang has deteriorated sharply since the transition from Hal Roach to MGM, and this short example is a great example. All these jokes are very funny, and the last line of Froggy, that this is the happiest day of his life, paints in your memory a bad picture of how he looks for him the rest of the time. A very bad example of making a movie.
