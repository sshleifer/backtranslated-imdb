well, this movie could be good if it had a plot. the name did not even fit after the first ten minutes. the wind had nothing to do with the rest of the film. Acting was below normal, and the letter reminded me of something you read in a children's book of horror stories. <br /> <br /> As for horror films, they should not even be classified as one. it was a shame for horror fans and thrillers everywhere. I hate to be so abrupt, but I felt like I wanted the time I spent watching this movie. I hope that there will be no continuation of this. This film must be locked in storage and never be disclosed for viewing.
