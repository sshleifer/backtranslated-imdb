If you have ever listened to any of the James Lee Burke books on tape or CD, and the reader was Will Patton, you can agree with me that Will is the epitome of Dave R. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones is a native Texan (or so I heard), and no one portrays a Texan better IMHO, but he is not a Cajun. Its delivery is all wrong. I lived in the state for several years, and I still hear the strange pato that contains the Louisiana accent. TLJ has nothing like that. <br /> <br /> I thought Marry Steenbergen was a good choice for Bootsy, but I missed Cletus (who will play this role? Rock? Mickey Rourke? Anyone, he must be big). <br /> <br /> In general, I thought that the film was only 4 - the plot flopped like a fish out of water, and it had nothing interesting, but not Linear continuity, as a rule, in a book. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, Hollywood will try another JLB book, The Last Car on the Champs Elysees. We will see the best villains from JLB.
