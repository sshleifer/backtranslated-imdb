I entered this film with an open heart. I was too lazy to go to the video store to choose a movie, and my friend came back with it. I promised him that I would not laugh at his choice, but during the first five minutes I told him that I would have to withdraw my promise. We kept on watching, just hoping it would get better, but no; followed by constant rape. <br /> <br /> This “movie” was probably one of the worst movies ever made, and certainly deserves a spot on the 100th day of IMDb. distributed. The lighting was bad. I saw the best way to play primary school games. In fact, nothing positive about this.
