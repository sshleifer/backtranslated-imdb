actors cannot act. all dialaga suffered from bad accents and loss of character. Channing Tatum never moves his lips and does not change the facial expression ... EVER. <br /> <br /> This story is nothing new. Some kid from the street is involved in the professional world of dance, and this turns his life around. that combined with the entire incident involving a small child were taken directly from the film “You Received the Ministry and Save the Last Dance” (I don’t say that these films were good too, but this means that this film did not bring anything new to the table). <br /> <br /> and dancing ... ONLY 3 DANCE SEQUENCES IN ALL FILMS AND 2 THERE ARE RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM COMMERCIAL. I may be overly critical because I am a dancer, but perhaps this is what needs to be heard. Channing Tatum is NOT a bi-boy. his little solo in the parking lot had little style, technique, or some amazing factors that are all part of the criteria for street dancers. All the jazz and ballet in the film had nothing but bad technique and a few acceptable spins, but no more. The grand finale made me think: “Well, now they will become serious” to the very end, when I realized that this would never happen. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am of course difficult to make a good dance film, but “Step Forward” is not an exception to the rule. You Got Served, with the exception of its inconsistency with the culture of street dance, at least has a dance aspect. “Save the last dance” - rubbish, like any other musical over the past 10 years (although I was impressed by Moulin Rouge) ... look at the stage for ballet, look at Beat Street for hip-hop
