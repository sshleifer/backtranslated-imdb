Really impressive eyesight, and some hot chicks with swords are flying, oh, and these hypnotic Chinese violins too ... Let me think: “Crouching tiger, hidden dragon”? <br /> <br /> I somehow liked the CTHD practical simplicity and well-developed characters that still leave enough space for you to enjoy the vision without thinking about the DEEEPAA meaning of it. <br /> <br /> “Hero”, on the other hand, is painfully pretentious and demanding, both visually and conceptually. Morality beyond life was terrible. I mean, sacrifice your life, sacrifice your convictions, sacrifice your love so that your mighty people can succeed ???? WTF ?? <br /> <br /> No thanks. <br /> <br /> But, Hay, Mao, and GVB would be proud! <br /> <br /> Viva
