This show is a pity. I can not even imagine how someone with an IQ larger than that of a can of pea soup that has expired can readily sit in that garbage for half an hour. This is one of those rare shows that are so terrible in all respects that you can honestly say that you are less intelligent just watching it. I did a study and found that the average person loses 10 IQ points for every fifteen seconds they watch this show. This is the second place after another abortion in the Comedy Network, Popcultured (19,863,221 IQ points per second lost) and, to a large extent, the connection with Girls Will Be Girls. The keys to the VIP should apologize to each of us. Whenever I watch this parody of the show, Iâ€™m sad about the company. How can I continue?
