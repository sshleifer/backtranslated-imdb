I was a fan of the film “American Werewolf in London,” and I was curious if it could be continued 16 years later with the French language and local characters, supporting and minor characters. Tonight I looked at the “edited for the FOX Network” version, which was a kind of curious hybrid of several hyperactive sequels. Writers and directors pay tribute to some of the key concepts of the plot: a tourist gets a wolf bite, a full moon appears, a boy meets a girl, a boy becomes a beast, a boy dies a heroic death after the help of a ghost victim. For me, the strangest aspect of this “formula” trip with the effect of teenage horror was the manifestation of the school teacher’s love relationship to the television comedy “ED” as one of the ignorant victims of the werewolf, who more or less absolutely did not sympathize with the Scenarios. I did not see another horror that this film is a “sequel” (a film about fighting vampires called “BLADE”), but I think that parts of the plot should explain how the werewolf villains (they fake) threaten “goodness” a pair of werewolves during the long part of the film. There is also the last conflict in the Paris metro, a la SPEED. This 1997 studio product is a strange hybrid of the film, since for terrible purposes significant technical effects are shown, but, in my opinion, the original horrors of the original have been completely undermined. A strange rewriting of the legend about the werewolf and the "cinema mythology"!?! My suggestion for those who view this in the video store is instead go for the classic thriller "Top of the Line": Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO!
