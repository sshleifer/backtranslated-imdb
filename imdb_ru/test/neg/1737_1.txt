Worst.film.ever Nothing more to say. Aaron Carter pushes him completely away, and the rest of the actors should immediately fire their agents. This is really a terrible horrible movie from start to finish. I would like to be more eloquent in describing many (oh) shortcomings in films, however I cannot be worried / too angry to make the right sentences. <br /> <br /> In short, I absolutely hated everything about this film, and not in the spirit of “so bad, it's good” ... <br /> <br /> It was a real drift. <br /> /> Gavin
