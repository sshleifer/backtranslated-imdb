Absolutely insane fighter made in the Philippines. This refers to the regime of Filipino films that tried to show themselves as American films on the international market. After a rather boring start, the film takes off and never again disappoints. This is actually the plagiarism of the worst films ever made by Chuck Norris: a Soviet prisoner is brainwashed by an American prisoner who inserts a microchip into his brain, so he is programmed to kill the Pope and then the US President. One of his old buddies (played by the persistent B-movie hero Max Thayer) is sent to stop him. Absolutely ridiculous fighting scenes, a putrid game (the performance of Nick Nicholson as an evil Soviet commander is a must see!) And the implausible plot is one of the funniest action films ever given to the general public.
