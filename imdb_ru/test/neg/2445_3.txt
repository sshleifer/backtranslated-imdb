Genre: a short cartoon without dialogue, an African girl and a lion. <br /> <br /> Main characters: Inca, lion and bird mines. <br /> <br /> What is happening: the lion wants to eat an African girl named Inca. There is also the rather tangled Mina bird. Is he on the Inca or is the lion side ...? <br /> <br /> Message: Erm? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I agree with Lee Eisenberg, this is pretty bad for poor Africans !! :-( I like the main character, the Inca (African girl), the pretty good main character, but they still portray her rudely and make the young people not really love her just because she WANTING !! GRUNR CHARLES M. JONES! ! I donâ€™t really like a lion, and I think that the bird of mine is ALL RIGHTS (I guess). Personally, I prefer the Charles M. Jones cartoons "Looney Tunes" in the future. <br /> <br /> this, then I recommend the YouTube website. Just type "Inki" in the box on the main page and you are there. <br /> <br /> I would like Charles M. Jones to be Beyond the Inca in this short. So there. <br /> <br /> Recommended: to people who are interested in old cartoons and / or to people who are just lounging on You Tube.
