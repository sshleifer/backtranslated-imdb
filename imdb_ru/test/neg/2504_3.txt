One of the few films shot at Coronado High School in Scottsdale, Arizona, in the late 80s, as well as Just One of the Guys, Bill and Ted's Great Adventure, and Just Perfect (this was a segmented movie played during Mickey Mouse Club time.) definitely for children, as in previous comments it was correct. <br /> <br /> Over the past couple of years, Coronado has gone through a major overhaul, and many of the buildings shown in this film have now disappeared. The field where they play the catch is adjacent to the football field, one of the few areas that are still there. Interior scenes around the lockers, which I suppose were in an old building of 200. <br /> <br /> If he doesnâ€™t play on Disney Channel late at night, it can be very difficult to find a movie. How they ever kept it up is beyond my power.
