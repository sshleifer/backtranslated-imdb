If I didn’t know anything better, I would have thought that the Resurrection took place in the late 80s / early 90s, when shit was sold as a Hollywood film. <br /> <br /> I don’t understand why people like Christopher Lambert. He speaks as if he reads hint cards and turns into a fountain when he has to show emotions. He was easily the weakest aspect of the film. With the other actors, everything was fine, no big deal. <br /> <br /> It’s easy to see where most of the budget has gone: special effects. The killings look pretty professional, but are unlikely to compensate for the dullness of the film. <br /> <br /> I would not say that "Resurrection" is an exact copy of Se7en, but, of course, has a certain similarity with it. When focusing on a religious killer in a modern crusade, detectives investigating his work must rely on biblical passages and Christian history to put together a killer riddle. Resurrection, however, is devoid of clever Se7en story-telling, cinematography, acting ... well, everything that makes it good. Instead, the Resurrection lies to the audience and uses the Scooby-Doo mystery method to surprise him. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the Resurrection was just as awful as I expected. I almost feel bad because I criticize this film because I knew it would be bad, but ... sue me.
