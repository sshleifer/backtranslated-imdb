I really thought it would be a good movie, boy ... I was wrong! For a quick summary: B class acting skills C class special effects D class for the entire film. Don't get me wrong, the story was pretty good and not funny, so the adult also skates with her, the “hero” looks good, so most women will like it :-), and not a full cast of chicks, because it contains some fighting scenes and a little blood <br /> <br /> but the way it was shot ... terrible <br /> <br /> special effects-> better suited for TV-> in the children's show <br /> <br /> and finally ... send some actors back to acting school if they ever attended classes there. <br /> <br /> Believe me, there are much better ways to spend 2 hours. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
