Plunkett and Macklin are two thieves who rob the rich to give ... well, rich; comparatively, they are rich. But we know they are good guys, because the guy behind the forces of law and order, Mr. Chance, is just so angry. He rapes women - or tries. He beats his subordinates. He commits murder. He has bad breath. He does not shave properly. He has no point in fashion. He torments puppies. This last one is just my conclusion: we do not really see that he is torturing puppies. But I'm sure he does. The villainy of Little Chance is largely due to his pursuit of Plunkett and Macklin. It's just what he does in his free time, a kind of hobby that he takes to be absolutely sure that we don’t like him. He didn't need to try so hard. No one in this movie is cute. <br /> <br /> Let's summarize. Attractive characters? There is not one: I think we considered this. Removed? Do not blow. Instead, we have some kind of dirty breathing. Dash? Spark? Vigor? I'm afraid everything went wrong. Realism? None of this either. I think they TRIED for realism, since everyone was so dirty, but the characters and actions had all the credibility of Errol Flynn — without a feeling of delight to support them. Beauty? Nope Does a great camera work? For the crew, maybe. Humor? You can giggle once or twice if you are in a good mood. Again, you can not. Dialogue? See "humor" above. Music? Don't even get me to music. The music in Ladyhawk, for comparison, was unusually successful; and at least the erroneous aesthetics of this score was consistent. <br /> <br /> Ugh. I apologize to Ladyhawk for THINKING about it in this context. <br /> <br /> To summarize: there are a lot of positive things and nothing is CHEAP - except for Liv Tyler, which I can't remember doing. <br /> <br /> I think I just wrote a review of smallpox. “Not very good,” says the review. It would be much more interesting if I could somehow PROTECT smallpox, say that smallpox critics misunderstood everything - but I don’t know how I would do that.
