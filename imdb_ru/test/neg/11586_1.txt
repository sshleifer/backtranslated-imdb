I just caught it on Showtime ... not even a joke in a bad movie. One of the loudest flicks of monsters I've ever seen. Plus, the television reporter in the film was that annoying Jerry from last season of The Survivor. The only funny thing was that the “secret base” was a home from Fantasy Island (and a million other films and television shows; the place is in the LA area). I fully expected that Mr. Roarke and Tatu would come out and greet the visitors. If Tatu ate a snake, I could give this film 2, but oh well. Watching the people who stand there shout for five minutes, while Komodo or the cobra hang over them instead of running, because it was pretty funny, especially because you could really say that they simply shouted in an empty place where computer animators would later draw in a monster. However, I almost fell off the chair when in the scene with memories they brought either a cobra or a chest of drawers - then of normal size - in some indestructible solid steel container with air holes drilled in it. Wouldn't a cage be enough? LOL! I think they could not afford to rent a real komodo and cobra. I have to remember that I shoot Showtime for their series, not for their films.
