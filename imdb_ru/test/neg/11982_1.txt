Barely gone through the whole movie ... Act bad, the dialogue is even worse. I felt like a st00pid 4, I watched it, but it was named the same as one of my favorite games, so I struggled with the trough. They even screwed up the sound. In some parts of the movie, the background music is so loud that I had to turn down the volume. It would be great if it was a competition about who can spoil more. <br /> <br /> Yes, and PS: I don’t know what this guy “Uwe” is capable of ... I certainly don’t think that this film is bad just because he is a director. I checked the list of his works, and this is his first (and probably the last) creation that I saw. <br /> <br /> again and again.
