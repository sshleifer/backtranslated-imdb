I am usually quite tolerant of films and amuse myself very easily, however this film was terribly disappointing. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie after I saw on the cover that it was William Zabka (The Bad Boy of The Karate Kid) and during this movie I saw that this would be the only reason. <br /> <br /> This film is a huge waste of acting talent. The music and the sound are terribly sticky - I could not believe it from a movie filmed in the 90s! <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this film if you are not interested in one of the actors.
