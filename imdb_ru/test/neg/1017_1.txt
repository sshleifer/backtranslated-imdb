Directed by Fabio Barreto, he received the weird Academy Nomination for his latest film, Quatrilho. Quatrilho is a bad movie, but Bella Donna Barreto starred in one of the worst films of all time. His adaptation of the novel Riacho Doce is ridiculous. Think with me how poor Brazilian fishermen speak perfect English? In the film, they do. There is no script here, this is just a very long video with beautiful places and lots of sex scenes with Moskvich and Henstridge.
