“Days of Heaven” is one of the most painfully boring and meaningless films I've ever seen. In no case, neither in form nor in form, I would not recommend it to anyone ... unless you are trying to put your children to sleep or, God forbid, give someone aneurysm. If I could go back in time and do one thing, I would set the drums on fire before they were sent to the cinema. What for? The plot of the Days of Heaven is simple, but extremely vague. Long sequences devoid of dialogue make up the bulk of the film. Characters are too small and ridiculously stupid to communicate with them. The climax of the story does not touch you: by this time your brain worked so hard to figure out the plot and the array of hidden metaphors that your ability to think has disappeared. Only your eyes work and, unfortunately, your ears, which should listen to the sound of Linda, the little girl in the story who speaks like a man. I'm dumber now watching this movie. Do not let this happen to you.
