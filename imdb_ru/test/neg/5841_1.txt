Obviously, some agents did not see any signs of the dollar when they signed their 117-minute * damage * to the courtesan complex to their clients. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film could be fine if $ 1 million were left of it. Seriously. The number of checks is irrelevant, prostitution is still prostitution, and no "love conquers all" cannot change the fact that no marriage vows ever meant "for the richer for the poorer, for pimping, as in faithfulness." Imagine a story differently, though: 2 children, broken, borderline "desperate" and completely stupid. They are faced with a rich businessman. Child marriage is strained due to imperfect times and the fact that the husband is a bit of a loser. Enter Mr. Tuxedo, exuding charm and stability - a virtual magnet for a ticking biological clock - and with it his wife's temptation, tension, suspense. Who will she choose? Perhaps, in these conditions, I would not care. Frankly, the selfish and manipulative playboy Redford gets a sympathetic character. A woman who sells herself is about what a guy deserves who will drive out his wife. Indecent judgment makes a husband a FULL loser, deprived of all positive male qualities, and turns his wife into a cheap pipe, seduced by money, and not mixed with other potential love, a woman deprived of moral center and self-esteem. <br /> <br /> All the impressive talent (acting, directing, cinematography) was wasted on this film - and that was an impressive amount - could not save him from his cumbersome, but too crappy, million-dollar line. If I see this turkey in another bridal soul, I'll bake it! (Or maybe cross it with Titanic and send the ribbon to the ocean!)
