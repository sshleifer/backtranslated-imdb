A sprawling, overly ambitious, plotless comedy with no drama center. It was probably assumed that he would have an epic vision and a surrealistic flair (at least in some episodes), but individual stories never turn into a meaningful whole, but there is little laughter and they are far from each other. Although a fun ending. (* 1/2)
