Acting in this film was old school: trite and tough. Irene Dunn shines and looks better, although she has some very unnatural features. However, her ability to transmit emotions is manifested. <br /> <br /> Fans of old films will find at least some redeeming qualities in this film thanks to the observation of cinematic techniques of the 1930s. Otherwise it is not worth it.
