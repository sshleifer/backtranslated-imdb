For many months I was looking forward to this release. The previews looked good, the early posts on the web were encouraging, and Golden Eye and Timesplitters were great shooters (the same people). It turns out I was greatly mistaken! Haze had the potential to be there with Call of Duty 4 and other next-generation shooters, however it looks, plays and feels like something about 5 years ago. I played Haze on 1080p TV and was initially disappointed that game developers limited the graphics to 720. The Haze universe lacks detail and atmosphere, the feeling “they were in a hurry to finish it” is always present. > <br /> The controls are sluggish and bulky, and I have yet to find an adjustment for the sensitivity of the x / y axis. There are many parts of a single player that are very dark (visually), to such an extent that you cannot see where you are going. Why not add a torch function like in Halo? or even better night vision? The use of the drug "nectar", which increases efficiency, is interesting, however, as soon as you get used to it, you switch to the other side and no longer use it! Why bother? I could continue with many other flaws in the Haze, but instead I’ll just say no! Wait for killzone 2 or play Call of Duty 4 and try to unlock the golden AK!
