Lame plagiarism of ANXIENT CRITERIS (1955): the first half is deadly boring, even dreary - but the latter stages are significantly improved with scenes involving the frantic “monster”. In the accompanying collection of art (a rather dry novel in 9 minutes compared to those created for other titles in the Criterion's Monsters and Madmen), director Dey admits that he was not a fan of science fiction. the genre is trying to justify the film’s shortcomings by saying that it had a zero budget to work (where all the space scenes were made up of videotapes!) ... and I would be inclined to be more lenient with the film that I didn’t watch CALTIKI recently IMMORTAL MONSTER (1959) - a similar (and equally worn), but much more stylish enterprise from Italy! <br /> <br /> Bill Edwards, as a defiant but unhappy astronaut who is obsessed with achieving title talent, is initially bored, but in the end he manages to win the sympathy of the audience when his physical features are distorted, and the character develops a taste for blood ! Marshall Thompson, his commander and older brother - OK like the skinny type of Glenn Ford; he previously starred in FENDE WITHOUT PERSON (1958), another (and more successful) science fiction by Richard Gordon, which, by the way, is also available on DVD via Criterion. Italian starlet Marla Landi, who is struggling with the English language, makes the female role inadequate; even entering it into the Featurette turns out to be a little durable! <br /> <br /> Audio commentary is another pleasant track by Tom Weaver / Richard Gordon, which, among other things, presents the fact that FIRST MAN INTO SPACE was conceived as a dual function with CORRIDORS OF BLOOD (1958). up - but it was eventually released as a separate release to take advantage of the current news value of the current space race; it is also mentioned that the dialogue with the monsters was actually dubbed Bonar Colleano (who, unfortunately, died in a traffic accident before the movie was released!). Weaver even recalls a couple of anecdotes from the time when he was involved in creating a DVD-film shot by all people, former cult director Norman J. Warren: Landi, who by then had become the title lady, was still ready to help transport the equipment needed to record interviews on several flights of stairs!; Edwards was supposed to have contributed to this function, but, once in London, he did not want to cooperate with Weaver - after all, the latter learned that the actor had recently been diagnosed with cancer, and, in fact, he died in 2002!
