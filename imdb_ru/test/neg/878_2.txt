This is one of the most unromantic films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Casting: Richard Gere is already too old, looking for romantic main roles. Diana looks a little eager to please and frowns, as usual, but the romance itself seems unconvincing to her. The auxiliary cast is not too memorable. <br /> <br /> History: the medical drama with which he has to deal is unconvincing and uninteresting. The story is weak - it happens, not enough to make a film about. There is nothing new or new way to say it. <br /> <br /> The setting is a bit gloomy, and the house is not attractive. <br /> <br /> NOT destined to be great to remember.
