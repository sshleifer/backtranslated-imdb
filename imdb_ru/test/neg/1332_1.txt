Wow, let's talk about the terrible. Do not waste time. I wish I first saw the other comments. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, I did not watch it all. It was too terrible. The worst, safest dialogue ... I could go on and on. But what really made it invisible was the guide. Poor actors. You cannot even tell if they have any talent, because they have not only pathetic lines to speak, but the director has not given them any action. If you watch the film director on this site, you will understand why this film had no chance. <br /> <br /> This would not even be the case for television films. <br /> <br /> Oh!
