Much has been done about the theft of Carlos Mencia (Mr. Holness, sorry) of the material of other comics. Heck, even before Joe Rogan fought on stage, I knew that Carlos Mensteal stole stuff from Cosby, Kinison and many others. <br /> <br /> In order to compose the crime of his theft, he retold the Joking Geniuses of jokes BAD. <br /> <br /> And this crime he continues to perpetuate in this show. I am sure that the authors of the series should share some of the blame - it must be difficult to write jokes day after day ... but this is why people get paid for it so much! The authors of these series should return to their daily work of throwing up hamburgers or what they did before they decided to start a career of intellectual theft. <br /> <br /> Not to say that he steals all his stuff. You can tell when he himself invented a joke, when what you are watching goes beyond the horrible and goes straight into the terribly bad territory. <br /> <br /> Because he likes to call people b *** h on his show for ten years called him a genius. They will grow up the other day, Carlos, and when they do, you will dry out and be blown away.
