The greedy earth baron in the tiny western city of Prairie City wants all the ranchers to leave their land, using scare tactics and arson to make them free; it seems that the city is full of oil, and when the Swedish farmer refuses to leave, the baron’s hired pistol mows him down. Soon the son of the farmer-navigator arrives, slowly realizing what he is facing, and is trying to rally the rest of the inhabitants to fight. Another story about lawlessness in the West, where everything is under the thumb of the villain (who, of course, holds all the cards). Derivatives and inconvenient at times to watch, with a long wait, before our stoic hero finally raises his anger. Stirling Hayden's hesitant Swedish accent is a big problem, although he highlights a strong, sympathetic presence on the screen and almost makes the picture worth seeing. Directed by Joseph H. Lewis puts most of the scenes tough, like a television western, and Gerald Fried’s heavy score will not help, although Ray Rennahan’s rich black and white cinematography is gorgeous. Independent production, released through United Artists, the film has a strange beginning (starting with pictures from the final, followed by footage from the middle of the film), but at the same time it has a certain piercing power that certainly attracts the viewer on Heiden's side. ** from ****
