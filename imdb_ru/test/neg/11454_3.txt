Like many films of early sounds, Cimarron should be regarded more as a historical interest, and not as an irresistible entertainment. Hammie, starring Richard Dix, nominated for the title of best actor, can be justified as a relic of the acting school of silent cinema. However, even giving the advantages of doubt, Cimarron is a poor-form dramatic play — a bloated film that moves from an unrelated sequence to an unrelated sequence with a small dramatic impact. Officially, the film takes two hours and four minutes; it seems like four o'clock when you watch this. There is no reason to spend your time on this if you don’t want to see each winner in the “Best Photo” nomination or take a keen interest in the first days. In my opinion, Cimarron is the worst choice for the best picture in the history of the Academy, and the award was to be given to City Lights or Little Ceasar. Simarron is hardly remembered today, and they would have remembered it at all if it were not for its victory at the Oscars.
