It is incredible how a film can take so much time and effort and yet prove disgusting. For those of you who appreciate the painstaking special effects and unbelievable details in each frame, you will watch this movie with awe. Just because Predator Island contains none of this. This is a redundant remake of every monster horror movie over the past two decades. Now I appreciate bad horror movies, they have a certain flash of humor in the most dramatic circumstances. However, if your goal is to create an unforgettable job that will thus end up in the Hall of Fame of Cults, then my first offer is to find fantasy / creativity and get talent. Yes, and a few more bucks to insert into your photo. <br /> <br /> One of the traditions of horror films is to shock viewers with violent death and bloodshed. However, shock does not last more than a few seconds. To really cause a satisfactory response from the paying crowd, you need to develop characters, some characteristic features. I know, you probably say that this guy does not give anything clever to the directors, he just makes an amateur remark. Well, that shows how lovers these directors are. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I had to watch this whole film, it was a silver lining. Dan Gordon's performance as Chris is great. He is not given to work in the script, but he can come out of this film as a star. Of all the actors, he is the only one who believes in what he reads. It not only provides viewers with someone we can identify with, but we also have someone we look forward to so we can go through the whole movie. Gordon shows genuine talent and ability to cope with quality work and overcome the huge obstacles that other actors are. Dan Gordon will be a star, I hope, sooner rather than later. That is, can he get away from such films that will deter him.
