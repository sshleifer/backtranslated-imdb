Pretty soft horror movie; If not for a couple of sex scenes, it could be a television movie. There are many holes in conspiracies (one example: why do we need a secret passage from the 18th century, leading from the top floor of a house that was burned to the ground, and a new building built 200 years later?), Cardboard, characters who do things like who would have an IQ larger than their shoe size, wouldnâ€™t cope ... <br /> <br /> He has some funny moments, but overall this is a low-quality film that managed to get Roy Shader because his accounts in connection. If you are looking for an extremely formal, predictable film that may bring some laughter, it is probably worth a look. If not, this one is not for you.
