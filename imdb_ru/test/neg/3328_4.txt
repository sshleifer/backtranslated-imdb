I want to say that I liked this film, really, but when it came down to it, it was too boring. Everything looks promising, and even when they fall into the mines, the eerie atmosphere and mood are excellent. The problem is the monster or its absence. As already said, this is a monster that stops, but this is not a problem (a stop can look great if everything is done correctly). The problem is that we don’t see enough of it, and we don’t see any deaths. It must be a horror movie, so the absence of a monster and deaths is tantamount to boredom. There were several scenes that I liked, for example, when one girl uses her camera in the dark and the monster approaches her. There are also several other creepy scenes, but they are too few to interest you, and definitely not worth watching a movie. It's a shame, because I see that if it were processed correctly, it would be a really creepy horror movie. The saddest thing is that such films will never be shot again, because these days the filmmakers are over-polishing their films and relying on the CGI crappy effects.
