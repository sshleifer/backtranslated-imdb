First, good things: I agree with another viewer who said that Gene Raymond has a wonderful drunken scene. He does - I was tickled to finally get the opportunity to laugh. And there were other moments that seemed funny to me - Raymond's parents in the bathroom with faulty plumbing and a scene in a restaurant with Robert Montgomery, who was trying to make Carol Lombard jealous, saying sweet words to a stranger. <br /> <br /> But overall I was alarmed. I love Carol Lombard and most of Hitchcock. And I understand the restrictions imposed on production by the Hayes Code. But it was awkward and awful to watch. Of course, I knew that they would be together, after all, this is a romantic comedy. But it did not make sense, it happened too quickly. In addition, I can not believe in the love of professions when faced with such harmful behavior, both physical and confrontational.
