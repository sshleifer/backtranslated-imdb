Carlos Mencia is not funny. Carlos Mencia is not the funniest of his special offers and the train derailment from the television series. For two years, I tried to convince people that he was stealing other comedian's jokes, and as for his comedic material, he is an ordinary “Johnny-come recently” with much less results than just unsatisfactory. Psycho astronaut joking? Britney spears nervous jokes? I hope that this is just a planning mistake, but let's find out that Carlos and Comedy Central, these themes and many others, defined the range of opening monologues of the leading night shows, Saturday Night Live, Mad TV and many, many others. Spark ethnic and racial stereotypes? The comedy has no chance to develop with Carlos Mencia. Perhaps people, especially the spectators and leaders of Comedy Central, will understand this after this week New York magazine definitely named him: "Carlos Mencia, an unrepentant joker."
