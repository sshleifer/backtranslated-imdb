The cast and crew of this cheap horror movie are more interesting than everything that happens in the movie itself; We have Barbara Payton, Raymond Barr, Lon Cheney, Jr., Tom Conway, Paul Cavanaugh and Woody Strode in front of the camera and writer-director Kurt Siodmak, filmmaker Charles Van Anger, editor-in-chief Francis D. Lyon and production assistant Herman Cohen for This. The hapless Payton turns her head to almost every man she comes into contact in the depths of the African jungle, where she lives on the plantation of her husband Cavanaugh: Dr. Conway secretly wants her, while Burr’s brigadier’s hot head is approaching, literally, more hands. on. On the other hand, Cheney is (surprisingly) a laid-back but knowledgeable authoritarian figure, while Strode is a local police official. The plot is very simple, but, frankly, it does not make much sense: after a particularly excited dinner with a thunderstorm Burr and Kavano (art, imitating life, about this a bit later) fought in the garden because of his affection for Payton and, which is convenient for Berra , the big snake just crawls near the place where Kavano falls to the ground! Witness of the event from behind the bushes, the mysterious maid Payton (no less a native witch) for some inexplicable reason curses Berra (who in the meantime married Payton), who periodically turns him into a gorilla ... from his very wedding day (when he the hand turns briefly) Consequently, Barr takes to lose himself in the jungle all day ?? even if the monkey creature itself is barely noticeable throughout the entire movie. It must be said, however, that the version I was watching worked for only 56 minutes, when the “official” length in another place is given as 66, 70 or 76 !! Thus, for obvious reasons, the film seems to be in a hurry and disunited, though not less than just hilarious, since it ends with a subjective hunting hunt for Payton in the jungle of the gorilla, and the very first is pursued by armed Cheney and Conway. Let's return for a minute to the tragic blonde, leading the film: after a promising start in the movies next to Hollywood legends such as James Cagney and Gary Cooper ?? in, respectively, a kiss tomorrow goodbye and Dallas (both 1950) ?? her career soon turned her nose into class B (and less) due to her own "colorful" backstage tricks: her most notorious misdemeanor was the cause of a widely publicized bar fight between courteous husband Franchott Ton and the cruel former lover Tom Neil, who ended up with the first fell into a coma, and Payton soon left him for the last !! But that was not all: nympho Payton also boasted that Woody Strode was among her conquests (a controversial issue at the time); Ton's short-lived husband, having caught Payton on infidelity videos, spread these damn photos around Hollywood, and this in fact served to the fact that she ended her days as an asterisk. her latest appearance in the film, “KILLING Edgar Ulmer, is my blow” (1955), which I accidentally discovered in my pile of Unwatched Films. The last 12 years of her hectic life have been spent on Skid Row in the throes of alcohol, drugs, prostitution, beatings, arrests and even stabbing ?? before finally dying in 1967 at her parents' house at the age of 39!
