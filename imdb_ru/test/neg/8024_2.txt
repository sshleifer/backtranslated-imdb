It's funny ... the day before I watched this film, I watched a documentary about Leni Riefenstahl, so the comparison was automatic ... of course not :) <br /> <br /> This film is weak in all aspects ... the acting is not convincing (especially the one who plays Simone ...) and unnatural ... edits in confusion and always leaves a taste of an incomplete frame, the music does not fit, the story does not flow, it gets boring, and the film goes much longer as it is ... oh, and the characters are not very well shown, you really can't tell a lot of story write about girls (except what you see). .. The film also tries to shock with obvious expletives (which is very funny :) <br /> <br /> So ... 2/10
