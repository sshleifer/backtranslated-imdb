I just finished watching this movie and I think this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It was so boring that I discovered that I was scaling it with a speed of X2 and finished it in less than 30 minutes. I was not only disappointed, but also angry that I had wasted my rental money. He is one of the five worst films I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands of movies! The plot was very confusing. If I had not first read the cover of the DVD before renting it, I would be completely lost in this movie. I would not have thought that Tim Robbins, having shot such good films as “Shawshank Escape”, would have agreed to act in this film.
