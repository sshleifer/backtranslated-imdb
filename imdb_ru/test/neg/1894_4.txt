Yes, this strange feature was written by John Sales. Filmed in Toronto, this is another feature of the 80s about the dangers of the urban jungle, where the police are afraid to walk, and the homeless and criminal classes are the only residents. Included in this mix is ​​the myth of the wild thing, a wild young man brought up by a handbag after his parents were killed by a dirty policeman in charge (Mori Chaykin) and Chopper, a local crime lord (Robert Davy). Interfere with local virtues (priest Sean Hewitt and ignorant social worker Kathleen Quinlan), and you have a recipe for some rather uninteresting sequences of actions. Davey is outstanding among the actors, and filmmaker Rene Versier does a pretty good job. Otherwise, this is a rather luminous action that will not satisfy the fans of the action and will leave sales fans with a slack jaw.
