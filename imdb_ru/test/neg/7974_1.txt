First question: how many incompetent idiots need to spoil a movie? Answer: One is more than enough if he writes and directs the script. Second question: Has anyone taught actors how to handle a weapon? Answer: hell no. Interestingly, Christie Swanson got hit on the face with hot copper - because, damn it, it seemed so! The third question: how many times have we made a conspiracy about the "conspiracy of a top-secret government agency uncovered from the inside"? Answer: a good pair is too much! The fourth question: are Michael Madsen and Ron Perlman overvalued? Answer: in this film, unfortunately, yes. Fifth question: can a pair of boobs keep this film? Answer: even the three (a pair of Christie Swanson and the director / screenwriter) did not. <br /> <br /> God ... If I see (most likely) a murderer preparing weapons for a strike, then morons from the sermon department give her a completely different set, the first bloody thing in this damned movie, the "suck" meter reaches a peak. Time from the beginning of the movie to turn off the TV: fifteen minutes. Slightly more than I needed in the case of “Alone in the Dark”.
