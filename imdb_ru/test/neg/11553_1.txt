It is incomprehensible to me how anyone could enjoy or laugh at this film. I would say that this is the worst film I have seen in recent years, and I see a lot of them. Maybe I forgot high school? It is also very hard to believe that this is the very Jeff Daniels who played such a brilliant performance by George Washington in “Crossroads”. Looks like since he did Dumber, he went into the tank. Can you believe that he even wrote and sent this garbage?
