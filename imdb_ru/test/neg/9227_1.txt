Terror in the jungle - a real find. If you saw this, you are one of the lucky few. It's fun! <br /> <br /> The story of the plane that crashed in the middle of the South American jungle. The crash scene must be seen to be believed. All die in a crash, or they are subsequently eaten by live crocodiles. Only a young blond boy survives. The nearby tribes bring the child to their village, and they (all men) respect him because of his golden hair! I'm not kidding! In the end, between the locals and the man there is a lot of struggle in search of survivors in a downed plane. All this time, the child sits on the throne, his blond hair is surrounded by a golden halo, and he cries without stopping !! This is a scream !!! <br /> <br /> Very unclear and contains very dubious subtexts. Sure, if you're in the fog, these are such bad films.
