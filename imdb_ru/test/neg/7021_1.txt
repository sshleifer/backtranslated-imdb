Truly, I also love Lucy ... comedian genius yes ..... MOM ... NEVER ... she was as ridiculous as mom ... as was the film version of the "Divine Secrets" sisterhood Ya. Ya. Both just missed the moment. Roslynd Russell was, is and always will be the first and only mom. Perhaps, as a young star, Ball could play a role where her inherent beauty and youth could carry her to the end ... but this seemed like a desperate attempt by an elderly star to show that she was still viable in the field. which so many supporters of Russellâ€™s version (apart from the fact that you cannot improve the original) is that Russell had a presence, she absorbs every scene, while Lucille Ball can be a pattern on the wallpaper in Mom for all the attention she commands in the role.
