This film is the apparent looting of the US underworld with Cliff Robertson in the title role. You yourself have to spend a couple of hours and see the original. I found that this film was incoherent and difficult to see, with many scenes that did not have much meaning. I am not against violence in the cinema, but all this seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to blow one person after another, many of which were only marginally related to the plot. With all the others killed, throughout the entire film, I wondered why Frank hadn’t just knocked out Johnny’s brains. Of course, he could, and Johnny, of course, did not behave like a person you can trust. Another thing that bothers me is the sex scene; Why do these people have sex in clothes? Does this have to turn us on? Of course, they did not think that they had a chance for a PG rating. Nothing in this film seemed natural. as if someone was watching people in real life, instead it was done in a hard and superficial way.
