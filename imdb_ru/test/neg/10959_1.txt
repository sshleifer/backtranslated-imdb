I watched this movie a couple of months ago when it first appeared on the shelves of blockbusters. This is officially the only film that I wanted to cancel while watching. Let me start by saying that I like the "B" movies. I consider Ice Pirates to be one of the best comedies. I also note that I am a writer and that I met the director / scriptwriter of this cinematic miracle. <br /> <br /> Evaluating the action: if I were going to choose a bright spot, I would have to say that Dion Day had a great acting debut with his role in it. For those who do not know, Dion is a boxer, not an actor, so we will forgive him for his lame death sequence. Why he does not shoot a gun that he holds once? Budget? To isolate a bad game, pages will be needed, so I’ll focus on the selfish guide of Rin Baskin. Ryan (who looks like a name picked from a comic because it sounded cool) has a maximum time in this film, perhaps because he was a producer. His appearance is completely fine, but his delivery evokes memories that SNL is bursting into soap operas. I suppose he could have done so much only with what was written for him, but part of the blame definitely belongs to him. <br /> <br /> Special effects: Not my specialty, but for a low-budget film, I believe that makeup and playing with weapons was acceptable. It did not bother me, but did not impress either. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter / director: Oscar for best screenplay is not something that I can foresee when Gerald Nott wins. Not only is the plot rudimentary, but the dialogue is flat and untidy. I understand stylized hockey, but it was just a bad letter. I was most worried about theft. Nott stole scenes, shots, and Viggo's facial hair from a variety of other films. The scene where Russell Crowe walks through a wheat field in the Gladiator, “Entire episodes from Good, Bad, and Ugly), this kind of thing just doesn't suit me. I prefer not to comment on the shooting, because I do not know what it takes to take a good picture, etc. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: do not shoot this film, do not even pirate it. It's too bad to waste time. Good reviews can be completely fake, after meeting with Jerry. Most likely, he publishes them himself.
