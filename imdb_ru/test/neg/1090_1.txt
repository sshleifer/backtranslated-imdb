Badly / in bad shape ... this film officially became the worst "made for a television film" in my book ... except for the cost of the camp that it offers, I give it 1 in quality and 10 in value. Offer: watch with friends, champagne and a lot of popcorn ... you want to throw some on the screen! Preferably friends who like Chris Noth from his Sex in the City ... this film is terribly funny. This is definitely the lowest point in the career of all the actors ... to be honest, I don’t know how they controlled laughter when the lines were set! Daniel J. Travanti is absolutely pitiful. ALL participated in the school of excessive acting; and poor Joan Van Ark, I believe that she was the only one who takes this theater of the absurd seriously ... although she is considered a producer. Her Mom jeans and bad plastic surgery are scene thefts. This film also crosses a very delicate feature of social incorrectness when they bring in a character’s plot with mental problems. This is an obscure film, shown in Life of the Life and marked as “With Harmful Intent” .... Has anyone else had fun?
