If justice existed in the cinematic universe, director Lewis Schönbrun would never have been allowed to go back to the set again. It would seem inconceivable that anyone who spent two full decades in the assembly room, where LS began his film career, could be completely devoid of any sense of rhythm or drama, but this film is a marvelous proof. <br /> <br /> No matter how bad it is, it's so exciting. From the first scene where a nurse dressed in a suit is only suitable for a porn movie or a parody of a Mexican variety show, the viewer is forced to see how low he can go. The answer is not far off, as in the next scene we move to the funeral home, where the next stunning fashionable statement will be a sexy black dress with open shoulders, which wears one of the mourners. <br /> <br /> Aggressively inappropriate costumes are not the only drawback of the film. Dialogue is a pleasure for connoisseurs of bad writing. “You turn my tears into wine,” is a sample of a precious stone. The actor deserves an Oscar for putting it with an open face. <br /> <br /> The director reinforces each scene with a cheeseball with what may be the most audacious soundtrack ever recorded that turns from awkward slander in dialogue scenes to cheesy The groovebox imitates rock and roll in transitional scenes. <br /> <br /> The script introduces characters without rhyme and reason, and the plot bits are heard as if with a broken bucket. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget that this is a horror movie, though. Our characters end up in the woods where Dr. Chopper and his two “scary” girlfriends are hiding, who are supposed to be some Franken species, but look exactly like the Girls of the Valley with fake blood soaked under their super-chest rags. Honestly, I have seen more terrible makeup in eight-year-olds who did tricks or treats on Halloween. <br /> <br /> Again, we hear the foul smell of a needlewoman as she jumps in the Ghoul Valley One. in a pseudo-Victorian robe, while her boyfriend wears an inconspicuous ensemble that could be almost fashionable in the less fashionable corners of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Dr. Chopper makes a great fashion statement, though, like Crisco's cowboy, who got lost in the woods on his big black Harley, dressed from head to toe with black S & M zippered leather. <br /> <br /> If this sounds intriguing, All means check it out. There are many difficult and sophisticated dialogues (for example, a scene with an “elephant cemetery” or “intellectual” discourse about Ginsburg). <br /> <br /> To be honest, cinema is good, considering what was produced. in front of the camera, and the actors are striving (with wildly extreme results) to make something from a heap of scrap cliché and vanity. You really have to wonder if they really are stupid or just blindly despairing so as not to leave the stage after catch a glimpse of ridiculous-looking villains with their weapons in the 99 Cent store.
