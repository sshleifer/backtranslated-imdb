this film has spent my time. I saw only a part of it, and I cried for the time I spent, doing something productive and useful for this land. for everyone who watched this movie more than once, I blame them for global warming, because the number of black balls that hit the ground because of this shit was not necessary, and if they came from another film, I would forgive . Robin Williams lowered his standards to actually take more than 10 seconds to participate in this film, and Tim Robbins, as he went from this film to the ransom, I have no idea. Please do not watch this film for the safety of the land. stop releasing black balls into the ground from a film that they should never have funded or let out. Please burn all copies before anyone else watches this nonsense.
