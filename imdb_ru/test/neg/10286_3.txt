If you find the description of violent murders and senseless cruelty of the police, expressed in a plot without a plot with a fascinating ice rhythm, then you will surely enjoy the observation. This film was trash for the mind and spirit. The notion that this is a “thriller” is ridiculous; this would imply some tension and turbulence. You kept waiting for the story to really finish the “launch.” He never rises above the glorification of idiot violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life. Imagine all the violence "No country for old people" without any chase or sympathetic characters. Thrill-killers go berserk. Basically this is a good game, but the script is a bunch. Do not worry, and tell your friends not to bother.
