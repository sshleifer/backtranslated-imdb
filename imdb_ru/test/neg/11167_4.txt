This is rip-off and insane Hollywood films such as Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. The story is classic, some high school students try to play asthmatic disorder in the classroom, but something is wrong. Terribly wrong. When you watch a movie, you know what happens before it happens all the time, it’s not very good if the movie tries to be scary. The actors are fine, and the girls are cute (after all, they are Asian), so I’ll give two of the five on mojave'o'meter.
