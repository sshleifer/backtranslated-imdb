Any lover of wrestling should forget this fight. No logic in matches, some tricky tricks (clown and Giant Gonzalez), it was an unforgettable PPV, something rare for WWE (F). The logic that Hogan won the world title at the end did not make any sense, and many people feel that they alone help the nail of the PPV. From the mindless tricks of the Roman soldiers to just a very bad fight (doink vs Crush is the worst match) to simply unsuccessful match selection (Scott Ramon razor against Bob Backlund, how can you have one of the greatest fighters on the mats returning and working on your first fight , face to face with a power fighter who was undefeated at the time), this PPV, which since then recognized even WWE, was much lower than expected.
