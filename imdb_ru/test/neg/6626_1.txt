Is this a bad movie? Don't take my word for it. Consider the following press reports about people who tried to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> · While he watched this movie, Mr. Harold Faber’s brain from Sandusky, Ohio, was forcibly thrown out of his skull for more than 200 km / h and preceded wriggling along the floor, shouting NOOOO NOOO NOOOO. <br /> <br /> · Mrs. Louise Robbins of Enid, Oklahoma, a 69-year-old retired housewife, performed a ritual seppuko with a butter knife while watching this film. <br /> <br /> · Ms. Janine Hosmer of Colombia, South Carolina, gave birth to a severely deformed child while watching this film, although she was not pregnant. <br /> <br /> · Watching this movie together, Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Wells from San Francisco, California, exploded spontaneously with such force that Mr. Wells's left shin was later found built into the wall of a house in Marin County. <br /> <br /> There have been many similar incidents. <br /> <br /> Of those who did not suffer, more serious consequences, such as those described in detail above, at least 75% became incurable, cruel and understandably insane after watching this movie. Of the remaining 25%, the majority were already insane before watching the movie; the rest were either blind and / or deaf, or in a constant vegetative state. <br /> <br /> I do not say, do not hand it over if you want. I just report what was in the papers.
