Yes. This stinky. I saw this film on the advice of my "dear" friends, who told me that this is a great "psychological" film. This film makes every effort not to be clear. I realized that after the first 20 minutes I was terrified. I waited because I expected to see something valuable, and most importantly, I paid for this film. The wait was unbearable. After watching the film, I talked with my friends and learned that in the intellectual environment (they call themselves under this name) Turkey this “film” was recognized as a masterpiece. Yes, a masterpiece, but in the category of stinkers. I believe that the film should be self-evident. This film is just the opposite. Stay away from this thing that calls itself a "movie." Burn your money instead of paying for this “phenomenon.” Rate: 1 of 10
