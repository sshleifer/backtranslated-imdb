This home movie is mostly scandalous trash, but you have to give them 3/10 per try. The blood is rubbish, but the grandmother who kills them is pretty funny, and I think the idea is good, and the makeup is fine for a home movie. However, thank God, it lasted only 55 minutes, and the turn at the end was literally a fight club (almost as much trash as a movie). Just read this comment, do not watch the movie.
