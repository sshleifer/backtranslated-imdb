So Seagal is played by a DEA detective named John Hatcher, who lost his partner because of an unexpected investigation into the drug situation in Colombia! Not to show off or something like that, but my father was born and raised in Colombia (hence my name), and now he is a doctor in California, therefore, no matter what you believe in films, there is some things besides drug dealers and cocaine coming from Colombia! <br /> <br /> In any case, due to the ruin of the drug, Hatcher loses his partner and accidentally kills a naked Colombian prostitute, prompting him to make a confession where I have never seen him before in any of his films, before or after. It was actually quite interesting. Seagal has a tendency to impersonate an almost asexual man, because he is never keen on women, except as a plot device and how an occasional attempt at seduction, be it a stripper or a lover, never evokes the slightest interest from him. He gets bad guys all the time. <br /> <br /> But in the confession booth, he confesses that he lied, sold drugs, falsified evidence and even slept with informants in order to get the information he needed to put the bad guys behind bars (I hope I’m not getting into trouble with God telling you about it ??). The priest tells him to go to his family, so he decides that it’s time to leave the army. <br /> <br /> The next third of the film is an exercise with the characteristic paper characteristic for Seagal’s films. "Marked by death" is Seagal's story against a group of mystical Jamaican drug dealers, and these guys have no reason to promote their products in broad daylight. <br /> <br /> Hatcher returns to his old school coach, Max (Keith David's minimal effort), and right in the middle of the practice there are some of these frantic fears of goons who sit right there in the stands, peddling like some on bookworms to high school students. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just got experience in high school, but I didn’t know that crackers and crazy people hang out at school in the middle of the day. Anyway, very soon Hatcher will find out how angry these guys are. They do not just trade with the guys from high school, but the coach regularly loses to the players because of their drugs, they participate in clever looks with Max, and since this is not enough, his 13-year-old niece died in their insane asylum. <br /> <br /> Oh, good. We get the picture. I am sure that they also torture puppies and beat up older women, and maybe to kidnap children too. Is it really so hard to establish who the bad guys are? A 13-year-old niece died in their lunatic asylum. Wow. <br /> <br /> Anyway. The film not only does not know how to develop the villains without resorting to what basically comes down to the name-calling of the film, where evil deeds are attributed to them superficially through dialogue, but they also don’t know how they should act. <br /> <br /> The leader of the drug dealer is Winchester, and I suppose that one should tell you about a movie of this type. The devil is a cartoonish Jamaican man with these bright, strangely green eyes, which I think should be an important part of his character, because he spends most of his screen time with his eyes half-bulged. His favorite means of intimidation is to really shout loudly from his wildly bloated Jamaican accent, and his face is literally less than an inch away from the one he is shouting at. This guy likes the faces of guys so much that he has to turn his head to the side so that their noses do not touch. I could only think about how the poor guys would cope with his breath. <br /> <br /> Dude, they don't want you to forget that these guys, by the way, are yamtsy. Their accents are so exaggerated and exaggerated that for most of the film they are almost impossible to understand. Not that it mattered. No matter what they say, all you need to know is that everything that comes out of their mouth is something evil related to drugs, they are just psychos who sell drugs and kill people. The film must have been a big hit in Jamaica! <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with the film is that theatrical performances, especially the bad guys, as I already described, are incredibly stupid even for Seagal. film. They are so caricatured and weird that it’s impossible to see them as anything other than creating a b-movie of a stupid gangster, something glued together to provide food that Segal can extend its distinctive brand of vengeance. <br /> <br /> But the film has a strange kind of mysticism that just makes it all strange. For example, a mystic, I suppose you would call her, at some point imposes some kind of curse on Screw, if (if I remember correctly) spits Bacardi’s throats on a live rooster that hangs upside down before decapitating him and drip blood onto the Screwface image. Hm Interesting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is this woman who warns Hatcher that these people have been "marked for death" by these people, which means that they have some kind of voodoo reptile. Not to detract from anyone, but if I were told that such people were cursed by my family, I would have just laughed at it. Hatcher doesn’t impress me as a guy who is trying to stock up on fancy voodoo curses! <br /> <br /> But the installation, as you can see, is pretty standard for a Seagal movie. It can be said, unique villains, although not very impressive. Definitely the strangest film of Seagal's early career ??
