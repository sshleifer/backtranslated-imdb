A serious step backwards for puppets in this mostly dull and tedious campaign. Guy Rolfe, as fantastic as Andre Toulon in the third part, this time almost does not appear, and Richard Bandâ€™s fantastic melody appears with puppets a few minutes after the film begins. At the beginning of the film, we meet the caretaker of the Bodega Bay Inn (Gordon Kerry) and some of his young friends (many of the actors are Canadians, and all of them are very good at unfortunately rather unpretentious roles - Theresa Hill is quite tasty), Totems, the minions of the Egyptian god Suteka want to bring back the secret of animated life, and the dolls (when they appear) act with an unprecedented mind, trying to destroy the very ugly and very computer games that look like Totems. Totems only complicate the series and distract from the things that previously made the series so unique - they do not share the strange beauty of the puppets and, thus, do not fit. The top scene is Pinhead, using a rag to clean the blood of Tunneling drills, classic and about the worst in this film. The fifth film was filmed at the same time, so expect similar episodes of mediocre and Toulon performance, which seem to have been filmed in a different era (or even a galaxy). Guy Rolfe deserves the best, and fans of the series certainly do. Grrrrrrr.
