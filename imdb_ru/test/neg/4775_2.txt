I was REALLY disappointed with this film. I heard some good reviews about it and, unfortunately, did not see it in cinemas. As a result, I was very happy when I saw the DVD. I thought it would be a terrible horror movie with a lot of scary surprises, but instead it was a predictable snail movie. He pulled and pulled without a climax, and after all the difficulties through which these people were trying to escape, the end was completely disappointing. I gave this film two stars for one reason. This is not your typical horror movie with one bad guy who kills a bunch of people. The story makes this film unique and enables people who watch a lot of horror films. Although I donâ€™t like this film, I recommend to all horror fans to watch it at least once. You might like this amazingly. As for this horror fan, all I can say is that I hope that the continuation of this unforgettable film is NOT TO BE.
