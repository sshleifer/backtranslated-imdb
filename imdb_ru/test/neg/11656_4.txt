It was included in the disc "Shorts: Volume 2" - a rather boring collection of short films. Shorts is one of my favorite movie styles, but somehow the people collecting this second collection found it difficult to find quality content — and it wasn’t as good as the first volume or other short collections. <br /> <br /> This short film seems terribly incomplete. There is a story, but so much without an answer that the viewer, like me, feels a little deprived and dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a woman, her boyfriend and her Vesti (this is a dog, by the way) going to a lonely beach. The lady speaks with an accent that is sometimes difficult to follow. Considering that I have problems with hearing, I would surely love if he was with subtitles. Anyway, the guy goes swimming while she sleeps. When she wakes up, her dog is gone. She panics and makes a guy follow her in search of a dog. They spend most of their time arguing and being unpleasant. Then, suddenly, they stop having sex. Later they find the doggy end of the story. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, both of them seemed rather dysfunctional and unattractive. She was a fussy and demanding lady, and he seemed to despise her. When you thought about why they were together, their small sex gap showed what bonds they held together. <br /> <br /> Some may like the characteristics — I continued to find people annoying and unreal — more like cartoons than people you might meet or learn about. In addition, the reward for all this is simply not worth the wait (unless you want to see the guy naked).
