The time machine begins in New York in 1899, when Professor Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pierce) offers his beloved girlfriend Emma (Sienna Guillory), who unfortunately accepts right after the robber attacked them, and Emma was shot and killed died in the hands of Alexander. Jump forward "Four years later," and Alexander built a time machine, which he uses to return to the night when Emma was killed to save her, but she is still killed, only this time otherwise. Alexander understands what he is doing, however, no matter how many times he returns, Emma will always be somehow dead, and he can't wait to find out the answer, so he travels far into the future to find out the truth. However, after the destruction of the moon, two new races appeared on Earth, such as Eloi and the monstrous Morlocks, who feed on Eloi. Alexander decides to stay and save Eloi. <br /> <br /> Director Simon Wells, who is actually the great-grandson of the author G. G. Wells, who wrote the original book The Time Machine, in which the original The Time Machine (1960). The film was founded, and this is actually a 1960 film, on which the script of producer John Logan is based here, and not in the original source of Wells. Although all three tell the same basic story and ideas, this remake adds a plot that Alexander's fiance is being killed, which is why he invents a time machine, and not just because he is smart and knows how. The script is a mixture of science fiction, action adventure and drama, none of which really captured me and hooked me so much, of course, there are some nice special effects, some good action scenes and a moment when Alexander's question is answered as to why can't save Emma, ​​in fact she is pretty clever and makes sense, she never struck my imagination, and that never bothered me either. The aspects of Time Machine related to time travel are very similar to Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1992) in the sense that you cannot change the past, but at the same time the future is not fixed. good movie as Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The character is fine, although I thought Guy Pierce looked too young to be a smart scientist who could invent a time machine, and there was never any real explanation for his mechanics, because as if there was no time machine at one moment invented and did the following. one and works fine. I believe that the Back to the Future trilogy offers much more thrill, laughter, excitement, and shared entertainment value than Time Machine ever does, and at the same time I will not call it a bad film as it moves. at a decent pace, says sensible. This story has moments that I would not call brilliant or even particularly good. There is also a small cheeky link to the book and the original film, both of which are tested here by name. <br /> <br /> The advantage of this modern version compared to the original is in the development of special effects and, in particular, CGI, which leads to scenes of time, quickly passing around Alexander in his time machine, in which huge buildings are built, are formed new mountain ranges, canyons and mountains and a complex panorama that ends in space when we see passenger rockets orbiting the moon. The effects work well, there are one or two points that look a little below par, but in general the effects are good. I saw “The Time Machine” on the TV channel, and the station played poorly, and scanned it, so the left and right edges of the frame were cut off from the screen, thus cutting off part of the year on Alexander’s machine dial, so I actually didn’t know what year gone Apparently, director Gore Verbinski took the last eighteen days of filming because Wells suffered from “extreme exhaustion,” while IMDb says that the time machine itself was the biggest and most expensive prop ever made for the film. that it's hard for me Believe me, and Guy Pierce broke his rib during the battle scene, but continued like a soldier. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 80,000,000, production figures are high with a lovingly recreated period in New York and good effects, although it is surprising that the Time Machine was nominated for an Oscar for best makeup, but lost to Fried (2002). The game is mixed, Jermie Irons plays well in a terrible makeup job, in which he looks like a rejection of the movie “The Lord of the Rings”, while singer Samantha Mumba debuts here on the big screen and is just awful, although Guy Pierce is pretty good and pretty nice . <br /> <br /> “The Time Machine” is not a very bad and not very good film, just a little remarkable, which can be watched and which takes an hour and a half, but not much, Instead, watch Back To The Future again (1985 ).
