Well, I felt that a Mormon film about Mormons for Mormons would be a catastrophe waiting for what happened, but I didn't know how it would hurt a lot. A little known fact is that Mormons have always made exceptionally good propaganda films. The Church’s official cinematographic campaign has created rare and durable pearls that go beyond the Mormon community, including the wonderful short film “Cipher in the Snow”, which in the late 1970s turned into an educational film. Then there is Neil Labuta’s harassing mastery .... <br /> <br /> However, the success of these films depended largely on the fact that they did not focus on Mormons or any particular Mormon theology. Instead, they prefer to focus on a universal theme and work with it on a basic human level. The “Army of God” rejects any pretexts of universality and rapidly runs into the fierce and short-sighted world of the Orthodox. Although this may be enough to alienate anyone other than the most devoted Mormon, the inability of director Richard Duchcher as director and his youthful approach to storytelling is sufficient reason to judge the Army of God, which cannot be traced by virtually any standard. . <br /> <br /> Dutcher's own terrible wooden game sets the tone for his army of the least interesting Mormons you have ever met. Of course, the miserable actions of the actors did not help anyone from Dutcher's miserable scenario. He should be commended for not escaping some of the more controversial aspects of the Church, but, as was to be expected, he conveniently creates these contradictions in a sympathetic light. It should also not be surprising that most of the answers to the darker side of the Church are directed only to faith. At some point, an African American missionary swears by a black couple for joining a church that was segregated before 1978 (about ten to twenty years after almost all the meetings in the most degenerate parts of the deep South have already done so). Instead of engaging in an active racist history of the Church, perhaps the most painful place in Mormon theology, which even church leaders no longer protect, instead Dutcher’s worried nature ponders the murder of Joseph Smith — an obvious and possibly outrageous hint of lynching. Complete this milky fried syrup with third-class lepers with jokes that sound like comic relief, and you have good reason to revive silent films. <br /> <br /> If you knew a little about the Mormons before watching this movie, you may become prone to avoid them at all costs. If you're a Mormon, this film offers absolutely nothing to be proud of.
