In fact, I own this film, which is a version of MST3K called “Cave dwellers”, and this is really the only way everyone could watch such a film. If it were not for Joel, Crowe and Tom Servot, the wise men who are constantly doing it, it would be impossible to survive this piece of shit. You have a hero named Ator, who is very similar to Jeff Spigoli in “Quick Times” in Ridgemont High and looks just a little smarter, without a single stone. He takes cavemen (cave dwellers?), Invisible guys, giant snakes (with a bunch of anal holding snakes who like to build all the skulls face to face), invents a hang-glider that suspiciously looks like modern aluminum one with several cheap vines wrapped around of this, and then fights an evil guy like John Saxon. Then he rides his horse through tire tracks, where someone rides a four-wheeled wheel. <br /> <br /> Yes, I got most of this from MST3K, which, as I said, is the only way to watch this turkey movie. If it were not for this, he would have received zero stars.
