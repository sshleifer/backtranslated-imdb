Eric Roberts "stars" in this debut prison film Tommy Lee Thomas. He plays the leader of a corrupt guard ring. Despite the fact that most people are angry, his character is a type of guy who is good enough to give you support wires while you hang a chain on the ceiling when he tortures you with electric shocks "Lethal Weapon". <br /> <br /> The film has a confusing plot of prison corruption that makes absolutely no sense. Thomas has Clint Eastwood's squinting eyes, Dolph Lundgren’s one-wayness, JCVD ​​acting skills and the body of the smallest guy you knew in school that took steroids after graduation. <br /> <br /> Martin's Cobra Kai’s career with Kowa shares this low point with Roberts; in the film, it’s hard to say whether Kow’s character should be drunk during the whole movie, or Kowa just came in that way. I can't blame him if he did it. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for all the participants, this film is “so bad that it is good” quality that can be funny IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE BEST.
