The Quintet by Robert Altman is a dark, gloomy, difficult-to-follow thriller, where you finally give up after a while, because it's so complicated. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this at my local twin at the opening of the weekend with a full hall. By the time the picture ended, it was less than a quarter full. I have never witnessed such a mass exodus without an emergency situation in order to drive out people. This should tell you how bad it is. I think this is the worst movie ever made with such great talent in front of and behind the camera.
