This film tells about a group of women (perhaps not the most famous) who are sent to a small fort to seize the recently abandoned property of an uncle, where they plan to open a store. Upon arrival in a nearby city, they discover that no one will go there (although it is only 15 miles away), so they walk. When they get there, they discover that there are no soldiers there, but there are a large number of people who took control of the fort and built a small town nearby. Soon they discover that something is wrong here, and Fort Macmillan (Ft. Doom, as the locals call it) is in serious trouble. <br /> <br /> Instead of going to the storyline, I will make a few comments about what I noticed in the film. First, the acting is very flat, it seems that only a few people are realistic enough to believe in it. At first I played badly, but in the end I watched some actions, and the same people came to life. So my only thought remained: the director wanted so much. In addition to bad behavior, I have a big problem when people do not respond correctly to a given set of circumstances. Take, for example, that no one will take them to Fort Macmillan for any price, although it is only 15 miles away. However, when we arrive at the Fort, we find that it is well supported by a decent population, all of whom should receive supplies from someone, not to mention mail, etc. It is supposed to happen in 1867. The car has electric lights (at least they are not included) and a locomotive engine, released at least 30 years later, is not one of the most common locomotives of the time. There are also places where you can see an asphalt asphalt slab (and maybe at some point the car did not want to go back and see) and other anachronistic objects. If they followed the rules of the “world” they created, and allowed the actors to become actors, it could get 4 from me instead of 2 that I gave, and they rewrote it 4 more times, it could be even better.
