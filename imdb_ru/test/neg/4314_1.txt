Opie, Tom Gilson, was my brother, so I went to see the film and never watched it again in all these years. Sorry! it was bad. I was told that I should write 10 lines, so Iâ€™ll add some trivia. Tom and Tuesday Welding were to be "represented" in this picture, and Tom was ordered to take Tuesday to the premiere, but Tom said that he was not going with Joan Collins, and he did, and because he was only on Tuesday introduced to Weld. I found it very funny then and still doing. The film, although the concept was funny, and the actors in it were impressive, but something like this just did not work funny. Continuity was abstract, at best, as if I watched 2 different films at the same time, each facing a different one. Sorry bob gilson
