Comments already left for this show are more fun than the show itself, and they are all accurate. I feel the same way that I am very disappointed with how far Rick Mercer fell when he did really cool things at this hour with 22 minutes, but now he is just fooling around, going in different places and talking to people. He does something in the studio about things going on in the news, but they are never funny, just very sad and predictable jokes about headlines. Most of his show is that he is going to talk to people somewhere, for example, he goes to the rodeo this week, and all the videos show how he makes funny faces and is afraid of wild horses, etc. with since This Hour left 22 minutes, he became less funny, and this show is no longer funny. Now that Air Farce is off (finally, thank God!), Mercer and This Hour have 22 minutes to become the next in line for the ax, just an old weary, predictable comedy that almost no one finds funny. This is sad, considering that Rick Mercer was the funniest person on Canadian television!
