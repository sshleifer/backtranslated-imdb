I know this movie. But when it comes to the image of real life (in any case), it should be as true as possible. Sorry, but "El Misterio Gal√≠ndez" is not as accurate as it seems. And the Dominican Republic is not depicted as it really is. In fact, I was shocked to see that the filming location for Santo Domingo was Cuba. And oddly enough, films with a Cuban theme (Havana, Lost City, Bitter Sugar, Godfather, Part II) were actually filmed in Santo Domingo! So what happened here? Why did they shoot the film in Cuba instead of DR? Cuban-inspired Spanish dialogues are terrible! This is not the Dominicans! On a historical level, Galindes would never have been hanged. He might as well have been shot, beheaded, or died from the inhuman torture he received. Then threw his body into the Caribbean. But Trujillo would never have ordered death from strangulation. His sick mind would not allow it. <br /> <br /> Act not as expected. Harvey Keitel looks like he is expecting a salary. I prefer the lead actress in the "Deep Blue Sea". The rest of the cast would be great in some Cuban film, and the same goes for the chosen location. <br /> <br /> I offer "Goat's Holiday" from the bestseller. Written by Mario Vargas Llosa, directed by his cousin Luis Llosa. This is a bit more realistic with Dominican history. Trujillo's character is very well depicted, and the Galindez incident is very briefly covered in this film.
