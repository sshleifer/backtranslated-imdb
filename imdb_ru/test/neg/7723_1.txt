Sorry, but they got the impression that these commandos had fought zombies before. But they certainly did not behave as if they had seen zombies before. Jump and turn away from them, like lovers. Secondly, the characters are written quite badly. The actors did their best with what was given, I blame for bad writing and bad direction. Finally, here too, where the spoiler warnings are highest. They lose the sample twice, and the girl Jennifer Holland does not know whether she was bitten or not. How stupid is that? No matter how painful it is to be bitten, you might think that you know, plus the gallons of blood flowing from your body are a good clue. Stupidly, the first film had its flaws, but it had the ability to re-watch, unlike this film disaster, which I could barely survive once. I give the HOUSE OF THE DEAD 2: NO ANIMALS, ALL THE PET FOOLNESS
