This is one of the rare films where instead of a bowl of popcorn you should watch it with a bottle of vodka. Honestly, we are a group of people who actually know this person, Mo Ogrodnik, and decided to drink themselves for the stupidity of this film. <br /> <br /> The cinematic aspect of Wolfgang's Something Something doesn’t seem to take into account close-ups and chest. The joint efforts of Moe and Wolfgang showed the passion of two actresses, plastic feathers, holding passion. There is also a knock beetle. As Violet would say: “This (plastic ball) raises your ass.” Porn rats and the subsequent breaking of the rat is amazing. <br /> <br /> Good. So, if you're still reading, let's explain who we are. Mo Ogrodnik teaches at New York University, and we are a group of her students who, having finished a cinema lesson with her, decided to go crazy and watch the directorial debut here. She also wrote Uptown Girls. I can not tell you how much it was slaughtered in our turtles. So this film is quite impressive. At the very bottom of this post will be a drinking game that we created for this film. <br /> <br /> After about 13 minutes of play, none of us could see directly. A huge amount of Dido in the first thirty minutes created enough reasons to drink to calm the elephant. There was something secretly pleasant when two underage girls struck Kurt Cobain’s twin without any context, except for his mysterious store scene. where he oh-oh-so naturally reads the local newspaper. Because this is what we all do. Heart-shaped glasses were delightfully derived from Lolita. And something about the provocative scenes of a naked chin-up boy suggests the story of a director of homosexual pornographic experiments. I wish we were joking. <br /> <br /> Enough intellectual contemplation. ON DRINKING GAME! This will provide a positive viewing experience. It's very simple, and very likely, to send at least one member of your party to emergency room. <br /> <br /> Mo Ogrodnik / Mature Drinking Game :. 1. Every time you see something related to pornography, have a drink, 2. Every time you see the name of the author Mo Ogrodnik, have a drink. 3. Sex. 4. (plastic) two drinks are required. 5. Every time someone sends a weapon to another character, have a drink. -At that moment you will probably need to replenish / pee the urine of any remaining sobriety from your body. - 6. Any time there is blood (INCLUDING "LADY BLOOD"), please take a sip! 7. An underused hula hoop girl needs one drink per second. 8. For the unreasonable use of the “magic black man” one drink is required. 9. If you cannot understand the end-to-end line, continue drinking, Beiotch. 10. Whenever you can predict a line, have a drink. Believe us. It's simple. <br /> <br /> That's it, the Internet! Keep drinking and try not to be torn. <br /> <br /> -Hawaiian Smirnoff Punch, Jr.
