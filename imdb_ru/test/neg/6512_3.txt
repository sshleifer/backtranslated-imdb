Not a very good fighter, because he unfortunately demonstrates the same water as Steven Seagal's early films, because there is not a very good plot. Steven Seagal plays the same character as the one from "The Excellence of the Law." In my opinion, Keenen Ivory Wayansâ€™s performance in such an average film is wasted and belongs to a much better film. Bob Gunton is fine as the main heavy. The best role in the entire film belongs to Brian Cox, who is very scary in the role of the killer. My favorite scenes are fighting scenes with the Russian mafia. One of the reasons for The Man with a Glimpse (1996) is the short appearance of the beautiful and crazy Nikki Cox. It is a pity that there were no more scenes with her.
