I live in Mexico City, so I have to endure trailers for every piece of garbage that comes from all these stupid Mexican directors. Do you want to admire the Mexican guy for making great movies? Take a look at something Guillermo del Toro (especially “The Devil's Backbone”) or maybe Alfonso Cuarona (although I really don’t like his films, but I respect them) <br /> <br /> Mexican directors often produce some films. from the worst trash ever (Por la Libre, El Segundo Aire, American Visa), but this is one of the lowest points in Mexican films. If you respect your brain, please avoid this piece of **** at all costs. It would be wiser to watch a video about the wedding or watch Britney's reality show. In this "movie" more IQ than everyone.
