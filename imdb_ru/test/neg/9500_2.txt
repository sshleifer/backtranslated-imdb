Yah I know. He has the name "Sinatra" in the title, so how can it be bad? Well, this is bad, believe me! I rented it, thinking that it was some kind of film that I missed in theaters. Is not. This is some kind of garbage "movie", filmed by people on Showtime (cable station). Gosh, these cable stations earn a few dollars, they think they can make any trash movies they want! This is not good. I'm as big a fan of Sinatra as any sane person, but this film was just stupid. Boring. Stupid. Unfunny. Not interested. The only redeeming quality is that (if they really stuck to the facts) you find out what happened to Frank Jr.'s kidnappers. Otherwise, it's just a stupid movie.
