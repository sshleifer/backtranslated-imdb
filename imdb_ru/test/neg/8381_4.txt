The cult begins 20 years ago on the Quingling Ridge, South China, when a guy named Owen Quinlin (Robert Berson) finds an ancient amulet, which is said to have magical powers, built in California, where Quinlin created the cult, and its participants sacrifice yourself when one of them (Kesey Golomb) disrupts his evil scheme ... Jump forward to today, until five college students, Mindy (Rachel Miner), Cassandra (Taryn Manning), Bailey (Glenn Dunk), Alex (Joel ) Michaeli and Morgan (Victoria Venegas) explore the events of twenty years ago, who became known as the “Quinling Massacre” for a school project. Unfortunately, Morgan decides to commit suicide, which releases the evil spirit of Owen Quinlin for rather minor reasons, and he begins to finish what he started all these years ago, demanding a soul, so that he could finally inherit the magical powers of the amulet for his own evil. use ... <br /> <br /> Edited, co-produced and directed by Joe Knie, this film is not very good, and it's very nice of him. The screenplay of Benjamin Oren, who seems to take himself very seriously, is a harsh supernatural story about a cult leader who returns from the dead to finish what he started several years ago, because you expect that the character involved now has links to what happened all those years ago and it’s as boring as it seems. The characters are soft and easily forgotten, the dialogue is the same, there is no horror, no exploitation in it, it is slow, sometimes predictable, clichéd, in the end it completely derails and gives you a little feeling when you think about it. The story never captivates and fascinates you, it is never exciting or particularly interesting, and I even try my best to call it average. There is very little that I could recommend to Cult, do not worry about it. <br /> <br /> With the director Knee, everything is in order, but in the film they take this soft snapshot on the video made for television. this, this is absolutely forgettable & flat things everywhere. There are no fears, no atmosphere and not enough tension. There is no blood either, of course, there is a fair amount of blood spatter, but there are no real special scenes with bloody effects. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 950,000, the Cult looks cheap, though not as poorly made as some of the low-cost horror films I have seen recently. Acting is not even worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> Cult is a bad movie that didn’t do anything for me; I would have called it average with all my might. There are much better horror movies out there.
