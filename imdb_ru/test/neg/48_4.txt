It's Saturday, it's raining, and I think that every movie should have at least one comment ... so I just watched The Bravery of the Doctor of Crime throughout the film. This is a murder mystery with a typical set of characters and a pair of ordinary suspects - each of which has its own possible motive for the crime. The story begins suddenly, and the viewer is thrown into the plot without any character development or storytelling. I think it is not too surprising for film B of this period. There are also some moments that look and feel like it was before World War II, but perhaps this is due to the fact that the author worked in radio shows. <br /> <br /> “Criminal Doctor” is the fuck who visits California for some of the R & R from his psychiatric practice on the East Coast. He contacts a mystical friend, a novelist, with whom he is supposed to have been with one or more previous experts on the disclosure of secrets. The writer sometimes plays the role of an assistant to our detective (also known as Dr. Watson), and also sometimes illuminates things with a comic relief (of a kind). <br /> <br /> There is also a somewhat simple, but not entirely clumsy police captain, who is sometimes annoyed by the intervening detective. And then the mysterious Braggas, brother and sister, who dance in a nightclub. Dance is a kind of interpretive dance, which is one of those moments that more resembles the 30s than the 40s. Although the storyline is California, Bragg seems to live in a castle! <br /> <br /> There was one plot element that amused me a little, but I will not divulge more than this, because I always enjoy movies more when the story is discovered, and not known in advance. (although I can think of many, many B films that would rate higher, and it’s hard to say that watching this is a good time) I have not seen any other films from the “Criminal Doctor” series, so I cann’t make any comparisons.
