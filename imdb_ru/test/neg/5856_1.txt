This film is slightly larger than the ersatz Verhoeven. Shooting should be tele-realistic, but simply disgusting. The parody disappears in about 15 minutes and is replaced by a story that seems to take itself seriously. Brechtiansky pauses for non-existent advertising brakes are tedious and even painful; undoubtedly there was no real intention to make this film “Brehtian”, it was just an accident that happened this way. If you want to watch a parody of a reality show, take a look at Celebrity DeathMatch - it's funnier and sharper, and most importantly shorter. I rarely felt such pain when watching a movie. Avoid like a rabbit rabbit.
