This film was one of the most boring horror films I have seen in a long time (and I have seen a lot). Personally, I liked the piercing taking of all this, which was original, but other than that it was rather unsightly. I could not bear Dee Snyder as an actor or singer. It seemed to me that he tried, with all he said, to make this a memorable quote, which they were not. I can get movies for free, and I still did not think it was worth the time to get.
