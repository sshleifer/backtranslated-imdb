In case you are interested, the clowned Lauren C ***** n (Cryptozoology Inafame) is a living idiot, and any information he provides should be thrown away with garbage. This guy is just clipped in the newspapers. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it was a predictable train wreck, the actors were mechanical, the lighting was terrible, and the props / clothes were cheap. <Br /> <br /> Bobcat Goldwait was to play a major role in the clowns of this film. I was physically sick after seeing ten minutes. <br /> <br /> I watch monkeys / retarded monkeys, which are still responsible for the films that I see. <br /> <br /> dan
