The filmmakers obviously had enough money to afford decent makeup effects, but not enough to create one that would move and convincingly attack. We will never have the opportunity to see how the "monster" moves from one place to another - whenever it happens (presumably), the camera focuses on the "scared" reactions of people who are nearby. And when a man attacks him, he seems to simply hold an inanimate object against himself so that he does not fall to the ground. This is still not the most terrible robbery of the “Alien” (for example, two Xtro films are even worse); it's actually interesting enough if you have 68 (!!) minutes to save. (* 1/2)
