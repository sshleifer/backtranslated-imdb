I thought it might be worth watching a movie with Peter O'Toole, Suzanne York, Michael Craig and Harry Andrews. Alas, I was wrong. Quite pretentious nonsense from start to finish, and O'Toole and York wildly outplayed. I watched it twice and still do not understand what it is about. I have a feeling that O'Toole is playing in the “Laird” of the Scottish castle, who has alcohol problems, and he likes to play again the children's games with his sister (York). He also barks crazy. But besides this, your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> There is no redemption feature in the film. I can only assume that the actors and the director were blackmailed to make this dull, inconceivable, stagnant mockery. Obviously a waste of time for a talented actor and director. Laughable
