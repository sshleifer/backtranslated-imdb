An ill-conceived sequel (... the absurd idea that a snowman killer is raging in an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather) returns the spirit of the psychopath, returning thanks to a scientific experiment with the addition of foreign elements that reintroduce life to its molecules (... This is the best I could do to explain this ridiculous concept). <br /> <br /> I could delve into how he finds himself on the island to kill numerous tourists, but I just don’t find cause for concern because it would be so tiring. Anyway, the filmmakers consider it reasonable to kill pretty girls not earlier than ten minutes after their arrival (I mean, seriously, why bother even presenting them to us if we can no longer enjoy our eye candies, this ?!) . <br /> <br /> The snow anvil kill scene takes the cake. Icicles protrude from a sandy beach, so the victim can fall on them. Oh, and another girl was slaughtered with a pair of tongs. <br /> <br /> Listen, I understand what comes to me when I sit down to watch a killer snowman movie ... such a ridiculous supernatural slasher or tickle you funnybone ("Oh, this is such a wonderful cheesy horror movie ! ”) Or you wonder what the hell you are wasting time on such nonsense. Jack Frost has the ability to freeze the water (then how could they melt it in the first movie?) And makes the island resort to snow. In one episode, Jack freezes with water in a pool, enveloping a swimming model under a sheet, causing her to sink, and she has nowhere to run. Oh, there is also a re-creation of the “tongue stuck to the ice pole” fragment from the “Christmas story” (“Cowatonga dude”)! “). <br /> <br /> I have to give it to the actors, though .. they are real soldiers who are trying to entertain this poor material. Christopher Allport (... perhaps unwisely) returns as Sam to meet his old the enemy, like Eileen Seeley, like his wife. Attempts of mocking humor (at least for me) failed, but the rushing soldiers tried to make the most of a very difficult situation, with energetic performances they do everything they can to rise above a pathetic cause and woeful dialogue. <br /> <br /> Occurs an event that increases the danger for those who are still close to face Jack, his genetically modified water molecules, thanks to the input of extraneous elements, allow him to withstand coolant / freeze, and, even worse, it can now multiply ... through an upset stomach, Jack cracks what seems to be snowballs that hatch to show small snowballs with black eyes, mouth and sharp teeth! The terrible snowman costume and the little snow puppets presented later in the film can make you laugh in the stomach if you are in the mood for such machinations, but I personally found this rubbish rather abnormal (I think this is the goal, I think, cheap griffs) . from those who are willing to accept it) and unbearable. Offspring in a snowball is a clear homage to Gremlins, where we get a bar scene, where little bastards celebrate the number of victims of terrorism at the resort. Weapons against them .. bananas! This is because when Jack went to kill Sam in the first movie, they both fell into a truck full of antifreeze (the icicle coming out of Jack’s belly penetrated Sam’s chest when he pushed them out of the window into the bed of the truck, and I think being "tied up" with an icicle, Jack inherited Sam's banana allergy, or that's what we believe in!) and in that both "merged" in a sense. <br /> <br Fu, a film like this defies simple explanation. This film with effects and plot is so terrible that due to the many shortcomings of the presentation may seem enjoyable.
