Charlie Chaplin responds to open auditions at Lodestone Studios. Opponent Ben Turpin arrives in the same studio, obviously another unemployed comedian! Turpin is trying to draw attention to Chaplin's actions after the head of the studio shouts: “Next!” However, Chaplin manages to enter through Turpin. Charlie funny manages to spoil the work of the actor and carpenter. In the end, he will be able to take a big break, but will a star be born? <br /> <br /> There are a lot of jokes related to the buttocks. The opening scene involving a farce from Chaplin and Turpin is a relative highlight. Note that Gloria Swanson is a typist on the background, left on the screen, at the opening of the film. Agnes Aires also appears. <br /> <br /> *** His new work (2/1/15) Charles Chaplin ~ Charlie Chaplin, Ben Turpin, Charlotte Mino
