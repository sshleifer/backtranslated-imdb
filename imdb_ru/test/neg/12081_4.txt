“Solids 2” are harmless, aimless, and less plot free. I would add “brainless” to this list, but the “movie in film” trick, although not very successful, helps him avoid this shortcut. The landscape has changed from California beaches to Greek islands, and the only returning actors from the first film are Sorrells Picard (bearded guy) and Robert Collins (who one day falls into a dirty pit, bringing back the classic fight with Pam Greer house "). All other actors are new, but it is obvious that Brad Zutaut should play the same character (Scotty) as Grant Kramer in "Solids". This sequel lacks the energy and attractiveness of the first film, and does not fit to match it in the “hotness” department. Of course, Brenda Bakke and Fabiana Udenio are both very sweet, but the team of Til Roberts - Cindy Silver - Christie Somers is unbeatable. “Solids 2” is far from the worst of its kind, but if you want to watch only one of these films, you need to get the original.
