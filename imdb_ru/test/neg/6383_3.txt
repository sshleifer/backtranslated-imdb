I know that Terry Gilliam is considered a good director, but to say that this film is good is just silly. What was the movie about? What is this fake? Fantasy? Comedy? Satire? No answer from Gilliamâ€™s script. Completely tangled and uselessly rushing from one historical century to another. I find it funny that some people really call this movie magical. Because they should praise any film that is unclear and indecisive about what it is about? 3 stars for special effects, considering that this is 1981. Roger Ebert right in his review. The film is ambiguous and looks like a game of Gilliam with money just to make a vague children's move disguised as a historical revue. The film also tries to confuse the potential viewer by giving John Cleese and Sean Connery the maximum score.
