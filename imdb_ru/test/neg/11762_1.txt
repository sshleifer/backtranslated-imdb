Several scenes that are actually trying to describe the revolutionary struggle, reminiscent of the boy scout boy scout, wading between swimming pits. When Sharif or, please, God, Palance try their hand at fiery oratory, they sound like Kurtz swallowing a beetle. Strategic brilliance shows include a map of Cuba, filled with smiling fish in the ocean, and Vaudeville's positive hypothesis of how the pigs passed. What does this leave us with? One comic dentistry scene; an excess of cheeky Hollywood peasants who turn to the camera as if it were a moving train; and just for fun - homoeroticism, which is not limited to Castro's manic and unrelenting cigar sense. Never trust the Bear, but even a broken clock runs twice a day: it is a HISTORICALLY terrible movie.
