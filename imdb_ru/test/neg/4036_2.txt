I had a terrible misfortune when I watched this “b-film” in its entirety. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is to save my time and money !!! It should be the worst b-movie of all time, it should not even be called a b-movie, more like an f-movie! Because he loses in all aspects that make a good film: the story is not interesting at all, all the actors are subtle and not at all believable, they have bad leadership, and the action films are so fake that it is almost funny ... ..... almost. <br /> <br /> The film is just full of stupid cues that no respectable person can find in the least funny. <br /> <br /> This film is supposed to be male-oriented, but all the women in it are SO unattractive, especially that old wrinkled thing that is coming to an end. They are trying to look sexy in these strange, terrible costumes and fail miserably !!! <br /> <br /> Even some of the most ridiculous bi-films will still give you a laugh, but looking at it is too painful !!
