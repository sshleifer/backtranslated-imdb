Immediately after watching the first and very stupid. I accidentally watched the episode "Bones" and then "The Eleventh Hour". The 11th hour should be confused. <br /> <br /> This is so weak. Stewart presents himself as a government scientist. No mention of what kind of a scientist, just a specialist in science. In a cloning program, they bring a caretaker to the church, who is paid for removing unsuccessful germs, forcing him to kneel before the statue of Jesus on the cross and ask for forgiveness ... and also tell them where the bad guy is. how can they move on the plot. Now it's science at work :( <br /> <br /> A silly, not very stupid piece where Picard rages on a TV that advertises a skin scream that makes you look younger, shouting “It's a lie”, like his Randy assistant gropes for a local hot bobby next door. <br /> <br /> The end of the first episode looks like a bad cartoon where a bad old lady named after dad Pinnohyos to move an awkward plot along waves Picard from the street when she gets into a taxi. Picard is on the floor above, and he looks out the window thoughtfully ... she has run away. try to escape ... or maybe call the police ... or maybe dial a taxi and call him, or maybe I had something different than ... I wave my hand and I sit in a taxi now, and you can't do anything about it until next week ends ... mahahahah. <br /> It is a pity that it is so stupid. At some point Picard is convinced that the grieving father convinced that even if a clone son was born, he would never have been his son, since his son had a soul. the hat is the right people. A common scientist opposes cloning on the grounds that every soul is unique and sure why else you want to clone. <br /> <br /> Although general scientist Picard finds cloning a little sticky, he is ready for stem cell research and goes so far as to claim that disaster will befall humanity if it is not allowed. He has rather sharp talk about how important this is. Of course, he does not mention a single example. This kind of show results. Humming words and carelessness.
