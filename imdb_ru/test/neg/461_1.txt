I am the person who can enjoy a good B-movie if he has some kind of redemption value, but Dead Space has nothing to redeem! This is a movie that makes you upset, restless, and sick to the stomach. <br /> <br /> Bad behavior. Lame story. Dire consequences. Horrible, painful dialogue. Dead Space has it all!
