I bought this DVD of Chuck Norris, knowing that it was one of his earliest films, and he shows. We all know that he will never win an Oscar for his game, but we are not following this. Although there have been several earthquakes in California since this film was shot, there have been no deserts or hills between Hwy.99 and I 5. Presumably, Billy went from 99 to 5 by 120, a distance of less than 15 miles. I would like the authors, producers and directors of these films to at least see the map. As a truck driver who spends a lot of time in California, I could tell from the very beginning that the geography was wrong. However, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. So take your Doritos and adult drink and enjoy time travel.
