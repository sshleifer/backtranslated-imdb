Where should I start? The story was so bad that it must have been written in a school film club! The game was so wooden that I felt sorry for the actors! One actor even reminded me of how a deer should look, looking into the headlights of a car! Another actor has such a constant look of constipation! But it was the dialogue that takes the cake! <br /> <br /> Our hero says to his captors - everyone has automaton in his hands - if you put your finger on the imprisoned woman, you will be dead. After a moment, the strongest guard, built like a truck, and the only female prisoner who goes to him. When our fearless leader, who has this very annoying squeaky gangster voice, finds out about this crime, he calmly approaches the guard, while machine guns teach him, and in no time breaks this giant guy's neck, as if he is breaking a toothpick! Then he stands in line until all the villains with their machine guns do absolutely nothing, but in fact shout at him! <br /> <br /> I could go on and on! This film is the jewel of the camp; and if you have some sense of humor, it is guaranteed to make you laugh so much that your eyes are watering!
