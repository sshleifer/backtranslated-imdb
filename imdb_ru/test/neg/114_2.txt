I saw the Mogul Video VHS of this. This is another one of those old 1980s distributors whose catalog I would like to have! <br /> <br /> This film was rather meager. Although “Do not look in the attic,” is repeated, the main warning that repeats itself is: “Do not go to the villa.” Just getting into the villa is a bad idea. The character does not go to the attic until there is no movie in the hour, and in fact he should have done it earlier because of what they learned there. <br /> <br /> The film begins in Turin, Italy, in the 1950s. Two men fight, and the woman tells them that the villa makes them do it. One man kills another, then regrets it, and the woman pulls out a knife and stabs him. She leaves the villa, and after she leaves him, the chair itself moves (what's the point?), But when in the garden the hand goes up on the ground and drags it to the ground. <br /> <br /> From there today, thirty years later. There suddenly appears a session that has nothing to do with the film. Children of the woman from the prologue inherit the house. The main daughter is played by the same actress who played her mother. At least one of the two men in the prologue seems to reappear as another character. She is haunted by some warnings not to go to the villa, but they all do, because if they don't use it, they lose it. People are dying. A lawyer who won all his cases is trying to investigate a little. The ending is pretty poor. Why was the family cursed? Sorry, boring movie. <br /> <br /> On the back of the video box there is a funny rejection of the small print that says: “The scenes depicted on this package can be an impression of the artist and do not necessarily represent the real scenes from the film. In this case, the lid of the box is an illustration that more or less accurately depicts the aforementioned woman dragged into the underground scene, although there are two hands, and the woman is different. It's true, sometimes the cover has nothing to do with the film. I also recall seeing a reviewer with a bad scale of movie predictors, in which films with illustrations on the cover, instead of photos, received at least one point for this.
