In fact, the first two movies “Critters” were already silly, but in a good and exciting way. This film is more like a B-film, which is stupid, but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> This is the first sequel, which really does not follow the plot of the first two films. Basically, all the characters are new, and this time there are no bounty hunters (well, no matter how cool, because the bounty hunter appears in this film too late), and the budget for it has clearly decreased. To save even more money, the film was shot close to part 4, which I imagine will be just as bad as it immediately follows this film and was made by the same people as with this one. <Br /> <br /> This is just a typical B-genre movie, in which there is nothing original or bringing in entertainment. This makes "Critters 3" a real redundant extension, which you can easily do without. Of course, it could have been a lot worse for this film, but it’s not very good either. The film just falls apart like science fiction / horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> It is also strange to notice how Critters suddenly changed in this film. This time they are about twice the size of their regular size, without giving reasons, and they are even more like Gremlins in this film than in the previous one. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting only because it was the debut of the Leonardo DiCaprio feature film. He was about 17 years old in this film and, of course, he looks childish-faced, as he is now. I like to look at this famous actors in their early roles. It's nice to see how they act, and if their style has improved and changed over the years. Of course, DiCaprio was only getting better, but he already passed on his lines, just as he does in our day. <br /> <br /> Indeed, too stupid and lame film. <br /> <br /> 4/10
