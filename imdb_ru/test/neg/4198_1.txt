I rented Dark Harvest (first) because it looked like a stupid monster-on-box thrill-like experience. Scarecrow also scares me. The film had an effective sequence of headlines, but it was followed by rather flimsy ones (flat, poor lighting, acting, editing, directing ...). I recently noticed that DH 2: The Maize had a rather extensive advertising campaign. I thought that maybe the first one was slightly successful, so they increased the bid a bit, perhaps adding some big budget scares and effects from scary stuffed animals. Well, there is no stuffed video ... Not a problem. The problems begin in DH 2 with a sequence of headings that looks like an unfinished concept, with strange shapes and stripes erasing headlines and whatnot. As for the real photo ... every time the sun shines in the frame, you will have all these blasted squirrels confirming that you are watching some ultra-low budget mini DV project that some Midwesterner was shooting on their farm uncles. The game did not act at all. The cheap robbery of the Shining Twin Girls was below the standards of a novice film student. Editing was extremely amateur and lazy. The sound was sharp and intermittent. (for example, every time the editor cuts a new frame, you will see here the perspective of changing the sound). It was as if someone had gathered his friends and family (actors), took out a video camera on a corn field for three days, turned on the light for night episodes (no kidding - this is what they actually did), burned some cassettes, put in the footage in their computer, cut out a (very) rough version, threw it into some kind of music, went around any creative sound work or mixing, recorded it directly on a DVD and threw it on a video store shelf. Any horror fan should be offended by this type of direct work with a video that is devoid of ANY skill or style. The fact that a person owns a video camera and can get some kind of image on film does not mean that it should be made public. If I could give it a rating lower than one, I would.
