We thought it was one of the worst films ever. I had to voluntarily watch the end. The novel was not believable; characters were not developed; love affair had almost no meaning; it was wrong; and the scenery was absolutely stupid, because they were (in my opinion) similar to the way the Adams family goes on holidays ... just creepy, gypsy and cheesy; and OUTERBANKS usually do not look like those at home on the surf; and who would have spent the night in one during a hurricane, if it were not theirs. Also .. it was not realistic. hurricanes warn you to batten hatches. <br /> <br /> A friend was superfluous; and did not fit the story. What did the civil war have to do with external banks anyway? I should also mention the wardrobe ... did D. Lane have to have a scarf / pashmina / shawl in every scene? This was exaggerated. She looked good enough not to hide things; without making them appear as with light pants. <br /> <br /> Finally, Iâ€™m concerned about the impact on our landfills, when everyone should get rid of this stupid, and I mean STUPID movie !!!! Do not fall for the deception about this !!!!!! We have done. Not even watchable.
