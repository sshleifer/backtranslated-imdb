If you want to see an example of how not to make a movie, then you need to watch it. I myself, without the experience of filming, could achieve more. The script is ridiculous with a weak plot, and there is no effort for any reasonable structure. To fill this gap, you might think that the action would be decent, right? <br /> <br /> Since the acting, editing, and general unification of the film are terrible, the only saving grace is the terrible performance of the lead actor. The reason why he is the saving grace is that he acts so sincerely bad that he must get Oscar for it. At least some recognition for laughing at him so much. <br /> <br /> Throw the body of a dead woman after all the men shoot (where did she come from?), Click on the semi-automatic trigger dozens of times. while the sound engineer shoots two effects of the shot, a reflection of the film crew in shades of Kool Mo Dee, the one and only SINGLE music track for the TOTAL film, a non-original script that has no logic; This is the perfect recipe for a really very bad movie. In fact, it is much more fun to find mistakes than to try to find something positive. Avoid at all costs.
