This film is an absolute disgrace! I thoroughly enjoyed the original airport, and I can't believe how the very same people could produce this chatter nine years later. First, the acting is bad. The original were the actors who previously starred in high-quality (not related to the disaster) films, but this uses the actors who have already starred in films about disasters (Blakely, Kennedy, Wagner). In addition, the character of Patronie George Kennedy seems to be moving very fast. He is currently the lead in the film, but his character is not strong enough to bear it: he has lost the charm and humor of Airport (1970), and now the character is just boring. Did I mention the plot? Is it generally believable that someone sent a rocket after Concord ?? NOT !!! There are also too many loose ends; scenes that have nothing to do with the plot. The scene where the balloon lands on the runway, chasing a thief at Charles de Gaulle airport - two such scenes. Both that and another would be interesting - if only they had any relation to the real story. There are also many unanswered questions: why does Patroni open the window and light a flash on another plane? Why does Robert Wagner's character kill himself? (He should have another stupid and expensive way: "Why is there no investigation after the rocket nearly blows up the Concorde? Why are the rear projections so bad?" (It looks like the animation rocket follows Concorde; although it works well when the plane lands in Paris) Why does Patroni think he is in a flight simulator? (When he turns Concorde over) Why does he receive the hero's greeting in the cabin after scaring passengers? The end is so poor, if you can call it an ending? Their one-dimensional nature, no one seems to notice this. The blessing given to the young couple on the plane by the girlâ€™s coach is Schmalans, the person who is annoying to play the saxophone, and the woman with the bladder problem is just stupid. and when she says to Wagner that she still loves him is pretty awful. This film was supposed to be the culmination of the previous Three films at the airport: instead, it is devilish, perplexed, full and complete waste of time, money, energy, celluloid and "talent" !!!!!!! Remember when Patroni asked the French pilot, "Has he ever landed on his stomach"? This film certainly makes a belly on his stomach and lands on his pointed nose ...
