I was so disappointed in this movie. I am very familiar with this case, having read not only the book by Mark Furman, but also the much superior book by Timothy Dumas, “The Wealth of Evil: The True Story of the Murder of Martha Moxley in America’s richest society” Anyone who watches MURDER IN GREENWICH should know that they are watching the story of Mark Furman, and not the story of Martha Moxley. This film is nothing but the ego journey for Furman. Just watch his character as if he were the second coming (yes, even when women are looking at him). Actors playing children look too old for their roles, and the memories of the 1970s are completely unconvincing. If there is a hero in this story, then this is Martha's family, her mother Dorothy and brother John. They supported this matter for two decades before Furman entered it to make a name for himself. They and Martha deserve to tell a true story.
