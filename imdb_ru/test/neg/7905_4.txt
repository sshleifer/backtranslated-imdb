This film was not too funny. It was not so terrible. Just a fun plane ride soul. This is a black flight with a disco-ass, beautiful bar and stewards. The plot introduces you to the idea of ​​black (not race or color, but “style”) of an airplane with the same style of black humor. At times there are wonderful rare scenes, for example, when the main character uses a “regular” toilet in a “normal” plane. Check this. However, there are lulls, and I find them most in the character who played Soul Pilot. Watch to find out who it is. In general, this is a funny movie. Tom Arnold adds fun to his "hacker." This is one movie to watch when you play poker, when you are drunk or just a vegetarian.
