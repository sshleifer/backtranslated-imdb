The fact that this film represents a good quality in the basement is a real shame, but back in the 1940s it was the only type of film created for theaters serving black audiences due to segregation. Thus, while MGM, Warner and all other major studios were making extremely sharp films, tiny studios with a limited budget remained in disarray with what they had. And after watching this movie, it becomes obvious that it took a lot of energy to create a movie, even if it is an aesthetically rather lousy movie. Some actors were not particularly good (especially the French guys), the scenery was minimal, and the plot was completely stupid, BUT the film also had good music - from different styles: from classical to jazz, rhythm and blues. This is thanks to many talented, but largely unrecognized black performers. <br /> <br /> Now, as for the plot, he was completely stupid and stupid, but still watchable. I liked seeing Tim Moore (Kingfish from AMOS 'N ANDY) a drag, as he made the ugliest woman in cinema history (including the Bride of Frankenstein and many others) - probably because of the fact that not a drag, he was a rather ugly but funny guy. If a man pretending to be a woman really looked distantly like a woman, I doubt that this film would have worked as well. Seeing this ugly man with a rubber face and a stupid wig, still hotly wanted by three fans, was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> This is not a very good film, but from a historical point of view it is fascinating and a great viewing for young people to find out how America was for blacks in this era. Very interesting and fun time capsule.
