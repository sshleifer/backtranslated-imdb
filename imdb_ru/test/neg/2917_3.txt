In this unconvincing sound film by Harold Lloyd there is not the slightest laugh, and the question arises: isn’t that same Lloyd the same one that caused all these delightful and funny silence? when we can hear him speak, and the slow, restrained pace replaces the insane antics of his silence. Lloyd plays the young son of a missionary who grows up in China and then transfers to modern New York, not knowing how life is arranged outside of his Chinese village. He considers himself an unlikely winner in the mayoral election and is quickly infuriated by all government organizations, because he refuses to look the other way in the face of rampant corruption. When he is set up in an attempt to confuse him, he decides to play as dirty as everyone else, and sets the false execution of every rogue in New York as a scare tactic. This dark satirical ending seems out of place next to everything else in the film, but this is the only part of the film that comes to life in the distance. Everything else is boring. <br /> <br /> I don’t like to admit that Harold Lloyd’s film fails because I really like it, but I have no choice with that. <br /> Evaluation: D
