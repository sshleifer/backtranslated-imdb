First of all, let me say that I do not in any way deny the importance of this subject - rather the opposite. I am a Pole, and I knew about the Katyn massacre long ago (in fact, two members of my family died there), so I was looking forward to this film. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think that the main problem lies in the script, which contains too many plots and characters, none of which are designed properly. Characters are painfully one-dimensional; their stories are intertwined, but have no common meaning. In my opinion, the actors are not able to show their abilities. The exception is Andrzej Čira, depicting Jerzy - the only interesting character. I wish the story was more focused on him. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film lacks emotion. Before I saw it, I thought I would be touched, if only for sentimental reasons - but in fact I was watching it with a strange feeling of detachment everywhere, except for the final execution scene. This is done well, and its placement is interesting and provides a climax, although the idea of ​​the Lord’s Prayer, which is read in unison by the executed officers, seems a bit far-fetched. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I believe the film may have some educational value for those who are not familiar with the depicted historical events, but, in my opinion, it fails as a piece of cinema.
