I will keep it to bullet points, so here goes: 1. Very poorly written. 2. Tries to be like the Resident Evil. 3. Zombies are slow and obedient one minute, next minute Mad mad. 4. Never seen blood so easily cleaned! 5. The special effects are not as good as the original "Day of the Living Dead." 6. Acting is not as good as "Brave and beautiful." 7. It looks like it was written in 1 week and made the following week. <br /> <br /> The Basicaly Med team and special forces are sent to an infected zombie university to find the first zombie and extract the serum for the treatment of the plague. Everyone dies except for two main stars so predictable, although they survived without weapons . However, the special forces (who studied at a kindergarten scout school) killed 1 zombie, although they had a weapon. Also required is a jerk on hand to fill in any gaps. Total trash load.
