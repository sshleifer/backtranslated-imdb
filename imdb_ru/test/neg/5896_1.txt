This documentary was very amateur. This could be done by college students. Assuming that this is the case, my assessment is as follows. Content: C, Sound Quality: F, Cinematography: F, Acting: D, Movie Soundtrack: F, Casting: C, Boobshot: A ...... Overall rating: D <br /> <br /> I I realized that I was getting seasick when we walked through the streets with characters, bouncing with each step of the operator. My mother-in-law even changed the batteries in her miracle ear, and she could not hear the muffled dialogue. Extensive post-production editing and CGI would not have helped this bomb. These students would barely pass my course. I advise ... do not waste your time or money on one "A."
