"The Adventures of Sebastian Cole" talk about a boy named Sebastian (Adrian Grenier), who imagines that at some point he became a writer, given that he really makes an effort. This film appears to be the years when it receives writing material, years of adventure, hence the name, and the previous quote. In it we see very typical histories of coming of age and warnings about love, drugs and sex ... changes. Yes, there is a small twist here, which is very interesting, and this is what Sebastian’s stepfather (Clark Gregg) makes a very early decision to get a sex change, which has a huge impact on Sebastian’s family and his relationship with his step Dad. <br /> <br /> Clark Gregg plays Hank / Henrietta, Sebastian's stepfather, and he is very good at playing the role, very likely, not being on top, and the film could have gone quite easily this way, Fortunately, they did not . Adrienne Grenier, whom I know only from Entourage, is also very good in his role as Sebastian, and he and Gregg have a great relationship on screen. It is always interesting to watch how relations between these guys (?) Develop, and sometimes they are really heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> And this is the best that this film has to offer. Unfortunately, this brings mediocre cinematography, directing and cinematography. This is not bad, but it is far from being good or unforgettable in the least. Symbols are also poorly written, and from the very beginning it becomes clear how most of the arcs will turn out. The only really exciting character is Hank / Henrietta Clark Gregg. I have already said that Grenier acted well, but Sebastian's character is not only unattractive, but absolutely unbelievable. I honestly do not understand why someone from the audience will be guided by his character in everything he does. He jokes, whines, deceives, lies, and he lacks any aspirations except to be a complete slacker. It would be different if he was a minor character or comedian, but to have him in the spotlight and ask to be serious about the character? Come on. <br /> <br /> And I'm not against this film, but I just want to say ... choose a different song in all these films, Hollywood! No More Where's My Mind from the Pixies, we all know that this is a good song, stop using it in any other movie! <br /> <br /> I feel that I can just tear up more and more of this film except, frankly, I did not hate it. I just didn’t care about it and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. "The Adventures of Sebastian Cole" is not a bad and not boring film, it just is not very good and exciting. This is very uneven, and the script could use quite a lot of work. I guess the point of the film is to look at the life of the writer before he did it, and it worked ... if this writer had produced fiction that I would not like to read.
