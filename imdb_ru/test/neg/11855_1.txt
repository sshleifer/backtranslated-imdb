The only reason the question mark is in parentheses is NOT because I haven’t seen every movie that was released in 2001. This is because this film was shot PARTIALLY only in 2001. The rest was stolen from OTHER dinosaur films by Roger Korman, Carnosaurus 1-3. <br /> <br /> I have a confession. Carnosaur 2 is probably one of my favorite B-films. He borrows so much from James Cameron's “Aliens” that it’s not even funny. But I love it. I can't explain exactly why. It just works for me. I liked the scenery, I liked the cinematography, I liked how they borrowed from "Aliens." It is a bit ironic that at some point Cameron was a Corman understudy with films such as Battle for the Stars (1980). <br /> <br /> I have a Carnosaur trilogy on DVD, and most of all I can say for the first part that he has moments. The most I can say about the third is that it took me five years to find it watchable. <br /> <br /> Now we have “Raptor”, which does NOT continue this series. Instead, he borrows ALL scenes from the Carnosaur trilogy and builds a film around it. And somehow, Roger Corman was able to get Eric Roberts and Corbin Burnsen to do it. I'm not saying that Roberts or Burnsen have any career growth. But both of them were at one time those who could be called REPEATIVE actors. Not here. Of course, the actors react to effects that they do not even see during the filming. Here, however, they react to inappropriate footage from films that are between five and eight years old. There is even a sheriff, whose costume was modeled immediately after the character of "Carnosaur 1". Apparently, there was too much sense to get the original guy back. <br /> <br /> When the Raptor was announced, I was a little excited. However, I was disappointed when Korman said that they would use the old dinosaur models from Carnosaur. Obviously, after this interview, Corman decided that he would not even do that. And the point is not that he could not find an FX team for this. The script for this was clearly written, taking into account that the plot was to be built around the already existing video material. <br /> <br /> Don't compare this to Ed Wood. Ed did better than that. At the very least, he used Bela's footage only once in one film. There are ways to incorporate the footage into the film, and Raptor raises this frowning technique to a new minimum. Even if you liked Carnosaur 3: Primary Views, stay away from Raptor.
