If you need a complete waste of time, because pulling fluff from the navel, cleaning wax from the ears or tiling it is your idea of ​​carnival adventures, then you don’t want to miss it. <br /> First, forget the VHS cover. NO body in this film looks so attractive (i.e., Indian girl). Someone else noticed that the one who posed for the cover is not the same girl, and I agree. The cover is the MOST addictive thing in this movie. <br /> <br /> To put it in perspective, I bought this VHS for 99 cents at K-Mart and three minutes, no, 40 seconds in the movie, I knew I was frustrated. <br /> <br /> I finished watching it, because 1) I still paid 99 cents and, 2) it may have been an accident that some scene in this turkey cost more than jammed bread. <br /> <br /> It was not. <br /> <br /> Good grief, Fonda. I know that it was difficult for you to play roles when you did it, but it is under you.
