I went to the cinema to watch a preview of this movie, without knowing anything about it. Learning the name of Jennifer Lynch and seeing the 18 certificate, I realized that it could be unpleasant. In fact, I found the movie a farce. I found myself giggling at disbelief because of his parts. The game is terrible - Bill Pullman and his funny twitching face. I almost regret the actors, although the script does not give them any chance of plausible interaction with the character. After some shocking incident (there is a lot to “try” and shake the viewer in this film), two characters share a beer and talk about the weather. Everything was overpriced, or it was thought that it was clever, although in reality it was obvious! The performance of a little girl named Stephanie was the best in the film. Quiet and intense. I really could not recommend this film to anyone. His violence without meaning, funny characters, bad game, bad script and just stupid.
