... and it's a damn shame! Please make the sun rise and make it burn all copies of Dracula 3000. This must have been the worst vampire film of the new millennium so far (I haven’t seen REIGN IN DARKNESS yet, but they are not getting much worse than this). Do not be fooled, be a cool cover version of H.R. Gigeresque in the film. It's so bad, it's almost fun. I can not describe all the emotions of this film. I laughed at my ass, screamed at the screen, was numb, sat there, numb, nodding incredulously ... In this film it says "cheap and cheese." The best thing about this movie is the opening credits and starting footage, which show a more or less good CGI of two space ships. But when Casper Van Dyne's voice-over is turned on, you start to smell something suspicious. Indeed, after this, everything quickly unfolds. <br /> <br /> The crew of the rescue ship finds an abandoned ship "Demeter", which seems to be moving to the ground. They enter it, thus sealing their fate. This film is, above all, shameless low-budget plagiarism Alien, mixed with vampires. Up until the plot turns, Erica Eleniak's character, Aurora, shows that she is a robot. Kulio is very worried about the fact that he smokes dope, the bloodsucker 187 (pffff, hood code as the name?!?!). The character Casper Van Dien is named Captain Van Helsing (hahaha!), And he looks like ... well, in general, Casper Van Dien. Udo Kier in the role of Captain Varna, the former commander of Demeter, is shown only on the monitor screen, and he really has problems reading his auto-replica lines (poor Udo, what are you doing in this film?), And then we have Langley Kirkwood as Count Orlock, one of the most pitiful and ridiculous Draculas who have ever distinguished the silver screen. Just look at his outfit. Instead of some awesome futuristic black suit or something like that, he wears a cheap old school fringed Halloween costume. Did you think that Richard Roxburgh was unconvincing, like Dracula in VAN HELSING? Then wait until you see a Langley play! <br /> <br /> This time the designers threw overboard. The interior of Demeter looks like a cross between an oil tanker and an old metallurgical plant, which they decorated with terrible lights and colors of green, pink, blue and yellow. The preacher must have forgotten that this film takes place in the 3000th year, because the characters use weapons that look like today's .45 magnums, and “Prof” uses a non-motorized, not floating wheelchair. To move, you need to push it. <br /> <br /> In addition to one dried up corpse, several breakdowns and one dismemberment, there is no blood. Both vampire fangs and contact lenses look fake like hell. Add to this the lamest, stupidest and sharpest ending in history: the Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of one final (bloody) autopsy with Count Orlock, they are locked in the control room. Then Aurora explains that before her program was updated and she joined the drugs, she was Proteus 3.2 PB, in other words: a bot boot. Therefore, she says: "Well, what are you waiting for." Humvee replies: “I don’t need to tell me twice. Come on, girl, ”lifts her up and ...“ BOOM BOOM !!! ”The ship explodes and loans roll. No sex scene, no Erica showing off her boobs, no bloody climax ... One more shot of Udo Kira reading a line on the monitor and it's over. <br /> <br /> So, this film It is necessary to watch every lover of a bad movie, but I have to warn them: sometimes it becomes very painful. And anyone who claims that VAN HELSING, UNDERWORLD, or even QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is the worst film about the vampires of the new millennium, is clearly insane or just has not seen Dracula 3000.
