After watching this movie, I felt nauseous in my stomach, and if I saw one more minute, I would have to hurry to the bathroom and wrest before dawn. A sick movie that was NOT funny and didnâ€™t cost any money at all. If anyone wants to watch this movie, do not do it! Your children will never forgive you and will be sick for a week. Therefore, if you value the education of your child and want to stimulate his consciousness, do not watch this film. I beg you, do not!
