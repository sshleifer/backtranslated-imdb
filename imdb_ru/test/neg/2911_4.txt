A pro-American propaganda film about hostilities that was released in 1942 says that the children of East Side are becoming tough against any Japanese they notice in their area when they find out that they are too young to be counted. Eventually, they learn that they were mistaken in their distrust of some people, but also accidentally stumbled upon a spy ring, which they then decided to destroy. The film is quite harmless in its fashion, although some may be offended, considering how innocent Asians really stood out during World War II. Overall, this is a fairly common effort, and Leo Gorsy and Hantz Hall would have the best moments, the best of which tend to come here when they are free.
