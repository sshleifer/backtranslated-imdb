Franco Nero acts as a ninja Cole who comes to the rescue of his military friend Frank Landers (Alex Courtney) and his charming wife (Susan George) to protect them from the bandit (Christopher George), who wants land. Things get even harder when a gangster hires Cole’s old arch-enemy (Sho Kosugi), who is also a ninja. An ineffective thriller with better production values ​​than most ninja films cannot bring life to the environment or, for that matter, the action scenes. Bad effort around.
