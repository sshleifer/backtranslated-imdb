When you look at the cover and read material about it, a completely different type of film comes to mind than the one you get here. On the other hand, maybe I read a summary for another film called “Mausoleum”, since two films with that title were released at about the same time, and in both were shown plots that had common elements. However, reading material about this film here, I know that I have seen this, and not the one, and this film is even smaller than one could imagine a film with such a name. I'll be honest, I expect more from a zombie-type picture, and you get it to some extent in this film. However, there are still many things related to occult and strange forces, as indicated by the initial scene of the people whom the coroner picks up at the beginning of the film. The film also has the old theme of children going where they don’t belong to, to have some kind of crazy party, in this case it's actually a mausoleum. In another film, I don’t think that in fact this key feature plays that prominent role in the film, and I see that this score is also higher, but still it was not the film I was expecting.
