This film was very close to being a good film. The direction should be smoother in order to move from one to the other in order to make it more believable. In particular: the need for the main character to escape is not clear enough. Is he trying to kill himself? Is he trying to escape? It seems his life is not so bad, so it becomes more difficult for him to swallow what he so much wants to give up his life. In addition, it is not very clear how “in love” he fell in love with Jennifer Jason L. If the film had been reworked with even more attention to these details, it would be great. On the other hand, for an indie film it's very good! Maybe if you have a couple of drinks to dull your logical thinking, it would be more fun ... <br /> <br />
