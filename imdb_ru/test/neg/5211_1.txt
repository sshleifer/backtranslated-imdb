How did these guys get the money to make this movie? The lack of a script is one thing, but the cinema makes you cry. A hand-held camera can make a big difference to the look of a movie, but in this case you need a photographer who knows what he is doing. I know well that the actors are amateurs, but this does not protect, because the director may be the least talented director in Sweden. It would be a shame for the industry if he (or someone from the team for that matter) was given the money to make a film again. This film simply reinforces the argument that Sweden produces too many films every year.
