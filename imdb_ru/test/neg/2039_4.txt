Something boring, rather rude, a bit disturbing, it was not terrible, but not too good. However, when the statue comes to life, there are some creepy details that support this scene. Nothing much happens, and the film just feels like a scum. I was happy when it was all over, and I do not believe that this is a true story ... very surprised that on average about 6.
