The movie Soultaker is essentially an older form of Final Destination, in which several teenagers, broken by cars, separate their souls from their bodies and have to deceive the death pursuing them ... The film has its own moments and its concepts, the idea of ​​disoriented souls is to separate The body is a pretty neat idea ... If this movie were redone with some good actors / actresses and some amazing special effects, it could be very cool ... As for the movie itself, I recommend watching MST3K Version, clean in rsiya may be too dull to look through it, unless you enjoy bad movies, in which he plays the brother of Martin Sheen ...
