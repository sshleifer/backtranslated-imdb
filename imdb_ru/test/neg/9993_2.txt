When I read the script on the Internet, I thought that Capote needed pruning. Having just seen it on PPV, I can tell you that he was not circumcised, he was killed like this poor family! Example: in the script, Truman duplicates Sean's "Enchanting"; here he is "Mr. Sean". <br /> <br /> Badly enough, the lovers of this film remove the flames from Capote and break his circle (do we really believe that they thought so little about Nell, they crippled her a little? Opus, how disgusting is a joke?) Smith is in this very sensitive sacrifice, even though he shows how the Riots are sent. It is one thing to deceive the facts, and another to throw the ball: executions were carried out between 12: 45-1: 19 am, April 14; Truman show in prison after 22 hours! <br /> <br /> I was absolutely not thrilled with the "game". Keener doesn't even try to sound like a native of Alabama. The way Cooper kept shouting "Alvin!", I waited for the Chipmunks to appear! Hoffman gives us not a charming gadfly, but a wretched scum who sees a terrible act with his ticket in a big time. When Hoffman whines about the fact that he was “tortured” by endless calls, I wanted to give him a shotgun so that he could do us both a favor and blow our brains!
