Not long ago, I bought a cheap VHS tape called "Just Rambling Along", allegedly with Laurel and Hardy. Being a little familiar with their results and not recognizing this title, I made the painful decision to part with the whole dollar and buy it. Having played the film, I identified the film as "HOPE FOR THIS." Of course, Mr. Laurel was nowhere in the cast, which makes the packaging of this product criminally deceptive. Even worse, the quality is terrible. It looks like it was made with 8 mm film. He had some suitable background music. Actually, seriously, the tape costs money if you just want to understand what the movie looks like. In my opinion, this is a decent, but an extraordinary short. IMDb should add JUST RAMBLING ALONG as an alternative title for this film, which, by the way, was the name of Stan Laurel's 1918 film!
