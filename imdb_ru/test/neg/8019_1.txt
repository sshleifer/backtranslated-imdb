In the 1960s, a couple of teenagers had sex on the beach. It's all. They say that they are fifteen, and one of the actors is really twenty-five. Perhaps this film was somewhat revolutionary in 1978 from the point of view of “forbidden” themes, but I cannot imagine that at that time everything that was shown in Esmiko Limon was considered taboo. <br /> <br /> Small dialogues are mixed with disco music, which is even smaller. The choice of songs includes nothing but the very very famous “classical” ones that still sound on every second radio station today. The plot of the American pie is not much different, but at least a little ridiculous. Eskimo Lemon is boring, flat and not aesthetic. It is almost incredible that he had six sequels!
