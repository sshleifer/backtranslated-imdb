I really love horror movies and try to give everyone I see as many credits as possible (or sometimes more), but this really pushes the ticket ... most of the actors were very similar, but hardly any of them could play at all but then think again about the writing / dialogue of this mess ... some nice makeup, but completely ridiculous specials. Overall, I give it 3 out of 10 - and I have second thoughts about it !!
