A multimillionaire marries a female doctor. He did not work for a day, and she is devoted to her profession. He sees her off every day. Something must give. <br /> <br /> Our hero, Henry Fonda, finally decides to do something with his life. He becomes a salesman in a department store, but he is soon dismissed because poorer people need work. Meanwhile, Dr. Helen Hunt (Barbara Stenwick) quit her practice? What to do? <br /> <br /> Kirk (the Foundation) is buying a bankrupt hospital, and now they will be happy to help others while they survive. <br /> <br /> What is written here? Irritated by her husband, Dr. Hunt says: "You behaved like a Gestapo." It must be a comedy. Bullshit. <br /> <br /> Very boring, tedious movie. Very little is happening here.
