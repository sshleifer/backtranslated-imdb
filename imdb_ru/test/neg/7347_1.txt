When I first watched this show on the Cartoon Network, I found it uninteresting. Then I read a lot of good messages about this show and decided to watch it. The show was so boring. Each episode was predictable. Moreover, there is no logic in this show. Girls with hypermarkets who go to school and sometimes do such nonsense, 99% of episodes start with a monster attack on Townsville, then the mayor (he is a fool, he is NOT funny, he is so stupid that I imagine how he became mayor). The professor, yes, was supposed to be the smartest person on this show, but actually ... He didnâ€™t even find the difference between the monster and his brother. Narrator's comments also make this show boring. Because they also have similar lines at the beginning of each episode and at the end. Also the animation is very strange. All but the main characters, shown ugly. Also in each episode, this show gives you life lessons, and this means that it is aimed at young children, but if you look closely, you will see that there is a lot of violence and even blood (!!!) in them during their battles.
