Ken Burns's “Baseball” is a worthy documentary ... it presents the clear origin of the game, a magnificent depiction of his early years and baseball heroes. There is a lot in this movie for any baseball fan ... who said that the film has several obvious flaws. <br /> <br /> 18 hours is just too much for human attention. Clearly, Burns has stretched his film to fit his nine-inning concept. It’s not even a heavy 18 hours ... the pace in each segment is slow, almost gloomy ... the music is always nostalgic and thoughtful. Has baseball ever been exciting and fun? Why is every player and his achievements presented in the form of tragedy? The talking head behind the spoken head turns each pitch into an emotional upset of the heart, shouts about baseball as a metaphor, baseball like Americana, psychology and theology of baseball ... enough! This is a thick, disgusting thing. Billy Crystal is here to sell us all the Yankees Hokum he sold us earlier. Ken Burns uses the national anthem as the main song of the series and can play Take Me Out To The Ballgame as many times as you can snatch. We got it, man. <br /> <br /> Clearly, Burns is a neo-Hollywood fake liberal, so he probably spends a third of the film on the Negro leagues ... these segments were spent on yesterday’s punishment not as open as Kenny today. Shame on you He blames baseball for segregation in the thirties and forties, but does not understand that America was segregated in those times! Burns falls head over heels in love of Baku with O'Neill, a former player from the Negro league, and drools over all shots in which the elderly O'Neill talks about his playing days. Nonsense ... <br /> <br /> Burns would be better off if an adult helped him edit his creation. "Baseball" eventually turns into a soft, sentimental civil rights propaganda disguised as Americana. It is clear that Burns is not a baseball fan ... otherwise he would know that we are watching games, laughing and cheering, not crying and reading monologues ... are you listening, Mr. Burns? There is no crying in baseball.
