In my opinion, the film was funny - a bad dialogue. Whoever wrote the script - please save your day job. This is definitely NO Godfather or Goodfellas. Good to be on the other side of the table - a bad choice of words. Some of the characters were clowns. But what do you expect from a low-budget film without the name of the actors.
