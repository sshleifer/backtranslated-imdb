A shaggy, friendly, but disappointing film has the same old message: if you want to make it in this world, creativity is not enough, you have to live up to your place in society, which means living by (heterosexual) rules that govern us. The dragon queen drama comedy from Australia is basically an upbeat journey of three male friends traveling through the outback in their pink bus called Priscilla. Although this is not a film-formula as such, there are obligatory episodes of the “road film” (gluing together at a fire, facing down to rednecks, etc.). Screenwriter Stefan Elliott watches every potentially vile moment with a bit of humor and sympathy, but there are mysterious gaps in his story, a horrible story about the relationship between a gay and his ex-wife and alienated minor son (both of whom are comfortable - and wise with his lifestyle), and the third act without energy at all. It has some transvestite wicked humor and a pretty cast, but a script that seems to have been softened along the way. ** from ***
