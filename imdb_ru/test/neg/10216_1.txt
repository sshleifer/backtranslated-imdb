I really have to give this bitch more confidence than one star, because there are so many eye-catching lines in the film that it is almost worth the price of hire. <br /> <br /> Acting, if you want to call it that, is so unnatural and far-fetched that Ed Wood actors look like live ones. Sammy, the lonely black character, must be Mimi's husband in real life, because he appears in her other films, but he has zero acting ability. His lines are priceless because of his absurd delivery, although I suspect that the intention was to create a sympathetic character. His old man was reconciled in his other turkey (“Pushed to the limit”) of a budgetless quality for high school, with eyebrows of a cotton ball and hair dyed white. <br /> <br /> In fact, I can’t understand anyone buying this video unless people like to organize their own parties at the Mystery Science Theater and they don’t need a copy of something like that. This is really Beyond Fear-- this is actually Beyond Funny.
