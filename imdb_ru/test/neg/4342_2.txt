The trashy crime thriller "B" of the early 50s, the story is bad, wooden characters, Allison Hayes and Abby Lane are the only two sex sweats that attract attention, but one short shot, only a few frames long, shows the train "el" crossing the river on State Street Bridge, from 6000-series cars built by Pullman, painted in an original 1950 color scheme as they were released in 1950 when the new one. For traction fans like me, this short take makes the picture worth it. I think films like this one, Ulmer DETOUR, D.O.A. with Edmund O'Brien, “The Fugitive” with Harrison Ford and other genres of the film “Noir” (crime dramas in a big city) make this interesting, if not only because I know Chicago and San Francisco well and find out a lot part of the street ground. Otherwise, this is really a boring boring movie!
