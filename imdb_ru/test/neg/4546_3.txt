I'm all about the walking dead, but my mind is still not sure about the walking dead. Unfortunately, the cooling did not help me to make a decision. It's really slow, nothing happens during the first 45 minutes, and I press the "Enhance Movie" button several times. By that time, when well-designed zombies appear, it is already too late, and the director (according to rumors, two people filmed this) does not know how to shoot them. Haggerty, Blair and Donahoe look tired / embarrassed / recovering in some way. I will pay tribute to the film, because it precedes T2, ending with the fact that the villains are frozen from liquid nitrogen. Shriek Show DVD offers an extended promotional video from a day that lasts 8 minutes, and I would recommend that it watch the entire movie.
