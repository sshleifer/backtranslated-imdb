Solomon and Sheba entered the Hollywood legends not for the quality of the film, but for the fact that Tyrone Power died during its creation. I was in 5th grade and I remember well the great news about the days when this tragedy occurred. Then I did not know who Tyrone Power was, but I learned to appreciate all his work. <br /> <br /> I often wonder if Tai had any meaning in this film and what nonsense it proved. He was an unnamed manufacturer of it as well. Maybe he just did not want to meet with critics. It's good that Power really came out with the Witness of the Charge, although you can see it in long frames if you look closer. <br /> <br /> We have a biblical stew here that would probably confuse the greatest Solomon. The several cases described in the Bible, which the Bible treats separately, are woven into one plot with several additions added by Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The real story about the Queen of Sheba is that she went to the trade mission in the Kingdom of Israel, chatted a little with Solomon, came back with a lot of trade goods, and that was so. The story of the novel between her and Solomon is a legend. The ancient kingdom of Sawa is located where Yemen is now, and its people allegedly moved to the African continent, as Ethiopia was founded. <br /> <br /> The Queen never witnessed the famous case of Solomon, in which two women had different claims for a child, and she was not associated with the construction of the First Temple. Nor was she around for the destruction of the same. In this regard, Solomon was also not. <br /> <br /> And she did not participate in the dispute over succession when Solon’s brother Adonijah filed a counterclaim. This is the heart of this movie. Adonijah, hearing the news of the death of King David, declares himself king. Of course, David temporarily meets and says that God came to him and said that Solomon should be his successor. When David hears about what Adonijah did, he says that it was from this that God was thin and Adonijah was greedy. After this, Adonijah proceeds to conspire. <br /> <br /> It seems that everything is in full circle when Ty Power collapsed on the set, fighting with George Sanders in the role of Adoniya. Sanders and Power have been rivals in many films, especially in the movie “Lloyds of London,” which was Power's breakthrough role. If Sanders is not a sophisticated sophisticated man he was in Samson and Delilah, he still remains the biblical hero of Sanders. <br /> <br /> When Power died, Yul Brynner was invited to play Solomon and give a wig so that the existing footage of the Force could ultimately be saved. Brynner gives the dialogue due dignity, but I think he probably regretted giving an injection. <br /> <br /> Gina Lollobrigida is Queen of Sava, and she is charming as a biblical seductress in the tradition of Cecil B. Demil. It seems she has no real conviction, and I assume that she was shocked by the death of Power and the need to do so again and again. Marisa Pavan in the role of Abishaga can give a better idea in the film. <br /> <br /> The real story of Adonia is not as complicated as in this film. He argued with Solomon for continuity and gathered around him a group of some of the court of King David as supporters. Solomon pardoned them once, and then Adonijah asked Abishag in marriage. Abishag in the Bible and here was the adopted daughter of King David in his old age. When Solomon hears this, he decides that Adonijah becomes greedy again and kills him. The Bible mentions someone named Bernius, who went mainly to perform contract hits with Adonian supporters. <br /> <br /> In the film we see an impressive climax associated with the miracle that I was looking for and could not find. It came from the fruitful imagination of director King Widor, who ended a long and distinguished career on an acidic note. It was about Vidor trying to play Cecil B. Demil in a biblical spectacle. <br /> <br /> He did not.
