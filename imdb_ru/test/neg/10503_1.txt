Well, usually I'm fascinated by Z movies. Some actors, directors, writers, etc. In these films there is a piece of talent. They want to reveal this talent, so, unfortunately, they have to communicate with stupid people in order to make their films. But in some Z films, there is at least one thing that may be worth considering. <br /> <br /> Not here. <br /> <br /> As soon as I saw this, I thought ... â€œWow, a fake blade. Believe me, if this movie were the label that would make it the best movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, I underwent the most horrific acting action I have ever seen in my life. Master Kao was bad, so bad that I think some of my neurons in my brain exploded, trying to figure out its effect. I'm still trying to understand his statement and why he raised his voice, uttering certain words ... to add a dramatic effect, I'm sure ... but it was for no apparent reason. Just overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Oh, and here's another black guy in a purple cloak at the end of the movie. The guy in the purple raincoat struggles with the hero for about 30 seconds, but he is so bad that it actually looked like he was afraid to fight. <br /> <br /> The main character and the main villain did a decent job. The main character (Derek Washington) seemed to really know the martial arts.
