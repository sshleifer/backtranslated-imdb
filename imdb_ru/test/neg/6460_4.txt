Why does Guy work for Buddy? Perhaps because Ari was absent in 1995. Why does Don want to be with Guy? To access the buddy. Why does she stay with Guy? I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of things in this movie that I'm not sure about. But Kevin Spacey is a great verbal tsunami, like Buddy Ackerman ?? and quite plausible, because he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> Is the Frank Wailey guy, certainly not in his element, working for Buddy ?? he wants to write and make meaningful films, and not to be a gopher who is verbally insulted for receiving Equal instead of Sweet & Low. <br /> <br /> Dawn Michel Forbes, who also wants to make meaningful films, seems like a way out of the Guy League. <br /> <br /> The end leaves much to be desired.
