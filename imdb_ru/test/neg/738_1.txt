For the lover of the novel “Northanger Abbey” it’s hard to come to terms with this adaptation of the BBC and not throwing objects on the TV screen - in fact, if Jane Austen herself saw this, she would be somewhat surprised and perhaps shocked. The adaptation of Maggie Wade turned Northanger Abbey into what it mocked, a gothic novel (and readers of gothic novels). <br /> <br /> The role of Catherine Morland in adaptation is depicted fairly close to Catherine Austen, the open generous girl whose imagination just runs off with her. But Henry Tilney in the novel is not sniffing, wielding a cane, the juicy hero of the Gothic novel - he teases, almost a handsome man with a dirty room and alive (truly, Henry Tilney is a priest, a charm that is completely excluded from the script). Some of the best scenes from the novel, when Henry, completely imperturbable, outrageously teases literally thinking Catherine on diction, magazines, Mrs. Radcliffe, etc., are not depicted in adaptation. Most of Henry's personality is lost when these scenes are not adapted. In addition, Peter Furth's appearance is not accurate - Henry Tilney should be 24 or 25 years old, with dark hair and brown skin, and not 35 or 40 and blond. <br /> <br /> There are many other absurdities in adaptation. what causes surprise and disgust - who is this marquis and what does she do in this story ?! Why is John Thorpe less stupid, but rather an intriguer? Why is Northanger Abbey a castle? Catherine’s novel, with its romantic visions, awaits hidden passages and dark tapestries, but is very disappointed to find that Northanger Abbey is in fact a comfortable, modern home - another element of satire! Why portray General Tilney drunk? Why does Katherine have strange visions, like Mrs. Allen cuts with her finger, etc.? Katherine's imagination only runs off with her in Northanger, with Henry to correct her gently. And finally, why are so many facts about the Tilney family and the death of Mrs Tilney changed too much? To make the story more horrible? All these oddities and even simpler are too strange to be overlooked. <br /> <br />>
