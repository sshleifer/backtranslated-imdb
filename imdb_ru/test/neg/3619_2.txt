Snake Island is one of those films that, sitting and looking at its amazing level of stupidity, makes us think that the film camera was never invented. The real reason why Plan 9 from Space will hold on to the honorary title The Worst Movie of All Time for some time is not so much due to how bad it is. This is due to the fact that this is the most interesting bad movie you have ever seen. Snake Island is a different kind of bad. Snake island is so bad that it is painful. A stupid premise is combined with a script that was written by monkeys who pressed single-key machines on transparencies, which were then superimposed on each other to resemble dialogue in order to create the most obvious problems here. Filmed entirely on site in South Africa, the environment in which the film takes place is the only element that can honestly be considered well implemented. Many snake snapshots are made up of close-ups that look so surreal that you can ask yourself if the snakes mentioned are CGI, puppets, or real snakes that are fed with very strong drugs. <br /> <br /> William Catt Stars You can call it that, as the author is traveling to an island resort on a river ferry. Along with him is a set of very common, poorly defined characters. It’s all a matter of a random screen recording of who will live to the end, but Catt probably thinks about the dismissal of his agent. The rest of the cast seems to be from the Home And Away acting school, where any contemplation of an unpleasant plot is accompanied by a gaping gaze and a keen eye in all directions. Foley effects are often worse, with one memorable scene where a double-barreled shotgun sounds like rather flat sound effects that usually accompanied shots in games like BioForge. In the meantime, snakes constantly explode or jump at random. It would be more correct to name the film “Snake Holocaust”. <br /> <br /> Of course, no Z-rank horror film or science fiction film today can’t do without unbiased scenes depicting unshaven women in their stripes. As each woman in the cast almost takes off her clothes, the film begins to become less and less Snake Island and more Snake Island orgy. But, as in all the worst heaps, in this case, all that is needed is a lot of settings without real feedback. Sex scenes never happen, and the death of the characters is so flat, so uninteresting, that the whole movie becomes meaningless. Unless you see William Catt, running through a muddy forest, wearing improper cricket gear and smashing snakes in all directions with a cricket bat, is rewarded. For the record, I do not know. I used to think that Anaconda was the worst movie about predatory snakes. I was very, very wrong. At the very least, Anaconda had a serpent to fear if they would suspend disbelief for some time. Some of the snakes depicting killing people are no more than shoelaces from several pairs of combat boots that I wore. <br /> <br /> So, we still have a checklist for bad horror films. Unrecognizable, backward cast and bad audio and visual effects are taken into account. The dialogue is so terrible, so inopportune, that I saw the best composition and performance during some school plays, in which I played many moons ago. Unfortunately, where Snake Island fluctuates in this respect, this is a place that is fatal to all bad movies. In fact, he forgets to be so bad that it is ridiculous. It's so bad that it stops being good after the opening credits and it becomes painful as soon as the actors start talking. Compared to William Cutt’s performance on Snake Island, John Voight’s performance in Anaconda was as Oscar-worthy as Russell Crowe’s in The Gladiator. Not that Voight or Katt were necessarily bad actors, but with a material like you, it's hard to say one word naturally. Listening to some lines here is like being a victim of a violent crime. Thought tends to reject experience, primarily as a self-defense mechanism. <br /> <br /> Because of the aforementioned inability to be funny bad, I gave Snake Island two out of ten. My special score for movies that are so bad that they can't be good, but not so bad as to entertain. It's all so boring or pointless that you might as well watch the test table. The correct way to write "shit" is S-N-A-K-E-I-S-L-A-N-D.
