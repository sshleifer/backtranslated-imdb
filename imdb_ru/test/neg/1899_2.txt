What a frustrating movie. The small southern city is filled with opportunities to study the complexities of interpersonal relationships and dark undergrounds hidden under calm surfaces, as anyone who has read something by Carson McCullers already knows. It does not do any of this. Instead, the authors agreed to cute twinkles, cheap warm fluffs and a banal melodrama. This is similar to a film made for television, and it was filmed without much distinction, but it's hard to imagine what someone could do to make this material interesting. <br /> <br /> Although the most unpleasant aspect is the fact that there are many extremely competent and attractive actors in this cast who are all diligently trying to achieve the best results and do everything they can with them - well, there is no other word for this is nonsense. The tragic waste of talent, in particular, the great Stockard Channing.
