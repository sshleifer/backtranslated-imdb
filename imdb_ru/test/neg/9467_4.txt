The lines in the title of this review are the first lines in the main theme of this film, a surprisingly insane parody of the (in my opinion, terrible) song My Favorite Things from The Sound of Music. And this funny little detail is not the only aspect that makes The Body Shop aka. Dr. Gore (1973) is recommended to my colleagues from Gore / Trash. The film, which was almost entirely created by Yu.G. Patterson Jr., who worked as a producer, writer, director and lead man in the role of Dr. Gore of the same name, is, of course, crap, but there is no doubt that this is funny, and that all participants, especially Patterson, knew about it. that they didn't exactly make a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dr. Brandon (Patterson), a famous, but absolutely insane plastic surgeon, loses his beloved wife, Anitra, a model, as a result of an accident. Together with his hunchbacked assistant Greg (Roy Mehaffy), he now abducts beautiful young women to build himself a new, perfect wife from their body parts ... <br /> <br /> “Dr. Gore” is undoubtedly undoubtedly the film “so it's bad that he is good, ”but he also has qualities that go beyond the usual ridiculous nonsense. Mad science has always been one of my all-time favorite horror themes, and, in fact, it is also one of the coolest themes for the ridiculous Thrush films. Obviously, a snapshot with a minimal budget, Dr. Gore pays homage to Frankenstein, especially to James Wheele's masterpiece The Bride of Frankenstein (1935), and resembles the look of the early Tromy / Herschel Gordon Lewis Gore films such as Blood Feast »(1963) - only that it looks much cheaper and more fragile. Apparently, J.G. Patterson’s motive was not just to make an amusing blood click: being a rather ugly, weird looking guy, his role as Dr. Brandon gave Patterson the opportunity to deal with a couple of hot, barely dressed young women (who would later end up as donors of body parts in Brandon's laboratory ). <br /> <br /> Much of the blood is actually quite well done for an apparently tiny budget. The dialogue includes several very cheerful lines (“Take this, it can be a door ... and put on a coat so that they do not see that you are a hunchback.”). In addition to the aforementioned themed song, “Doctor Gore” also includes a surprisingly cheesy country group performance called “Bill Hicks and Rainbow” - my new favorite group is NOT. For the rest of the film, I kept wondering if Bill Hicks and Roy Mehaffy, who plays the hunchback’s assistant, are twins or even the same person - these two look exactly the same, and have two unrelated fat, red-haired guys who look like this: weird one movie would be a huge coincidence. In addition to J.G. Patterson, most of the actors have never made any other films. This is the first film I've ever seen of Patterson's few. Unfortunately, this man died of cancer in 1975. <br /> <br /> In general, Doctor Gore is a film that is definitely not for everyone. In fact, this is complete nonsense. But it’s also fun and recommended to my fellow amateur strangers and cheap camps. Dictionaries must show a screenshot of this movie under the heading "Trash Bin."
