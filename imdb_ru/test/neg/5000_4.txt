Zombie movies are hot, I love them. Can't get enough. Why I would buy a movie of this caliber, it goes without saying, I just really like zombies. Surprise, it really doesn't look like a zombie movie; low budget, which I can cope with, being deceived, only annoys me. <br /> <br /> A group of horror movie clichés is held in a warehouse / lab / who knows what to avoid outside the firestorm. Panic, shouting, poor lighting and (eventually) zombies will follow. <br /> <br /> Apparently, it’s bad for the filmmakers, as it’s obvious that they really thought they were collecting something good; a serious, scary horror movie. Far from it, this is a boring mess of wooden game, wacky FX, poor lighting, excessive dialogue and excessive editing. <br /> <br /> At first, things go bad when it takes more than 10 minutes. so that the characters will ever sit down and start figuring out what's going on Worse, when another 20 minutes pass, and they are still sitting, trying to understand what is happening. All this is replete with inactive and bad dialogue. <br /> <br /> Finally, someone becomes attached (but not a zombie), and hope only flickers with a touch before the characters are idle again (now). the emotions that each of them generates) about how much this sucks. Me too, guys, me too. <br /> <br /> Zombies are finally here, but no one else looks at that. I think some blood and blood was thrown, but I was too busy praying for loans to quit to notice. And when the screen finally became faded, I felt even more deceived by the meaningless inspirational ending of “Cuba”. <br /> <br /> I pay tribute to the fact that he tried very hard, even if he failed. That and the punk chicken was very hot if fully used. <br /> <br /> I can’t recommend this to anyone except for students looking for no-no signs. <br /> <br /> 4/10
