Well, I had high enough expectations for this. The controversial subject was a good concept. As a horror fan, I confess that I was fascinated and very excited about it. <br /> <br /> It turns out they had a great idea, but it was awfully fulfilled. We'll see. This film seems to work in 3 modes: Happy, Sex and Dark. The problem is that the film never decides who he wants to be. The “happy” parts, in my opinion, should have been contrasted with the “dark” parts, but this does not work. Soundtrack is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> The film goes between these three modes very badly, I can’t even tell how lame the direction and editing is. There is sex in the most unattractive and non-erotic way. I don’t complain, but even for horror standards they were unnecessary and fillers. <br /> <br /> All the characters are incredible, except for Paula (Potenta). Her friend from Munich is a whore, and perhaps one of the most annoying characters in the films I have recently encountered. <br /> <br /> There is a little plot that I will not go into details ... It is not. stupid and in more talented hands would make a good movie. There is even a pleasant twist and a cool plot. Do not try to understand everything, because there are giant holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> All this is done so indecently that you do not care about victims, criminals and all the rest. And to think that it would be great. I can say ONE good thing about it, that the film shed some light on today's unethical medical procedures. With the development of genetics and controversial sciences, this could become a great philosophical film in which these issues are raised and discussed. But you won't find it here, just a series of scenes loosely inserted along with people and things that you don’t care about. <br /> <br /> Skip this and see Flatliners instead, please. <br /> <br /> 3/10
