Before the appearance of Stan Laurel's home video comedy "Kill or Cure" before Hardy was known - to such an extent that it was known at all - only because several episodes were included in the collection of Robert Laurel and Hardy Laughter. 20's. Youngson knew what he was doing: the best gags in Kill or Cure were intact in his compilation, while the rest of this only slightly ridiculous comedy remained on the floor of the cutting room of Youngson. <br /> <br /> Laurel portrays a commercial traveler selling patent medicine, Professor I.O. Dine's Knox-All: This name is the funniest joke in this movie, which says little. I should note that this film dates from 1923, the Tail of the Ban. During the Prohibition, quite a few Americans acquired a patent medicine if it had (aha!) Medicinal properties, therefore — if Knox-All contains alcohol — Stan’s work in this film is less desperate than the one that he and Ollie knew about. I was in Big Business selling Christmas trees in the summer. Too bad for this film, that it is not as funny as Big Business. <br /> <br /> We see that Stan (but does not hear him in this silent film) demonstrates a lively conversation about sales with a person who seems to be paying attention ... until we know that they are outside the deaf-mute, and this man is deaf. A haughty woman appears above the gate: Stan quickly tries to get her attention, moving her fingers at her. Of course, she is not deaf, and she quickly beats him with her umbrella. I found this sequence offensive, NOT because it involves deaf people (deaf people are not a joke), but because it instigates a very widespread misconception among hearing people that they can communicate with deaf people by simply moving their fingers randomly and doing Sharad without actually learning a very complex grammar of sign language. <br /> <br /> More amusingly, in this film the maiden has a favorite canary named Rudolph (as in Valentino), and there is a gag associated with trick photography for giving a person the opportunity to hide behind an object that is already his body. I saw this device in several cartoons and live action films, but I think “Kill or Cure” is the earliest film in which I used it. <br /> <br /> Stan Lorel, an underestimated actor, doing one physical thing here deserves Chaplin or Keaton, in which he conveys his emotions and changes in behavior, moving away from the camera with his back to us. However, Laurel never became a top-notch comedian until she teamed up with Oliver Hardy to form the greatest comedy team in history. "Kill or cure" hardly estimates 3 out of 10.
