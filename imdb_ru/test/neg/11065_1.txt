It seems that there was money behind this film, but it would have been impossible to imagine a film that was poorly planned and executed if I had not really begun to watch it. <br /> <br /> To begin with, as soon as we are in a cave with characters (the usual stereotypes for young people we met in horror films from the early 80s), the film is almost completely close-up. Since the actors are wearing helmet lights, this means that all we see are sparkling lights, alternating with total darkness — we never see what the characters see; so when they shout "Look there!" it remains for us to ask “What ?! Where?! Ultimately, the film has a nauseous, confusing strobe light effect, which does not make sense until we reach the end. <br /> <br /> And I won’t tell you what the “end” means, but you’ll find out if you’ve ever seen the old laughter festival of the early 60s "Ego!" with Richard Kiel. <br /> <br /> But what crazy person would want to create a variation on a theme like “Jehovah!”, which has long been remembered as one of the worst films ever made ?! But this is what we have here guys. Moreover, unlike “Eegah!”, “The Cavern” is not someone's idea of ​​silly fun. It is not available for observation. (I chased him at normal speed 2 times, just to get it over with, hoping that I could actually see something by the end of the film; but when I did, it was just silly.) This film really gave me a nice moment though; since it cost only a couple of bucks, after I got it out of the DVD player, I was able to smash it with my own hands - what a relief!
