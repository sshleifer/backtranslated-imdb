It is useless to try to describe in detail the intricate, excessively melodramatic plot, which includes the bitterness of the Civil War, the bent city boss and other complications. This is all bad. <br /> <br /> Stella Stevens, Andrew Prien, Bo Swanson, William Smith, Tim Tomerson and Lee Majores are all good actors who may not be big stars (or big stars), but always make funny movies. . . <br /> <br /> Everything is wasted in the picture, which looks as if it was taken in a tourist trap in the wild west, and the costumes were borrowed from the local theater department. In fact, most acting skills also seem to be at the high school level, which could not have been so bad if it hadnâ€™t been so pretentious. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood's name is called too easily, days. I think that in this case the comparison is justified. However, I suspect that the old Ed would make a more interesting western than this.
