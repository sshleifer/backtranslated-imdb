It is difficult to criticize a film with a title such as “The Deadly Bed: The Bed That Eats”, in which the ghost narrator who is locked behind the two-sided picture he painted, and the bed that snores and ?? if i'm not mistaken, masturbates. (Now it goes back to his human companions!) In addition, it foams (orange, for whatever reason) to absorb edible products lying on its surface, including apples, wine, fried chicken and, of course, people. Again, suffice it to say that do not expect too much when you see that I assume it is gastric acid? last remnants of anything that orange foam takes ?? dissolve only certain things. It will drink wine, but the bottle is all right, and it will eat away the chicken bone, but the bucket is just fine. Hell, the bed even replaces unused containers. Fun, at one point, it knocks Pepto-Bismol. I had to laugh at that. I don't think they really wanted you to take it seriously. This is a low budget, and it’s very easy to see where they cut costs and save a lot of money. I thought that in a world where there could be a killer Lift and Bloody Beach, this Death Bed can be fun to watch. For reasons that can lead to costs, 90% of the film is offscreen, no one screams or shows extremely low signs of fright / confusion about why the bed can attack (I can think of one thing - and I have never been one of those children who jumped on the bed), and you have to suspend your disbelief for the faith. (The victim loses all flesh on his hands, barely saying “ay.”) Only one scene that lasted too long was very tense? a woman is trying to crawl away just to be dragged away using a sheet. Where are the guys from MST3k?
