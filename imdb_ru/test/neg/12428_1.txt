OMG, another bad movie by Larry Buchanan. This guy didn't learn to stop, did he? First, he gives us science fiction films with a zero budget and lies about the famous dead people, and now he uses the Loch Ness Monster as malicious. <br /> <br /> The “plot” mainly concerns some southerners of the United States pretending to be Scottish campgrounds in Loch Ness. Alas, fishing, oh, I mean Loch Ness, there is an inflatable monster killer who calls himself Nessie and tries to kill people for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that the MST3K film crew has never heard of this movie. Yes, this is also bad.
