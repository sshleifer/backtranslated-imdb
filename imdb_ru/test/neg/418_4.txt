Why they didn't follow the book ... I'm really upset and disappointed. I was looking forward to seeing this film, however, if you read the book (perhaps recently), it can be very difficult to remain objective. My wife did not read the book, and she really liked the movie. <br /> <br /> Causes of disappointment: 1) participation of Kern ... gone with the wind, such a shame, there is a very small part at the beginning where antimatter is created, but even this does not depend on the facts (why not, the fact that Vittoria's father was burned with the first Illuminati brand, and this is how Langdon got carried away would be an ideal beginning for Film_ 2) The storyline between the (deceased) dad and Camerlena completely disappeared ... it completely oblages the anti-matter theft motive 3) The storyline between Langdon and Vittoria Vetroy is completely absent <br /> <In general, too unreliable story line, and I can't understand that Dan Brown let them put his name against it. Maybe I should go back to this film in 10 years, when I can’t remember a great book anymore (I'm afraid I forgot about this book). It’s a pity the negative review spoiled by expectations.
