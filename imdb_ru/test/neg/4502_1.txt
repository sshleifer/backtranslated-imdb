Being a fan of Godzilla for many years, Gamera was a cheap fake for me to benefit from the success of Toho star number 1 in kayu. The monster attack was for me at that time (1975) an almost painful viewing experience. <br /> <br /> Last weekend I attended the annual Godzilla festival, known as G-FEST, where Karl Craig, one of the stars of GAMERA v. VIRAS, appeared. Of course, they showed this film. It was one of the funniest bad movies ever made. Of course, you must be in the right mood to watch this. For example, in one of the scenes, scouts who held a prisoner aboard an alien spacecraft could escape, distracting not too bright aliens. When they realize that they have been deceived, one of them says: "It's funny ... I think these children have lied to us." Even PLAN Nine from outside space cannot boast of such a dialogue. <br /> <br /> It may not be GODZILLA or even GAMERA 3, but this one is a decent waste of time if you look at it in the right mood. <br /> <br /> However, if you want to have fun with the highest quality kaiju, check out the recently released GAMERA 3. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** 1/2 of *****
