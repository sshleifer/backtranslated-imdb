In this horror film, there is not enough horror or even light waiting. Even the blood is not good. The plot will have some promise if it is made by someone who cares about what they write / shoot, but the people who made this film obviously did not. In fact, the film unfolds in a series of episodes and begins as follows: <br /> <br /> The main character insists that she is not crazy. <br /> <br /> “Milo” is hiding in her yellow raincoat or riding a bicycle in front of the car. <br /> <br /> The main character insists that she is not crazy, and talks about his passion as a school teacher. <br /> <br /> Someone dies unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> The main character insists that she is not crazy, and collects several fake sobs. <br /> <br /> We see a sample here? If you do not, you can enjoy this movie. Otherwise, see something else. The budget is low, low, low AND IT SHOWS (unlike, say, EVIL DEAD, which makes you forget about its shitty budget), and the game is bad, bad, bad (with the possible exception of a cleaner). In general, the film is boring, boring, boring. I can not remember a single scene, which in fact would have been successful. In fact, I didn’t like the film so much that I actually turned it off ten minutes before the end, which I very rarely do ... damn, I watched the non-interchangeable MANOS, the CLONES and the WILD WEST. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Spare yourself and see FANTASMU again.
