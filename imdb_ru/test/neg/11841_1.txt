So one Saturday, I fell ill with the flu, and the silver lining was that on the SciFi channel that day a marathon of films about dinosaurs was held - the trilogy "Carnosaur", "Pterodactyl", "Raptor Island". Then I clicked forward on the cable console to see which SciFi movie I put on my glamorous Saturday prime time. Some cinema, about which I never heard, was called “Predator”. I was very excited. The film begins with the fact that some teenagers drive jeeps when they are being chased by velociraptors. I said, “Um, this is weird, it looks almost like a scene in Carnosaur, except for the fact that it was in the middle of this film.” Then I did some really bad things, and then some guy fell into an underground research lab, where he was eaten by a fierce T-Rex. Now I say: “Wait a second, it was also a scene in“ Carnosaur ”. Then, after I saw several scenes obviously cut off from Carnosaur 2, I realized what the hell was going on. Roger Korman and Co. snatched the scenes from the Carnosaur trilogy to use them as action movie scenes woven into the main plot of Dino-begi-amok, and tried to pass it off as an original film. A shame. I don’t know who I’m angry with more, Roger Korman or the SciFi Channel for trying to pass it off as a decent prime time position. The only reason it was worth seeing before it was completed was to choose actors / actresses who looked like their colleagues in the Carnosaur trilogy and guessed which scenes would be shot next. No matter how much I hurt being a dinosaur lover, I have no choice but to give it as low a rating as possible, because I feel completely cut off,
