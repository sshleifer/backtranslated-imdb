I am very passionate about Waverly Hills and watched the film “The Tunnel of Death” for the first time. Couldn't be much worse. Then I heard that the documentary was coming out, and I was excited to think that, since this was a documentary, it would be more serious and would not have terrible special effects. documentary must be. Waverly Hills do not need help with blunt effects, everything is in order, as it is. Tours - $ 20.00 per person and $ 100.00 for an 8-hour investigation for one night. Minimum group of 10 people during the night investigation. Tours must be set in advance. Great spot for the Phantom Hunter!
