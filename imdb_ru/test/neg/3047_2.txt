It starts interestingly, because next to someone's house there is a carnival with an oil rig and some church showcase across the street with the neon sign “Jesus Salvation”, all in one tiny place ... Now it's pretty dazzling, if unbelievable ... and then we go straight to the movie, which brings the incredible to new levels. Of course, this is an unfortunate remake of the 1979 thriller starring Carol Caine as a nanny Jill Johnson ... now Jill is some girl who runs her mobile phone a few minutes ago, so high that her evil parents punish her by forcing her work is probably something that the audience of this film can identify with. Jill drove to this huge and beautiful house on the lake in the middle of nowhere (of course) her dad to look after the Mandrakis family. When Jill arrived, the children were already pressed against the bed, and the housekeeper was still there, yes, she could not look after the children? Of course, despite the fact that there is one of Jill's friends nearby, with whom she seems to have problems, such as “stealing a guy” or something like that. In any case, of course, the alarm in the house goes out for no reason, and then calls from someone, calls from someone who wants to kill her, begin to arrive. Of course, Jill calls the police, and since there was no real threat in her life, they drop her, but tell her to call her back if there is anything else they can do for her. Look at the scene with Jill, who calls her friends at a high school rally on bonfire / pep or how it should be, does this look like some kind of festival "Burning Man" ?? !! ?? There are all sorts of flimsy panic, including the cool cat Chester, which, of course, pops up here and there, one of the most tedious cliches of “horror films”. I admit that at some point I dozed off, and I missed something? Hard to say or worry true. This is one of those films that makes me think about how bad the remakes of Amityville Horror, House of Wax, or Fog could be. Anyway, reading online reviews, it seems that the people who were most frightened were 12-year-old girls, and I can only assume that from statements like "it made me pee my pants." Well, one can only hope that this will put an end to Hollywood remakes of films, which from the very beginning were not quite stellar, but you should not put it on. 2 out of 10, and I'm too generous.
