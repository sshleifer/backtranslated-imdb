Cybrog 2: Glass Shadow plays Elias Koteas as Colton Hicks (Rhymes with punches!), A Karate Instructor who helps Kesa (Jolie) escape from Turntables, her creators who want to blow it up and destroy a competing company. Along the way, Billy Drago and Karen Shepard appear to dislodge the duet, while Jack Palance is there to give the duo guidance on the run. One of the things that is quite shocking in the Cyborg franchise is how the series managed to have quite prolific and unsurpassed actors in the cast. The original was Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dale Haddon (donâ€™t you know her? Well, she was in a heap of 70s), this one has Jack Palance, Elias Coteas, Billy Drago and Angelina Jolie. The third is William Kutt, Zack Galligan and Malcolm McDowell. (Well, the cast of Cyborg 3 is not so impressive.) I have never seen Cyborg 3, but I saw it on a science fiction channel and I must admit that I was not impressed. Surprisingly, Cyborg 2 is a very beautiful film, shot with excellent style, and the visual details make it pleasing to the eye. However, Cyborg-1 acted in the same way: the film was shot with a certain style, slow motion and music that made life easier. Unfortunately, as in the first case, it has no new ideas or anything similar to the plot or texture. Most of the ideas are taken from Blade Runner and Max Hadrum, so for various reasons the film cannot offer anything other than what it looks like. Another aspect is a terrible game. Karen Shepard and Billy Drago are absolutely terrible, and Angelina Jolie is not much better. Elias Koteas and Jack Palance are well behind, but seriously, Palance plays a cyborg warrior, and Koteas is a karate instructor. I believe that on the positive side, Michael Schroeder cannot be blamed for not being ambitious with casting. However, the film is boring, and I lost interest in the story in fifteen minutes. Besides, why did they still tie him to Cyborg? This has nothing to do with its predecessor, which may be worse than. <br /> <br /> * of 4- (Bad)
