This movie is awful! AVOID ALL WITH COST !! I want to return my hour and 20 minutes !!! <br /> <br /> It's not funny at all, you can watch this movie without laughing or even smiling. Oaths spill out of the speakers like a waterfall, each of which is becoming more annoying, like the last, and does not contribute to the plot of the comedy OR (the general comedy is not this film in general!) "Out Cold", ish film - but incredibly awful. The film tells about two groups of the city - “Poreis and Richie” (how foolish is this?), Where the two opposites are fighting each other on a snowboard. (the story is very similar to a bedtime story for a 4-year-old child without any curses and stupid jokes) <br /> <br /> FILM - 1/10 - because you cannot give lower marks
