This film is so bad that there are no words to describe it. If I get a video camera with a monkey dancing for an hour and a half, it will be damn more interesting than this one. The plot is so boring and unimaginable that it is not even worth mentioning. The best part of the film was when the credits rolled through, and I laughed, knowing that the main actors were James Bond III. Just trust me and stay away from this pile of garbage!
