Just to save money and time, I will go ahead and say that this film is absolutely not worth the match and the gas that will be needed to burn it. Do not waste your time. In fact, you better forget what youâ€™ve ever thought of watching. I seriously saw the best B films in a language I can't understand. Who ever gave permission for this, you need to sew. The only positive thing I can say about this film is that with the new script and the right director and actors this can be a great story. Let me break it; The virgin became pregnant by the demon, and the child, being in her womb, wants to eat people. They are trying to make up for the fact that this is possibly the worst film ever made with a curse and senseless nudity. In general, it is absolutely not worth the dollar that it took me to rent it.
