Low budget trash about bloodthirsty cultists in Greece, led by Peter Cushing. It is up to the priest Donald Pleasans to stop them. Crown International released this shit in 1978, and it was "Dog of the Week" in an episode of Sneak Previews with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. I forgot which of the two “pursued” it, but I see the point. In Crappy, the worst performances of Peter Cushing and Donald Plesans I've ever seen. There is a monster on the video box. There is no such animal in the film. Instead, you get a statue, but at least it is inaccurate. (Woo Hoo!) <br /> <br /> Cultists are like Klu Klux Klowns ... if a group can exist. Skip this.
