I had high hopes for this performance, being one of my favorite works. <br /> <br /> Indeed, much of this is reasonable: Helen Baksendeyl is not a bad lady Macbeth, but she lacks the hell out of what the original character possesses Many of the secondary characters succeed, and the Scottish settings are excellent. <br /> <br /> A big disappointment for me is Jason Connery in the lead role: he seems to be reading his lines from the error card. points - of course, for the first time. He can do much better. Any production compared to the exalted Ian McKellen (Macbeth, 1979), which, in my opinion, gave the performance according to the gold standard, will struggle to be evaluated, but I actually fell asleep and I had to rewind this before I could to pass it is hardly an excellent sign. <br /> <br /> Honestly, avoid.
