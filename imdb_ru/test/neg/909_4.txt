The story begins in the house of a little girl who is going to have a birthday party, and the mother and father seemed to be quite quiet and closed with each other. They continue to give their daughter a gift from both, and it seemed to me a funny expression on the faces of two parents when they gave the child this gift, it was almost like: “I hope she likes it”! The film is a murder, and Catherine Mary Stuart (Julia Kerbridge), "The Reaper", 2000, is involved in the case because of family ties. Julia works hard to become a doctor, and it is this murder that destroys her whole life. Rob Lowe (Kevin Finney), “Top View,” 03 is a neighbor next door in the same apartment as Julia, and eventually he goes to bed with her and tries to help her in other ways. It’s not a bad movie, but you’re not going to lose your mind if you don’t like the set in Canada and the pretty Catherine Mary Stewart, born in Canada.
