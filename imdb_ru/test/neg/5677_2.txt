This show was an amazing, fresh and innovative idea in the 70s, when it first went on the air. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but after that everything stopped. By 1990, the show was no longer funny, and it continued to decline to a complete waste of time, which is today. <br /> <br /> It’s really shameful how far this show has fallen. The letter is terribly bad, the performances are almost the same bad — if it weren't for the easy, entertaining respite from the host guests, this show probably wouldn't have been broadcast anyway. It's so hard for me to believe that the same creator who manually selected the original cast also chose the next group of hacks. How can you recognize such brilliance, and then consider it appropriate to replace it with such mediocrity? I felt I should give 2 stars out of respect for the original composition, which made this show such a huge success. Like now, the show is just awful. I can't believe this is still on the air.
