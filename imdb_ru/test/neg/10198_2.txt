Unfortunately, I went to this movie for entertainment purposes, based on limited information that I saw on Fandango. Since I am a scientific amateur, I was interested in the idea of ​​a film about a UFO. <br /> <br /> Instead, this film quickly emerged as a propaganda film about evangelical Christian propaganda. Suitable for like-minded audiences, but not very Christian, likes to use the cinema scene and preach an unsuspecting audience, especially considering the cost of tickets and concessions. Shame on you! At least the Da Vinci Code did not hold back its insane madness. <br /> <br /> So this class B film (and I'm good) will be appreciated in those churches with similar convictions, probably youth groups shown on Wednesday and Sunday evenings. But if you are a primary Christian or not a Christian, you will not be comfortable.
