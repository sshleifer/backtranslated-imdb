This pathetic psychodrama uses every beat-up device in the book to draw attention and sympathy to our characters, who, with one exception, do not deserve any attention at all, not to mention the two precious hours of movie-goers time. <br /> <br /> Similar to Robert Redford’s Ordinary People (an excellent film that, by comparison, clearly shows the emptiness of Heroes), the late teenager died, leaving his family in the throes of bereavement. In this case, death was a suicide, an event that almost always poisons the emotional well-being of survivors in a particularly aggressive way. We monitor these people for the next 8 or 9 months. <br /> <br /> Father (Jeff Daniels) becomes withdrawn, practically mute, usually drunk, shy, who secretly leaves work for months, instead he sits on the park bench all day and insists on the place of the late son was covered with a full plate of food for each meal. He treats everyone else in the family with an unmistakable abomination. He visits his doctor regularly, but the problem of therapeutic intervention in his apparently dysfunctional state never arises. <br /> <br /> A mother (Sigourney Weaver) screams at a nearby woman, including when she’s foolishly trying to buy “marijuana” (her term) in the main store (what an adult would ever try so dumb a trick?), and closer to the end, falls into a coma with a lung disease, which everyone in the theater believes is cancer (she is a heavy smoker). Mrs. Weaver has a few unexpected words, but in general she is acting too unreasonable to deserve sympathy. <br /> <br /> The point is not that there are no people who behave so stupidly when extremely stressful circumstances arise. But why shoot such nonsense? What can you learn from the behavior of this pair? <br /> <br /> Elder sister of the deceased (Michelle Williams) went to college and very happy to move away from the family zoo. The younger brother (played by Emil Hirsch) is the only trustworthy member of the family. His sufferings are genuine, their causes are varied, and his behavior is consistent with the circumstances. But the character of Hirsch is too quiet, sullen and beaten to carry the film. Other bits, subtexts and pleasant, unrealistic dialogues do not help. <br /> <br /> The theme of suicide is repeated almost carelessly in the case of two other minor characters. So what is it that writer-director Dan Harris is trying to say? Is this not a serious question? Why Jeff Daniels agreed to play the role of a father, as written in this scenario, is something that can only be answered by his therapist. Avoid this dog. Rent a classic Redford. My rating: 4/10 (C-). (Adopted February 17, 2005). If you want to read more of my reviews, send me a message with directions to my sites.
