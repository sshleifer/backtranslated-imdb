In an interesting short film telling about some frauds associated with the replacement of Carson Jay Leno as the organizer of the Tonight Show. The film is currently very relevant, given the public drama around Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno. <br /> <br /> The film helps to deserve the interest of viewers in events and to show some of the problems of stakeholders, especially from NBC executives. I thought the image of Ovitz was particularly convincing and interesting. <br /> <br /> However, many of the characters were very briefly affected or affected, and some of the actors seemed careless. Still an interesting story.
