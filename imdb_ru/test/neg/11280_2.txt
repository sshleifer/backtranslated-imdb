I gave these 2 stars out of a possible 10. <br /> <br /> I went into it, not realizing what it was - and found that it seems to be a kind of African musical - as people start singing songs every A couple of minutes. <br /> None of the songs rhyme, most of them don't really say anything sensible, and they all have the same non-existent melody - if you could call it a “melody”. <br /> Carmen is a tall, spectacularly built young woman with the longest braids I have ever seen. [The actress looks as if she was probably modeling.] <br /> <br /> The film opens in a women's prison, although she’s not like any prison I've ever seen or heard about — prisoners wear all that they wish for - and seems to be having a party. <br /> <br /> Carmen does some crazy dancing, and the female warden of the prison, Angelica, [a beautifully beautiful woman] is definitely erotically interested. She and Carmen dance together. Later, Carmen visits the warden's room, and they make love - unfortunately, the scene is not detailed and very short, although there is some nudity. <br /> <br /> Carmen escapes from prison, and then we see her dancing in front of another group, where a man named Lamin, possibly a colonel, is watching her - it was never clear who he was. He is with a young woman who does not like the seductive dance of Carmen, and there is a dance between the two women. <br /> <br /> After this, the story (such as it is) becomes even more confusing. <br /> <br /> With Lamina in prison, from prison, and who knows where. <br /> <br /> Carmen may be associated with a group of smugglers or thieves. <br /> <br /> More singing, more dancing, and Angelica’s scene, obviously suffering from a broken heart. <br /> <br /> The film gets tangled to the end, and I sighed with relief that it was over. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
