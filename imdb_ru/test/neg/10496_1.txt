I looked at it as part of a research vampire marathon, otherwise I would never have looked at it to the end. The first scene, in which a group of vampires in very bad wigs, seems to be struck by electric current from various slow-moving weapons, which even slower wannabe Van Helsing owns ... in black and white ... with a voice over, sets the pace for the rest of the film. The fighting scenes look ridiculous, the dialogue would be funny if the game were not so bad that the storyline does not make sense, and the production values ​​bite (from the concoction of the plaid with the coat Spike, which the hero wears, to the wacky cheap wizard throws their lead vampires around . <br /> <br /> I have seen some bad films (see “The Magic Sword” with B. Rathbone or “The Crow” with a very young Jack N.), but this one gets my vote for the worst of all time.
