Ants are shown in cartoons as able to carry chicken legs, watermelons, people, etc. This can be a wonderful feature because ants carry a phase IV film. This is not because they want, but because they have to. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a narrator, mysteriously explaining that some cosmic event happened on earth, and that one scientist is working on the effect of this disturbance on the ant population. The film is divided into segments; The first part after the cosmic event is Phase I, and so on until the end of the film, which is Phase IV. <br /> <br /> What is Phase IV? Who knows? We do not see this part; apparently, this is somehow related to the fact that one of the scientists who study ants lived in the area. The girl, who looks like a cross between Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler, is angry at the ants because they killed her horse, but, with the exception of one angry blast, she passes the biode with an empty (“ignorant”?) Look. <Br /> <br /> These ants are pretty clever; or scientists are pretty dumb. I pay tribute to ants. What for? All that usually spoils my picnics, which can then build reflective towers, blow up trucks and adjust to poison with maximum ease, gets my vote for becoming smarter, at least in this film. <br /> <br /> Sterno says stomping on this anthill. <br /> <br />
