I have been collecting comic books about Iron Man since the beginning of the 70s and have always enjoyed a character that is far from an ordinary clean cut hero and his many and diverse enemies. At least three attempts were made to create an animated series for Iron Man, and only the original and part of the second made the character justice. So I was hoping that this newest version would be good. Boy I was wrong! DVD art is VERY deceptive and represents an image that is not a movie. Discard the good, the fact that there is little ... Art and animation are well drawn, and the text and dialogue are generally good, albeit with notable exceptions. The voices of the characters are very well matched, and each character is distinctive and well-functioning. Now for the bad ... Unfortunately, the authors decided to fully understand the origin of Iron Man and especially Mandarin. In addition, they decided to make Iron Man and his opponents in the CGI. Bad CGI. It makes them stand out almost as bad as live actors in cartoons. CG work is often repeated, and occasional abbreviations are used from time to time. CG battles are also clumsy, which further reinforces the fact that CG and linear animation do not fit well. Cinema, of course, would be better if they decided to actually draw all the characters. Another problem is that Iron Man is in his traditional red and gold costume for ONE battle! And this is not even a big fight at the end. All this delays the film, and it never rises. <br /> <br /> ************ SPOILERS (or warnings) MAY FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING ************ <br /> <br /> Film begins with an interesting unusual sequence of stops and movements of machines, welding works and mechanisms. Then we get to know what looks like a Chinese temple in the process of restoration, and the statue of what fans will recognize as Mandarin is outstanding. Everything goes strangely, hindering progress in the restoration of the temple. His supervision is James Rhodes, an old friend of Tony Stark. It seems that they are planning to actually raise the temple above the ground, despite the resistance of the group, which insists that the construction of the temple will lead to a terrible catastrophe. Rhodes captured in the raid. Stark, who is shown in a hot bath with a beautiful lady, is informed about the problems and intends to personally oversee the project and save his friend, while in the background his father is dealing with Council leaders who insist that Tony be removed. Tony arrives just to have his armored convoy ambushed and blown to pieces. Later, Tony awakens the mortally wounded in the heart and captive of the rebels. He is saved only by the rapid action of Rhodes and the scientist. In the end, Stark must build a prototype of gray iron armor and make a good escape, but only after some loss of life. While with the rebels, he meets a troubled girl named Li Mei, and they fall in love with each other. The temple is raised, and four elemental creatures (all done in CG) appear and continue to collect hidden rings of power. Stark and Rodi find problems at home, but they donâ€™t manage to confront the elementals, really stopping them, first using Water Armor, then more classic Red and Golden Armor, and finally everything returns to the temple, and Stark returns to bulky gray armor opening and colliding with what may be Fin Fang Foom (also in CG.) Here history takes a major turn, as it turns out that Mandarin needs the body of the host to manifest. This leads to a somewhat tragic final battle, clouded by the fact that Mandarin is slightly more than a ghost, and has not been seen until the last 5 minutes of the film. ugh ... <br /> <br /> If you're an Iron Man fan, then you most likely won't like this walk. And even non-fans may find the film somewhat lacking or not.
