This film has some of the worst performance and editing I've ever seen. There are several cases when the actors paused, trying to remember their lines, the actors walking in front of the speaking actors, and one moment when the film misses about seven frames. Not to mention the fact that the heroine is shot in the chest, but she begins to limp! Yes, and what about the secret passage, which is well lit and right in the open. Awful. <br /> <br /> The plot is non-existent, something related to a primitive nuclear bomb and going to the ends of the Earth and some kind of cave war. Ator pulls out a hang glider at one moment at the dumbest point of the movie. The dialogue is stupid, containing such pearls as "This is all and nothing." and "I feel it here." <br /> <br /> The film is a mess, a tangled, tasteless mess. Ator is a soft hero, sword fighting is absurd, and the plot is slowly evolving. In general, this film should be avoided.
