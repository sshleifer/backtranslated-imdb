Is it just me or the fact that the evil racing team is Japanese, and their arrogant star racer is German, seems a bit overwhelming? Maybe this is the case on the international racetrack, but if all of America represented them, they are fools, like Cody and his mechanic Chris (Peter Berg, who must have learned to act), then I would be a fan of another country. Formula movies can be good, but the characters should be cute, and no one meets these criteria in this movie. Simply put - a very bad movie.
