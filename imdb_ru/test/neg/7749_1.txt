The director of this celluloid embezzlement specializes in horrific exploitation films, where the claim is everything; Last year, he made “Dangerously Close”, whose good idea (that gangs get too much power at school, and the editor of the school newspaper against them) was plunged into a sea of ​​sloppiness, and he continued to do Cyborg, Jean Claude Van Damme film in the history (not a feat). This potential comedy about the girl - Katie Ireland in her debut in the movie - which is in complete confusion, whose inner babe wakes up only after she falls to the center of the Earth and has a number of poorly filmed adventures that are impossible to follow ( dwarves who want her because she has big bones - go figure it out!) before returning home has changed for the better, it is not funny, does not capture and does not entertain in the least degree. And anyone who watches this to saliva for Miss Ireland will also be put off - not because of her voice, but because she spends most of the film under tons of baggy clothes, with huge glasses to download. Not surprisingly, Cannon manufacturers are out of business. Surprisingly, since then Katie Ireland has made the best films ... or maybe it is not so amazing. Next to this, "Barbed Wire" is "Aliens."
