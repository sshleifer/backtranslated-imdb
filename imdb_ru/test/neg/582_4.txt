Lou Costello (without Abbott) plays in the small town of the "garbage collector" (and the inventor of the time-controlling machine!), Who secretly cares for the niece of the city. After the quarrel, the girl Lou (Dorothy Provin) is confronted with a foggy cave - why it is foggy, we will never know - and appears as a 30-foot giant. Provine is definitely a good sport, and she doesnâ€™t try not to look ridiculous (it would be impossible anyway), but the screenwriter is really tough with this character, turning her into not only a giant, but also a grumbling harpy. Provin is led by Costello, creating chaos with the army forces that are being called in, but nothing funny is done with the transformation. Conquered by the "Attack of the 50-foot Woman" last year, the film does feature Lou Costello in his final bow, but lends a little to another. The special effects are minor, while the script needed more funny lines and directional stimulation. * 1/2 of ****
