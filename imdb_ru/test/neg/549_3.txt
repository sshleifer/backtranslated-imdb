I was pleased to find that TCM shows it, since I like the 1992 version with Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Joan Plowright ... In this film there was a glowing Ann Harding, a wonderful performance by Frank Morgan, but the acting of others is rather a farce, than the wonderful unfolding of this later film. Reginald Owenâ€™s Arbuthnot is painful to see, and you cannot understand why his wife adores him. After watching the film, I learned that it is based on a theatrical production, in which the 1992 film is based on a book. The original film also felt that it was a fragment of the larger part and was incomplete. It is a pity that it was such a disappointment.
