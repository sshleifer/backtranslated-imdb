When I first saw this film twenty years after its release, I did not quite understand. Why was this such a huge hit in 1986? His amateur skill drips from every scene. The jokes are lame and predictable. Sex scenes are exploitative and excessive (this does not mean that Miss Mine has no nice boobs!). Singing "Schrecklich". The only really funny scene is a big firefight, when gangsters die in break dance, a feature that firmly dates the film to the mid-eighties. I really do not understand how much I am unable to understand what caused the enthusiasm of fans in 1986 (and, apparently, so far, when I read the comments of my colleagues from IMDBers).
