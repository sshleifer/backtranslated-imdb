Honestly, I have not seen much of this show. Perhaps because it was not as good as the original M * A * S * H, but I think I remember how they moved it on a weekly schedule. Some shows are simply not worth watching every week. But at first I really tried, so everything was not so bad. Maybe I just expected it to improve, but I can't give it a show 1. Honestly, I can't give it more than 2. <br /> <br /> This was not MASH (I'm not going to type these stupid * every time). And he tried to be a MASH, without putting any effort, as it could happen in a magical way. Well guess what? No magic. The best I can do here is to compare it with other shows. <br /> <br /> Trapper John, M.D., was a much better show. However, they had to call him B.J. Hunnicut, Maryland, because Pernell Roberts looked exactly the same as old BJ, but he didnâ€™t look like John Catcher. Leave everything else the same, just change its name and the name of the show. Presto! After MASH it was not the only continuation to completely bombard and disgrace the original. The place of Archie Bunker was an unfortunate continuation of the film "All in the family." He had no heart, no conflict, no depth. all that made everything in the family so unforgettable. In addition, MASH was funny because the doctors reacted to the impossible absurdity of war. Remove the war, and you remove the disc in 99% of humor. Potter cannot shout at Klinger for wearing a dress, because Klinger does not wear a dress, because he is not trying to be kicked out of the army, because he is already out of the army, because the war is over. (breathe) All the jokes became forced, because there was no motivation for anything. The viewer was the least motivated to stay close and watch the show. <br /> <br /> And from what I remember, the whole show seemed to be Potter, Klinger and Mulcahy, who simply stood there unnaturally and looked at the public as trios of vaudeville performers. It was like the Good Times, where they spent 90% of the show, standing behind this couch and talking to the audience, trying to make sure they had a natural conversation. They were not. And after After MASH it became even less natural. <br /> <br /> Another incident that I remember is that the people who created MASH never received any fees from the selection. The studio used the absurd excuse that After MASH really was a way out of the MASH movie (which they owned), not the series. Nice try, but Mulcahy was the only one of the three in the film, and he was never deaf. I think studio directors will do everything for a dollar. Nothing but a decent continuation, that is.
