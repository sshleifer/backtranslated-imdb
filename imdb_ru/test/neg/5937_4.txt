After two terrorist attacks in Europe, one in London and the other in Amsterdam, the main suspect is the leader of Al Salim (Alon Ofbul). CIA agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio), working in the Middle East, was appointed as his chief at Langley Ed Hoffman (Russell Crow) to keep the “safe house” in Amman under surveillance, and he contacts the security chief in Jordan, Hani Salam ( Mark Strong). Roger did not disclose the whole operation of Hani, and she fails due to the intervention of Ed. Meanwhile, Roger has feelings for the local nurse Ayse (Golshifttech Farahani), and he is approaching her family. When Roger designs another al-Saleem scheme using the innocent architect Omar Sadiqi (Ali Suliman) as bait for Al-Saleem's bait, he endangers not only Sadiq’s safety, but also Aishu’s abduction. After the execution of Sadiki, Roger tries to negotiate the release of Aisha with the terrorists and offers to free himself in order to save the nurse. <br /> <br /> "Body of Lies" - a disappointing pyrotechnic journey through Europe and the Middle East. despite the names of Ridley Scott, Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. The IMDb user rating indicates that many viewers like this type of fast-paced high-tech espionage film, satellites and all sorts of disrespect for the sovereignty of other countries in the name of oil, which gives no time for reflection, but this is not my case. It is boring and ridiculous to see fat Russell Crowe with a mobile phone as a family man, while his partner risks his life in a dangerous operation. The rich character performed by Leonardo DiCaprio is poorly developed, and, in my opinion, this great actor is mistakenly considered an operational agent in the Middle East because of his biotype. But the film never explains its connection with the Middle East. Saving the living Roger Ferris is also very stupid and banal. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Rede de Mentiras" ("Network of Lies")
