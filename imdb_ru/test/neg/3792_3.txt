This is a film with a great concept for the story, but it was distracted, but with a lot of clich√©d plots, hackneyed and unrealistic features and performances, and some frankly implausible (and quite random and, not to mention, convenient as the plot indicates comes to its inexorable end). <br /> <br /> There was a lack of anything that would have marked the leader as a gay, except for some coincidences with the Crow Bar or the fact that he was gay. In fact, it would not hurt to show that he is doing something, even if he would just meet with a friend for a drink. <br /> <br /> Worth checking out and has its merits. Not so much, even now, a few years after the release of the film, films that have both gays and a significant storyline for gays, as well as African Americans. For this, it is worth checking out. I would not look at it too hard and would not waste my time looking for it. This is a rental, not a premium rental in it.
