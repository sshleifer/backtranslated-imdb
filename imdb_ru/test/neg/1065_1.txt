This film is so imitating, played up a cliché, awkward and difficult, that I find it striking that no one can feel deceived by experiencing it. <br /> <br /> Here is a series of idiotic clichés, ridiculous psychologisations and simply impossible stories in this “hard” representation of high school: the tough guy is really a homosexual. A student is unhappy because his father pushes him, and for some reason it makes him incest. Teacher sneaky for the student who wets his pants in the classroom. The girl who meets with the aforementioned athlete is really in love with him and “just wants a family.” <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only saving grace is the scenes of student counseling that are a bit interesting, but most of the devices in this film are so lead that they can’t believe it. <br /> <br /> In this film I don’t understand teenagers, and I won’t be surprised when it bombs, especially teenagers. People who like this film seem to be parents worrying about their teenagers, and boys, they bark at the wrong tree if they think that this film will help with the “understanding” of the teenager’s problems. I mean, what is the moral of this film? "Hey guys, let's all look at each other and hug each other" GIVE ME BREAK. Anyone who thinks you can reach 14 years old with this message should remember. In the 1980s, we watched the film "Kentucky Freed", Xtro, Porky's, "Evil Dead", "Terminator", etc. This film will not be heard. <br /> <br /> 2:37 right there with another Australian “independent” film “One Beautiful Day,” which was as bad as this full movie turkey. Thank God, the taxpayers' money was not spent on this bologna. <br /> <br /> TO AVOID !!!!
