This film is supposedly about three young idealistic people, two of whom join the Naxalite and Blah blah movement. This is actually just another film about some beautiful, rich people trying to decide whom they should sleep; peasants and Naxalites and the political struggle of the era serve only as a picturesque background. Literally, since we don’t hear the villagers say the word, let alone learn someone’s name, so they play the same “role” as the “natives” in old Hollywood films. The film is also boring, and the story actually does not lead us anywhere - except in different bedrooms. Obviously, we should admire the cunning of all this, which simply means the absence of a good song and dance routine, which, of course, would not have saved the film, but could at least ease the boredom. <br /> <br /> My Friend Japna was annoyed by the immorality of the whole story, not the bat in the bedroom, but the whole meaninglessness of the story. The bottom line is that ideals are not worth pursuing.
