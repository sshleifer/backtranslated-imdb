I can't remember when I saw the worst movie. The game was overloaded, a banal dialogue to such an extent that it was painful to listen to him, secondary special effects and a ridiculous common story. <br /> <br /> I never wanted to go to the cinema anymore, and if I were alone, this would be what I would have done in about 30 minutes and saved myself almost TWO ESCAPE WATCHES from nauseous dialogue and The plot with more holes than Swiss cheese is about the size of Texas. I just can not overestimate what an unfortunate experience was when I was sitting in the colossal waste of perfectly good celluloid. <br /> <br />
