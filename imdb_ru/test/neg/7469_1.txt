I saw this film at the New Festival in New York. It was the worst movie. This is the use of uncircumcised full frontal nudity and a weak-minded script and direction, which does not take on the reworking of “Maurice” and does not decide that this is a click of Neil Labouth, leaving me with the feeling “Why did someone spoil a perfectly good cast like this? ". He lacks irony, and he fills the vacuum with feelings, which makes the moments when the film turns on, make you want to erase your face, when your mind and heart are looking for what may happen in the film, but this is not so. I would like the director and editor to edit the film, because maybe there are more stories out there that could be freed from unpleasant experience.
