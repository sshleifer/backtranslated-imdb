Let's face it, this is a pretty bad movie. However, if you go getting ready to laugh at it, you will be able to experience this experience. Well, you will cry strongly in agony. African jungles are entertained in a wacky way. <br /> Tom Conway (who spends most of the funk-lead movie) uses a local sorcerer and insane science to create a “perfect” creature. It looks like a warmint who was drunk in the sixth week and in a bag dress. It's terrible to be kind. But it will not kill him, because he uses a good girl as his subject. He needs a bad bad girl. <br /> <br /> Marla Inglish and Lance Fuller are two petty rogues in search of African gold. The actual lessons for Mrs. English should have been at the top of the search list. She is a bad girl and lets everyone find out about it in a play worthy of playing in high school. “Connors is the white guide of the English and Fuller con in the leadership of the expedition. <br /> <br /> English and Conway finally met, and this is a match concluded in hell. Get his voodoo creature, because she will do anything to achieve what she wants. At this point you will do everything to stop the agony of this film. <br /> <br /> What made this movie interesting for me? was Conway in this cool tribal hat / headdress / flower piece! Still trying to figure out what kind of dead animal it is. I think he thought that if he pulled him low enough over his eyes, no one would recognize him. <br /> <br /> A really bad movie.
