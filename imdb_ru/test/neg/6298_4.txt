Terence Stamp can carry anything, but it's still a shallow one-dimensional film. It's nice to look at - like the actors - and if you are fond of transvestites, I think you might like it a lot, but the plot and characters are as thin as cardboard. This is one of those politically correct films that distorts everything else so that the “minority lifestyle” seems warm and pleasant. He gets a lot of benefit from bitchy dialogue, which I think is funny in this sanitized form. <br /> <br /> Ninety percent of militants are wearing bright costumes in inappropriate situations. The dramatic content - a symbolic appendage - they hardly try to make you take it seriously.
