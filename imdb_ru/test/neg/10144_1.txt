This show is designed for people with an IQ of under 80. The jokes on the show are so lame. If you are on a desert island and you have nothing to do, you will be better than to watch this garbage ... you will hate their emphasis on your behavior and on all the silly jokes and sweepstakes that they are trying to perform ... It really pisses off that the audience gave Reba 6.7 to their vote ... Of course, I knew that there are people with an IQ below 80, but what I did not know was that there were so many of them! So people, if you need to read this, I hope that you will never download or buy this world of garbage ... I know this is not the place for it, but I want to recommend one much better mini-series "Scrubs"
