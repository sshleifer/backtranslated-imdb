How in the world does such a thing get into my DVD player at home? How can it be packaged and distributed? Are there absolutely zero movie views (and I use this term loosely), which must pass before it is put on the shelf of a video store? I'm all for making a DIY movie, but come on! It does not give me the right to gather a group of my friends and relatives, a crappy video camera, a terrible story and put it all together to create a bunch of crap and call it a movie. And I would like people to stop using the words Indy and Campy to describe these types of films. They also do not. In no other profession would this be considered acceptable. If someone tried to sell you a car that was as bad as this movie, you would have taken it back and said it was a lemon. If it was a surgical procedure, you would sue the doctor for negligence. I wish I could get back the time and money after seeing this. Shame for video stores that sell similar movies. They are plagiarism for the public. Do you want to "hike"? Get any of the Friday 13th films (even the latest) or Dead-Alive. At least those don't make you want to kill yourself. It is because of such films that people automatically identify themselves with garbage.
