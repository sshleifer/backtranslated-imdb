I guess I should comment on the 4th click in the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN franchise; the sequels still surprise or surprise me with their mean-spirited and deliberate _absurdism. They constitute or counterfeit the 4th path - not the classic, not the revisionist, not European, but the vile Americana, akin to the films of the cruel vigil of the 70s, absurd trash. This release is also pompous, incredibly awkward, and even somewhat strange. <br /> <br /> Now it bothers me that these sequels have not only opportunistic fans; but the fact that the fans simply do not feel any difference between the style of the original and the sequels. <br /> <br /> These sequels are not boring or tasteless, but fancy. They are of course very poorly written - dirty scripts, garbage lines. This is just insane; In this party, each fighter gets a few women ?? Van Cleef's young wife begs him to release a young prisoner; he finally does. A young man resumes his life, shoots Van Cleef, kidnaps his wife, rapes and kills her, and then joins the offender. Van Cleef, who had previously refused to help defend the village, now gathers a small handful and charges the hacienda of the offender; then the criminals attack the village where Van Cleef has sat down. <br /> <br /> I liked the cast. <br /> <br /> Van Cleef - Chris; Stephanie Powers, quite active in the disgusting 70s westerns, is Van Cleef's favorite. Callan, very antipathetic, is Noah, the writer and chum Chris. The rest of the aggressive group is Askew (one of three survivors), Armendaris, Lacking, Lauter; Rita Rogers is really hot, fleshy beauty.
