Man, this is lousy. From the point of view of comments, this does not deserve special attention, therefore, briefly, Rebecca De Mornay is a very disciplined police psychiatrist who falls in love with Latin American Antonio Banderas in a wine shop, he is from the tail and prison tats. When she is released, she is really released. In addition to this hot matter, which she has (and we must admit that this business has its own speed bumps), it is pretty cold fish. Her broken, sick father appears for the first time in many years, and she tires him. She is also adept at keeping her excited neighbor upstairs (Dennis Miller) at bay. And there is a prisoner Harry Dean Stanton, who is trying to force her to make a diagnosis of multiple personality disorder so that he does not chain his rank and file to the wall for the serial murders he committed. <br /> <br /> All these people, and perhaps even more, immediately suspect when strange things begin to happen to her. Someone sends her dead flowers. Someone does incredible things with her beloved cat. (The next time I see a pet in a bag, or hanged in a cupboard, or boiled in a pot, I will vomit.) So who does this? Guess. No force on earth can make me reveal the ending, but perhaps a hint will help: child abuse. <br /> <br /> Justifying ill-treatment is in itself an interesting matter, much more interesting than a movie. What does child abuse mean? We mean sexual abuse? Physical? Both? How about hitting a child in the back with a wooden kitchen spoon strong enough to break it? This is what happened to me and my brother when we were children, as well as all the other lost boys in the neighborhood. Sexual abuse? As far as I know, this has never happened to any of us, although I am not sure that it would be rejected with any degree of animation. In the village of Samoa, which I studied for two years, there was one case in which a teenage boy played sexually with a much younger girl. The girl's family knocked him out of himself. The boy's own family sent him to live in another branch of the family in another village, the expulsion of which lasted two years. By the time he returned, the incident had been forgotten by everyone, including the child. (By the way, the little girl we see here is less than five years old, so she is unlikely to remember Dad's nightly visits anyway, since the long-term memory is not really established until that time.) The experience of Demorey, leading to her mental The disorder can be called "social injury design." It is not there if we do not put it there. Enough psychiatric lectures. It will be fifteen cents. <br /> <br /> You want injury? I'll give you an injury. The film from the very beginning makes us identify with the character of Rebecca De Mornay. Then, when she has the first date with Antonio Banderas, and Pio Donnaggioâ€™s account is pounding eroticism on our heads, the camera gives us a shot from her bare torso shoulder of Antonio crawling on us with his hairy chest. Now it is traumatic. This makes any viewer feel that he is on the floor of a laundry room in the California men's colony in San Luis Obispo. Do not get me wrong. I do not like Antonio Banderas. I just don't like him. In the entire universe, there are not enough nude shots of the elven body of Rebecca De Mornay to compensate for such anxiety. <br /> <br /> Here is an interesting way to survive in this film. Instead of just sitting there, trying to select scenes shot in Toronto, and separate them from those that were shot in Budapest. This is a real challenge, and as far as we know, can keep you sane.
