Like everyone else, I learned about this turkey in Mystery Science Theater 3000. It is easily considered one of my favorite MST3K episodes of all time. I really couldn't imagine trying to watch this movie by itself, although ......... it really is, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very bad. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keefe plays the role of Ator, the muscular wannabe of Fabio, who lives in the days of cavemen. We, the spectator, are asked to suspend our disbelief that he knows alchemy and chemistry and can build a complete hang-glider in 5 minutes. Yes, right! There is also a rather attractive actress (I can't remember her name), who wears a cap like a chest shield. Oh, and I can not forget this stupid Asian thong. He had the easiest role in the film, as he does not utter a single word of dialogue throughout the film. He had to figure out how to make his character interesting, without speaking ..... and he failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The film canâ€™t be watched, you only need to watch it in the correct MST3K format. If you watch this version, you will laugh silly! <br /> <br /> "I AM HUGE !!!!" <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
