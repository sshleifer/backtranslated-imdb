**** Possible spoiler **** <br /> <br /> If you made a serious film with an influential, but aging father with three obviously ungrateful daughters, with the participation of actors of the highest level, with great cinematography and wonderful atmosphere on Midwest, where would you go? Yes, of course, after the “King Lear” you will create a modern tragedy. <br /> <br /> This is what I expected. This, of course, is not what I received. What I received was 105 minutes of feminist violence - one long argument about the inhumanity of a man towards a woman. Why, in the whole story there was no decent man. <br /> <br /> You see early where this film can go, but you can't believe that someone will waste all these wonderful actors and masters on it. banal scenario - you just want them to continue the theme of King Lear. But this never happens; and there is a real tragedy if you ask me. <br /> <br /> In addition to the panorama of a gorgeous rural center, the only thing worth seeing was this wonderful chameleon, British actor Colin Firth, who practices his Midwest accent, now had fun. <br /> <br /> 3/10
