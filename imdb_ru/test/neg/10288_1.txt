After a very terrible, rough opening, which gives you this eerie feeling of "chainsaw slaughter", everything falls apart. <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOILER: As soon as two FBI officers start fighting, you know that they are real killers. Anyone who has seen enough of these "wacky" films can figure it out. <br /> <br /> This film was created with one purpose: to portray the brutal murder. Why then does a little girl not be tortured and murdered? Will this be next for us movie lovers? Torture and child abuse? What's wrong with you people? Lynch has a really disgusting, ugly mind.
