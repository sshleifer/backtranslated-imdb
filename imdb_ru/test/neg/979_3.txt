I can imagine what happened with this film: a lot of guys from the studio are sitting idle, they are drinking a gin and tonic, maybe a joint one, and one of them comes to the conclusion that it would be great if they could find a film that would bridge the gap between generations, which at that time was as far away as Archie Bunker and Mick Jagger. The fact that both student-age rebels and their parents would seem equally interesting - perhaps for various reasons, but still a ticket is a ticket. What is interesting hippies? Asia, philosophy, pacifism, wild scenery and costumes. What interests their parents? Musicals, eye candy, a scenario of good mood and nostalgia. Very good, then “Lost Horizon”, an old classic, like a musical, in color. Can not miss, right? It was a bomb. The Lost Horizon by James Hilton is perhaps not a classic, but a good novel. In general, he describes a sketch of a utopian society in Shangri-la, "Valley of the Blue Moon", near Tibet, in which peacefully satisfied villagers live, who serve in the abbey of <i> very </ i> long-lived monks. An island of Gilligan invades paradise, resembling an island of strangers (World War I veteran, missionary, etc.), each of which in its own way unwinds the situation - which plot is associated with the reaction of each of them to the choice presented to him to live in paradise, or try to go back to the turmoil of the twentieth century. In his own understanding, it is a gentle, light down, representing Hilton’s own conservative British views in an “oriental” dress, as exotic and familiar as prediction cookies. Being captured by the honored guests of monks, it is forbidden to run away from leaving the valley, but they are never forced to work or pray (not that the monks themselves did so much), they were approached royally and provided simple but luxurious rooms - who want to escape? In this middle American paradise on earth, the monks are cultural and wise, the climate is warm, the food is plentiful and tasty, the villagers are picturesque trifles and nothing will change. The nuns are chaste, but encouraged to look beautiful and even flirt a little (the reason is one of the most fun and inaccurate tantric sex explanations I've ever read). Even their religion does not pose a threat: it is open as a mixture of Christianity and Buddhism, representing the best of two worlds, can offend very little anyone but the most persistent fundamentalist or eccentrics who really knew something about Tibet (who in the early thirties there was a very small number). <br /> <br /> Like the Capra film, which focuses on the aspects of adventure / character interaction, it was charming; and maybe Steven Spielburg could have made him fly if he was there. As a Hollywood product of the early seventies, the adventure ended too quickly, and the updated character list was too soft to make an impression. Deprived of the meager, suggestive qualities of classic black and white, the monastery resembles a luxurious white and pale blue spa, and although at least some monastic robes tried to achieve historical accuracy, most of the rest of the prisoners looked like they were on their way to the morning massage and fango tub with a couple of golf courses in the afternoon. Perhaps Stefan Sondheim could restore the story by playing a very real conflict in the reaction of each character; in just five years, Brian Eno would capture the tranquil atmosphere in T; instead, Bert Bacher and Hal David were tasked with writing songs that combine Muzak-like tunes with some of the most awkward New Agey lyrics ever written. It is quite natural that each song requires a dance number, which varies from simply forgotten to completely boring, as well as a script in which there is not a single line that is worth quoting. <br /> <br /> The tie-in with this film was legion - everything from cookbooks to posters planned for the promotion of this film was there, and such was the hype that I really went out and bought the album sountrack. The only thing I can say about good is that I was quite impressed by the complete writing of this review from memory almost thirty years later - I read Aldous Huxley the next month, bought a copy of Bardo Tadol and, therefore, learned about real Tibetan culture . Moan. <br /> <br />
