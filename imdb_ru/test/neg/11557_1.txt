I think I can say with confidence (without giving anything away) that there are no robots in this film. The guys in the costumes of "robots" did not act and did not speak as such, and the evil essence behind all this "plot" is also not a robot. <br /> <br /> It all looks like it was shot somewhere in the city park, where there are photos in the background when the director needed his own set. I can't even use the words to describe the acting skills ... <br /> <br /> It couldn't even offer a fun ending to the Star Crystal. In short, this is clearly one of the worst science fiction films of the 80s, and I would be so brave as to say "all the time."
