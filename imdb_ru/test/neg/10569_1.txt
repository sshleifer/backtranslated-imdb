It's horrible! As if someone had given the child a faulty video camera and $ 30 and ordered them to make a film. Even then you will get a better and more professional film than this one. The story is so stupid that we can say that it is not. I do not think that the guy who did this knew what to do at all - watching foreign movies all day is not enough for someone to become a director right away. The acting is very bad, really the level of kindergarten, and the script is simply terrible. The only scene I didn’t hate was the caravan crash scene, but even this means that it was a little less awful than the rest of the movie. How do people get paid for these things? I am not against alternative films, but shouldn't they be a big steaming pile of cow dung? I would call the “Price of Milk” amateur, if it were not an insult for amateurs. It would not even be a good movie if you were drunk or stupefied!
