The plane with the daughter of a rich scientist falls in the thick desert. He gathers a group to find her and others, but soon the rescue group suspects that something is following them. Then the latent motives of the expedition are revealed, and this only intensifies the already existing tension. <br /> <br /> The film is a worthy idea, and the taking of the popular legend Sasquatch should have ended sooner or later. However, the direction of the film violates the fundamental rule of the horror director / thriller, and it shows too much too soon. Of course, viewers know that characters are haunting something, just read the title! But the show of what was supposed to be the kicker of the film, which soon only destroys most of the unknown and, as a direct result, most of the fun. The film also lacks a good atmosphere, and there are almost no landscape shots that show wilderness, but there are a lot of monster shots from the point of view that add nothing. They actually shamelessly knock down the Predator. The low-budget horror film Wendigo has done what this film is trying to do much better. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters' tensions and the ending without clichés can fill this climb over a bunch of crap, but it’s still poor and, given the background and potential, is very disappointing. --- 4/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R for some violence and profanity, but it's rather boring compared to most horrors rated R.
