I might like it if I didn’t like Diane Arbus. <br /> <br /> In fact, the unique visual aesthetics of Arbus was not captured (as Stanley Kubrick did in Shining when there were twin girls in the corridor, a direct reverence for one of Arbus’s most famous qualities that have none of the images of this film), and, of course, none of her character (sociable), similarities (thin and Jewish, not the Queen Wasman Kidman) or life, saving some very superficial similarities, she was a fashion who later photographed "freaks" and "outsiders" mong the many things. This film focuses on "freak", as its symbol of artistic and personal development, in a very superficial and predictable way. Besides that, it could be an interesting movie about a middle-class fetish, but I was too annoyed to worry. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, if Arbus’s name was omitted, it could be less annoying, but she didn’t have her name in the title, and there wouldn’t be anything that would interest me in all of this. A disappointment from the "Secretary".
