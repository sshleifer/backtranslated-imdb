I watched the beginning twice, could not understand it, and it worried me the whole movie. <br /> <br /> So try with me: Wayne (GOOD guy) jumps on the stage, disarms drivers (!) steal money (?!) and leave. <br /> <br /> Disarmed, one driver killed and the other wounded by the bad guys. Thanks to Wayne, who disarmed them, and then watched it happen. <br /> <br /> Then Wayne throws money into the dirt, rescues a girl, goes to town, laughs with Yak (too bad about the dead guy, probably) ... and then says that he “found” the money back to the scene . And that's all right with that. <br /> <br /> And is he a good guy? And I am sure that at that time there were no small flashlights. And Bell did his first telephone demonstration in 1876 ... were they in the houses then? I think too much about it? I am usually happy to suspend judgment in order to enjoy the film, but this one bothered me. And this is a sign that the move didn’t really work for me.
