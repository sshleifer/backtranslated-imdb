Blimey! This is a movie that should be shown on TV at two in the morning on Cinemax for all these insomnia (the lord knows that they probably would faint from boredom while watching this movie) that were worse. Lots of unnecessary “skin” in this film, pseudo-porn scenes that are just awful in more than a million, gawdy soap opera style script that really hurt the film and the director really had no sense that he was trying to create a genre with this film. I could see a group of teenagers with their parents' video cameras who do a better job than this. I don't think there is a part of me that could recommend this film to anyone ...
