The movie "The Cave" should be one of the worst films I've ever seen. There was no plot, no plot line, and the lighting was terrible. For most of the film, I could not understand the landscape, as it was highlighted with flashlights. Permanent "gray" places throughout the film were tedious. The only scene that actually manifested itself was in a cave lit by something that seemed like a poor simulation of conditions that can be found in hell. In general, the film was not worth watching. If manufacturers cannot come up with something better than this, they must find another occupation. Underwater scenes were especially horrible, mostly from bubbles and lanterns, from time to time they looked at the actors. In the end, a really horrible film with poor lighting, flash flashes everywhere.
