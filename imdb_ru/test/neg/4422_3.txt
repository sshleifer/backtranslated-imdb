"Theft Time" actually dates back to 2001, when it was mysteriously called "Renny Landing." Which explains how filmmaker Mark Fusco could afford this cast of television and movie actors, which obviously is an extremely budgetary production. Approximately ten minutes after the beginning of the film, you understand why this thing never received a theatrical release after a few years ago it went through a film festival. <br /> <br /> His recent distribution of Franchise Pictures is likely to reflect the notion that the growing popularity of some actors can be milked to offset some of the modest production costs. Although young actors are not a good addition to anyone's resume, they did the worst when they were desperately searching for acting work of any kind. <br /> <br /> Peter Facinelli, Ethan Embry, Scott Foley and Charlotte Ayanna play college friends who are doing an early reunion of the Big Cold and comparing military stories about the inability of reality to match their dreams. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, nothing else happens, absolutely nothing. Yes, Alec (Facinelli) dreams of capturing a liquor store and robbing a bank, which are then “cheap and hopeless” put under completely inappropriate music. This is the least hard work in the bank since the time of WC. Fields was a security guard at Bank Dick. <br /> <br /> If someone can point out at any time in “Time stealing” when something “really” happens, I would like to know about it, because, as far as I can tell, nothing does not occur throughout the film. Perhaps Fusco, through constant visual reflection, is trying to say something deep about how to take control of your life before it is too late. Like The Fire of St. Elmo, the film is full of every deep thought ever expressed by a young man who left the ivory tower for the first time to experience the real world. <br /> <br /> I felt that Fusco was going for the original motive of Howard Hawks “Young Angels Have Wings” in action. On the other hand, I'm sure I read too much in the film. In the end, things actually come from the Howard Hawks films. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
