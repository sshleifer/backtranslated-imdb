If this film goes to the theater next to you, consider it a threat. I was lucky to see this film here in Tokyo. As a Dutchman, I was surprised to find that a Dutch film plays in a metropolis like Tokyo. I thought it must be something special if a Dutch film goes all the way to Japan. So I went there with my friends, and we happily told the theater staff that we were Dutch and that we were so interested in learning about the film. As it turned out, it was one of the most childish, stupid, stupid, poorly played films with the worst of the conversational English films I have seen in 10 years, and I left the theater, trying to avoid the staff, because I felt almost responsible for this disaster movie . Sometimes you get the feeling that you know what the director wanted: Lola Rennt, a movie like Trainspotting. Instead, it was more like MacGyver in drugs with outdated breakbeat music as a musical score. But if I didn't feel too annoyed, the film was inadvertently quite funny from time to time, as it showed Holland at its smallest.
