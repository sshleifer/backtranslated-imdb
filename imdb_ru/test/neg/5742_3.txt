Slayer begins in the tropical forest of South America, where Captain Hawk (Casper Van Dine) and his people are attacked by a group of vampires who barely manage to save their lives. Jump forward six months later, and Hawk is summoned to see Colonel Weaver (Linda Carter), who informs him that there were other reports of vampires and that his ex-wife and her god-daughter Dr. Laurie Williams (Jennifer O'Dell ) left the house. there, in the expedition to study beetles, she is concerned that she asks the “Hawk” to take a detachment of soldiers back to South America and officially give back to Captain Griva (Kevin Grevyu) and his people, while at the same time unofficially looking for Lori and not dying vampires who decided to leave the caves and into the civilized world ... <br /> <br /> Edited by the author and director Kevin VanHook, this is another poorly made original Sci-Fi Channel, which simply is not very good in any respect. As far as I could see, the script without humor does nothing, it is one of those modern vampire films that decides to choose and choose the “traditional” rules about vampire films that he wants to use, since these vampires can be killed with stakes through hearts have fangs, but at the same time they can walk freely in the sun and do not sleep in their graves. The film moves at a reasonable pace, but all this is very boring, tasteless and lifeless. The story is bad and just rather stupid, the character is terrible, the dialogue is forgotten, and there is very little to recommend. The killer is also trying to get some environmental message, as the head of the vampire claims that he is just starting to kill people because of their systematic destruction of rainforest, where they have secretly lived for centuries, unfortunately, there are no convictions, and it looks more like a one-time line to fill the time than a serious statement. There is not enough content to operate and this is a rather unsatisfactory way to spend 90 minutes of your time. The creators even do nothing with the setting in the jungle, damn it, I did not expect Predator (1987), but was hoping for something more. <br /> <br /> Director VanHook shot several horror films. which I saw was equally poor, sorry, but it does nothing here and turns into a completely forgotten and looking film. There is no atmosphere or tension, but about true fears forget about it. The blood is restrained, there are some bitten necks and some splashes of blood, but we have not seen anything like this before and do not have much effect. In the end there is also a huge vampire monster, but it does not look so impressive, and it is too easy to kill. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 2,000,000, this is actually a decent amount of money spent on it, but it’s still a trash film, it’s pretty well done, but nothing special or memorable. Cast sucks, I'm sorry, but I saw that. <br /> <br /> Slayer is another bad, stupid and boring trash for a sci-fi channel that I just cannot recommend, Do not confuse with the rather beautiful British film “Video Nasty” The Slayer (1982), which 100 times better than this one, so watch it and watch it.
