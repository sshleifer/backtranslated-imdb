The film shows the relationship of a dying mother and son, who is very attached to her and, of course, loves her. What does this show? It shows their life in very bad conditions. This shows how gently they "walk" (in fact, he leads her). But what will we see next? After their walk, he walks alone in the same places where they walked together. It's impossible. A person who loves and cares about another dying person will do everything to make this person’s life better. He will not have a free moment to think, to be alone with himself, and if he finds several minutes a month for this, he will run away from those places where he normally should be. One more thing. The author dedicated this film to Andrei Tarkovsky. We see that he has learned a lot of Tarkovsky's visual effects. But in the Sokurov film these are just effects, they don’t support either feeling or mood. Someone compared this film with “The Mirror” (“The Mirror”). There is nothing in common except these visual effects. The Mirror is a great movie, and this one is just a bad imitation.
