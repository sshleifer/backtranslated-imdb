This German horror movie should be one of the strangest I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism, but it is assumed that it is based on a true character. <br /> <br /> Our hero is deaf and dumb as a result of repeated beatings by his father. he also has a puppet fetish, but I can't figure out where it came from. His colleagues will recognize and tease him terribly. <br /> <br /> During the day, he behaves gently, and at night he breaks into cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls. All of them, of course, are attractive, otherwise we do not care about the fact that he usually tears off their clothes to the waist. In the end, he ends up by actually killing, and that is what he is catching. <br /> <br /> As I said, a very strange film, very dark and very slow, because Werner Nachat never speaks and just spends time drinking blood.
