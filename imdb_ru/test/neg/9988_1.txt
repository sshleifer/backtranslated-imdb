I am currently making my way through Gibbon's “Death and Decline of the Roman Empire”, so I had all the Roman things in my head. I haven’t really got into it yet, maybe more than two hundred pages, but it’s just amazing how many of these Roman emperors were killed. I believe that I have already read, perhaps 15 emperors, and only Antonius, Traian and Adrian were not killed, or at least were suspected of being killed. I was also fascinated by the insane excesses of many of these Roman princes. Not the last of them was Caligula. This leads me to reviewing this film. I think about the film on a historical basis, as I understand it from the explanation of Rome Gibbon, as well as other studies from good websites and some science fiction novels on the period. <br /> <br /> My point is that I do not think that this film is what many of its proponents consider it. I do not think that the depravity shown through sex and the terrible violence of this film qualifies it as accurate. General ideas of the film seem to be accurate. Caligula was brought up on the island, exiled with his family and satisfied with the fear of being killed by the increasingly insane, suspicious and strange emperor Tiberius. He grows paranoid and frightened and can never shake the pretty nickname given to him by his guards, Little Boots, it helps him grow, feeling offended and helpless. The empire is handed over to him after the death of Tiberius, and the senate hopes that he will evade informants who brought death at the whim of the former delusional paranoiac, and will lead Rome away from the madness in which the dictator has installed it. Caligula begins as a decent but inconspicuous emperor, but falls ill, almost dies, and returns from a verge of feverish death to a real monster. His perversions with his sisters begin here, if not earlier. He really killed Macro and many others who were his supporters. Acts of madness seemed not so much the murders of Caligula, as his new idea of ​​himself as a living God. He was seen talking to a statue of Jupiter as an equal doomed to him. His brutal mad excesses are doomed to fail anyway, and three years, it seems, are quite decent for the followers of Tiberius. Well, the film basically sticks to these lines, although it manages to be connected, which is not common to all of its goals, it does this in an attempt to shock the public at every turn, in each scene the film asks you to be disgusted with the debauchery of ancient Rome. Shocking scenes are what this film is built on and where it completely fails. It’s too much to see how successive rulers kill person after person, rape him, torture him for some reason. Images of violence are possible, but not likely, accurate. Murder, of course, was commonplace in Imperial Rome, torture in advance was in advance. But the director’s vision of these deaths and the bored entertainment of their main characters, while the witnesses observe with carelessness, I just don’t see it fall so accurately. The death machine, who beheaded, is certainly something like what you have never seen in movies, and something that you once saw, you probably will never forget, even me, how you would like it. Drinking wine while the penis is circumcised remains the same, as soon as you see this shame, it's yours forever. These things strike me a fantasy director and that porn tycoon. They originated from their sick imagination, and not from any proven records. <br /> <br /> The game is pretty good. I actually think McDowell is the weakest link here. Mirren always has something to see, and here, in her youth, she is formidable and beautiful. Nerves and Tiberius are very well made by their respected actors. The film could have done a lot better by telling the story, it’s such a failure that it’s just a whole different layer of how this thing was shamed. For example, it might give an opinion on how and why Caligula went insane, or show that he was insane, paranoid about his illness, and this fever then broke the mental restraint that he had previously. This could show the weakness of Claudius and the miracle that he endured Caligula. He may have these and many other things, but it stuck to his sad nightmares. <br /> <br /> Finally about sex. This is porn. This shows that these sexual acts are performed throughout the palace by many people. A man on a man, a woman on a woman, a man on a woman. This is passionless, disgusting sex. Sex, that if you want to go crazy, I seriously doubt you could. Both Tiberius and Caligula may have been sex addicts, and orgies may be fairly common, but the visions in this film seem to resemble Greek time rather than Roman time. I do not think that this kind of acceptance of homosexuality or orgies in the open air was commonplace until Elgabal’s strange, depraved rule, and he was killed for it. <br /> <br /> This film probably never should have watched, if you are interested in this, release it. This is something, as I said earlier, if you look at it, you, unfortunately, have retained this painful vision for many years in your imagination. I do not think that this is an accurate historical picture in particular, even if it is historical in general.
