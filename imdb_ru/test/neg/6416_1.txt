In a word, damn it ... too many holes in the plot ... hm, yes ... Who takes their child to dig up a dead body in the middle of the night? and what happened to his wife, stealing the skeleton .. who does this? Why did a psychiatrist hit himself in the neck? and all this dog stuff .. I mean, really! The fact that the Sparrow tells from the very beginning also completely destroyed the unknown for me ... I mean, if he tells a story, he is clearly alive to tell about it, so there is no chance that he will be offended ... Where is the waiting? <br /> <br /> Of course, you expect holes in the plot of a film like this. But there is so much that I lost track of the story completely because of them. What is the name Fingling? Or Toppsy? Why did the wife dig the body? (Who does this?) Or do you go to this crazy eerie shelter alone? and where did all these candles come from? Why does the writer have his own PO BOX in an awesome book ??? I mean, come on ... And the book accidentally hit the bookstore next door to the wife's bakery? Too convenient ... Oh, and happy birthday, dear, here is a book about a serial killer ... What a nice gift! The book has a size of about 20 pages, half of which is empty, and it CAN'T READ it. If he is really obsessed with this book, would he not have read it all at once? <br /> <br /> It is a little convenient to stumble upon his future wife (carrying a cake!) 23 seconds after he was released from a psychiatric hospital .. how old was he? 36 ?? <br /> <br /> I was the only one who in the end was rooting for the bus to actually bring down the guy? It is not good when you support the main character to bite him in the end. <br /> <br /> It seems that it was written by a committee ... I believe that the first draft probably has nothing to do with number 23. ... It seems that they need a clever hook to make the audience think that something supernatural happens when, after all, it really has nothing to do with anything. I mean, I did not expect the Godfather or anything else, but everything in this film was a complete disappointment. Without all the numerology, this film could be quite normal, instead of some beaten-up Se7en fake. <br /> <br /> Not scary, unintentionally funny, but otherwise - a complete sunzer.
