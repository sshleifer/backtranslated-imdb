After watching the TV commercials of this film, I went to my local cinema, expecting a lot of laughter. In the end, it was one of the longest 90 minutes I ever spent. Wog Boy really couldn't create a storyline with enough content to hold my interest, and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes did not fill this void. <br /> <br /> The scene in which the two “Wog Boys” dominated the dance floor of their local nightclub was the only one that impressed me at all. The only character worth seeing was “Nathan”, played by Stephen Curry from The Castle, his fight with the opposite sex caused most laughter. <br /> <br /> The word for this movie is boring. Save time and just watch the commercial, which shows only laughter.
