We all know that special effects cost money, but it seems they could use the money saved to write the script to get better pictures. The train is obviously a model in most moving frames, a helicopter is obviously computer generated, an alien looks like the one at the end of the Cosmic Balls, except that ten years have passed and the Cosmic Balls had an excuse. <br /> <br /> the only clever thing they did was to blur all the special effects to make them harder to see. <br /> <br /> Even the actors could not compensate for such a poorly written script, and it’s quite obvious that they really didn’t try either. <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time. You are welcome.
