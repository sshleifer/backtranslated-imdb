I understand that it is very difficult to live to see the first film “The 10 Commandments” (which was grandiose and not personally a fan of Charlton Heston), but wow ... this film / mini-series disappointed. Even the revived prince of Egypt was better. <br /> <br /> The only thing that threw me back is Ramses. Compared with the version of Yul Brynner, the version of Paul Reese looked so weak and non-anoid. The game really wasn't so good. For modern adaptation, I expected something better. Visually, it did not look as amazing as the first. I think they worked with a limited budget or something like that. There is an occasional voice-over narrator, which I found strange and unnecessary. It also broke the flow of the story. And um ... the voice / lines of God were rather strange.
