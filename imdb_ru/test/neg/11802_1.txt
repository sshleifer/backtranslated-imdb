Well, they say it is real. They don’t list screenwriters or directors, but watching this movie alone will not show anyone - this is not what you hoped for. Conversation rarely sounds like a real natural conversation ... but also does not sound so that it can be recorded. (possibly in free form). To me, it sounded much more like what they always tried to unleash. (which they almost always did badly). Therefore, they knew that they were making “cinema”, and not just collecting real natural shots. So I am sure that these people knew what was going on, they knew that they had certain places to search for things that were created ... and they were simply told that they were doing advertising in all of this. <br /> <br /> ************* “Main spoilers” **************** ********* ****************************** <br /> <br /> Well, it's so lame. These items magically stumble upon any object, place, or thing that may be strange or use d as fear. Let me list the ridiculously clearly fake things I remember: <br /> <br /> 1) In less than 2 minutes, when they enter the house, they turn on the light switch - the light of the spark and the chandelier almost fall off the guy. <br /> <br /> 2) They find an old medical bag with a bloody butcher knife * when they inspect the cellar. <br /> <br /> 3) They hear the noise in the closet, so they slowly open the door - BAM - there it turns out the cat and jumps right into the camera, screaming. <br /> <br /> 4) Then they notice that there is a hole in the wall. So, let's thrust a hand ... wow, they pulled out a baby doll wrapped in a ribbon with a mummy. <br /> <br /> 5) Let's go to the attic, uh-uh, it seems heavy here .... BOOM - a chair flies across the room. <br /> <br /> 6) There is time. Oh no ! The girl who was afraid of bugs had a roach in the sandwich! Lol! .... funny. <br /> <br /> 7) Let's get the board Ouija ... oops, one of the legs on the tablet fell from the side of the board. It can't be because people are pushing it, isn't it? (they recognize the ghost named Charles) <br /> <br /> 8) Wait! What was that noise in the chimney ... KLINK - oh, my shackles fell out "I think she * kept people here." <br /> <br /> 9) Now the weak girl is going to boldly look into the chimney shaft ... oh, what it is, she sees something ... and asks people who don’t look at the chimney what it is. SWISH - He falls right on her. (perfect shot from camera) It moves just in time. It was more of a chain. <br /> <br /> 10) Now we have to separate and “clean” our room reserved for this room - there wouldn’t be something if something happened to these people one by one now ... well: <br /> <br /> CHECK # 1: Wow, suddenly her room is shaking ... but no one does. <br /> <br /> DIFFERENT # 1: Actually he says to himself: "Charles, this is what you are, Charles ... this is not you, because you are just a figment of my imagination, aren't you, Charles." Well, guess what, he was knocked over and dragged along the floor. Another good shot from the camera. <br /> <br /> CHICK # 2: Hears something .. tries to communicate ... and stands there, getting abrasions or something like that. <br /> <br /> DUDE # 2: He was in the attic, reached out through the hole in the floor and got a splinter .... I don’t remember what else. <br /> <br /> 11) Dude # 2 runs, gets Chick # 2 .. They hear the cry of the chicken and the guy # 1 ... they find them chained to the wall and tied to the table. (*) They are going away. Cut to black. The final text tells us that they escaped safely, were treated from minor cuts. Since then, they have had nightmares and insomnia, we also learn that the next day, 911 was called, calling someone named "Charles." <br /> <br /> ************ * “Primary spoilers” **************** ********* ********* more ***************** <br /> <br /> Well, when I first heard this movie, I couldn't to wait. I thought it would be real. REAL, real. - and more professional, with people of more professional type. I like the idea of ​​these kinds of things, I would like to see real ghostly footage. Before this movie was released, I saw a couple of reviews about it by people online. They both claimed that it was a fake and how stupid people were ... time passed, I forgot about the film ... then I realized that it had never been released in cinemas. So I found out that he went straight to the video, shot it ... found that every cruel review was completely truthful. This is very bad, I really wanted it to be good. <br /> <br /> Random Thought: There seemed to be no televisions, radios ... kitchen appliances that I remember ... that would make me think that no one lived there for a long time. Especially the house is really known for being persecuted ... I am sure that no one lives there. But it looks so clean and neat ... and what was the cat doing there? The property is not close to the neighbors .... In general, you only want to remove it if you and your friends want to sit and laugh at it ... or if you heard about it a long time ago. and it intrigued you. (you will be disappointed if you expect a good movie ... or a real movie) <br /> <br /> Random thought: I think the producer says: "The shots you see are real." Well, technically these are real shots, aren't they? Real cadres of fake persecutions? Perhaps it was his hole. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie one star - strictly due to the fact that they told the story of Madame Lawler. The true story of New Orleans. <br /> <br /> The best performance was for the guy who first told the participants about ghost hunting equipment. He was really real ... or a good actor. <br /> <br />
