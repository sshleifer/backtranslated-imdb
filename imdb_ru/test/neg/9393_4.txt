If you are a North American tourist looking for a “trap,” here it is. Was this a visit to the Retail Space in Tuscany? There were too many stereotypes. Little attention was paid to the development of character and plot. To yawn. The highlight of the film: throwing the flag. Poor guy! I thought he would lose an eye!
