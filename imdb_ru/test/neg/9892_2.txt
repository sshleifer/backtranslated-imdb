I had to understand that any set of two videos sold for only $ 6 would be bad. I even read reviews before watching this movie, and it still did not shake me. I liked the book, and I knew that it could not be as bad as people said. <br /> <br /> Yes it is. <br /> <br /> A quilt from the film, video and what appears to capture video footage, come together to make a three-hour tour of one chapter of the epic novel by James A. Michener. Well, the period covered was one chapter, but I donâ€™t remember many of the situations that actually occur in the book. The packaging on my copy of the film gives Maria Conchite Alonso the maximum score - although it turns out that she is only in one talking scene. On the second tape. <br /> <br /> Actors deserve praise for having played their roles well, despite the tricky, overloaded script. They must be offended, however, for taking roles in the first place.
