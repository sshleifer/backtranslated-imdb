What a terrible misfire. Not only the name, but the idea is the same as that of Jane Fonda, George Seagal's car a few decades ago. What for? Interestingly, someone with the influence of Jim Carrey will not only play a star, but also create this tired, ugly, meaningless reason for a comedy. He can take the comedy to a whole new level, instead he goes to what he believes is a safe territory. Money, money, gifts, Christmas. But I am sure that this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs. I call it uncomfortable, because I felt that way. Realizing how desperately I tried to try on screen to be funny. And unfortunately, with a bang. It could be an outrageous, politically incorrect, mirror comedy about the days after Enron, but no, it would indicate too high, too risky. What a disgrace!
