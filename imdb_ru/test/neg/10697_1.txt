This piece of shit is actually a bomb, just like the bottom of the barrel. I cannot understand what is worse; Norris's bleak image of anonymity (not a good trait in action) or the hysterical reappraisal of Christopher Neem This film does not give at any level what ever. The sequences of actions are manual, the plot is thin, and the scenes, which must be terrible, look like cliches of the fifties. You can't just fill the room with smoke and men in rubber suits and expect the audience to scream in horror. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film does nothing for me. It actually looks like an unfortunate combination between cheap porn Flick and Miami Vice plagiarism with a little sprinkling of hellish caviar. No, wait. It was supposed to be a hell of a yawn.
