Firstly, the title has nothing to do with the film. It all started well with good development, but it was annoying when he could not tell his girlfriend what had happened to him. Even his attempt to tell the police failed, which only added annoying value. There were too many pregnant pauses in the film, which looked more like filler than anything worthwhile. The plot did not reveal who committed this crime, although a good plot would allow to reveal it. The ending was nothing more than “hey, we’ve run out of budget, let's stop it here NOW !!” ... If I had written a novel that ended this way, I would have headed myself. Trash trash trash!
