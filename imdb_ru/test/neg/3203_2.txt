Trying to fit into the scary space comedy genre, this film falls into two of them. It really happens in space - but this is not funny and not scary. The plot is grim, and one joke about computer intelligence is replayed to death. Having said that Paul Whittorn as Ethan, Angela Bassett as Fran and Brad Dourif as Al Bert make the best of their ham script. Ethan and Al Bertâ€™s homosexual relationships are hinted at, but they have never been explored, although the attempt at sexual tension between Frank and Rick is so gross that it may seem ridiculous. In general, this is a turkey, which is best suited for late night television, preferably during ironing.
