I watched this movie so you don’t have to! I really respect Chris Christopherson, but what was he thinking about? Did he do it for scale? <br /> <br /> At least the title of the film reflects the truth in advertising, as people and objects usually disappear throughout the film, which adds confusion. Christofferson mentions this in his commentary that even he was not sure that the character of Genevieve Bujold really existed. This does not bode well for the viewer who can follow the plot! <br /> <br /> The “creation” feature was much more interesting than the movie itself. He explores the difficulties involved in raising money for indie, even while filming. <br /> <br /> To its credit, this film is visually pleasing and in no way resembles a film shot with just over 1M. It is a pity that the money was not spent on the best project.
