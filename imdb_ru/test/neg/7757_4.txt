From what I understand, Mr. Bawa abandoned this project before it was completed ... AND RIGHT SO !!! If I were him, I would definitely make sure that EVERY copy was burned, and if anyone in the future would ever ask me about this film ... IT WAS NEVER AND IT DOES NOT EXIST ... the end of the story. <br /> <br /> Despite some great shots and a good photo, this is one awful movie ... should it be scary? (last but not least) should it be funny ?? (puh-leese) A complete waste of time ... and I really don't like to talk about it !!
