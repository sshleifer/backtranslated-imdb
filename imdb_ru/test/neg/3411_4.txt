The first of the three Aztec Mummies films is the only one that, as far as I know, has never been fully duplicated in English. The film was cut and used piecemeal by people like Jerry Warren in other films (he combined it with another Mexican horror comedy with Lon Cheney to create The Face of the Screaming Werewolf. And he appeared in Mayan Mummy Attack and elsewhere. ) The longest of the three films, a good piece of this film is two later films that use this as the backbone of flashback. In the plot of this film, the scientist conducts a regression experiment in his past life, as a result of which his subject goes on a journey and discovers hidden cameras in the Aztec pyramid. The group, as well as the sinister figure, known as the Bat, hope to use this information to discover hidden treasures. Instead, they discover a lively mommy who has other plans. This long and long motive of this film has too few actions to sustain its 80-minute work time (even worse, the mummy does not even appear until the hour passes). Probably the least of the three films, it is easy to understand why this film was divided into parts, this is the only way to create a non-dream film. Watching a movie last night, I struggled to stay awake. It was a difficult journey, and I found that I eventually scanned to the place where my mother appeared. If I had a choice, I would take a pass and watch the second two films.
