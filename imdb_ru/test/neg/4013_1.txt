This video has audio that is meant for someone to hear while sleeping. The same can be said about the video. <br /> <br /> Morgan and his wife pretending that this is a rough minimum wage job? Is the camera rolling? And I complain about my little little wife? Give me a break. They are both rich. They sit in their fake apartment for $ 350 a month and take it down from $ 1,000 a month for each film crew of 12 people. <br /> <br /> I used to respect Morgan, but now his experience of “30 days” is nothing more than to fool any voluntary viewers who want to be fooled. <br /> <br /> C'mon, Morgan, are they taking you off to work for $ 6 an hour, and you are being paid by naive employers who don't see these big cameras take it all off ?? And we should not think that they do not pay you under the table?
