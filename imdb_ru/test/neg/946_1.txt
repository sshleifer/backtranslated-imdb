Summary: The child is not accepted in any colleges. He creates a “college” where he and his friends can celebrate, using money to educate their parents. <br /> <br /> Wow. Paean to ignorance. <br /> <br /> If you believe that we are fine, man, then this film is for you. In addition, you should understand that: <br /> <br /> 1. Children have it all inside - they just need to let it go. <br /> <br /> 2. Teaching really stifles the innate creativity with which everyone is born. <br /> <br /> 3. Someone must pay to ensure that you follow your passion. <br /> <br /> 4. 300 teenagers can live together in harmony if you give up these restrictive rules. <br /> <br /> 5. Speech to the mercy of fate is often much more convincing than ready-made presentations. <br /> <br /> 6. If the Education Council allows you to open a “charter school” with “non-traditional teaching methods”, it is because it is in your interests that they are interested. (It's not that they want to let go of low-performing students, who will still work on fast food.) <br /> <br /> This film is one of the genres of the college comedy genre, that is, Animal House. It follows the model quite closely. What is new here is a complete attack on higher education, not a parody of bad elements. He lacks a sympathetic insider, a professor who embodies a decent part of university life. <br /> <br /> This lack of balance will consign this film to the back rows of the blockbuster. It is so one-sided that I wondered if it was an ironic self-appeal to the whole genre - for about one minute. The film has no deep meaning, no layers, no introspection. As if they allow some children who never went to class to do what happens naturally. And what is natural is the name of the school: S ***. <br /> <br /> (I never thought I would say this: go see something with Will Farrell. His comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated.)
