I watched this movie on TV last night, hoping for a real account of what could have happened if there had been an outbreak of any disease that could be transmitted. I was disappointed and I think the film was rubbish. It did not seem real to me. Some actions were terrible, in particular, the actions of the doctor. She was about the worst I've seen. It all played like CNN's “worst-case scenario.” Even the compulsory battles of human relations from a disaster movie did not seem sincere. I have seen some disaster films, in particular weather films, which are really so bad that they are funny. This one is almost as bad, but it’s not even funny, it’s tedious and boring. Do not worry about it.
