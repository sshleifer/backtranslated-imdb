Well, if you discount the production cost, ugly outfits and big hair, this adaptation is still far behind the version of the 90s. First Ann Firbank (playing Ann Elliot) is literally ten years older than this role, and her acting leaves much to be desired. Amanda Ruth (playing the same role in the 90s version) can express more with her big brown eyes than Firbank with her whole face in a four-hour setting. Ann turns into an irritable, whining, boring character (and what happened to the stage during the "long walk" when she stops pouring poetry?). Henrietta and Louise looked so much alike that the only time I could distinguish them was when they stood side by side (Henrietta was taller). And Louise! Never had a more disgusting character! It was ridiculous to think that Wentworth should have been interested in her. She should be energetic, beautiful and charming, not stupid and stupid with her ridiculous laugh like nails on a board. When she starts to sing, “Lime, Lime, Lime,” I started shouting, “Shut up, shut up, shut up!” in film. Speaking of the fall on the scene of Cobb; it was Moses, the poorly acting, ill directed and edited scene of the entire film. How does a person fall three feet lower, land on his feet and still faint? <br /> <br /> In the plus, Elizabeth’s character was much closer to the book than in the 90s version. They also added many more scenes with Anna and Frederick at the end. <br /> <br /> I confess that I bought this film, even though I knew how much lower it was, but I am a huge Austin Fan, so I will buy any film adapted from one of her novels. Watch this move if you are curiously painful, or evaluate the 90s version even more. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this version can follow the letter of the novel, but the version of the 90s follows the spirit.
