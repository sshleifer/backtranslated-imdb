Chupacabra Horror: 2/10: It was the team of the Navy, which changed the balance from a bad crappy movie to just bad. Before that there was a lot of bad luggage in the movies, but seals ?? They wear bicycle helmets painted black. You know, the ones with air holes that make every adult who wears them look like a complete tool. Of course, the fishing boat for the bass, which they took to greet the cruise ship, could be another clue (she would not have passed through Tampa Bay, not to mention the ocean) ?? and their tactics would not pass by in the game on the XBOX of the 3rd level. <br /> <br /> Does director John Shepfird have a photograph of John Rees-Davis taking a compromise with the Hobbit? Because I can't think of any other reason why he would be in this film. Other actors have a great excuse. These are untalented unattractive hacks that cannot be hired for a commercial. The plot is that two men are trying to smuggle the mythical Chupacabra (Love, pronouncing this name) on board the cruise ship, and it is released. <br /> <br /> The kits consist of a horrific cruise ship forgery (complete with small apartment-sized air rolls), monster kills are at the bottom of the barrel, there is no nudity, and many really bad actors refuse to finish their death scenes. Of particular annoyance is the character-gigolo from the film of the 60s Doris. <br /> <br /> Cast ketchup is bleeding, and the chupacabra is bleeding with a daytime green glow in dark blood. (Why a goat eating a Mexican mammal will bleed because of something other than red - I can't do it.) <br /> <br /> Each B movie has a turning point that makes it funny (Hey, this is a lesbian scene in the shower, OMG, this guy just ate - these are his own eyeballs) or not so much fun (did they just call these forty overweight guys in overalls and Navy Seals bicycle helmets?) Chupacabra with a dull thud in the not so funny side of the movie B.
