This movie didn't bother me. While on vacation in Turkey, I noticed that he was playing in a local cinema, and decided to take the opportunity to watch it. The sequence of actions in the film is well delivered, but the plot is delayed in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> One thing I didn’t really follow was how Borta managed to get money to bribe the Guards. <br /> <br /> Another thing I didn’t particularly like was the missing part of Khan’s life. This did not go into the details of how the bad guys could find him and re-imprison him after he went missing for so long. <br /> <br /> Overall, I rate this film as (4), because I liked the action sequences, but there were too few to justify a higher appreciation, because the dialogue left me less impressed ...
