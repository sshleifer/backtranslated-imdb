I really wanted this movie. Great cast member ?? Walter Pijon in a role that reminds us of his cult "Forbidden Planet", Barbara Eden and Robert Stirling as young lovers, Frankie Avalon as a musical sailor (guy on a submarine sailor?), Even Peter Lorra as a scientist with a love for sharks . Maybe this is a good children's film, but I had problems waking. Lorre was greatly underestimated. I guess he was a red herring like a pidgeon ?? You expect him to go crazy and try to throw the hero or his girlfriend into the aquarium. There is no such luck. By the way, why on a submarine aquarium with sharks? This is typical of a movie without ambition. They explain why Lorre walks back and forth with the shark (because we see it), but just expect us to accept the fact that there is a shark for some reason on this submarine. "Study?" Yes, scientists are always engaged in this research, who can understand them? Of course, if there were no shark, who would kill the evil lady psychologist (Joan Fontaine)? Sorry, but even children's films of the 50s can be less predictable and frankly idiotic (not to mention exploitation). <br /> <br /> The first 10 or 15 minutes really gave hope. Gorgeous themed song performed by Frankie Avalon. Pidgin, host Floyd Barber (actually Howard MacNier, sorry, Howie loved you in Blue Hawaii) and Joan Fontaine on a tour, trying to skip the room with the huge “WARNING” sign on the door, past Peter Lorre with the aforementioned sharks, and we see a full screen shot of Eden shaking his creator while playing on the passionate horn of Avalon! The film quickly goes downstream from there. There is no real explanation for the fact that the firestorm threatens the Earth, so there is clearly no dramatic tension and no villain. Instead, Pidzhon’s character turns into an unconvincing red herring, vaguely similar to Ahab’s species (I think Kane’s Rebellion was still fresh in people's minds), and Fontaine’s character suddenly turns into evil without a cause at the end. Oh, I suppose the reason is that this is a surprise for the audience. And this is a bit surprising, since the only thing she did was speak ill of the mental health of the captain, and ALWAYS had no reason to sabotage her after she was a villain. Very poorly done and unconvincing. The guy who was a pessimistic biblical nut was better ?? at least his character made sense. <br /> <br /> So what else can go wrong? Endless, endless snorkeling footage. I never understand the attractiveness of this kind of thing. The giant squid attacks the ship for a minute, so there is a monster for the theatrical trailer. Maybe it fooled some people to think that this would be a fantastic adventure film, and not an unfinished unknown film about military scientists who never make mistakes. Yes ?? what's worse, it's just a science fiction movie, not a science fiction movie. He never did anything for my imagination, because the whole premise was nothing more than another disaster / apocalypse, and these characters never have any feelings of surprise or discovery. I did away with Irwin Allen. In any case, I never liked his later films, but this one made me pretend to be Jules Verne, when this is actually just another exercise in saving from disaster. The whole movie is just waiting to see which character is incredibly transformed into evil and will die. He has always hired an actor / actress with a charming and representative screen persona to play these roles, and this is the only element of “surprise” that can be found, since in any case these characters have no logic. What a waste of time for these actors. George Pal's films are 100 times better (the only one who was a loser was Atlantis, which, by coincidence, was the most allen Esquire), full of surprise, excitement and think about it! ?? ideas! In addition to several scenes of effects and Barbara Eden, here, in my opinion, it does not cost anything to watch. I think it's fun for those who love disaster films, but I think it's an empty and boring movie genre.
