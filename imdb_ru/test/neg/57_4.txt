Generally speaking, I do not make negative comments here. But since this is a festival play, I donâ€™t want you to lose time when you could see something else that could no longer play. <br /> <br /> I thought the actors were pretty bad. For example, they did not play at all against each other; rather, they waited to RECORD their lines, which were rather poor from the very beginning. The dialogue sounded really forced. Norman or something else, that his name was trying, or seemingly so, to be witty and bite in the lines that he chose, but just failed. <br /> <br /> After the words, he asked if anyone had seen the end approaching some people. they were all yes, and he almost called them liars. Look, there were so many tips, the biggest of which is a briefcase full of money for a whore for $ 500 an hour. I mean that John gave her at least 20 grams ... a fairy tale sign. Now, no, you could not see exactly what was going to happen, but by the time the turn really happened, I, for example, did not even care. I was just happy to get out of there. I asked him what draft he was shooting, and he answered 8.1, maybe next time he will wait for shooting until 15.3, because it took a lot of work. <br /> <br /> But he seemed like a pretty good guy, he was filming his own films, he would probably get better, and I hope that he will succeed, not so disgusting, I mean, I wish him good luck. Just remember, this is just my opinion.
