This is a real bastard. <br /> <br /> The story simply doesn’t fit most of the other TZ episodes. It's pretty boring, although looking at Peter Falk, invented as a double of Fidel Castro, is quite funny. <br /> <br /> Whenever the Twilight Zone went on air without warning in my hometown, I would take a sandwich and drink and get settled for some quality entertainment. 9 times out of 10 it was this episode! Strange thing? This often happened to my mom (another TZ fan like me). It was so many times that one of us said to the other: “I was ready to watch the Twilight Zone and guess which episode was in the episode? Cuban dictator!” Obviously, some people like this episode because it gets rating 6.7 ... how it happened, I have no idea - but that in itself would make an excellent plot of the Twilight Zone!
