Let me start by saying that I do not remember laughter during this comedy. At the opening of the stage, our main character Solo (Giovanni Ribisi) shows himself lost in himself, a weak and neurotic loser, completely unable to cope with the smallest duties, such as balancing a checkbook, restraining his word or forming a coherent thought. I guess we should be attracted to his fragile vulnerability and cheering him through the process of getting out of deep depression. I suppose we should sympathize, as he runs into a series of misadventures, apparently caused by his buying a dog, but in reality caused by his own despicable nature. I didn’t get the slightest hint that Solo had ever had any redemptive temper, which became alarmingly obvious when he couldn’t feed his dog for several days. No spark of humanity or a glimpse of conscience gave me hope that he ever realizes that his life is so miserable because he is self-absorbed, pathetic to himself a base man. I had no connection with this character. It seems he did not care, as well as me. I really wanted him to break his kneecaps once. <br /> <br /> The dog was not a character in the film. It was just a prop that was used, neglected, despised, insulted, desired, and dismissed at whim. So be careful. Despite the fact that there is a “dog” in the title, this film is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers. <br /> <br /> Scott Caan’s role is funny and believable, like a bosom best friend. Don Cheadle is sincere and attractive - I always want to see him more on the screen. Mena Suvari was delightfully repulsive. The role of Lynn Collins in the role of a “stripper with a heart” was well played, but the character was both absurd and cliche, not to mention the fact that there was no chemistry between her and Ribisi. <br /> <br /> Romantic? Barely Comedy? If you say so.
