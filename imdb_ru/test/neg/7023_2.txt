This is a terrible movie, and I'm not even sure why it is so terrible. Awful, on the one hand, with this trendy 1970s visual style, which at the time might have seemed like a good idea, but which now allows instant recognition of a film of that period as a product of the 70s. The film has preserved the history and songs that made the stage version of the musical such a hit, but the songs sound lifeless on the screen. But, basically, the film sucks because of the pale play by Lucille Ball, who do you think could have made something of this larger character if someone could. She walks through the film like a frightened actress, choking in a premiere, and the film sinks with her. Even Bea Arthur, who, I am sure, was hilarious as the best friend on stage, cannot breathe life into this bitch. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> Rating: D
