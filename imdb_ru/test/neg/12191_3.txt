ATTENTION: I advise everyone who has not yet seen the film not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> When I first started watching this film, I expected it to be a vampire film that would be awesome, considering how Rodriguez and Tarantino both helped make the film. I started in about 15 minutes, and already my hopes for this film did not come true, which shocked me. Firstly, the story with which she was going was not at all attractive in any case, but simply looked boring and inexorable to such an extent that I just wanted to turn it off. I became more and more disappointed with this film when he was stretching, but I think I had hopes that he would get better ... when he finally showed the vampires, he is VERY YOUNG, VERY badly. I thought, “Well, this film started with some horrible story about these two criminals, and then VERY slowly turned into some kind of vampire film that I thought would be from the beginning, in about the last 30 minutes? "To add to this, they are trying to make the main characters all cool and awesome and mean at the end when they just don’t; The rabbit would be more frightening than these characters! This movie is a terrible piece of shit !!! From dusk to dawn, I dishonored me and left a terrible taste in my mouth, discouraging thoughts in my head, and left my body unable to move away from the terrible shock that I had just lost 108 minutes of my life in a horrible movie. I don’t understand how George Clooney, Quentin Tarintino, Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo, being all good and honorable actors, could take part in this useless mud. In my opinion, “From Dusk Till Dawn” is one of the worst films I have ever made. You do not see, you will do a great service ...
