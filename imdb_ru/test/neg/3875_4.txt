"The Return of the Seven" has a few good militants, and Elmer Bernsteinâ€™s account inspires more than ever. However, this is a boring movie because it simply does not attract us emotionally. The absence of McQueen makes a really bad impression, and the fact that his character here plays another (little-known) actor, a strange one is a bad way. Characters are not developed, so we do not associate with them - and we do not care when some of them die. This sequel is a tolerable, but poor imitation of the original.
