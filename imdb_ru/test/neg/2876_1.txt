For me, Bollywood films are usually not so much, although they are still highly desirable, and Bollywood is a major producer of files, as they have their fans. <br /> <br /> The only motive that made me watch a movie was to see how much an American actress can change or influence the logic of Indian cinema. This not only did not change the plot of the film, but this confusion caused several ridiculous events. <br /> <br /> I mean that a lot of illogical things are often found in Indian films because there is a world of their own in their own world. films. But as soon as you see such incidents happen to an American, it makes you laugh. For God's sake, can you believe that a famous American actress is stuck in a desperate situation and feels powerless. Can you imagine an American actress falling in love with a dance teacher whose bride already fell in love with an American guy, and they met each other at the same time. There were a lot of similar things to mention. the less said the better. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I was mistaken because I was expecting too much from Indian films.
