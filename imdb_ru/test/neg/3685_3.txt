This line is a good summary of this film. If you read it and watched the 20 minutes of the film, you will know for sure how the rest of the film will behave. Some researchers named Surgei (pronounced SirGay) are looking for hell in the underworld of Moscow. However, he seems to have disappeared, and his friend Aries follows with the team to look for him. Could they have found a more boring plot? Some bad actors look after the old man in the underground. The acting is very bad, the romance really seems meaningless and false, often there is no compelling reason for the behavior of the characters, nothing terrible and, most importantly: nothing interesting in general, the whole movie does not occur. They just go, ask some gang leaders and other guys about the path, go still, complain, find an old man, and then run and finally leave the underground. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives me the opportunity to give this film the lowest rating of all is the atmosphere. If you just want to watch a movie for this, it may be a good choice. Dark, mystical and gloomy. However, the rest of the film is really boring. You just sit there all the time, waiting for the movie to start or something going on. This actually happens some things, but they are not very well executed. For example, I really did not notice when one of the characters disappeared, and I swear I didnâ€™t sleep or something like that. And I do not understand what is dangerous with these children ... They just run underground, scratching the walls with sticks (I think it must be scary). <br /> <br /> Just watch this movie if you urgently need a muddy atmosphere.
