To truly appreciate this movie, you had to be there (shoot?) Or be a member of the film crew. <br /> <br /> Yes, I am “Selena”, and at the mature age of 42 you have serious doubts about what we did / did. <br /> <br /> It all started with the fact that they looked like “John Waters”; friends played bad films in bad movies. Somewhere along the line, the fun had stopped, the people who were supposed to be friends, did not speak anymore, and the BAD became worse. <br /> <br /> I regret the bad image that I could have projected (try to fit into the first-size spandex gold pants) <br /> <br /> Besides, the movie sucks so badly that I even wouldn't make mom watch him. <br /> <br /> To my director, actors and film crew I say, <br /> <br /> "Why can't we just get along? <br /> <br /> It was over twenty years old, people !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!
