Let's look at everything in the first paragraph. "The Messengers", the newest film of the Pang brothers (Danny and Oxide), as a horror film, is very bad. And just like the film as a whole, this is a big disappointment. This is nothing more than a renewed “Sixth Sense,” and while this picture is still available, there is no reason on Earth to pay money to see this turkey. <br /> <br /> Recently, horror films / slashers such as the Final Destination, Wrong Move, Boogie Man, Ring 2, and Spite series are becoming more and more dependent from big shocks without reward (for example, something pops up on a person on the screen causes a sigh from the public, but it turns out that it is a cat, a crow or something like that.) Little turns it into a real frightening experience, such as " Sixth Sense, Signs, or some classic horror. movies of the 1940s, 50s and 60s. <br /> <br /> “The Messengers” rely on the same old, weary clichés as these new, much worse films, and therefore the old, tired and, to my surprise, turned out to be one of the most boring films that I ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot has another stupid family headed by Papa Roy (Dylan McDermott, “Practice”), mom Denise (Penel) op Ann Miller, Awakening, Kindergarten Policeman, series “ Desperate Housewives ”), older sister Jess (Kristen Stewart,“ Zatura: A Space Adventure ”) and baby Ben (Evan Turner) who are moving to North Dakota from Chicago. <br /> <br /> The reason for such a move is never described here, but this is due to the father’s inability to find work and Jess’s drunk driving. We know that problems will immediately arise because they are moving to a big gothic house in the middle of nowhere; a house that looks like a summer house in münster. Oh, and the first five minutes of the film show that something terrible really happened there. <br /> <br /> Jess hates this place (hey, who could blame her), but optimistic pop music hopes to find a way to grow sunflowers (despite an unusually large number of crows fluttering around). But when he meets Bervella (John Corbet, Helen Resurrection and looks like Kevin Costner in the version of the movie My Name Is Earl), a wandering tramp and sunflower growing expert, things start to get better. <br /> <br /> But then strange things start to happen; Jess is terrorized by a violent invisible force in the house (of course, no one but Ben, two, can see it, so she is marked with flakes), and the crows continue to wander around. Ben can also detect unearthly creatures, but since he is two years old, he cannot formulate it. Scene backstage, people telling a little boy to tell them what he sees, finally made me want to scream at the screen: “He can't tell you! He is two - damn "- years! “Yes, there is the only protagonist who can solve all these things, be a dumb kid, really smart. <br /> <br /> In any case, we can only think about the sanity of Jess; when and if Ben will ever correctly describe the paranormal visions that he sees; if dad makes sunflower work; if the tramp on the high plains is a good guy or a bad one; what is the meaning of a realtor like George Plympton; as forks stuck in the back, can only be a wound of flesh; what is the role of mom in the family; and where all the crows come from. <br /> <br /> All of this is in anticipation and that something — something — happens. The conclusion is indeed very inconclusive, and once again the question arises of how a spirit that does not have a physical body can harm a living person. Very boring, meaningless and most terrible of all, not at all frightening. <br /> <br /> Oh, and in this film a lot of crows.
