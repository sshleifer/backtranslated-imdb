Film director Brian Forbes, who once demonstrated a light, sardonic touch with attractive materials such as Wind Whistle and original Stepford Wives, is all here Not only was his leadership inept, he also casually adapted Sidney Sheldonâ€™s early novel; the results are brutal. Roger Moore plays a psychiatrist accused of killing one of his patients; Rod Steiger, chewing on the scenery, is a hot policeman under the collar (this is his most awkward job). The only actor here to show some life is Elliot Gould, who knows something about animating an ass script. Soft, changeable and cheaply produced. NO STARS from ****
