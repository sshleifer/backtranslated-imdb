The Rose ?? Does anything really happen in this episode? He introduces us to two heroes: a mad grinning idiot Doctor and a completely uninteresting interlocutor. There is no plot, about children's humor, mixed with some extremely bad rhythmic and random music. What else to say? <br /> <br /> End of the World ?? The slight improvement is that we see our first space scenario. Subsequently brought down by bad modern humor, thin paper logic, a very bad rhythm and tired SF cliches. <br /> <br /> The Unquiet Dead ?? The best episode to date, showing what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode, write a dialogue with interesting characters and integrate an intriguing storyline. Brings only the Doctor and Rose. <br /> <br /> Aliens from London / Third World War - Doctor who degenerates into a farce. What more can be said. Penelope Wilton brings a little seriousness to the process, trying her best in difficult circumstances. Some poorly written and irrelevant elements of the soap opera come to the fore in these two episodes, and a return to poor stimulation, bad plot and unworthy humor / satire. <br /> <br /> Far? Not much, but still much higher than the RTD tariff today. The pace and scenario are all right (although the Doctor and Rose are still annoying). The effects and threats of Dalek are well represented. The finale, however, took an interesting premise that turned the Doctor's most notorious enemy into a pleasant, irritable mess and turned a previously unseen threat into a blue rubber squid, similar to a child's toy. <br /> <br /> The Long Game is the first RTD script showing any plot, even if it was in the 80's cliche style. Nevertheless, it was somewhat overshadowed by his usual over-reliance on youthful jokes, which put him too far in the future to make logical sense, and again a bad move. Not as bad as his previous efforts, but instantly forgotten. <br /> <br /> Father's Day ?? The original premise could be vaguely interesting, but common sense and logic refuse this episode from the very beginning. Also we are waiting for a whole episode of Soap Opera. Before you start thinking that it's all about characterization, remember that there is a big difference between the lame Soap Opera and the characterization. On the other hand, this proves that RTD is not yet the worst script writer. <br /> <br /> The Empty Child / The Doctor Dances - this started in a mediocre way, with some unpleasant moments, and some illogical mistakes that even an elementary school student would not have made (well lit blackout windows, anyone? ). After this, the first part takes a more interesting and sinister turn. Florence Hoat really steals these episodes, showing us what an interesting companion could be. She can also act. Instead, we get annoying and politically correct captain Jack as a new companion. The conclusion was a bit hasty, but sufficient. The tempo and scenario improved with a fairly good storyline, which makes these two episodes quite atmospheric and intriguing. <br /> <br /> Boom Town - I have to be honest, with the exception of a few examples, I was so disappointed with the current series that when I saw the trailer for another episode of “Slitheen”, I gave up and did not torture myself. <br /> <br /> Bad Wolf - reality television, perhaps the worst aspect of modern media, is mainly used as a prerequisite. There is no subtlety whatsoever. Do we get any interesting social commentary, such as “Running Man” or “The Truman Show”? No, of course not. This is in the RTD episode, so they are mostly here to cynically try to attract viewers of these shows. And again the logic goes to the window, because in the future we have more than 200,000 years. RTD is senselessly trying to show here some kind of “excessive” history that has nothing to do except its own existence and when the villains reveal themselves in the end ... They create empty threats, and the Doctor smiles again, like an idiot for a climax! For the most part, faster than other RTD efforts, it has one or two interesting points. Otherwise, another inaccurate fee. <br /> <br /> Separation - Big Final. More moist squid, literally. The whole Dalek threat created in Dalek has collapsed because they are becoming quite pathetic. So many holes in the plot make this episode with typically bad tricks. Daleks want to gather people like Daleks, but then evaporate whole continents? Far can evaporate the indicated continents, but not destroy the Tardis in space? The tardis is now indestructible and can land anywhere, even over people, so that they can be saved in it? This ability can not be used to easily destroy the "god" is far? Daleks can evaporate whole continents, but not just destroy satellite 5 to destroy the doctor, but instead allow him to play? Is the doctor a wretched coward without conviction of his actions, after destroying his whole species, to try to destroy the Daleks? In addition to these and many other holes, we turn to the worst solution dues ex machina ever conceived, connected to an almost meaningless storyline. <br /> <br /> What can be said about the new series, all in all? <br /> <br /> If it was something other than Doctor Who, behind which stands RTD, would it have turned out in the second series? Would most episodes be regarded as something other than non-original and forgettable, if they were anything other than “Doctor Who” and to which the name RTD was attached? I think not. <br /> <br /> Some people would like us to think that we can’t say anything against RTD, since we owe him for returning Doctor Who to our screens. However, this is due to good characters and stories. Personally, I would prefer not to have a poorly planned, poorly thought out product produced at such a price. I would prefer to wait until someone can come and make real efforts. For the most part, this is the same trashy nonsense that gives SF a bad name, combining what is otherwise the most creative genre.
