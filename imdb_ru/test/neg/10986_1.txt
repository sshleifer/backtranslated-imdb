This is the worst movie I have seen lately. It reminded me of the Cirque du Soleil show that I saw in Vegas six years ago - without athleticism. By this I mean that several bright, fancy images appear in random order, without any supporting structure. Fake tinted film sepia is really sticky. This device is almost never justified and, of course, not in _Tuvalu_. I apologize to Abe Lincoln: sometimes you can fool some people.
