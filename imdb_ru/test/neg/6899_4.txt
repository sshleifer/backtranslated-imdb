This film seemed very fast, both in plot and in graphics. My two daughters were ready to go 30 minutes before the end of the film, which rarely happens when we go to theaters. It was a Nickelodeon production, and it would be better if they released it on television. station. The animation itself in some parts was ok. but the plot was terrible. The classic story of how a son tries to meet his fatherâ€™s expectations is used in many children's films, but the animation or graphics must be really good to keep the attention of the children. This was not the case with this movie. There were also clumsy elements between the leading male and female character, without which the plot could do.
