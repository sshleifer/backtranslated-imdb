Most of the low-cost fighters from the 80s, made exclusively for the video, always stink worse than coarse old socks. This particularly gloomy and amateur low-budget Chicago basement deal "nasty necrophilous nut in freedom" bloodshed serves as a depressing confirmation of this borderline inevitable fact. The bearded, disheveled, long-haired, fruit-worn psycho-hippie wild-eyed fruit-clad shirt and floral shirt begin their standard random terrible fun, graphically killing the libidinal young couples who engage in intense sexual intercourse whenever insane Manusonian crazy attacks. (Hmm, can I find a rather obvious and smugly puritan message of "having sex and dying" here? Gee, maybe a dude.) Boy, this mentally unbalanced patient is one of the real puppies gone? our killer madly loves to make love with their newly killed bodies. (WARNING: * SPOILER * possible * in front. By the end of the picture, the cops-crazy corpses are roughly interrupted by the police when he does the unbelievable with a nubilny corpse, thereby provoking the disgusting pervert to break off with understandable agony. Is this gonzo guy definitely not a loved one and a half? <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this film is so poorly made; if he had been made with only a small amount of talent and skill, he could have been a small, pitiful gem of a horror object. Alas, the clumsy direction of Wally Koz, in Lamar "Larry" Bloodworth's stubbornly static and motionless cinematography, Frankie "Hollywood" Rodriguez bland, monotonous head banging "hard rock" account, then plaintively cheap and unconvincingly makeup e / x, flat, noticeably awkward plywood acting disgustingly with all the thumbs and unattractive is not a blunder, sluggish move (too much screen time is tiresomely spent on gray police efforts to catch eccentrics), especially the lame, shocking ending of the “surprise” it will make you moan in disgust), evenly boring, incessantly quarreling and positively mind-blowing characters, as well as a continuous series of boring sexual sex scenes that are about erotic, like watching two slugs for 90 minutes all in a row are deeply rotten and not bringing the pleasures of soft, damp noodles made of clinker. However, to be fair, this film truly possesses one stellar virtue: The Crazy Dog Chopper has, undoubtedly, excellent taste of a motley tropical, louder than the thunder of day-glo Hawaiian shirts.
