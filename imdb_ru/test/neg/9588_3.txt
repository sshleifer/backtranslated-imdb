This film is trying to turn the studio era in Hollywood and the moral of the 1950s. Guy Stone was conceived of as a rock Hudson type, but script and actor Matt Letcher end up directing George George's clever baritone-voiced version instead of creating an unpleasant character. <br /> <br /> Guy Stone is such a reprehensible person that the audience doesn’t like this waste of human skin. Unlike Hudson, who was sweetly erratic, Stone is a hated man who consciously uses and then throws out cute, handsome young people who share his bed every few hours. <br /> <br /> Veronica Cartwright - Jerry, bachelor lesbian Stone's manager. Cartwright is very good, but the director doesn't quite know what to do with her. The mistake lies in the dialogue, which is a bit awkward, and the film tolerates it. <br /> <br /> Sally Carrie Preston is more indebted to Ellen Green at the Little Horror Shop. As written, Sally Preston is good for laughs, but a little more. Rookie Adam Greer is lost in this film. He can not play, and it seems that he was chosen for his hot body and beautiful appearance. <br /> <br /> Like many recent films, Straight Jacket is drama, a comedy film that randomly switches to drama about two-thirds of the way through the film. And, like almost all dramas, Straight Jacket fails. <br /> <br /> Despite the costly Skywalker Sound services, the sound quality of the film leaves much to be desired. Excessive use of a musical soundtrack also creates a distracting amount of signals. <br /> <br /> The film really did not manage to make fun of something about the 1950s. Unlike Singin 'in the Rain, which perfectly reflects Hollywood's ambivalence about sound, as well as the studio mentality of formula films, Straight-Jacket generally fails to portray Hollywood in the 1950s. The dialogue, scenery, and behavior of key characters are indescribable, not dead, Hollywood stereotypes of the 1950s. The same can be said about the heyday of common morals, social trends and hobbies of the 1950s in general. Compare the transformation of Guy's house with the dead satire of the 1950s house in the “Little Horror Shop”. There is no comparison; “Little Shop” hits the head with a nail, and “Straight-Jacket” does not even know that there is a nail. <br /> <br /> Motivations also seem random. Rick Foster is supposed to be a principled liberal, but he almost immediately falls in love with a materialistic smack, such as Guy Stone. Rick has been with Guy's closed status for months. But when it comes time to go to Italy, he comes into conflict for completely unclear reasons. And although Sally seems to fall in love with Freddie during a party, this point of the plot simply disappears in a few minutes without comment. Rick looks like gay from the 1990s, not like the author of the 1950s gays. Indeed, contemporary morality fills this film - which should not be if it were a truly satirical view of homophobia in Hollywood in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> There are also a lot of holes in this bitty movie. Saul repeatedly says that he is going to hand Freddie Stevens to the feds, but he never does so - allowing Freddie to chase Guy. Conspiracy of Jerry and Saul with "in" Guy never makes any sense, nor does Sally's sudden decision to take the blame. And although Guy acknowledged that he is a homosexual, apparently, it does not matter, and in any case he becomes a famous star and playwright. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the production values ​​saved this film. Michael Pinky's cinematography is pedestrian. Sometimes the film looks more like a filmed play, and not like a movie (especially the scenes in Saul’s office). Everything is limited to medium frames, and the film has an incredible static. Editing by Chris Conley also does not help the film. Long scenes that would benefit from making close-ups or shifts in viewpoint remain uncircumcised. It is not known whether this is due to a lack of lighting or poor editing, but the overall effect is to create a sense of lethargy. <br /> <br /> The film relies heavily on the effects of Guy’s computer graphics created by the visual effect. designer Thomas Dickens. But CGI looks awkward and deceptive, and this is very noticeable amateurish. <br /> <br /> My overall impression of this film is that jokes are cheap and light, the plot is muddled, the characteristics are wildly inconsistent and far off the mark, satire does not exist, performances abroad and inappropriately, and the comic time is off. This is almost an amateur movie. As if someone took school products and threw 10 million dollars into it.
