The 1983 "Frightmare" is a weird little movie. The director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic horror films in the style of the 30s / 40s with the shock factor of the exploding slasher genre of the 80s. This is not entirely successful (mainly because of the very obvious budgetary constraints and less professional level of the cast of young actors), but he still has his moments, mainly because of the class work (more cool than the film deserves) of the late German actor Ferdinand Mein, who plays an aging time horror movie star (ala Vincent Price) named "Konrad Rattsov". At the beginning of the film, we meet with an already horror star, when he shoots a commercial for dentures, and we quickly learn that old Conrad is a little brave, a prima donna. At that moment, when you think that he cannot be more unattractive, the commercial director scolds Conrad for the fact that he once again makes a blow, and the old goat pushes him from the balcony until his death. Good? Conrad then visits some of the horror movie club members on the college campus, unfortunately in the middle of his speech he suffers from a heart attack and eventually returns to his mansion, waiting for death. Still furious even on the eve of Death, he manages to finish off his despicable business partner by choking him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself. Then Conrad is buried in true Hollywood style in a neon tomb in high-tech style with video screens above the coffin, which will play personal video messages from Conrad himself for visitors who come in to pay homage. <br /> <br /> It was at this moment that the children of the Horror Society at college decided to pay Conrad’s grave after visiting after hours, breaking into the tomb and taking his body home with him to the party all night. (Not really my idea of ​​fun, but, hey, these are 80s horror movie characters. There’s no logic here.) College students spend the evening at dinner when Conrad’s body sits in a place of honor, posing for photos with him and even dancing with him around the room before you park Conrad and his coffin in the attic, planning to return him to the crypt in the morning. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ratzov, distraught from stealing the body of her husband, urged a psychic friend to try to "reach" Conrad through a session. You can pretty much find out the rest from here. Since Conrad was not a very good guy in life, one can hardly assume that he would not be friendlier in death. The psychic lady comes in contact with Conrad, and he, as expected, awakens again, and then spends the rest of the film, walking through the corridors of the ridiculously large student home, selecting young grave robbers in turn. This is where the movie falls apart. Endless scenes with teenagers wandering around the empty corridors and saying, “Hi? Does anyone have any? ”Are interspersed with random outbursts of violence (we get a rather cruel decapitation scene, which is the main point of the film) before the last two survivors finally figure out (WAY later than any semi-intellectual person would understand the same thing ...) But again, we are in the horror film of the 80s!) that the only way to stop the chaos is to return the body of Conrad to his crypt, where he is. Sluggish stimulation is complemented by many strange light sources and fog effects due to dry ice, supported by a soundtrack consisting almost entirely of sound effects, not music (thunder, moans and moans, howling, etc.), which after a while becomes strongly annoying. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend "Frightmare" to anyone who didn't grow up watching such cheap movies on late night cable in the 80s. Fans of "Modern Horror" will surely find the "Frightmare" incredibly slow and stupid. However, if you came of age in this magical decade, you can get a surge of nostalgia from Frightmare. Jeffrey Fans ("Resuscitator") Combs may also want to check it out, as the future Dr. West appears in one of the first roles here as one of the unfortunate students of the film. <br /> <br /> I would advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the EastWestDVD label (paired with Roy Ward's “Shelter of Terror” and sold in dollar stores), because the print quality is terrible. I was told that the film received a splendid release through wonderful people in Troma, which seems appropriate. If you're a Troma-type person, then “Frightmare” will be right in your alley.
