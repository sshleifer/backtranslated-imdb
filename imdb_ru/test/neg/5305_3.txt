Chile Palmer is tired of acting in movies and knows that she wants to succeed in music. Being half the mafia, half the negotiating expert, he wants to climb the music market. However, know that everyone is the same as him, and forcing a good singer, Linda Moon, to record a hit will be harder than expected. The first part is fun and filled with irony, this part gets into easy jokes and has many less pleasant moments. Only two women (Uma and Milian) are decent in their unit. Most of the film is made with a historical character, overly exaggerated (a little - well, too much - disgusting), and the only one who can be saved is a gay bodyguard who is at least consistent, the others are too idiotic that the film is not boring, everything happens so quickly, and so many things happen that you donâ€™t have time to be bored if you want to watch a movie. It can offend your intellect (a lot!), And the film is bad (yes!), But, well, it's not boring.
