I was only a cautious enthusiast when I rented "All boys love Mandy Lane," since I immediately remembered that I had heard and read a wide variety of opinions ?? both positive and negative in the short period of time between its short cinematic release and distribution on the shelves of the video store. Perhaps it was the most inventive and fresh horror film in recent years with non-stereotypical teenage characters and unpredictable plot twists for a change. Well, the basic concept may sound quite innovative, but the script inevitably quickly returns to the same old and annoying cliches-slashers, and once passed this point, even elegant stylistic trademarks cannot save the film from terrible mediocrity. The opening sequences are really awesome and literally bathed in a sullen, melancholic atmosphere, which in fact makes it even more painful to witness the film’s immersion into the “ordinary” level of a rudimentary click slasher. After a sublime introduction that demonstrates a drunken macho who has figured out his jump from the roof to impress the title beauty, “All the Boys Love Mandy Lane” turns out to be just another textbook and boring horror movie about a bunch of stupid kids getting stoned and excited on a solitary ranch before it is killed by a not very unidentified maniac. The whole pretentious production of the film collapses faster than the collapsed house of cards: we will never get a proper explanation why Mandy herself behaves so coldly and arrogantly towards all her fans (because she grew up orphaned, maybe? Oh, boo-hoo) Do the boys soon show that they agree to have sex with any casual chatter, and not just with the “divine” Mandy and the last turn? although undoubtedly unusual ?? just pointless. The middle section is rather boring and doesn’t even offer really terrible excitement (shotgun kills? Please!) Or genuine rancid meanness. My generous rating of 4 out of 10 fully complies with the grainy and disturbing style of shooting in the 70s (with faded colors, fancy but beautiful photographic images ??) and an amazingly amazing soundtrack. Director Jonathan Levin chose the classic Bobby Winton song "Sealed with a Kiss" for the performance during the trailer and the final credits, while I was initially convinced that Barry Manilow's funny love song "Mandy" will inevitably appear in the film.
