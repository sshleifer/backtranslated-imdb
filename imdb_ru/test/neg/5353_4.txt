There are other reviews expressing similar views, but I still feel the need to add my own comments. The film is usually well made from a technical point of view, except that it may be too long. The action is mostly very good, although Kevin Spacey doesn’t have enough space to explain his character’s motivation (obviously, ambition, not racism), and the only function of Sandra Bullock seems to be to believe in an eye that, admittedly She manages very well. /> <br /> At the fundamental level, the film’s heart is in the right place because it is opposed to racism, and I get the impression that he was trying to show some definite interpretation of racism, perhaps why so many famous names agreed to be in it . Nevertheless, it seems that the authors bit off much more than they could chew on (I did not read the book, so I do not know how much of this depends on Grisham). The biggest problem, as many others have said, is that it ultimately stands for fair justice. Apart from the fact that I disagree with this position, I do not think that such a point of view actually helps the cause of combating racism - it is more likely that it will be used to justify white defendants who kill black victims. At the end, the prosecutor invites the jury (and the audience) to imagine that the raped girl was white - but watch out for this and imagine that the defendant is a white man who killed black rapists ... at the end, it looks like a message that you can kill if you hate it. It is also convenient that the murdered person was presented as completely evil, and his guilt was not in doubt, which eliminates any moral ambiguity that may be in the real business. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson does an excellent job, but unfortunately it also undermines the plot - he looks like someone with considerable honesty, but it's hard to believe that he would be willing to hide behind asking for insanity (and in fact it does not when push comes to push). Supposedly we should think that this is because he faces the death penalty, but in fact at some point he was offered premeditated murder, although if you blink, you can skip it. Why not accept it, given that he should know that his chances of justification are slim? Or, if he wants to appear in court, why rely on insanity? <br /> <br /> There are also less serious disadvantages. Medical experts, whose testimony is presumably based on this case, are jokes - both are discredited for extremely improbable reasons, and neither offers any real psychiatric diagnosis. It seems the message is that expert witnesses will say everything they are told, and they should not be believed. The fact that the wounded policeman supports Jackson is moderately plausible, but still a bit comfortable (and what if he died?) I find it hard to believe that the KKK will walk along the street in broad daylight. Other apparently serious crimes (riot, arson, kidnapping, attempted murder) are carried out without any apparent attempt to detect or bring them to justice. And the scene where the dog returns is absurd. <br /> <br /> My last reaction is to feel rather dirty - as if I was a racist, because I do not agree with this resolution. Perhaps the film intended to explore different points of view and give viewers the opportunity to make a decision, but in that case they seemed to have forgotten about this by the time they reached the end. The film made me think about my views, read what other people think here, and add my own opinion, so at some level, maybe he succeeded - but I worry that in some people, maybe he was reborn extremely illiberal views, which I hope is the opposite of what was intended. <br /> <br /> Final thought - try to see “Law and Order”, it covers such questions with more depth in 38 minutes of screen time!
