His colleagues recruited a new guard in an armored truck to steal 42 million from him. No bad guys, so no one gets hurt, right? Of course, everything goes wrong, and the new guard decides to have a conscience and rectify the situation, saving the life of the dying person. <br /> <br /> I admit that in fact I was not interested in the film, but I was not interested in “Fantastic Mr. Fox” either, and this film was among the top ten this year. Armored - even more disappointing than I thought. As a robber film, it cannot deliver the goods, it is boring and full of holes in the plot, and in logic you can hurt yourself by thinking about it. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the film somehow has a really great cast. but the film doesn't even take advantage of it. Everything seems to be wasted in wooden characters that make silly choices. Columbus Short is an uninteresting guide that is never charismatic and never makes the viewers want shit. Matt Dillon is the mastermind of the robbery, he first plays Mr. Nice, and then when things go wrong, he quickly becomes a villain. The remaining impressive actors are Lawrence Feeburn, Jean Reno, Skit Ulrich, Fred Ward, Amaury Nolasco of Prison Break and Milo Ventimiglia of Heros. None of them do much, and when they actually do something, it does not cause any special reason. <br /> <br /> The film is relatively short, but even though it lasts less than 90 minutes, it feels tight. How long can you shoot a movie about a guy trapped somewhere? The phone booth did a decent job, and it was even more limited. Racing logic in relation to the plot is tragic. 42 million, and all their safety is checked every hour or so? My entire plan was to drive trucks into an abandoned warehouse and hide money. Pretend to get hit and burn trucks. Then they left with the money. Of course, something goes wrong, otherwise there would be no film, right? Through a series of unsuccessful events, the so-called hero got into a truck with a wounded officer. The rest of the film is Dillion, and his team knocks on the door to enter. How very exciting. <br /> <br /> The script calls on our hero to have financial problems, he may lose his home, which is the turn to make him lose his brother. You see, both their parents are dead, and they are just looking after each other. So now he has reason to join the robbery. At first, he did not want to, but his problems with money are the right push to throw him into the thick of things. How convenient <br /> <br /> The whole sense of Armored in the robbery genre is that it is from an armored truck, from the guys who drive it. After this basic premise, the film falls on the face. I found that I wanted it to end earlier and earlier, every time someone spoke. Speaking of the ending, it sucks. <br /> <br /> Skip this.
