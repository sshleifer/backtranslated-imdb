This click is a waste of time. I expect that in the action movie there will be more than two explosions and a little shooting. Van Damme's game is terrible. He was never an actor, but here everything is worse. He was definitely better in his early films. His script for the entire film was probably no more than one page of stupid nonsense. The entire dialogue in the film is a disaster, just like the plot. The name "Shepherd" does not make sense. Why didn't they just call it "Border Patrol"? The fighting scenes could have been better, but either they could not afford it, or the battle choreographer suffered from a lack of ideas. This is a cheap cheap action cinema.
