Being a fan of the game and watching this movie, I physically vomited !! <br /> <br /> It was a terrible movie, although the story was similar to the plot of the game. all these are super human soldiers. Besides this, Jack Carver, a completely American man in the game, is played by the Germans, unless it is some kind of perverse irony, which is what made me poke my middle finger on the TV screen as soon as it started. The fact that you can say that it was shot in the woods in the middle of summer, which seemed to be midsummer, is inappropriate because the game takes place in a tropical forest, while the director just looked out of his window in the Morning and went "it's a good forest." <br /> <br /> THIS RECORD TO ALL DIRECTORS: If you ever plan to make a film based on a game / book, play it, understand it and ask fans that ... it's not easy to play it for an hour and assume you know it !!!
