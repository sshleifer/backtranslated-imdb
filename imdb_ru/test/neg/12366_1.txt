I hope that this is not a foreshadowing of future events. High definition camcorders are getting cheaper all the time (although I don’t swear that they were used here), so the season is now open for all Scorsez and Tarantino imitators. <br /> <br /> It’s impossible to hide the cheapness of this abomination, and calling it a “movie” would make the industry a big bear. The photo meets the standards that can be expected from a family trip to the zoo. I could build a new house for me with the whole wooden acting game. What is remarkable about this is that no one stands out as the worst. They are all equally terrible. Like a whole bunch of Ben Afflex. Or Stephen Seagals. <br /> <br /> What got me hooked was the name. I love things like Frankenhooker or Monsturd. Frankenhooker was pretty bad too, but at least I laughed a little at it, and the game was just bad, not terrible. I cannot comment on Monsturd, as I have not yet managed to obtain a copy of it. <br /> <br /> In any case, I hope that the people who did this did not make money from it. Otherwise, they can be tried again. Guys, please lay down your camcorder and return to your regular job.
