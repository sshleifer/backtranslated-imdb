"Children's game" has created a new horror genre, "KILLED DOLLS". Some of these films did not have too much money to make it, but I think the only film that creates a shadow for Chucky is this. on video or directly on television, but Buratino is not real, and the killer is a little girl. The imagination of children is too great, and this film plays with him. The roles are good, and Kendans Mackenzie is great. <br /> <br />
