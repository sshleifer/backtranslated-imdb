This review contains a spoiler --- <br /> <br /> A film about an American ninja, who has been mysteriously trained in martial arts. He falls in love with the daughter of a colonel and turns from a hateful grumble at the post in the “People’s Hero” at the end of the film. This film is very stupid and very poorly understood. This is good for people who do not care about the development of the plot or reality. Good for children under 14 years old. Military mistakes in this movie are ridiculous. I remember that during the three years I spent in the army, we, ordinary soldiers, were not required to greet or call Sir "sir", the film does this in different places. Colonel's hair is too long on the ears. Master Sergeant's mustache was against the military protocol in length. At the post the colonel was the only officer in the district. There was no other officer walking around the post. You had a ninja idiot who was throwing troops against soldiers from M-16, rather poorly done. <br /> <br /> The people who filmed it smelled. Michael Dudikoff is not so bad for an actor, he just has lousy scripts. Ninjas were more fun than dangerous. Avoid this movie
