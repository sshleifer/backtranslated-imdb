I can not believe that I even tried to watch this dirt. Being an avid fan of B-Horror films, I was more than fascinated by the prospect of this film by the popular horror film director Gershel Gordon Lewis. Unfortunately, from the very beginning of the film I could not, in my opinion, think about a worse film than this one. Well, maybe Gigli, but I firmly believe Dr. Gore (The Body Shop) is worse when I think about it. A horrible story that moves incredibly slowly, the film stretches without much horror. However, I recognize the sheer joy of a couple of scenes when Dr. Gore hypnotizes his future victims. The camera focuses on its overly large, bulging eyes, while fun is constantly added to this funny soundtrack. I laughed most of the 10 minutes. After he has established his “miracle woman”, the film is spent for almost 20 minutes, just showing him and his “girlfriend” when he teaches her to speak, then they talk, play around among nails, arrange picnics, etc. Unfortunately, there is only music playing during all this fandango without speech at all. In this part of the film, you will want to cut the wrists with the dim edge of the butter knife. I almost want to vomit at the very thought of this film. If you like bad movies, watch this one.
