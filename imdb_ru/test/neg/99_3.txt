As for this film, I was intrigued by four things: first, the star Carly Pope (of Popular Popularity) starred in it, which is always a pleasure to watch. Suddenly a brilliant New Zealand actress Rena Owen participates in it. Thirdly, it was filmed with the New Zealand Film Commission. Fourth, a friend recommended it to me. However, I was completely disappointed. The whole storyline is absurd and complex, with very little resolution. Dad plays well, but Owen, unfortunately, is underutilized. With other actors and actresses, everything is in order, but I am not familiar with all of them. In addition to the good puzzles that accumulate throughout the film (as well as the father and Owen), this film is not very good. So the moral of this story ... don't watch it if you really don't want it.
