I was one of the many fools who had to pay for it in the theater, although I paid $ 4 for the morning (until 18:00) prices. <br /> <br /> The remake story was ho-ham, the CGI Morlocks were lame, the Eloi were Rastafarians to imitate today's hobbies (no, I didn't think the chick was hot at all) In general, just a sad, bad remake. <br /> <br /> I'll take Rod Taylor, Wynu and the fat glowing eye surfer Morlock over this junk at any time. My assessment is that many of the reviewers who like this terrible remake are young children, which does not take into account either the good taste or the true value of the old classics, which is largely not appreciated by today's confused and ever-desiring more young people. <br /> <br /> When the 60s version came out (I first saw it in the 70s for summer fun), it was damn impressive and still has its power. You do not need to have an excess of CGI in the film to make it better. Too much of it looks fake. I canâ€™t say enough about how the Morlocks looked sad, they ran and jumped like in a children's video game. 3 stars out of 10
