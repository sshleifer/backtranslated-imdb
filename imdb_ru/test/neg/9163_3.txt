When I finally got to see this film recently, it turned out to be exactly what it was at first glance ... another Hollywood CG / reanimation of the live action of a well-established cartoon franchise. Nothing fancy or memorable. Designed in every possible way to appeal to very small children and very immature adults, intensively using comedy techniques such as farting, eating poop and the size of Theodore's ass. <br /> <br /> This film bothers me a lot less if it weren’t such an obvious step down for the chipmunks. Even their characters, which I found, have changed for the worse for this film. While in the past each of them had a special personality, they all behaved like immature smart children with ADD, constantly randomly bouncing off the walls. I was particularly worried that Simon was portrayed in this way ... He must be a smart, serious nerd who acts as a "straight man" for Alvin’s crazy antics. But here he is largely an exact copy of Alvin. One joke in the film even implies that Simon only * thinks * that he is smart, but in fact it is not ... and honestly, if I had never heard of Chipmunks before watching this film, I would have agreed. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this film is just another obvious money grab, and I am more than a little sorry that it was made. The fact that this is a “children's” film does not justify its shortcomings ... Sorry for the stupid film that humiliates the classic franchise just because it offends children, and every child deserves something smarter than this film.
