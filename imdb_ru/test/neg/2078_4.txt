Before you begin, whether this film is worth your time or not, I have to inform you that I have never seen Carmen’s other adaptation, so if you are looking for an overview of how he ranks among others, this may not be very helpful. . <br /> <br /> The only time I came across Carmen was on a car stereo when I traveled to Spain for a family holiday when I was a teenager. I didn’t pay much attention to this, because at that time I didn’t like opera, and I didn’t know anything better. History has been around for about 150 years or so. Do I feel that I missed after watching this movie? Yes, mainly because of the plot, but also because if all the actresses who played Carmen looked like Paz Vega, I would gladly transfer all the adaptations to my DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Directed by Vicente Aranda (who also rewrote the story of Joaquim Hord), the story is told through the eyes of the original author, Prosper Merimee, a French writer wading through 19th-century Spain. He encounters José (Leonardo Sbaraglia), a criminal soldier and one of many men who fall in love with Carmen (Paz Vega), a sultry, sexy, dazzlingly gypsy woman who has the mouth of the devil, has the temperament “toro 'and who foolishly leads people to the moment she meets José, she is attracted to his restrained behavior, but she hooks him, pulls him up and lets him go many times. Until one day, José is looking for murder. Carmen persuades him to join her group of Gypsy smugglers. they calm down Fell in love with him, but meets charming Escamillo, the bullfighter. Can José hold back his jealousy or will it destroy him? <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful, seductive story, reminiscent of Ovid’s almost Shakespearean plot or emotions that can create or break us and turn us into actions that do not correspond to the character. This is poetic, incendiary and, most importantly, dissolute. I was left alone, I did not know which way he would turn. I always hoped that Jose could change Carmen’s dirty little ways. I will not tell you whether he has succeeded. <br /> <br /> The above synopsis is what I took from the film, but the film itself did not impress me. Only after I looked at it did I delve into the story and realize how much I missed Aranda’s opportunity to retell the classics of Merimee. It was a petty slutty drama of the period in which Paz Vega spent most of his time partially or completely naked (not that I particularly complain about that!). <br /> <br /> First of all, the acting was poor. I was not impressed with Sbaraglia as José. I'm still not sure if he was a weak actor or if Jose was supposed to be a weak character, I did not read the book. He must be a man with a passionate desire for Carmen, but most of the time he spends in confusion, jealousy and a little vaguely. Paz Vega was a little better than Carmen. I was convinced by her cruel, evil temper, although I saw her more convincing in other films, such as Zapping and Lucia y El Sexo. She seems too beautiful to play a gypsy (not that I met many Andalusian gypsies), so, in a sense, this role did not suit her. The other actors in the film were not good either. They seemed to do everything hesitantly. Is the story passionate, emotional ?? they looked half closed, as if they could not wait to get hold of the tight 19th century costumes they were in. <br /> <br /> However, the costumes that I was impressed with are one of the factors of redemption. film. I like Spanish culture, I liked the soldier's uniform, top hats, and women's flamenco dresses. They matched the time well. That's all I can say about it. Sorry, back to the criticism. <br /> <br /> The script, as mentioned above, was rewritten by Vicente Aranda and Joaquim Jorda and made so bad that Merimet turned into a grave. It was boring. It did not fully exploit Jose's intense passion for Carmen (or maybe it was just a game). Among the millions of obscene words, raw lines, satanic and devilish connotations piled up everywhere. I know that the Spaniards are not indifferent to the strange obscene word, but the film was literally littered with a put, “whore,” literally in every line. It may have been realistic in the poor 19th-century Seville, but history itself did not need it. <br /> <br /> Installation and work with the camera were boring and ordinary. There was only one bit that I really liked, and that was when the camera was watching a close-up of a fly in the air that falls on Carmen’s face. It was good. But other? Boring <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it’s sad to see how such a wonderful story gets lost due to unconvincing actions and direction. If you are a literature teacher, by all means let your class see this adaptation to get an idea of ​​the story. However, only the male half of the class will pay any interest in the film, thanks to Paz Vega. Otherwise, stick to the opera version (although I hate musicals). I give this movie 4, just for the fact that I love the storyline! And Paz Vega!
