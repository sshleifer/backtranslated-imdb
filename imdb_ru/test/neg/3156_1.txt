â€œI hate you, you hate me, Barney stole your SUV with a huge pile and a blow from me to you, won't you say that you hate me too? "Batman rings the bell, smells like a grandmother, shot a gun at Barney and made him urinate, and now Barney is not a moron" So I say that Barney is backward from the underworld? And the children in this show are like 12 years old. If I were them, I would not believe this stupid idiot named Barney. Now, producers, why do you believe this shit that Barney says? They are always happy. This is stupid. They must sometimes be sad. I'm right? The bottom line is that Barney is so stupid who is watching this ugly creature.
