Jack Frost 2. Worst "horror movie" I've ever seen. What for? 1) The premise is GOOD outside of funny 2) This damn thing doesn't even have legs to move on! 3) He avoids AFTER a full immersion in Antifreeze (first film). 4) Get it ... It passes through the ocean of SALT WATER on a TROPICAL island to get revenge on the sheriff who made it in the first film. 5) "Killing snowballs." I was not drunk yet to see Dead Man Ginger, so at the time of writing this Jack Frost 2 it was noted that he is the most stupid horror film ever. Even surpassing the meaninglessness of its predecessor (if you can believe it!).
