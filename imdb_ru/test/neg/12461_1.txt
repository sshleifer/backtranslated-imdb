For the first time when watching movies, I immediately became interested in this story. I do not know whether this was the way it was filmed, or the story behind the characters, but it was mild, excessive, and completely unoriginal. For the first thirty minutes, I felt pretty lethargic to all the characters and the story. I felt as if I had seen this structure before, and Tart did not provide anything new to surprise me. Thinking that it could only be my mood, I stopped the film and decided to start it in the morning, but this feeling persisted. I just didn't care. This is not a good sign. The characters were soft. When I speak softly, I literally mean that when you watch them develop, you will never feel that any taste will amaze you. The story seemed recycled, almost to the point of plagiarism. I'm not saying that Christina Wayne stole this story, but she did not add anything new to the perspective. The cast was terrible, the main symbols and themes were so lost that no critic could find them (no characters), and the stories were vague and sloppy. You didn’t know anything about anyone or anything, and instead of paying more attention to the characters, we instead ended up with drugs, little sex and money driven into our faces. These are the themes that we saw in each film from the very beginning of the cinematic period, but somehow could not be creatively captured by Wayne. <br /> <br /> What immediately distracted me from this story? They were mostly characters. I have seen most of the work of Brad Renfro, and, frankly, he needs to reconsider himself. Directed by Larry Clark identified it, and, oddly enough, he can not get out of this stereotypical nature. For the first twenty minutes of the Renfro screen, I was bored. I knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why. It was impressive, not impressive, just repetitive. He needed to bring some kind of excitement or anxiety to his role, instead of just playing this random social person. Without a strong character, the final climax of this film comes instead as a disappointment. Renfro did not demonstrate all his abilities in this film. While I'm on this topic ?? no one showed the best of their abilities. What happens to Dominic Swain outside Lolita, I do not believe that she really became an actress, and the continuation of such roles as the Cat Storm does not help. Bijou Phillips was the only actress who I witnessed and in fact tried to bring something remarkable to the screen, unfortunately, because of the terrible play of all the others, she was lost. Rembling here and there and, frankly, almost forgotten during the second act. Melanie Griffith was a meaningless actor, and much of the budget of this film was probably spent on her TWO scenes in which she was. Maybe the rest went to a random guy from Children in the Hall who desperately needed to move away from that. Project. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem, in addition to acting, was the time of the release of this film. Nothing, and it's hard for me to say, but nothing is mixed up. During the entire film, there were so many subtests that no real material was formed. Looting, teenage “longing and grief”, rich social benefits, finding out how terrible the real life is, the random guy “Children in the Hall”, and even the ending just felt hastily and badly edited together. With this cheesy craftsmanship, the whole story has never been formed. Family structures have never been defined, the characters have never been given any emotions, and all that we have left are pieces of honest remnants. Wayne did not complete the task. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I can not bear the burden on the director, with this film I have little choice. With a terrible title that just screamed completely the opposite of what this film is about, with an amateur ability to director, the cast could pretty much convey every emotion in every scene, leaving us with disgusting acting and bad events, and with a vague story telling It is difficult to find any "good" for the cake. It was a film about which I had not heard anything, and after watching it, I understand why. All that Wayne has done with this film is random excerpts from other films that have better coped with the definition of all of the above elements and put everything together to make the film Pie. It's hard for me to say this, but Wayne ruined this movie. Although I do not believe that much could be learned in this story, all the remaining elements of arousal were exhausted when Wayne took the helm. Although most of the time you can do justice to some stories, perhaps strong acting or even music, you can't believe anything in Tart. From the opening sequence to the end, I felt that I was swimming through a very lumpy porridge. No consistency, no strength. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is a waste of your time. If you are looking for some deep symbolic elements or perhaps some jokes in our society, you will not find it in this film. Although I know that this was what Wayne was trying to show, the final product looks like it was edited on Etch-a-Sketch. It was an awkward film to sit out and encourage anyone not to take it. Wayne threw all the teachings of his education at Columbia University and destroyed two hours of my life. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Rating: * of *****
