Someone has to teach the people who made this film that there is a difference between the “presentation of several turns” and the “turn of the audience”. They even use hypnosis as a tool to hide holes in the plot; whenever they cannot find a way out of or out of the scene, they simply say "she regresses to her past now" or "she goes out of it now," and they think this explains everything. This film is dishonest deception and in the last 20 minutes turns into a full-blown fiasco. (* 1/2)
