Calling a movie boring is not something that I usually think is valid criticism. However, when the film is made from spare parts from other films that were not so good from the very beginning, and it is as slow as molasses, without real feedback, I think it would be fair to call things by their proper names. And Ghost is a very boring movie. <br /> <br /> “Ghost” tells about the film, which tells about a young girl with amnesia who is haunted by a ghost who keeps the secret of her past. Only this is much more complicated and less interesting than you might think. <br /> <br /> The storyline is almost incomprehensible for most of the image, and the hook, an element of amnesia, only aggravates the situation. It seems that no one, including the screenwriter and the director, has a clue what the hell is happening at the moment. Instead, they decided to do something that is roughly equivalent to the cinematic equivalent of a comedy show. There are scenes taken directly from the Ringu, Dark Water, Shutter, The Grudge series, and a small portion of Pulse for a good rating. Worse, half a dozen women wear all the outfits and read their lines equally, making it impossible to separate them. <br /> <br /> With this film there is simply nothing to cling to. The story is not so well thought out. Amnesia trick is lazy. The mystery element is not involved and is managed with a little grace. The characters never deduce anything, all the information is simply handed out through the occasion, recalling their past when it is convenient for the plot. <br /> <br /> Cinematography, full of reflections and water shots, at least tries to add to the subtext, a thematic connection with amnesia and the last turn (which I will not disclose) is good, but often overloaded. Even the score seems borrowed and cliché. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, incitement to a curse is not very interesting, and the final turn is predictable and unconvincing. “Wait, do you mean that one character who has 15 minutes of screen time, but seems to have nothing to do with the plot, returns at the end? No! ”The audience is too smart for this kind of pranks. Anyone who has seen any films that he breaks will find very little to prevent them from falling asleep with this feature. I used to think that Shimizu was the bottom of a barrel for this kind of shit (he reworked his film of offense no less than 5 times), but even his second-rate work, such as Reincarnation, a film that I couldn’t even finish miles ahead. <br /> <br /> For more information, visit www.collider.com
