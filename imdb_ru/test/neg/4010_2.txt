This meaningless film was a complete disappointment. None of the characters are cute in the least, so you watch what happens to each of them without worrying about it. What was worse was the rental of this film in a gay club, where it turned out that this story about a male hooligan was filled with homophobic young people engaged in many scenes of direct sex, and not one gay sex scene.
