I wrote this as a two-part review. In the second part there are spoilers. <br /> <br /> Part 1: <br /> <br /> No, this is not about car accident sex. This is the one about racism in Los Angeles. You know, one where everyone is racist, and race is a topic that is always on everyone’s mind. Race. <br /> <br /> Like in the film, it takes the form of turret syndrome, where the race is a recurring theme. Race. Racist. Racism. Race Relations Relay race. <br /> <br /> Paul Haggis made a film that used the structure of the Magnolia, which was used to demonstrate the separation of people who had a tangential connection, and then brought him into mental vomiting 1'53 inches. Racism in america Race. During the 24-hour period, we have 7 parallel stories related to each other and about race. In the first hour, people say ridiculous things and do absurd things, trying to be truthful about racism in America. <br /> <br /> For example, the story of Ludicrous and Larenz Tate provides comic relief. Sorry, the first half of their story is taken directly from Bonnie's Situation in Fiction. Racism". Their section is Quentin Tarantino’s section, where: instead of being cool and talking about foot massage and religion, the characters talk about race and racism. CONSTANTLY. <br /> <br /> Another good thing about this is Mexican history, when a Mexican guy talks to his daughter. He gives her his invisible impenetrable cloak to protect her from a bullet. A worthy letter, but this is only because the writers had daughters, and they know that they will say in his place. <br /> <br /> The rest of the stories are extremely funny. Hindi does not act in any semblance of realism. The scene where he is trying to fix the lock, and the Mexican tells him that he needs a new door, is shortened and stupid. Why would anyone do that? This is real? NOOO. It reminds me more of a seller from The Doom Generation. "Six dollars, sixty-six cents girly." If I ever watch the second half of the film, I hope that his head is torn off, and his disembodied head begins to cough with joy. <br /> <br /> I did not mention the race in the paragraph. RACE. RACISM. Race for the sun. It is better. Then there is a black guy who wants to be white, Matt Dillon, who has a black chip on his shoulder, Ryan Phillip, who looks beautiful and does nothing, and other bad actors who behave badly with a bad dialogue. When Matt Dillon pushes black producers' wife, can I help if I have problems? When Phillip guesses for the second time what he writes about his partner in racism, can I help but fail? The film is so funny when it's racist. Racist. RACIST I tell you. <br /> <br /> Now, notice, this film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Editing, except for a hint of Matt Dillon, who really tried to do a decent job. Who paid for it, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> I don’t see this if you don’t want to preach about racism in society according to a bad and unrealistic scenario from two white men over fifty who don’t have a semblance of reality or interaction with real society in one form or another. <br /> <br /> D- <br /> <br /> Part 2: <br /> <br /> The second half of Crash takes all the plot lines in the first half ... and spews them back into a kind of redemptive The final, peace is a big coincidence. And this is actually one of the worst ways to do it. <br /> <br /> Take the 1999 Magnolia. People were not conveniently connected again and again. They were simply connected in a strange way, which happens more often than you think. You know someone who knows someone who has done something in which you knew that someone else was involved. The collapse takes this conclusion to a serious extreme. <br /> <br /> Stories are lined up so everyone meets again. Is there only 5 on LAPD strength? Don't these people work in strange shifts? Dillon and Philip were a late shift than an early shift the next day? And why was Tate murdered by a hitchhiker? Wouldn't he have more emotional tension and realism if it was someone whom we had not watched all day? As Philip just picks up a random hitchhiker, and then goes crazy. Everyone will go crazy. <br /> <br /> In the end, in the second half, the touching scene of an invisible cloak is used to make Hindi shoot a daughter. It annoyed me and made me feel dirty. It’s not that Hindi shot the daughter, but that they created a beautiful touching scene, and then this was the direct reason why people burst. It really annoyed me. The writers, not the scene. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is fake and completely inappropriate. There are too many coincidences, and they require an extreme suspension of disbelief. Unlike Magnolia, which was connected softly, she had connections in touch, which were simply excessive. The only good role in the second half was when Sandra Bullock falls down the stairs. She doesn't die, though. She must have. I was delighted when she fell. <br /> <br /> The worst thing in the film is the magnolia. Not only in terms of structure, but also installation over song In the Deep, where you see that everything is depressed. Magnolia picked it up and got a postmodern commentary on him when all the characters sang along with Sage Aimee Mann. Unfortunately, Magnolia was released in 1999, and Crash was released in 2005. It is difficult to comment on the film, which will not be shot another 6 years, but it happened. Somehow. <br /> <br /> Loss of my time. <br /> <br /> First half: D-; The second half: the lowest estimate ever; Total: F ---
