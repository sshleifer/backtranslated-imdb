I was captured by the premise that the show was about demons. From hell. And the door to hell. What I did not realize was that I would watch the guys run through the tunnels, pursued by small children who could / could not be demons during the entire movie. Of course, there was some kind of dialogue between them, and great underground landscapes, but there was not enough plot, developed characters, any turns or plot development. Yes, and out of interest there were no special effects. The entire budget was spent on the salaries of the actors, sets, and a lot of time running with the camera underground. <br /> <br /> The ending was one of the typical dull boring endings that make you say, “I survived this boredom film for this !?” If you want to see demons and the door to hell, I promise you that you will It is better to watch the trailers for the game Hellgate: London, which is shorter than this movie for 5 minutes, contains more dialogues, character development, actions, plot and satisfactory conclusions. <br /> <br /> overall low score for failing to make a film that stands out, and for the promise in the slogan is much more than was done.
