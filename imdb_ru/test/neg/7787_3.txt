This film is a great example of how to take an exciting subject, come up with 25 minutes of basic material and stretch it into a six-hour boring festival, reminiscent of the form a documentary film can take if Fox News decides to make it. Even the participants of this disgustingly obscene film cannot hide their laughter over the stupidity of their attempts to show one of the few great times in world history when people take a position and work to create a better world. If only the creators spoke to Ken Burns for 5 minutes, they could offer something softly clever instead of a cure for insomnia.
