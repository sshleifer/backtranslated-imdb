The film contains a very short scene Deneuve in the bathroom. She looks absolutely amazing for a lady of 56 years, but this is the only saving grace of the film. Otherwise, it has a meaningless, unmotivated script, and the main actress has no appeal Deneuve. The director apparently watched too many Peter Greenaway films, and Paul X looks like an imitation of a student of Greenway style without any inspiration from him.
