“The Land of Madness” is a story about a woman from the 1800s who a dirty Scot chose for herself who could not keep his penis in his pants. He just has a younger brother who is against violence and kills him, but he constantly says that it was an accident. It makes his wife go crazy, she is delirious, and she fails because she loves George too much. <br /> <br /> As I said, such things have been done before. It's just more “artistic” because it's a Canadian film, and it's an indie production made on low-budget channels with barely known actors (except that one guy from Lassi, yes, he's in it). I don't know if this was Oscar's bait, but it was damn boring. And it is based on a 40-page story. Half of this short story is included in this film, and I'm glad. Otherwise, I would die to death. Unfortunately, I had to watch it in my Media Fundamentals class, and I had a task for it. Read the short story and compare and match the film with the story. Boring <br /> <br /> You know, it’s harder to answer questions about a movie when you don’t like a movie. Ah, well, I hope that this is the last task that I and my class received. Whatever the cost, Annie Herron was absolutely hot, she had a beautiful, soft ass, and I liked her naked parts in the film. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for the boring game of Oscar Bait and graphic sexuality .. plus nudity
