.... so why on earth do I see The Sexual Lives of Potato Men? Answer: Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook. Vegas I saw live and thoroughly enjoyed. I think he is a clever and unique intellectual comic that manages to preserve utter nonsense. Crook, I only know from probably the biggest comedy in the last 10 years with Alan Partridge, The Office. Like Gareth, he was just jolly, and I wondered how he would turn into another character on the big screen. <br /> <br /> OK. So the guy and I went to the multiplex last night, and the film was very funny, just because the mediocre meaningless dialogue and banter of Ferris and Dave were delivered with aplomb and enthusiastic talent of Vegas and Crook. They are designed for the best things (they have actually done better already), and I even believe that Vegas will become a worthy actor right. The banal scenes where he says that he misses his wife were almost close to touch, although ** SPOILER **, attached to the scene at the end where his wife took him, needed to be lengthened, it just wasn't believable. And throughout the film, Vegas seems to miss his wife 2 or 3 times. <br /> <br /> The film became grotesquely unfunny and old, well, generally grotesque when sex was mentioned. No, I add when it was shown on the screen. Tolly’s impartial explanation of what was in his sandwiches and why it wasn’t even a little ridiculous, and just made me feel a little sick. Also, there was absolutely no need for Jeremy's character to pick his nose before showing the big prize-winner on his finger. If he was picking his nose, it would cause a smile, he was a pathetic character, and that would make him look as low as possible, but it wasn’t necessary to show snot at close-ups and it was decorous. <br /> <br /> One scene that I really think is fun with sex is Vegas in the top three. His tenacious conversation with the second guy only underlined the fact that the triples are not always endless ecstasy. Not that I know ..... <br /> <br /> This is all I can really say. I'll finish with this, and this is actually my main criticism of the film. This should revive the British film industry. This is not “Trainspotting”, this is for sure ... this is not even “Love in fact” (you would have to have a heart of stone not to tear it), and 3 million pounds could really be put into the best project. "Mike Basset England Manager" was a wonderful little-known British comedy, and it was shot for less than 3 million. I only hope that BFC will learn from the “Sexual Life of Potato Men” and will not receive such gratuitousness in the future. Although the terrible reviews that receive this film, only increase the box office. :-)
