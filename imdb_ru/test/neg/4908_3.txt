[The warning contains spoilers] <br /> <br /> I didn’t feel sympathy for any of the characters, including the main character, who very quickly experienced the death of his girlfriend (but that's okay when he reconciles with the former prostitute from the casino, in which he works). The main character is portrayed as this wonderful intelligent writer who is drawn into the web of deception, while his monologue of the book he is writing is working there. I cannot say that I would buy a book, perhaps a much better premise would be if a voice-over (which annoyingly interrupts the story of any part of the film that you might not have understood through his book) would have been 52 different characters ... to represent each card in the deck, but I was distracted. As a result, there was a turn, as a result of which the protagonist was tuned by someone close to him, but since by that moment I didn’t like his character so much (I discovered that I don’t like anyone in this film, all the characters are one-dimensional zombies) I really didn’t care, and I was glad that the film was over. <br /> <br /> Pros: English ER actress makes an elegant South African accent Minus points: annoying movie
