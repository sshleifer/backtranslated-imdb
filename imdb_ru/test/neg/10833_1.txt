Even the terrible figure for this film is all that made you cringe from start to finish. I don’t think it would be possible to squeeze more overly mediocre moments into one piece of mind, a staggeringly overwhelming waste of film. <br /> <br /> In the prison block H there are Thunderbirds, hell, even Virgil's expressions were more like life than his son. <br /> <br /> I haven’t even finished watching this, and I am here now ... Oh, no, light-minded applause from the 3 actors and the background made by the child with the Adobe premiere, This is really the end of my “I started, therefore stop watching her. " <br /> <br /> Oh, joy, the loans have come to save me. (And relax)
