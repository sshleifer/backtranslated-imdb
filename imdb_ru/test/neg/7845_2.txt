This movie was terrible. John Wayne is sometimes a cruel actor. The main woman, playing the role of "Maura", worked well and tried her best to make the scenes believable, despite the inept, one-dimensional, role of Wayne in the acting game. Seriously, did you see him when he had to talk in a dream? Funny. And his character became such a terrible person in the second half of the film, and then did nothing to atone for his behavior, and still says goodbye to everyone, including his sworn enemy, without even apologizing. The story was completely implausible. We had to believe that two adults, both of whom had achieved great success in their respected areas, would sabotage work and risk innocent lives simply because they did not love each other? You can pretty much randomly select any scene, and this will probably make you shake your head in disbelief that someone has paid money for this film. This is very bad, because the only other Wayne films I've seen are Shooter and Rio Bravo, which were both great movies. If you are not paid, do not worry to watch it.
