I accidentally saw this film during a flight from Paris to Boston, and he reminded me of the food on the plane: unique, tasteless and obscure. French cinema seems to have lost its popularity these days, and this is a good example of how a colorful script can spend brilliant actors. While some may find that the script’s “playfulness” meets the requirements of Euro postmodernism, the entire project is more like the death death of golden years and the truly incredible talents of Euro-Cinema vaguely reminiscent of Bunuel here, but without charm and wit.
