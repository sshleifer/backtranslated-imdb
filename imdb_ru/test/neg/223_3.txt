Almost every truly great crime thriller is based on a carefully thought-out, methodically planned, high-stakes super-crime, which in 9 cases out of 10 is done by a bunch of good-looking, indecent moral people for whom life is not fair, for whom returning to a person is good What is it worth cheering for? The first script of the script of the script of James V. Simpson for Armored makes this half correct. He made double the conviction that we have nothing but sympathy for the recently orphaned Iraqi war veteran Ti Hackettu (Short Columbus in the yard), who is going to take his house An evil bank (brother, me) was there) And he gave Ti a good friend in the family of Mike (Matt Dillon), who was very nice and got his job in an armored car company where he works with Baines (Lawrence Fishbourne) and how something strange french they man (Jean Reno). These guys like to have fun and joke, but they are also serious guys from armored cars, so this means that they have guns and they are strong. <br /> <br /> After a while, when one theoretically observes the Armored, one can start to think the same way as I do, which maybe - just maybe - it will be some kind of amazing, mocking film about robbery with cornball, with some characteristic characteristics that drive the story in its natural course, raising the personal bets of all participants, hoping to make public a really, really smart plan with a lot of potential moments of “holy crap”. I mean, one music is a robbery film from a textbook — rough, sharp rhythms, working overtime, when we are seen by big characters who say things like “Actually, I'm doing” and “Are you crazy? “For about 45 minutes, the film had some serious genre potential. <br /> <br /> Then it all really stinked. These guys, these idiots have no plan. There’s no scene.“ Okay, here’s what we are going to make ... ", no drawings, explosives, black van or ski masks (despite their" test run ", as seen from the trailer). No, these guys are going to steal $ 42 million from their own trucks (which are tracked only through HOUR contact on the radio, despite the fact that they are equipped with some unusual they’re not even going to sit down and discuss it. Damn, Mike only tells T. about the plan last night, which is completely ridiculous. But, of course, Ty should think about his house while Mike promises that "No one gets hurt, he's on board. Guess what, though. Someone will get hurt. Why? Because, besides driving trucks to an abandoned factory to hide money, they don't have a plan. That was it. That was how far they thought of things. Therefore, naturally, everything starts to break up. These cats deserve everything they get for being so unprepared. <br /> <br /> This scenario, frankly, feels like a product of some bad improvisation game: “Armored car robbed by its own security ... GO! "Despite some decent build-up that could have developed the film in several interesting ways, the story just falls apart completely, and pretty soon EVERYTHING doesn't make sense, or even remotely believable. <br /> <br /> When they have no cool directors" hooks "for their robbery, their characters seem stupid and inept. And when the characters are stupid and inept, it is difficult for the audience to invest money and their history in them. And when this happens, any obscurity depletes the bottom of the film, leaving a ridiculous empty husk. <br / > <br /> Skip this. 3/10
