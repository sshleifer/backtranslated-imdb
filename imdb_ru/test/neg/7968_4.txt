Lina McLaddle is a bright, lonely young woman who unexpectedly falls in love with Johnny Aisgart, a highly skilled bachelor with a penchant for losing money. They get married, but almost immediately Lina is prone to Johnny lying, gambling and going into debt. Despite his flaws, she cannot resist his charming manner until she begins to suspect that he may be putting murderous thoughts on her ... <br /> <br /> This is a good film, well done, with an attractive acting composition, a good script and, perhaps, the most disgusting finale in the history of cinema. Well, it may be too far, but not much. Many films change the ending of the book (“Great Expectations”, “The Shining”, etc.), But the last two scenes of this not only terribly lame, but also make the whole previous plot completely senseless. The story of a woman whose husband moves his greed and moral flaws - and what she knows about him - to kill her. It must end (as it does in the book of Francis Iles / Anthony Berkeley “Before the Fact”) when he tries to kill her. The reason for this is that the studio made Hitch re-shoot the final, one of the first examples of the terrible process of previewing the audience. Hitch was cunning and did what he was told (it was only his third film in Hollywood), knowing that if he played the game, sooner or later he would gain creative control over his films, as evidenced by his masterpieces of the fifties. But that still leaves us with a turkey finish. This is a big shame, because this is a really very good movie with an intriguing theme - does anyone know their husband or wife well? The script is excellent, with many unexpected moments (for example, when Lina's father dies, and Johnny assumes that she is crying about this), a well-priced performance of Grant (who never played the villain again) and a beautiful photo everywhere, ending with the famous glass of milk. Fontein won an Oscar for this performance, although I personally prefer her confusion and vulnerability in her previously injured wife role in Rebecca. I would like to rate this movie above, but I really can't forgive this ending; this is what happens when films are made for money, not for love, which, I think, is a curious theme of the film itself. Look quickly at Hitchcock's cameo as the person sending the letter.
