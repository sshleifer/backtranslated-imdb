I decided to watch this movie because I had not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie. I'm sorry that it should be, because, frankly, is it a dog? and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both of whom were great actors. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is simple: he is trying to invest too quickly, too quickly in the story of a young lawyer (John Manson, played by Stewart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) for an hour after meeting her. What is this cliché? Get married in a hurry, repent at your leisure ... <br /> <br /> In short, the story is a series of episodes that show the deteriorating financial situation of couples, their problems with John’s living mother, their struggle to pay the bill, reduced status John in the office, the arrival of their young son John Jr. (unexpected and causing additional friction at home with his mother), couples longing for their marriage, a child’s illness that worsens, which requires a heroic escape by a lone pilot (in a violent storm) to bring a special serum , to save the child, and finally, John was accepted as a junior partner in a law firm. <br /> <br /> How many more clichéd situations could writers include? Maybe mom will die soon? There was not a lot of comedy; the drama was dull at best; the dialogue was painful to hear. Only the game of the four main players was adequate. <br /> <br /> It was a period at the end of the Great Depression, when the US experienced a long recession ?? during which many people experienced all the events described in the film. <br /> <br /> So it made sense for Selznick to confirm that the good old generation promoted American values ​​of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance and initiative? ? all against the backdrop of the "average" American family. Who is better to use than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard? <br /> <br /> And, it should be noted that the film was released in early 1939; So it was planned in 1938 ?? shortly after the United States began manufacturing for World War II. Consequently, this kind of film was a great incentive for the general public, while many of whom soon had to join the war in England. As many here know, Hollywood and Washington made a difficult alliance before, during and after the war. <br /> <br /> However, I am glad that I saw it ?? as part of disguised social and political propaganda. But I will need to watch other Lombard films in order to better appreciate her acting range. <br /> <br /> As another reviewer noted: look at this one, just to say that you have seen all the films of Stuart; otherwise do not worry.
