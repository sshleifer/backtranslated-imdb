Being a big fan of Brian Yuzna and most of the films in which he participated, I assumed that I would get pleasure from Progeny. I did not, although in a sense it has its moments. However, if you are expecting something the same as society or Beyond ReAnimator, you may be shocked. In a sense, this is similar to Society, this is a story about a seemingly ordinary world with a terrible supernatural belly ... but that’s what it ends with. <br /> <br /> I don’t cover Yuzna when I say that the error is not really in it, because a bad direction is a bad direction, but a direction is a sound. What confuses the film is the script and the acting. Stuart Gordon (ReAnimator, Dagon) wrote a smart script, but the one that doesn’t really work with Yuzna’s leadership style makes him dwell on actors who provide a long dialogue when he really wants to drop this camera and do away with his bad self. This question makes the film rather awkward as it is, but it is even worse. <br /> <br /> If the film were shot with great actors, the film probably would have survived it. Unfortunately, this is very far from the case. The game is wooden, shocking, even for a low-budget function B. The inexplicably successful and famous Arnold Voslo destroys every damn line with almost exact accuracy, conveying one of the worst performances I have seen in a long time. This man manages to turn every line of a well-thought-out dialogue into that type of branch that you drunk to your partners the next time you're in a pub. “Hey, Bob! Oh my god, I'm losing my mind! WHAT IS IT ... COME TO ME! NOOOO! In fact, I can try it myself next weekend. The last addition of veterans of the genre (and personal favorite) Brad Dourif instead of enriching the film, as it should be, almost seems to give Duriff a film in the last attempt to stop Vosloo from Hamming, but to be honest, Dourif looks deeply uncomfortable perhaps waiting for the next assault on a bad acting game) next to Vozlu, and even an eccentric twist from it will not be able to animate the film. <br /> <br /> If the game were better, this film would be fine. Hell, it might have been pretty nice, but the lack of character makes the film a soulless affair and makes the element of horror seem tied and tasteless instead of the organic part of the film. It seemed to me that the scene with torture / rape by aliens is already a bit difficult to understand, but the fact that the characters lacked so much made them seem not only pleasant, but unpleasant, leaving an unpleasant taste in the mouth. <br /> <br /> if you really like fantasy and you have no problem with a bad acting game, walking with pedestrians and a really bright, dirty scene of rape, Progeny will probably be your cup of tea. But since I do, I probably will never watch it again. Once was enough. On the other hand, this is the only science fiction film that Yuzna has ever tried to make, so he obviously was not pleased with it himself.
