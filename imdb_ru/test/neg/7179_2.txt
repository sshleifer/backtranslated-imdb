This is without doubt the worst film in the Hamilton saga and the worst actor who played Carl Hamilton. Peter Stormare simply cannot cope with this, with his psychotic appearance and without any style. "Fargo" or "8 mm", but in this type of roles it is simply useless. <br /> <br /> Lena Olin’s presence did not use this film. She couldn’t save him from what he is: an Americanized copy of big budget fighters such as Golden Eye, Die Hard 3, Broken Arrow, etc. It is clear that some Norwegian upstarts from director McTiernan did it. br /> <br /> The presence of Mark Hamill is just ridiculous. 2 out of 10
