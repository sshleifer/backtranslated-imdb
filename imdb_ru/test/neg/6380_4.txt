This show showed its true colors now that the Democrats are in power. He never led the world in IQ, as anyone who thought he had intelligence is programmed to think about one thing (which is scary). <br /> <br /> Comedy Central shifted it, and he returned to an earlier Democrats once came to power for some reason - because now that the Democrats screwed up - what happens as often as the Republicans do - Stuart no longer strikes them. That is why the ratings of this and the back are falling. <br /> <br /> In fact, most of the humor is currently either pranks or jokes of Sarah Palin, which all humorists who are rating-rating are now talking about. The facts confirming this, speak for themselves. Jay Leno's show, which was the same humor, is on the verge of cancellation. The ratings of Letterman and Conan and the shows that follow them have fallen. <br /> <br /> Emperor Stewart is not alone. The trouble is that if one of them starts to go broke with clumsy democrats in power, he can hastily raise his rating, because the best humor is always at the expense of whose power. The Bush years proved that since the ratings of this show, as well as Colbert, Letterman and Leno, were higher there. <br /> <br /> O'Bama did one thing, proving that these shows should be ready to risk and thwart people in power if they want to flourish. Right now, the Daily Show and Stewart are sagging, but they may be lucky, and Palin will be elected the first female president in 2012. Then Palin's lame jokes will become the invaders of the ratings.
