I admire the attempts to bring this tragic story to the rest of the world. However, the film is made so badly that most people I know could not get through it. The film has been relevant for me since I lived in Estonia when these events took place, but it was written badly and does not attract the attention of someone who knows nothing about this issue. The choice of music does not coincide with the film, it seems that someone just turned on the CD player in the background so that the actors were "in the mood." Acting ... well, what is acting? The only actors are Jurgen Prokhnov and Donald Sutherland, although Prochnow seems uncomfortable in this role. With regard to the development of relations between Eric Westermark (Jürgen Prochnow) and Julia Reuters (Greta Scacchi), this is similar to watching a train wreck. There is absolutely no chemistry, and it is painful to observe their “sincere moments”. This is not a good movie. There is a difference between trying to get the message out (maybe it was a documentary!) And trying to make a good movie. This is a failure, and anyone who says otherwise makes me wonder if they are trying to promote it. In fact, as a native of Estonia, I am offended by this pitiful effort. This tragedy deserves more than just a low-budget home ghostly chase from the movie. It could have been a lot more!
