So many classic films have been shot in which leading people were just liars, and yet they look good. I never bought it. Screw Comedies was full of this stuff, like so many Fred Astaire films. <br /> <br /> Here Barbara Stenvik plays a famous country journalist who has been lying to the public for many years. and feels that she needs to continue to lie in order to preserve her identity (and her work). She even lies to the guy about marriage, another topic that has always been trivialized in classic films. <br /> <br /> She is a New York woman who pretends that she is an excellent cookery and someone who knows how to handle children, etc. Obviously, she does not know anything, and the lie accumulates so quickly that you lose track. I suppose that all this should be fun, because the lessons are learned at the end, and true love prevails, and so on. D. Etc. Please pass the bag to the barf. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie is NOT funny. Stanwick was much better in the film noir genre. As for Dennis Morgan, well, hand over the bag again.
