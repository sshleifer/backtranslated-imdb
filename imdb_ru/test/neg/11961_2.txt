I watched the 1st movie stuffed and did not choose it, although I knew that it was used class, he really had decent blood, and the guy playing the stuffed animal was a terrific acrobat and had good skills. The effects were better and the costume looked much better than this movie. <br /> <br /> I borrowed it with an open heart, I am also a fan of Ken Shamrock (former champion of the UFC super final) and hoped that it was a decent movie. <br /> <br /> The boy was wrong, the film sucks, the monster was pathetic both in appearance and truly scary, the storyline was so predictable that it was like watching a movie in preview mode, so as I would have guessed what would happen, the music was so bad, with a horrible lip-sync song that made me want to hit the screen. <br /> <br /> In general, avoid this crappy movie. <br /> <br /> Save some money.
