I got this movie in the bin, hoping for a funny bad movie. The boy was disappointed. (except avon.) You see, the film is really terrible, but so terrible that it is not even funny. The plot, oh wait, no plot. I think we can say that this is the main character who rises in the ranks of street battles. At the end of the film, the directors decided either to no longer make sense, or, more likely, they died, and the monkey finished directing the film. DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT FINISHED! although the ending does not spoil anything. The protagonist somehow finds herself in a room filled with mirrors, a la Enter The Dragon, and then very angry, recalls stupid memories and beats in the mirror. The end. Wheeee. <br /> <br /> The Avon scene was the only saving factor for this movie. He speaks to the boss of a competing street fight and says something like that, completely calmly: â€œDon't worry about him, sir. I killed him subtly. I ate it, I had dinner, we went to the disco. We had a lot of fun. And then I killed him. "At that moment the boss says:" Good work, Avon. You are number 1. "And Avon says:" Number 1! The scene continues with the avon, who continues to say "alllrriiiight!" Again and again. Next scene - dead Avon swimming in the pool. Smart? I think not. <br /> <br /> Finally, I own the version of this film for "Home Guy", which means the name on the box that I own, "Home Guy" It depicts a huge guy holding a giant pistol and screaming. It never happens in a movie. This person is never in a movie. High to Quality. <br /> <br /> Note: I am new to this review, but damn it, yes, I will continue in the same vein.
