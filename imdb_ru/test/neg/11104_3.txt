It's my fault. They all told me that I should avoid watching this movie, because I'm a big fan of old TV shows. They were right. While production values ​​are good, and the actors themselves (including “do not look now”) Julie Christie are not so bad, the whole film demonstrates audacity and self-awareness, which are clearly without any justification. A comparison between Karl "The Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns 2000" comes to my mind. In fact, Belphegore 2000 is much more indebted to the new Mummy films than to old TV shows. But then the scenarios are terrible, there is no speed, and sometimes the film is full of unintentional jokes (the first scene in the tomb looks silly) when the cats are clearly abandoned, when they have to jump (landing backwards). Belphegor moves like a statue on wheels, neither impressive nor frightening, and the psychological drama unfolding in the old TV series, when the heroine had to learn that she was a villain, is completely ignored. This film is so LOST (wasted money, wasted actors, wasted project) that it hurts. This is an inappropriate detachment from the mummy, which is good only for laughter, but has nothing to do with Greco's classics (she also has a small role in the film in the cemetery).
