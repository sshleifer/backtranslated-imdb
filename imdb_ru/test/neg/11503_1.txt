I think it was just like Lizzie McGuire, except that it was much worse than the original. the only thing that is different is that she loves animals, science and all these disgusting things. everything else is the same. she likes the guy she is too nervous to ask. and later she finds a guy who loves her and she has no idea. I think people should stop doing the same shows. and the other thing that is the same is that it is always a thaw, friends are two girls and one guy. Don't people think that these things become obsolete and these ideas continue to be used again and again, and yet they continue to use these ideas. but I know the people who watch this show, and I know that they like it.
