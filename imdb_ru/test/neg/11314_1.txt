Leslie Nielsen reaches a terrible bottom with this absolutely terrible comedy that is the worst mainstream movie I've ever seen. In this film, there is nothing to love, because in fact it is a film with one joke, and the joke is not so funny. How many times do we have to laugh at an almost blind man who makes a fool of himself? This is not funny, it's just a pity. Nielsen needs to seriously abandon some of these pitiful scenarios, and Stanley Tong needs to start making Jackie Chan movies, because itâ€™s not much worse than that.
