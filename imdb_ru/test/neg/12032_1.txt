A low budget can be an excuse for bad acting talent and pitiful fake blood. However, this is not an excuse for a bad letter. It is a talent to be able to write dialogues without forcing it to sound forced and mechanical. The dialogue in this film was on par with the majority of training videos shown to fast food workers in training. <br /> <br /> I also understand that you need to make a few exceptions when it comes to acting talent, when you have only 20 bucks to spend on it. With that said, no serious director would look at these scenes and say to himself: “It was beautiful.” I see the best character playing on Canadian television. <br /> <br /> In this film there was a delicate plot, a bad game, a bad dialogue and absolutely no reasonable ideas. It just proves to me that some independent films are for some reason. If you're looking for a quick scare, rent something else. Even The Cable Guy was a scary movie. After watching this movie, I think it would be better for me to watch the re-run of the X-files.
