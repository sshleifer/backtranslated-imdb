This is a very, very, VERY bad movie! <br /> <br /> The plot is weak, the acting is bad, and science is worse. <br /> <br /> Special effects are inconclusive. Dramatic scenes are a joke. Every step on the way you can see how a mile. The end is disappointing, and there is no waiting. The best aspect of the film is the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The only reason this vote was not received is that this is a television film, and I believe that the budget for the beginning was low. <Br /> <br /> I believe that young fans of Luke Perry will still watch this movie, but he did a better job. Again it is terrible. Very very very awful. If you have a choice, look at something else.
