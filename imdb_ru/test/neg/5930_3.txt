This film was fine as far as the films go. This could be done as a transition to secular films. However, it had nothing to do with the books “Left from the back,” on which it was supposedly based. Major historical premises have been removed, and new major historical premises have been added. <br /> <br /> What disappointed me the most was the way Nikolai was portrayed. He was shown supernatural powers, which he did not have at that moment in the books. Antichrist is not Satan, not omniscient or omnipotent. <br /> <br /> Faith and belief were portrayed in strange, surrealistic ways that seemed to make the film just silly. <br /> <br /> Non-believers who watch this will have more ammunition to ridicule Christian beliefs.
