If you want to see someone accidentally eat the egg of another man, or look at a series of fake wedding fakes, or listen to a man talk about how good it was to have sex with a girl when she was sick, then this is a movie for you. Tomcats are certainly interesting in the alternation of romantic and rough comedies that destroy the neck. Beautiful Jamie Pressley plays the wife of Horatio Sanz (tell me one more), which is found in many silhouette situations with other women, but, surprisingly, there is no nude. Jake Busey is very disgusting like a beagle that you wouldnâ€™t like to be your friend. Shannon Elizabeth and Jerry O'Connell are both good and make a convincing couple, but the film is too busy trying to disgust to be good.
