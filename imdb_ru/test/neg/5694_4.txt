I’m willing to put up with almost everything in a science fiction film, but it was almost unbearable. While some of the special effects are very steep (landscapes), this is not a “battleground”, but scattered odd mother-daughter relationships with sci-fi inclusions. This film is boring, since the fighting scenes “from hand to hand” are funnier than in any other tat film in Hong Kong. The plot line is tangled, and the devices used to move the plot (the narrator), the inexplicable jumping of the scene and the multitude of deus ex machina confirm the idea that the writer and director is not a good idea. Save your love of Sci-Fi for something else, instead of losing it here.
