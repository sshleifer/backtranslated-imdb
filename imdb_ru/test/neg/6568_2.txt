Even without being a fan of Star Trek movies or the universe of shows and books and the like, I still enjoy some movies with the old, and in the case of First Contact, even the new. , Although this film was sad to watch ... it seemed that he wanted to be so big, but on many levels he failed to become one of the worst Star Trek films. The plot is very far-fetched, it seems that he wants to combine three or four stories into one final adventure of Trek, but ultimately it becomes unfunny when trying to be, not tense, when he wants to be, and not stuffed with actions, as if trying to get confused. inconsistencies. The entire film, to take a phrase from Spock, is illogical. The effects are not special, as I have seen Next Generation episodes, which are just as good, that is, it's good for a television show, but not for the main film. The plot is ridiculous, because the gang first tries to stop Brother Spock, and then joins him in his quest to find God, yes, you read that right. The Klingons look like they really do, which in fact will create a much better film, The Undiscovered Country. In general, you know what is bad when the best part of the film is the singing of Kirk, Bones and Spock, rowing on a boat, well, Spock didnâ€™t really sing, but rather doubted the lyrics.
