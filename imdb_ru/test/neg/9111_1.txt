***** I reveal two “turns” at the end of the film. Do not read if you want to watch this movie for some reason ***** <br /> <br /> Oh god, this is bad. And for some reason, Sean Bean, one of the greatest contemporary actors, has sold his soul and appears in it. The only consolation is that the writers must have realized that someone as pitiful as Steve Guttenberg could never have in his life tried to kill as tough as Sean Bean. Instead, he was killed in what should have seemed an amazing turn at the end, a good guy who should have been killed by Bean, but in fact was his boss and faked his own death. Do not worry I have not destroyed anything for you. The actor’s performance itself is strikingly terrible: the stern man patented by Guttenberg “Hey, look, I can pull out Chuck-Norris” dominates the two hours of hell on earth. In addition to the story that I could write when he was tortured and hung upside down with both hands cut off, there is also a completely pointless critical error in the fact that once a virus breaks out, if they look just as wrong at it, while another moment, Steve Guttenberg boldly runs with him, throwing, catching a beating and generally abusing this “virus”, which has a distinct kind of collection of those little soap balls that you put in the bath. My last word? If you are suicidal and feel like you want to laugh manically at something that should be a bad comedy, but worse, record it the next time it's on channel 5 at midnight, and then write it down when you realize What I really say is true.
