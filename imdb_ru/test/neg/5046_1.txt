This is just one of a hundred million films in which directors are trying to add too much drama to a film that is not at all dramatic. As in the beginning, the part where the monk duck put an arrow in his hand, and then fired the same arrow at the gargoyle five minutes later - no point. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is worse than the storyline is CGI, which would strongly compete with a self-made flash-film. The actors look like they are trying to portray a bunch of robots of the 70s; dialogue makes little sense, it is not funny. <br /> <br /> Many things just happen without explaining how and why, for example, a woman suddenly wanders around the zoo, which was closed a few hours ago. And when she sees that this THING is flying to her, her first reaction is to take a picture, and not what she does a full ten minutes later - walking with force (not even running), on which her life depends - which, obviously, this is not true. <br /> <br /> Overall, not recommended. I want them to still do new episodes of MST3K.
