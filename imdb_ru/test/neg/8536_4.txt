After problems in Chicago, the Solomon family moves to a remote farm in North Dakota to start all over again, but their attempts at idyllic farm life are interrupted when their teenage daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her 3-year-old brother Ben begin to see attack supernatural beings that do not allow them to live in the world. <br /> <br /> “The Messengers” begin decently, although eventually it becomes a common horror film that is much more humorous than frightening. After reading the package, I thought that it could be a decent movie, because it sounded creepy and there was potential in it. Unfortunately, the film did not live up to its potential, although I should have expected this, since the trailer was terrible. The script was probably the worst. It was full of silly sequences and gentle dialogue. The characters were not developed at all, and most of them acted like a bunch of idiots, so it was difficult for them to feel sympathy. <br /> <br /> The directors did a terrible job creating uncertainty. They mainly relied on cheap fears, such as loud noises and random jumps. The music was truly unsurpassed and it was easier for the audience to telegraph the next “scary” moment. I also didn’t like the way they just used one place for the whole movie. The house was the central part of the story, and it was there that most of the filming took place, so after a while it became a bit boring to see the same area. In addition, I did not like the close-ups of the actors. During the conversation, the camera continuously jerked from character to another for five seconds, and it became really annoying. The directors really created a decent atmosphere, and they get some points for making their film stylish. However, since we have come a long way in terms of style and effects, it’s actually not so difficult to make your film beautiful, especially if you are working on a Hollywood film. <br /> <br /> The scene was terrible if this film were released in December, I’m sure he would have received several Razzi nominations. Kristen Stewart showed some talent in Panic Room, but you can't say she has talent by watching her performance in “Messengers.” She was fine in fright and that was all. The rest of the time she was dry and unconvincing. Penelope Ann Miller was just awful when it came to everything. It sounded like she was reading her own lines, and she had some of the worst facial expressions I've ever seen. Dylan McDermott was just very wooden and showed almost no emotion. John Corbett gave the best performance, and he had some good scenes. The twins who played Ben were also decent and managed to play many adult actors. In general, this unconvincing horror film is not worth watching because of its softness and laziness. Rating 4/10
