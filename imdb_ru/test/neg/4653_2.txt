All but the youngest Americans are probably familiar with the cult appeal "Laaaaaa-sie!" from little Timmy, or whatever his name is, crying a little tug for his friend on a border collie. These same Americans may or may not be familiar with the fact that Lassie made the leap from television to the cinema (or was it the other way around? Those are irresistible to make "this movie went to the dogs!" Pun, so I won't ( although technically I just did.) But, in a sense, it’s like that. Lassie (played by Shep, man’s best friend) gets the highest score. DOG GETS TOP BILLING. Now I’m not familiar with how the actors or their agents negotiate contracts, but how does this add up to my head: <br /> <br /> MOVIE MOGUL: Well, Lassie, in the credits, this is b and with Lassie as Shep! LASSI: Rrrrowf! Grrrrrrr. MOGIE MOGUL: Ha, ha, baby, calm down, calm down! LASSI: Rrroo rrrrooo roooo. MOGIE MOGUL: Well, I think I see it. Rawrf! Rawrrrrff rawrf! FILM CAN: Oh god! Let go of my hand! Top billing! The best bills for you, now let go of my hand !!! <br /> <br /> So, the dog gets the maximum bill, and I guess With the rest of this acting shock, that's understandable. We get a cute old, grumpy Jonathan, his young, tearful and obviously orphaned friend Tommy, a sketchy loser Lin Taylor and a cute old religious, grumpy Pilot Pete. The plot of the plot here can be summarized in several sentences, so I will save you from the real pain when watching a movie. Jonathan is a scout with a dog named Shep, and his partner dies while he is at his request. He has a new partner named Lyn, who becomes obsessed with gold, and Jonathan for some reason gives Shep a tearful little crying Tommy. Lin kills Jonathan, Shep sees this, and Lin tries to kill Shep. Then Lin tries to kill Tommy. Then Tommy whines, it gets cold, and Shep executes a carefully crafted plan to get revenge on Lin, what does he (or she?) Do. The end. <br /> <br /> If you don’t have a deep, anxious desire to watch a Lassi film (even then, a Lassi film should be better than this), just avoid “Painted Hills”. When it doesn't slow down, amazed by Lassie's limited ability to “act” (perhaps similar in style to Keanu Reeves - always the same facial expression, only the body moves), setting up the obvious using a few minutes of the film or insulting Native Americans everywhere with his white acting mask ” Phew! How! I'm Running Bear! " According to stereotypes, The Painted Hills is only suitable for Lassi fetishists or people who have some connection with the search during their days, like an old gray-haired seeker who is looking for a vein of glittering gold!
