Perhaps this is the worst movie I've ever seen. What a weak waste of Michael Imperoli's obvious talent. Disgusting film from start to finish. All I can say is that this director is not an “author”. You will never get inside the game, the character's head, an amazing talent with the numbers that this Stui had. The coke scene is bad enough to throw your shoes on the set, perhaps it would be a great scene if it was filmed for a movie, and not for a scene when the camera was halfway through the house hanging above the mirror with drugs, and the drama goes on the background. The scene where he wins the big league is ridiculous. This should be shown in film 101 - What not to do when creating photos.
