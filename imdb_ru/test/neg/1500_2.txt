This article presents an interesting way to work with the camera, especially for the DTV movie — the version I saw was full-screen - <br /> <br /> —but it is not suitable for the scripting department. First you get <br /> <br /> about 20 minutes of conversations, conversations, conversations in the “be it hip” style, after “Trainspotting”, and then it is a slash city. And then <br /> <br /> comes the most dishonest fraudulent ending I've ever seen is much worse than <br /> <br /> Fool's Day - where, at least, it made sense. So, in general, <br /> <br /> This is an old song and dance: an interesting director tries <br /> <br />, but deserves a better film. Funny: are these usually actors who are desperate for something better? Skip this anyway for your time.
