“Flashdance” is met with “Meatballs III,” or maybe it should simply be called “Meatballs IV.” This is my friend Wesley's favorite movie, largely because it still has to do with the fans of J.V. Someone once said, “This is good — more than good — but as you get older, you have to expand. Whether you want it or not, society demands it. ” <br /> <br /> “Give me the F” She has the greatest cheerleader of the SP, Mary Ann (played by Beth Miller), who looks like Alicia Silverstone with a sweet face, even before her “ignorant” days. Wesley hates Miller's other film, the terrible "Teen Wolf Too", shot three years later, where she plays the fickle southern beauty, much like the character of Martha Smith in "Animal House." Personally, I admire Miller's range, as these two characters could not be more different, and she is as convincing as both. <br /> <br /> In any case, Mary Ann is a naive cheerleader new from Moline (a member of the Lucky Ducks team)) who comes to Beaverview Camp for cheerleading instructions. She became friends with Jenna (Karen Lee Kelly), the leader of a group of tough girls, which is rightly called “Demons”. Jenna becomes the protector of Mary Ann after her main rival dislikes Mary Ann. <br /> <br /> Later, Mary Ann falls in love with Tommy Hamilton, the main instructor. Tommy spends his summer struggling with the dilemma of having to grow up and move on, which is a problem, since his only skills are learning to cheer and perform difficult dance exercises in the soul, for the pleasure of viewers who go for that kind. thing. Phoebe (Daphne Ashbrook) - Tommy's long-suffering friend, she has a well-adjusted attitude and an experienced perspective. She even tolerates Tommy's flirtation with Mary Ann, believing that Tommy will not really take advantage of young Mary Ann. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that these four characters are strong and their relationships have a pleasant charm, the cast is almost as weak as the material with which they have to work. And it's a shame, because if they brought some real comic relief to production, it would be a decent movie. Jennifer Cook plays Pam, a social climbing and insanely fun instructor who leads with the hungry camp owner Bucky. And there are a couple more with things for the characters from Mad Max. Since there is nothing funny in this, you will only have a pretty semi-romantic and some magnificent dance exercises. <br /> <br /> An attempt was made to create some tension by slowly summing up the final competition, but if this is not your first film experience, the result is never in doubt. And there is a story with some Japanese businessmen from whom Bucky wants to get money, but this does not lead to anything either dramatically or comically. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
