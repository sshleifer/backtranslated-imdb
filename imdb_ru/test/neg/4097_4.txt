One hundred seventy five million dollars is a hell of a lot of money that can be spent on even the biggest summer blockbuster. Even Michael Bay didn’t have such a large budget for Transformers, so exactly how Universal Pictures spent so much money on creating Evan Almighty remains a mystery. Of course, they didn’t spend it on the script on the one hand, because the film is not so much a classic comedy as a Christian flag waving and holding back one or two quiet chuckles, you will most likely spend time wondering where the budget went or why Steve Carrell felt the need to shoot it in a very specific film at the very moment when his star profile began to grow. <br /> <br /> Continuing the comedy of Jim Carrey Bruce Almighty, this film sees former support character Evan Baxter (Carrell) moving up the stairs to the player’s main slot. The story begins with the fact that he leaves the newsroom to become a public servant, and moves to Washington with his wife and three new sons (a slightly odd puppet in elementary school, an energetic high school student and a sullen teenager). Nevertheless, Evan’s attempt to change the world through politics receives the key to the fact that God appears (Morgan Freeman) and asks him to build the Ark. <br /> <br /> In other words, this is an update of the old history of Being. , with Evan struggling with cynicism and skeptics to build a huge boat. Unfortunately, while the premise is quite promising, unfortunately, it does not give a lot of laughter. Initially, there is a bit of fun when MP Evan tries to combine the demands of the civil service with unwanted flocks of animals that follow him, and a beard that resists all attempts to shave him off, but as soon as he accepts his divine mission, the film begins to throw in the eyes. <br /> <br /> From now on, it turns into a movie message. Evan begins to preach with alarming regularity, and Morgan Freeman continues to appear, offering good wisdom, while gently pushing his chosen one in the right direction. Without Evan’s resistance, however, the only remaining comedic track comes in the form of a few jokes with fake animals and excrement and the role of John Michael Higgin as Evan’s irritated right man. Higgins can demonstrate the same rich comic potential as previously in Arrested Development, but his enthusiasm cannot save a sinking ship, especially considering that Carrell almost left his amazing improvisation skills in the background. <br /> <br /> In a sense, this is a bit like the Passion of the Christ, but unlike the Mel Gibson film, in which everyone wanted to believe in God, shedding blood and feeling guilty, Evan Almighty tries to be more cautious. The film simply tells us that we must believe in God, because He believes in us. Unfortunately, this movie is as likely to make you laugh as a passion. Carrell is on autopilot, there are no jokes, and Wanda Sykes relies on becoming the most annoying person on the planet. It may be nice, but someone just threw $ 175,000,000 overboard.
