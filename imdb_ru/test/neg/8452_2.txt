This is an example of a film that can have great potential and is very poorly executed. I am a fan of children, thumb suckers and many other so-called teen anxiety films, but this one scared me. <br /> <br /> Why every white guy turns into a gangster who loves rap and becomes one dimension. The action was terrible, but simple, since basically it was just dropping a bomb after a bomb, just a bad bad movie if you want to watch the best movies like this: children sucking their fingers intimidate everyone <br /> <br /> who I think is better, so I recommend one of them, if you want to watch a good “movie for teenagers”, I hope that my comment was useful to you, and I hope that you will hear from me future comments
