This film is so bad that it becomes ridiculous. One of the worst films I've ever seen in my whole life. The funny thing is that in the trailer there were scenes that were not in the film. Just looking at the trailer, I would have saved a lot of time. It actually showed everything that happened in the film, except for the conclusion, and it was also so obvious. <br /> <br /> Honestly, it is difficult to understand the reason why this film was shot. This is so bad. Horrible. <br /> <br /> I would give 0 out of 10 if it were possible. There is nothing more to say about this movie.
