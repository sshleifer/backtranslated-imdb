Ewww! The sequel to Disney, which is rubbish! Who would have thought? In fact, quite a lot, judging by the comments here, and they are not mistaken. In fact, I was looking forward to the opportunity to see this horrible film based on my taste of the original. And that's the whole Disney mentality to "cash in". Throw any old trash into the background of success, and people will go for it. Don't you think they are so cynical? Then ask yourself: how many Disney movies have a sequel? And then .... How many of these sequels spawns a sequel? Significantly lower number. <br /> <br /> Kronk's New Groove is another example of this. The plot is ridiculously simplified and drawn out. Even more annoying was the increase in the number of "inappropriate" objects and scenes - for example, a home for old people and, God forbid, the Aztec version of the Boy Scouts! Worst of all, the opposing leader Chippamanka Kronk has a completely incomprehensible accent in English for no reason. Accent, which after a very short time strongly strained nerves. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of good things. The animation is very good, and the talent of the voice goes well with the sub-standard dialogue they are given, especially with Warburton in the lead role. But other than that, there is really nothing to recommend. Of course, young children may like it, but there is little that can amuse mom and dad while they sit in this winding fascination with the original concept. <br /> <br /> Avoid this deformity with the same zeal that you use to avoid a flock of crowing man-eating lions.
