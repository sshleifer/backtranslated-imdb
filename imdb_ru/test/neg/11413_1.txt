I am ashamed to admit that I was listed as the director of this film ... my very first one! In fact, it was the first feature film for almost everyone who participated. Look carefully, and you can even see me in one of the first scenes, as a dead man, who will soon be killed, by the name of ... "They sat down" (my own last name). <br /> <br /> Originally titled “Hostages,” this picture was replaced by “Another Sam's Son” by the producer-director, who at the time wanted to capitalize on the serial killer in the news. Nothing could help. I don’t even think that this photo was good enough to be shown on MST 3K! <br /> <br /> The film was made mainly using the collection of old Mitchell cameras and early Arriflex handheld cameras. In fact, a helicopter shot during a hostage siege was taken from my own era of World War II. The painting was filmed entirely in Charlotte and Belmont, North Carolina, in the mid-seventies. Most of the "Stars" were local TV presenters, and the rest of the team was simply inexperienced or credulous enough to believe the former stage and production director, Dave A., in the illusion of Adams' adequacy. If you like to watch such a picture, you might like the work of another North Carolina, the legendary Owensby Earl. <br /> <br />
