Well, I have to admit that I really liked the House of the Dead despite its well-documented mistakes. However, it was the worst film I have seen since the Demons at the Doors. Compared with DATD, the effect is much higher. However, the plot is weak, acting reminiscent favorite, porn movie, as well as the decisions and actions of the "characters" constantly borders on the idiotic. I am tempted to try the latest cinematic events of Uwe Boll to get an idea of ​​HOTD2. I do not claim that it really cures, rather, it is another case of illness, but when your feelings are offended in such a disgusting way, the only way out is the way up. OK, it is. I coped with a minimum of ten lines and will no longer spend our time on wasting celluloid, that is, the House of the Dead 2.
