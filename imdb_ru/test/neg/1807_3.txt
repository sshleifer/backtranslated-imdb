Review of the film "Heart of Darkness." Can a book that is well known for its eloquent formulations and complex concepts ever turn into a film good enough to convey the deep meaning of the book? So far, this goal has not been achieved. The Heart of Darkness was tried to be made from the film in 1993, but this was a failure compared to a book. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to turn any book into a movie. There are always concerns that this will not be descriptive or have the same meaning. So why the novel "The Heart of Darkness" turned into a film, I do not know. There are so many descriptions and hidden meanings throughout the book. When I just read the words, I think that the person will think that it is rather boring and will not receive symbolism. I think this is what happened in the film; The film simply showed the story on the surface. <br /> <br /> The film did not even fully correspond to the storyline of the book, major changes were made, which, in my opinion, made the film even worse. For example, the manager did not go together on a boat with Marlow and the rest of the team, instead a spy. I think I pulled out a few key stories and pulled out the manager’s great deception towards Kurtz. In addition, Kurtz was not even on the steamer when he died, which especially made the whole journey even more useless, which became annoying after a while. And when Marlow told Kurtz's bride about his last moments and words, it was far from being so descriptive or important, the bride was not even upset. <br /> <br /> As for acting, none of the actors did a very good job, with the exception of the actor who played Mfum. In my opinion, Kurtz was not very angry, and it was very important in the book. In addition, other characters, such as Marlowe, the manager and the groom, did not do the justice characters they deserve from the book. Their game was not very exciting or memorable at all. In general, I do not think that they even tried to turn this book into a film. I think you can use some of the themes in another storyline, like in Apocalypse Now. But as for following the same storyline of the book, it is just a shame.
