Perhaps, like most of the others who saw this film many years after its premiere on television, I wanted to see many of my favorite actors in an old and obscure form, which is Slow Burn. With the exception of nostalgic significance, the film itself is not very good. <br /> <br /> Eric Roberts plays former reporter Jacob Ashe, hired by wealthy artist Gerald McMurty (Raymond J. Barry) to investigate the whereabouts of his estranged son Brian, who lived with his mother Leina (Beverly d'Angelo) for last few years. Jacob Ashe talks about what will become more than just investigating the whereabouts of Brian. But as soon as Jacob tracks Lane, his discoveries reveal a lot of problems. Perhaps due to the fact that the events in the film are moving too slowly, this little thriller never waits a lot of time, even towards the end with the final routine of disclosing the guilty and their motives. <br /> <br /> However, as mentioned earlier, this film is likely to attract attention because it is a relatively unknown cast, which includes both the very young Eric Roberts and the charming Johnny Depp, who plays stepson Lane Donny This may be reason enough to try it ... if you can find it.
