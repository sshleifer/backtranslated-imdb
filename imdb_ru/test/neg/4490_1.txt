The film begins in the spring of 2001. A soldier named John Tyree (Channing Tatum) falls in love with college student Savanna Kutis (Amanda Seyfried) during a break. For two weeks they fall madly in love with each other (!). But he must go to war, and she must go to college. They do, but keep in touch, corresponding with each other. Then comes September 11th. He wants to be credited again - she wants him to stay at home. What will they do? <br /> <br /> Hysterically bad romantic drama. The leaders are attractive - Tatum is definitely a handsome man with beautiful green eyes and a hot body (he appeared coming out of the water without a shirt after surfing) ... but he cannot act. Seyfried is a beautiful woman, and she tries ... but the dialogue here is terrible. When I saw this, my friend and I struggled to NOT laugh out loud at some of the “romantic” dialogues at the beginning. It was just awful. For the first hour or so, I was bored of a ridiculously predictable drama, or I was surprised by a terrible “romance”. Then, after that first hour, tragedy began and, I must admit, made me cry. However, the filmmakers are trying their best to make sure that you are crying with death, burial and meetings with people crying from tears. How can you not cry? It would work if the game were better. Tatum's face never changes expression - NOT ONCE! He always had a blank expression. Seyfried was a little better, but not by much. To make matters worse, Tatum and Seyfried did not have sexual chemistry on the screen at all! They barely looked as if they loved each other, let alone love one another. There were some beautiful pictures of Caroline, but this is a boring and silly romantic “drama”. A 1 completely ... and I usually love silly romantic dramas like this one!
