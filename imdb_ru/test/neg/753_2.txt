Poor Jane Austen should be glad that she is not there to see this terrible adaptation catastrophe. There have been so many great Jane Austen films lately that this film deserves to be buried forever along with two other films that I despise - The Man in the Gray Flannel Costume and David Copperfield’s 1969 version. My main claim to the film is that it does not completely correspond to the meaning of the book. Jane Austen made fun of Gothic mania in her society, and most of the novel is a tongue in her cheek. The film, however, is serious and sounds terribly melodramatic. The carefree, funny flavor of Austin’s work is completely and conspicuously absent from this heavy foray, in which horror of horrors meets historical drama. Catherine's imagination scenes are both unreasonable and uninteresting. In addition, Henry Tilney is terribly unattractive. Why, I ask, will anyone fall in love with him? If you're looking for a fun Jane Austen evening, see Emma instead!
