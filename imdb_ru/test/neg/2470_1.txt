According to an article on http://blog.ifeng.com/article/2737487.html, one of the actors of the film, Carina Lau, was forced to appear in this film for free. She was the victim of a notorious kidnapping shortly before this film was shot, and later her unfortunate photographs were published in a magazine that has since been forced to close and its publisher sent to prison. The actress denies that she was attacked, but a film leaked online that allegedly showed how she was raped. (The Hong Kong press, out of respect for it, basically refused to report the incident, but Google will have several articles about it.)
