Suppose you are a producer, you have some money, and you somehow got the equipment of Richard and Bruce Willis, so now all you need is a script ... but why bother? You see, this film is really terrible, the acting is pretty good, but the casting is terrible equipment, and Willis did everything possible to play these characters, which they simply cannot play. Now this film has no plot, or rather, there is something that the plot is trying to pass off: there is an evil contract killer (Willis) who is dangerously dangerous and tempted (in fact, he is not from those things, but from some kind of dialogue between other characters, you should have that impression), so this hired killer is on assignment to kill someone, now there is a former IRA prisoner, kind and pleasant and very handsome (outfit), which the FBI releases from prison so he will help them. so now the FBI is “investigating” to find this hired killer, the investigation consists of a series of implausible information - like some random person lost his wallet, and someone used his name to buy a car - which is always right for money. Since there is no real plot and scenario so foolish, you cannot expect any real character development or tension, so instead of creating them through a story, they simply add some kind of deactivated dramatic music that signals you that something very dramatic instead of creating something dramatic. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this is a very bad movie and a waste of time, which somehow got an incredibly high score for its level, perhaps because of Cast - and that's exactly what manufacturers count.
