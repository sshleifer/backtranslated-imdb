Another B-movie for teens, based mainly on CGI-effects, industrial soundtrack and some medieval images. It is a pity that the legend of Beowulf is used in such a boring way. I'm a fan of Christopher Lambert, but I have to admit that he is getting worse as an actor and his films too. Rent it if you are only a teenager.
