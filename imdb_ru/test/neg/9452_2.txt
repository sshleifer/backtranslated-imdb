A really terrible film, really low-budget, with a terrible game, a confusing and meaningless plot, a modest reworking of vampire stories mixed with modern science. <br /> <br /> The result is a complete mess, most parts do not make sense, with very limited and cheap effects. It's not even fun, like some of the inexpensive independent films of this kind. <br /> <br /> Loss of time
