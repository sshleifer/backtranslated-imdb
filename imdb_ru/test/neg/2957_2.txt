This movie is too long. I lost interest in about an hour to the story. Saratoga Highway tells the story of Ingrid Bergman, who is the child of a famous husband from New Orleans and his mistress. After her mother died in Paris, Bergman returned to New Orleans to shock his father’s “legitimate” family and blackmail them. She meets Gary Cooper, who is also seeking revenge against the railway magnates who have tricked his father from his land in Texas. She draws him to her plans, and the climax of the film at the resort of Saratoga. Long and boring, but worth a look if you are a fan of Bergman or Cooper. The Little Cupid is the only bright spot in this winding story.
