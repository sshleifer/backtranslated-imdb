Oh, what a disappointment in this film. I can't believe that it was director Waid. There is practically no plot, and 90% of the film consists of different people going in and out of the screen, weakly trying to interact with each other while talking about the Katyn massacre. The most interesting thing happens at the very end, but by that time I just stopped caring, trying to suppress yawns. <br /> <br /> Almost the entire film was shot using a hand-held camera, which should convey a sense of “personal immediacy,” but in most films there is nothing personal or immediate. Instead, the constant jerking of the camera made me sick. To be fair, there are great shots (no pun intended), but nothing that makes you say “Wow!”. <br /> <br /> If you are not familiar with the Katyn massacre, the film will leave. You scratch your head. If you are familiar, you will also be scratching your head, although perhaps for other reasons. In fact, the film says and confirms again and again that it was the Soviets who killed thousands of Polish soldiers in 1940. This moment repeatedly sounded as if someone from the audience had to be convinced of this fundamental historical fact. However, the film never tries to explain why they were killed. In the end, tens of thousands of Polish soldiers in other Soviet prisoner of war camps were not injured and were released in 1941. It is also never properly explained, HOW MANY people died, although the figure of 20,000 is thrown a couple of times. <Br /> <br /> Acting is sufficient, and only Komorowska (old woman) and Chir (Lt. Jerzy) give noticeable performances, but in total they can perform for 10-15 minutes. Of course, not enough to carry the entire movie. Many other actors seem to have been chosen more for their morning views, and not for their acting skills, but I will not mention their names. Suffice it to say that they are definitely NOT the Oscar material, so any claims that this film was “robbed” for the Oscar award are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The tone of the film is also incorrect. On the one hand, he is trying to be an accurate historical drama, on the other - he resorts to cheap anti-Soviet propaganda, for example, he shows how a Russian soldier tears a Polish flag and uses it to clean his shoes. Then there are some mysterious scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, such as a couple climbing a roof or the elimination of Krakow University. <br /> <br /> There are many missed opportunities to make this film more interesting, for example, adding a political narration to the story, or showing German discoveries of the graves, or even an image of Anna's journey from the occupied part of the Soviet Union to the German-occupied Krakow. All these aspects could be the main part of the film, but instead they are reduced to a couple of minutes. In the end, we get a collection of loosely suitable, tangled, boring scenes about the reaction of the Poles to one of their greatest tragedies of the Second World War. Not very convincing and not at all worthy of Waida.
