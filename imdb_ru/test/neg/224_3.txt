I was amazed by the director Antal's Kontroll back in 2003. His first American project, Vacancy, was a less impressive but worthy start. Armored is his second feature, and although the visual signature is recognizable, the film never rises above the level of film B. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the main room has all the ingredients for turning, and the cast with the participation of many quality actors must be able to perform. Antal may have made a great movie about the theft, but instead went to an action movie. On the other hand, he could have made a cool fighter, but in this section, too, this did not work out. <br /> <br /> What you have left is one unbelievable situation after another, a group of poorly drawn characters quarreling and fighting for a certain amount of money. If you look through the sharp cinema, the cast and the intense musical score, youâ€™ll have something that could be below average right in a video featuring Van Damme or Seagal. <br /> <br /> This was probably the most disappointing film for me lately.
