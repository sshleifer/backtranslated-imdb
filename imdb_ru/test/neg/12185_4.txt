It was the next for Jill Ireland's latest film, which died of cancer in 1990 after four decades as a famous actress and producer. Ireland made a lot of waves in the press when she abandoned her then husband David McCallum in 1967, starting her long relationship with Charles Bronson. It is a great irony that Bronson, probably the leader in the number of deaths presented on the screen, was one of the longest marriages in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> “Murder”, it seems, the film was tucked into the production schedule of Cannon for the sake of Bronson and Ireland. Ireland suffered from cancer-related illnesses in 1987, and you can almost imagine two actors wanting to do "one more for old times." "Murder" is done carelessly in general, showing a lack of care and exhaustion facilities that Cannon could curb by 1990. But there is some nostalgic value in seeing the couple together for the last time, and the film makes you wonder what the relationship helps to survive in the Holocaust chaos. <br /> <br /> Bronson plays Jay Killian, a high-ranking secret service agent tasked with protecting the first lady, Lara Craig (Ireland). The wife of the president has a reputation as a difficult leader who looks after agents and wants to do everything in her own way. That everything changes, however, when attempts are made on her life, and she must travel with Killian in a car, train, motorcycle and believe it or not, a dune buggy to escape from potential killers. This is not surprising, since Killian believes that the killers are part of the inner work, perhaps organized by the president himself. On the way, Killian and Mrs. Craig develop an unspoken affection for each other in scenes between Bronson and Ireland, which are actually very funny. <br /> <br /> What really attracts me is how this movie was advertised after it was released and how it is still made to look like a DVD. The original trailer gives you the feeling that “Killing” is another careless shooting of Bronson. But most of this film - which was rated PG-13, by the way - in a comic vein, putting it in the line of a romantic thriller, such as Bronson and the Irish western "From Noon to Third." Even the DVD shows a Bronson with a rocket launcher, ready to blow things up. Which he does, but to a lesser extent than his other 80s pot-breakers. <br /> <br /> In general, “Murder” is Cannon’s late work, and he doesn’t know what kind of film he wants to be. In addition to the transition from the action movie to the romantic thriller and back, there are serious errors in continuity, the values ​​of the properties are cheap, and the effects are terrible; many explosions seem to be dull work and not made on the spot. Robert Ragland, who showed good writing skills in earlier films, teamed up with Valentin McCallum with a score that is mostly synthesized and better suited for television. <br /> <br /> Richard Sale’s script has a real mass of dialogue, with conversations between Bronson and Ireland the only bright spot. There is no explanation as to why the First Lady was called 'One Mom' suddenly, or as to why Ireland remains with her British accent when the character is a Wyoming native. Ian Gan Boyd, who plays Killian’s chief assistant, has a personality that looks like a kitten, and he is mistaken for a federal agent. Stephen Elliott (former candidate for the Tony Award, who died in May 2005), Randy Brooks, Eric Stern (as the assassin of Bracken) and Michael Ansara (Senator Bunsen) are acceptable in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> By the way, this was the last film directed by Peter Hunt, which came on the scene with Her Majesty’s Secret Service in 1969 and collaborated with Bronson and Lee Marvin on Mortal Hunts in 1981. Murder is available on DVD via MGM Home Entertainment; it is presented in two widescreen standard format with subtitles in three languages ​​and theatrical trailer. <br /> <br /> ** of 4
