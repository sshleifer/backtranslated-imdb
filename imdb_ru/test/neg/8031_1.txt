I may be a simple person, but I prefer films that somehow make me care about people in them. I could not care for anyone in this film. Was this supposed to be a comedy? Maybe the humor was too thin for me (right down to the nanoscale). The fact is that in many things was not enough. There were characters who could be funny, but they are not. There were characters that you might like, but you did not. For example, the guy who thought that the Beatles had ripped off his songs. There was so much potential there, but all he did was say it, like the Beatles, and complain about being robbed. Haha And the previous poster spoke about the “I am the Walrus” scene, as if it was special. What kind? He played "I - Walrus" on the old piano and sang out of sorts. Is there a joke from the inside? It definitely smelled at par. It seems to me that this film is similar to the film that people like, because it sounds like “intellectual” or “fashionable” to say that you like, that you get all the metaphysical information about art / trash the artist expresses. If you want to have fun, stay away.
