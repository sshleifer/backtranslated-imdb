<br /> <br /> Well, great costumes and a wonderful feeling for Italy before World War II. But what happened here? <br /> <br /> Great actors ... Christine Scott Thomas, Sean Penn, Ann Bancroft, James Fox, Derek Jacobi ... if you can't get unforgettable views from this "List", then the problem is this film charged with pitiful leadership and inadequate script. I rented it on DVD after I liked Angels and Insects (1995), also directed by Philip Haas. <br /> <br /> Yipes! I can't believe how boring this thing was. It just went on and on, and no one could save the poor thing. This is not even a good intriguing film "Alien with Mussolini" - "Dude with Mussolini" is gone! <br /> <br />
