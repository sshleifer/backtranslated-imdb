This film is bad, as we all knew it would be. In most cases, I usually like bad comedies of the 80s / early 90s (haha, no pun intended). I list the ski school, career opportunities, hot shots, summer school and more, made around this time. It is even a classic, but forgotten comedy by Dean Cameron (he is also an instructor in the section of ski school 8 and Party Maniac for Summer School). But this film is just slow. It takes almost 30 minutes to get started, and we have to have meaningless dialogue between the half-meaning Sheen boys (E & C). And yes, I hear bloggers die to kill me with the words “obviously you don’t watch 2 and 1/2 men). Well, Charlie was not at the level at which he is now during this film ... not that he was worth watching Charlie shines only when his colleagues support him, and Emilio is nothing more than an overly amazing bra, offering little support. In fact, this film was written by Emilio, and it shows. Ski school writers 2 started the final.) I don’t know how any problem will be solved, there are no hot kids, I don’t swear to cover a bad plot, characters, acting skills ... I am tired of this tirade. and watch the movies I listed above. You will enjoy them much more.
