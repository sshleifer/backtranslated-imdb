The director remained true to the most accurate description of the story, published in 1894, which includes the 1846 manuscript of Richard Williams Bell (son of John and Lucy Bell and younger brother Betsy Bell) entitled “Problems of Our Family”. As far as is known, this is the only eyewitness story ever written. The filmmaker should be commended for the accuracy, but little can be said about the quality and quality of the actor. The game was theatrical, and the quality of sound and image was extremely low. It seems that the director simply filmed scenes of the events described, without including and without interweaving them into a smooth plot or storyline. If you need to know a story, read about it, it is much more exciting and convincing.
