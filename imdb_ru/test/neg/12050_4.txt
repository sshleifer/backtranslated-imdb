I was delighted with the fresh (pun intended) synopsis of this film and look forward to seeing it. The first few snapshots tell about some of the characters, as well as the main place where the stories take place; garden allotments. The film looks fantastic. Colorful but simple. Magical but authentic. Unfortunately, it only takes a few minutes to figure out where the film will go. We will quickly understand that this will be a manipulative, juicy story illustrating a bunch of exhausted people standing in their way faced by “cute victims” and that she will have a happy ending when exhausted people realize the mistake of their ways and accept these people. <br /> <br /> Characters, especially prejudiced, are very “comic” in nature. The story tells mostly about two refugee families. One of them is headed by a single mother, who is brutally played by Divin Henry. I am saddened to say that any emotions that might have arisen in her struggle were weakened by what was an unforgettably bad act. <br /> <br /> Another story is much more interesting and focuses on the father and his two children. They all suffer from their journey to this country through containers, where the wife and mother died, but the husband suffers the most. Benedict Wong gives an amazing presentation here. At first, his emotions are very suppressed, but as history unfolds, he subtly makes us aware of the inner struggle of his character. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the film is just boring. There were so many possibilities in this movie. There are several tracking symbols, many of which may have potential, but none of them are realized. Worse, despite the fact that this film is not very Hollywood, some of the main plot stories are solved cheaply in the Hollywood way. Example: <br /> <br /> Character A likes character B Character B refuses his achievements. No problems! Let character C declare his love for character A so that we all have a happy ending. Yon <br /> <br /> I really liked the storyline of the Asian family. It was well done. Unfortunately, the entire resource allocation business, its overall aspect, the dynamics involving a large number of actors, is still being exploited. <br /> <br /> What you have left is a film that costs very little.
