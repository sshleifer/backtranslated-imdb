Shameless waste of my time as a spectator. This is one of the worst films I've seen in recent years. Please do not rent it, as you will regret it! Guaranteed! I wonder how Kathleen Turner found herself in this! She is a legitimate actress, and people can be attracted to this film because of her. But it is really better to act as if this title has never been made! It should not have appeared!
