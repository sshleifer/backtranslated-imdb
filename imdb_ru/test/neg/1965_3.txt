-can contain spoilers- <br /> <br /> Obviously, the one who ever shot this film must have had a lot of connections. I just do not see it differently. What really surprises me is that no one used the name Allen Smithy, and even more surprisingly, all participants did not use that name. <br /> <br /> In any case, where to start. Bad dialogue, obscene costumes, terrible looking film stock, unintended comedy, excessive characters and more controversy than in George W. Bushâ€™s career. I do not know what was funnier, the guy lost his hand because of a snowball or a slow scene, where they killed all the baby Jack Frost. In addition, one of the greatest lines of all time was uttered in this film. "How do we know that this is him?" As if there is another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs! Great camp film, but overall very bad.
