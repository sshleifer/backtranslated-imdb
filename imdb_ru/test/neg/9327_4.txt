I hate to admit it, but they were right to fire Schroeder. Here there is an opportunity to create an atmosphere, to attract an audience to the cinema. This has not been done. The characters are weak. The story was weak. The direction was very bad. Schroeder was beyond its depth, and it shows. I watched it several times now in the hope that there would be at least one redemption function. But no, nothing. The next step is likely to be a remake of the original, or, I hope, it will remain alone. Anyone who wants to know what the best continuation of The Exorcist should read is Legion written by Blatti, and it should be the best continuation of the original play to be dedicated to printing. Unfortunately, this is not well reflected on the screen, and I doubt that this is possible. As for the Dominion, the beginner. Avoid at all costs.
