When I listen to my parents watch this (after I put 10 minutes into the film), they absolutely do not understand what is happening. When Charles Dickens looked at the camera, I almost expected him to turn into a demon (yes, he looked like one). Unfortunately, it did not happen. <br /> <br /> This film had various reasons why I didnâ€™t finish it: first, it was unbearably slow. I mean, seriously, it was SLOW. You can understand only 10% of the above, and the characters were poorly represented. <br /> <br /> If you have an English accent and you like to talk a lot, inaction, terrible actions, trashy laughter and the same music / sound effects play over and over again, then this is the movie for you ... br /> <br /> 1/10 - absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs
