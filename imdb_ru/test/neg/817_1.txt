I say this. If you want to see art, you go to an art gallery. If you want to watch a movie, you go to the theater. An attempt to bind art and film turns out to be catastrophic in the film “Where the Heart Is.” An interesting cast is completely useless in this confusion. You like Dabney Coleman, see "Short Time". You like Crispin Glover, see Bartleby. You like Uma Thurman, see "Kill Bill." First of all, if you like Christopher Plummer, see The Silent Partner, because his character here is a terrible embarrassment. In fact, all this production - embarrassment. Of course, the human work of art was intrigued for a few minutes, so make a short speech, but do not subject the audience to meaningless crap, masquerading as filming. - MERK
