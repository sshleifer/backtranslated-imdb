Busty beauty Stacie Randall plays the PVC-clad shameful bitch Alexandra, Faust's faithful assistant, an evil creature who has gone to hell Determined to free her master, the evil minx rushes into the warehouse to steal the magic gem vital to her success; but, conducting a satanic ritual to summon Faust, the stupid mare accidentally enters a pentagram, which she painted on the floor, resulting in the loss of a precious stone and the release of two miniature, troll-like creatures called Lite and Dark. <br /> <br /> Now Alexandra needs to find a spare stone that will not be easy: the only other stone that will help is her former lover, worn on the neck, police detective Jonathan Graves (Peter Leapis), who is investigating a warehouse robbery and too knows well what the wicked Alexandra is capable of. Meanwhile, insightful interdimensional half-pints of Lite and Dark get into all kinds of trouble, trying to find their way home. <br /> <br /> In the twisted cinema world of Jim Vinorsky, all women are big boobs with a fashion sense of a cheap prostitute. Ghoulies IV is no exception: every woman in this film, whether it is a police captain, a keeper of antiquities or mentally ill at a shelter, is hot, hot, hot and wears not so much, and this fact makes this completely unnoticeable piece of shit from STV tolerable. <br /> <br /> But be careful, even though having a semi-naked, high-quality mouthpiece makes the process a bit easier, there’s a lot more in this movie. to be marked as a severe test: the game is wooden, and the dialogue is painful; black humor (as described on DVD) is about as funny as the knee for idlers, and the comedy banter “Lite” and “Dark” are particularly depressing; and special effects are a profitable base consisting of rubber creatures and visual effects that would appear dated ten years earlier. <br /> <br /> 3/10 exclusively for high bimbo ratio.
