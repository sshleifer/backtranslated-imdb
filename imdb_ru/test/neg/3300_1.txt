There are shows and films that I saw, and then read reviews on IMDb.com, with which I do not agree, and gladly admitted that there was only a difference of opinion. <br /> <br /> Reading positive reviews of this scum just reminds me of the sinister plot in which the television network employees were ordered to browse the Internet and publish unconvincingly positive reviews of programs for which they themselves are responsible. <br /> <br /> How else can we explain the review that this show “will definitely become a phenomenon” a year after it becomes clear that it will not be anything like this? <br /> <br /> I will not waste words describing this mess, but enough to say if you like wives who dilute their husbands, husbands who dilute their sons, children who disrespect their parents and have no other behavior or implications to legitimize the characters, who are mostly just unfunny one-line spewing machines, and then watch it w ow. <br /> <br /> I, on the other hand, have a few Seinfeld DVDs to go through. <br /> <br /> Futurama - Canceled. Titus - Canceled. Arrested Development - Canceled. War at home - renewal. <br /> <br /> There is no justice.
