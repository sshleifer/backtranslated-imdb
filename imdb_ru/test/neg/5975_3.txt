When the exploiters become evangelicals, they still exploit in the name of poverty! <br /> <br /> My first reaction after watching a movie is ?? God bless me that I don't eat fish or any non-vegetarian foods! <br /> <br /> A documentary about Lake Victoria in Tanzania, where numerous varieties of beautiful fish once lived, and once, in the 1960s, someone came and injected a powerful perch that became an export commodity for Tanzania in Europe and Europe. Japanese markets. The consequences were severe ?? first, all local small and large fish have become extinct; secondly, the plane that arrived to pick up the fish could not be empty, because it does not have a commercial / business / capitalist sense, so it is filled with weapons and ammunition (this is what Europe can give to this world); thirdly, pilots (like all migrants and traveling people, such as truck drivers) must survive their sexual needs, raising cheap local African prostitutes for them; fourthly, brokers, dealers, middlemen in the chain (mostly businessmen of Indian origin) become richer, and poverty in Tanzania remains the same; Fifth poverty leads children to crime, drugs, etc. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​making this documentary was excellent. But did director Hubert Zuper manage to make a good documentary? This is a big NO. <br /> <br /> I speak of the reasons: as in India, a higher caste of Brahmins is required to rise and project Indian poverty and the untouchables onto the world; Similarly, it is required that a European documentary producer, born in Austria, tell the world the story of Tanzania with its collapsing and collapsing economy and poverty. This is the pathetic motive of the unconscious breeding of that rich class (who has never seen either poverty or the poor) who survives, lives, earns and fame as a pest, clinging to the projection of poverty on the world as soon as he sees it. There is nothing more than the contempt of poor people in Africa and India who see such images of them. <br /> <br /> Hubert's intention and motives seem completely one-sided. Images, characters, locales, interviews are too dark and gloomy, dark and disturbing. He uses exaggerated ignorance as a voice to present his case. In the end, we feel pity and sadness for Africans. We are also starting to regard the government and people of Tanzania as villains. Maybe some Westerners sitting in their air-conditioned rooms will take the time to discuss and discuss the miserable living conditions of Africans, but there will be nothing else. <br /> <br /> The director is constrained to show himself even once on the screen ?? not to be identified among the Europeans who exploit this poor country. <br /> <br /> This director, Hubert, can only survive as exploiters, such as today's media giants CNN and BCC. Hubert did not have the courage or common sense to talk with Europeans who eat or companies that import these fish products. Absolutely one-sided brittle effort! But I understand the reasons for the same ?? Hubert just wanted to gain fame by sitting and smiling with awards in his European comfort. <br /> <br /> There are no more words for this pitiful effort. I hesitantly give the documentary a higher rating of 3.5 stars out of 10, simply because the topic was correct; but was pathetically exploited and blown up by an amateur ill-conceived director, created exclusively for an unwise western audience! (Stars 3.5 out of 10)
