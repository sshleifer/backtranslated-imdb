First, Blythe Danner does not look adult enough anywhere to play Capshaw's daughter (in fact, sheâ€™s not like that - just ten years apart). <br /> <br /> I understand that it must be one of these magical, supernatural novels like "Moonstroke", but it goes beyond. Very, very weak in terms of action, script and direction. <br /> <br /> The only one who really shines here is Ellen DeGeneres, who makes this movie watchable - if not really believable, since she played the role of a heterosexual sex dog. But, nevertheless, nice. In fact, DeGeneres and skin shots of a young guy that Capshaw takes off with, make it watchable. But no one can tell whether Capshaw is really in love with a young guy or not; Neither the script nor its actions bring us together, and we can only wonder how she really feels.
