This is a great example of how a great book turns into a bad movie. The direction simply creates the impression that the film was made when they walked together, and Patrick Swaz is so wooden that his body can almost see puppet strings. <br /> <br /> Spy movies against spyware - or should not not about car chases and shooting, the bad guys in these films - really bad shots and miss the main characters, even when point-blank. <br /> <br /> Even combat shots are just a clich√© with the usual installation of sidewalks and a fall through the tables and chairs - a yawn. <br /> <br /> I walked half the way and turned off - completely boring.
