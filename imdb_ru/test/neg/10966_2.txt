The trailer for this film promised a new twist in the zombie genre: staging it in the Old West. Except that this is not the real Old West, of course. It is a kind of West of the future, in a world where some apocalypse is known to make apocalypses, kill people and later turn them into zombies. This is again a zombie virus time guys and you know what that means? Bite and become one of them. <br /> <br /> So, a hero comes to this dusty and dead world. He is a bounty hunter who is paid to take care of zombies. It is not entirely clear who provides the funds, but it seems that a small zombie hunting industry has appeared. But as the trailer tells us, there is a problem. They run out of zombies. The only way to keep making money is to infect new cities with a virus. <br /> <br /> I think this is a good idea for a movie. But, unfortunately, in order to make a good film about zombies, you need much more than just a good idea, and a crowd of people caressing the windows. What we actually get is a clone of Clint Eastwood (his name is Clint, for crying loudly) and his “cheerful” partner trying to catch zombies and then track some of the still-living bad guys to get great reward. The whole story about the infection of other cities is mentioned only in passing, halfway through the film. Instead, there are a lot of western movie clichés, bad zombie cosmetics and some world-class bad action. Really bad. A view that would not even get to Hollyoaks. Heroes and villains gnaw on cigars, hurl them, people bite. As the film approaches the conclusion, the only thing worth considering is whether it will end with the hero's cliche being the only living person who killed the one he loves, or his cliche turning into a zombie in the final frame. (Incidentally, the first) This film was written and directed by Gerald Nott. This is the only thing he did, and hopefully this will be his last. At the beginning of the film there is an inscription "Nott Entertainment". At least they got one thing right.
