Too broken to be pleasant, too loose to be interesting, and too awkwardly photographed to be tolerant. MR LONELY is an interesting idea, ruined by really bad filmmaking. Like the Ken Russell film at its worst, or the DAY OF THE PLACE remade by amateurs, Mr. Lonely might seem like a good idea on a few pieces of paper (without a script, you see) and on a free rest somewhere, but in the end we have a widescreen movie that seems to have been made by students whose parents told them that EVERYTHING they did was a brilliant creation. Or did I understand the director correctly? Mr. Lonely is a waste of resources trying to be (eccentric!) Whimsical and deliberately insane. It ends with annoyance and condescension ... and meaningless. What is the point of going to a commune in Scotland? What a stupid idea in this movie about Hollywood delusions. Maybe Korin wanted to remake GODSPELL ... well, the result is GOD-TERRIBLE. Oh, and there are some scenes, such as the remaining footage from FITZCARRALDO, including Werner Herzog, the nuns and the plane. Add the dormant and violin music in the style of "ser-mo" with all the thoughtfulness and melancholy, add James Fox, who seems to hope that it can be considered bold (as in the presentation), and the result will be an enchanting soup with wide screen. It may have been fun to shoot, but the result on the screen is a mess. Imagine an American PIE BAND CAMP with food poisoning.
