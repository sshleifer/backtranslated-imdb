After sitting and watching this film, I can only think about the reasons for making the film. It was, without a doubt, one of the worst films I've ever seen, and there was no role to play in it. <br /> <br /> If it was funny, then perhaps it was a very weak comedy, but as a fighter it was awful. <br /> <br /> Slowly, without plot, without real action, nothing comes close to a good dialogue, and I have no idea about the characters. What more can I say. Avoid.
