This is really a film of two halves. The first details about the life and friendship of the two boys (one of whom was a privileged Pashtun and the other overthrown by the Hazara) in the late 70s in Afghanistan before the invasion of the USSR, work very well. Young actors turn into convincing performances and see that Afghanistan, as it once was, throws the existing situation into absolute relief. <br /> <br /> The real problem arises when we move to a later stage in history, where we join Pashtuns as a person living in America. Ancient debts to his young friend forced him to return to his homeland, and at that very moment everything collapses. It is assumed that the central adult character is cute, but in fact he looks like a weakling and falls into self-pity. It is difficult to really take care of him, and one cannot help but feel that a really interesting story is a story that we cannot see - the story of his childhood friend. <br /> <br /> As soon as he returns to Afghanistan, the story becomes mired in a series of rather contrived coincidences. Most remarkably, he manages to meet his childhood enemy almost immediately after all these years (although he is not looking for him), despite the chaos that has since swallowed the country. This allows him to confront past demons in a way that is too comfortable to be credible. The resolution of the narrative is also permeated with terrible Maucist sentimentality, which undermines any really serious comments that the film may try to make. <br /> <br /> Although you can begin to see the characters and their abuse Living as symbols of a state that has been torn apart by world politics, itâ€™s hard to really see it as a film that is involved in any broader political debate. Instead, the narrative is reduced to the emotional journey of one character to self-inquiry and healing. Unfortunately, this character is so boring and self-absorbed that it is difficult to truly dive into its history, while the opportunity to make a really interesting film about Afghanistan itself is missed.
