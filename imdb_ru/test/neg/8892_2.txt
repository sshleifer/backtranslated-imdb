I wanted to watch this film because I liked “The Prisoner of the Caucasus” (“Prisoner of the Mountains”) and “Brother” (“Brother”) with Sergey Bodrov Jr. and “The Thief” (“The Thief”) with Vladimir Mashkov. Well, unlike other movies, the Quickie was a waste of time. A story that does not make much sense, a very uneven game (Lesley Ann Warren was especially bad), really awful dialogues, bad cinematography, what else can go wrong? I find it funny that in almost every American film when foreigners who speak the same language (in this case, Russians) are left alone, they prefer to communicate with each other mostly in broken English (and when they speak Russian) For what For some reason, translators feel obligated to add to the sentences a lot of “f ** ks”, which do not have profanity, literal or non-literal). At the same time, English speakers prefer to speak broken Russian. Why? Returning to the story, most of the plots of the film (for example, bets on the house, inviting paramilitary groups in Latin America, etc.) either do not make sense, or do only the embarrassment of the audience. It is a pity that Bodrov, Mashkov and Lee (all good actors, in my humble opinion) were involved in this catastrophe.
