I saw it when it appeared in cinemas in 1996. I remember that I was already familiar with the work of Elijah Wood (true, he did things up to The Lord of the Rings!), And the commercials in the film were quite abundant (Flipper water pistols even circulated). <br /> <br /> Adults were reminded of old films and television shows, and for the sake of nostalgia they were taken by children who were excited because it was a film about a dolphin and a dumb boy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was not something that someone was expecting, and he failed a lot. You know that the film has problems when a boy swims away from a hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean, and a flock of dolphins scares off the shark, and the child - instead of getting out of the water into the boat - swims in the water for five minutes, thanks to his dolphin for saving ... obviously, he did not take into account that the shark is still there, perhaps even under it. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Paul Hogan. He looks old, crunchy and tired of refining his crocodile Dundee. By now, no one even remembered Crocodile Dundee much less than Hogan, and I half expected that he would suddenly begin to pretend that he didn’t know what a hair dryer was for the sake of laughter “fish out of water / social satire”. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a really bad “family” film, which is at the amateur level and sometimes difficult to watch. I hated it when I saw it in cinemas in the distant 96th, and now I hate it more.
