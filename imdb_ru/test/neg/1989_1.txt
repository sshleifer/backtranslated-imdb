This film is worse than the "celestial gate" or "Plan 9 from space." I do not know why he even had one Oscar, he had to get a million raspberries, just like the audience who either left or did not appear at all. The hospital was a first-class financial failure, but I’m sure that the elite classes of left winged intellectuals complained that the American public was too plebeian to appreciate the bite of social commentary when they saw it, and incl. George Scott, in one of the most unsophisticated and embarrassing roles, together with the aging sex symbol Diana Rigg, spend most of the film trying to curse in a more and more brutal way, moving along a silly plot. Poor old George is impotent, and he is simply depressed by this event, but after having had many dirty words between him and Rigg, he will rape her several times on a beautiful night in the dirty, crumbling hospital in New York, which looks so disgusting that I don’t I want a dying pet rat treated in it. There is also some blasphemous rubbish dialogue, thrown in different directions, with a lot of expletives. It ends with the image of the erroneous notion that unusual stress without physical exertion always leads to cardiac arrest. You never want to see another minute of this terrible movie.
