Before I start, let me have something from my chest: I'm a big fan of John Airs' first film PROJECT: SHADOWCHASER. The film, the B-rank cross as TERMINATOR & DIE HARD, may not be a work of cinematic genius, but an extremely fascinating action movie that has become a cult hit (and which produced two sequels and an exit from the game). br /> <br /> A judge and jury start with Joseph Meeker, a convicted murderer, who was sent to the Death row after being captured after the so-called “Bloody Shootout” (which seems like a bad name for murder?) kills three people chained to an electric chair. There is a funny scene where Miker talks to a priest about living for sex, but meets his only true love (which was killed during a shootout), expressing his revenge for a man who killed? ?? Michael Silvano, an avid soccer player who spends his days watching his son Alex play football with his school team (and eventually chases his son's coach). But after the execution, Miker returns as a rematch (or as Kelly Perin calls “a hamburger without fries”), whose sole purpose is to take revenge, which basically means making Silvano’s life miserable. <br /> <br /> Let me point out that the Judge and the Jury is not a real horror film. This is a supernatural fighter in which Miker chases Silvano, using his ability to change shape (which is equivalent to David Keith changing into anything from a copycat Elvis, a French chef (with the same bad accent as a mustache), transvestite clown and a comedian), a shotgun that shoots explosive shells and invulnerability to death (although this does not prevent Martin Kov from shooting Keith with the help of the Desert Eagle) to pay Silvano for the murder of Meeker's wife. <br /> Directed by John Eyres does not seem interested in the characteristics, but focuses solely on action films, which are enough in the film. But this is the main drawback of the film, since there is nothing to tie the scenes together. The acting is surprisingly good: Keith demonstrates better performance, with the support of Cove, as well as Paul Coslo, who plays a well-washed police officer. Kelly Perin is annoying as a taxi driver who tries to help, but worsens the situation.
