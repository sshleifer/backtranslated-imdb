Well, how can someone think that this film is awesome, so for me ... I can not even understand how someone can find this film funny, the only character he seeks is an evil super game designer nerd and it gets old after a while. This film is so predictable, the highlights are not funny, they are forced, you see that it is better to play around the red-light district, and the story sucks, it is so predictable that you know exactly what will happen. Even the characters don't react as they should, try to go to the hot chick, who is your boss at work, and tell her that you are fucking the two crazy chicks you live with at the same time, her answer will not be (smiles) “Okay, let's back to work. " I never laughed during this movie, and I wish I had ever seen it or spent $ 3 to rent it, because it wasn’t even worth it. Adam Sandler produced this film, I lost all respect for him. All his films are the same, his comedic style is outdated since Waterboy came out, if I knew that Adam Sandler had produced it before I rented it ... I would have never spent time on it. This film is as bad as possible from all aspects ... Ace Ventura was not a smart comedy film, it didn’t have a murderous plot ... but it was original and funny. I do not confuse the film because he has a low humor, I knock him down because he sucks, this is a piece of Hollywood crap. If this film was presented to a production company and there is no “ADAM SANDLER” behind it, it will be thrown into the trash faster than the used condom. If you want a good pottery film, check out Cheech and Chong or Whitecastle. If you rent this movie, all you get is a regular comedy, designed for children of 14-17 years old, with loud rock music at every possible point, actions that will make your eyes squeeze and your stomach will turn, and comedy which is equivalent to watching a petrified friend eat McDonald’s for an hour and a half. Do not do this ... for the love of God ... this film sucks, treat it as it is, and look through all the Hollywood glory behind it ... Hercules in New York used to be the worst movie I ever -he seen, but in fact it is so bad, it is good. Instead, it was a very expensive film that sucked just as much, if not more.
