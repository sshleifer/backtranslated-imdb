This film is a very bad example of boring storytelling, which is trying to hide behind the facade of a “feature film”, trying to shock the audience with unmotivated violence (against women) to hide the lack of psychological depth of characters and internal conflicts. Everything in this film is pretentious, from gratitude to Bele Tarr at the beginning to photography, acting, music, history and editing. When suddenly, for no reason, you have to watch close-ups of “charismatic” Hungarian villagers in your boats, while the soundtrack is trying to convince you that this should be a dramatic moment, although they are only on the way to the funeral of a local alcoholic, this is one thing. Putting totally unmotivated scenes of rape as a shocker is another thing, which I don’t understand at all. This film struggles to enter a certain genre of artistic (Eastern European drama) films, but it lacks the subtlety, observational skills and the “soul” that other directors have.
