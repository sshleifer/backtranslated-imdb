This is the situation with the new clothes of the Emperor. Someone should say: “This is not a funny and original film (and so on. D. And so on. P.); This is a low quality film. Don't waste your money on this. ” The film is trashy, and the people in it are embarrassingly inferior to the trailer trash. They are too realistic only for themselves. They have no lines, they do not act. The American dream is not to create low-quality low-quality films or something else low-quality and low-quality; it is the achievement of something qualitative and, therefore, success. Only people who are desperately trying to praise any film that was not shot in Hollywood (it could not be shot in Hollywood, could it?) Tried to give this film any quality. This is worse than Ed Woods, another film about a director without standards. These films should not have been made, and you should not watch “American Cinema.”
