I remember this movie with a feeling of pure. agony. More than half of the film - commercials (no, really!). A little excuse for a story could be easily told in 25 minutes (and almost like that!). The end result is a team love story of the predictable Schlock, clearly united in an insane commercial attempt to wrest a few more dollars from the modern Hit Debbie Boone. Yes, that's how quickly it was produced ... a song that "inspired", it was still big on the charts when the movie was released! <br /> <br /> Despite decades of watching bad movies, this still impresses me with its extravagant, impetuous, rapid jump into the most boring, ridiculous and indelible cinematic anger. He really deserves to be on the list of the 100 worst for all time IMDb, and never left the top 3 on my personal “worst” list. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this masochistic thrill!
