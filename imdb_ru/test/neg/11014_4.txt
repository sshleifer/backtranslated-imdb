This is another one of those films that I can remember when I was a kid, and I recently managed to purchase it on eBay - 20 years later, it is not as good as I remember anywhere. <br /> <br /> The story “vague” strike was launched by a “cosmic event” (as an “underdeveloped plot” there is another additional member of the film crew), which causes collective ants to become super-intelligent. Types of ants that had previously fought with each other, stopped rivalry and now work together. What I wanted to know for the whole time was: WHAT exactly to do? You will never know what they want. Nigel Davenport and his companion are sent to the desert, where there is a strange activity of ants, and begin to study ants from an inaccessible needle-shaped laboratory. Probably the most frightening scene, in my opinion, was when two scientists visited a giant square in crops (for example, a square crop circle) as a result of the ants running away. <br /> <br /> This film was not very scary, simply because you do not know whether to be afraid of ants or to love them. All you know is that the ants want people to leave this area so that they can continue their jokes - but you won’t know if they really are villains. This is not fiction, because the explanation of the "cosmic event" is too vague to properly take into account. This is deffo more chiller. Flashes, crazy hairstyles, narrow shirts with large collars and unnaturally large facial hair Nigel Davenport - scared me more than the ants! Have you noticed that there are only six actors in the credits? Yes, it is true - SIX, and you will not see other people in this film at all. Even on distance! This is clearly a budget film that is a little watchable, because you probably have not seen one. I can't think of anything. The shooting of the ants is pretty good; they must have made the months and months of shooting before they had the shots they had to put in the film. You can say to yourself: “How the hell do they make ants do this?” Again and again, but it's pretty simple. You will also notice that the filmmakers donated millions of innocent ants to make a film, so the rights of animals look REMAIN! Good for the cost of new items, but you can not watch it more than once.
