It's very sad to see someone like George Scott in a low-budget thriller, which would be better if the original novel was written by Graham Green and the director of someone more experienced in the genre. DO NOT INTEND A BETTER CINEMATOGRAPHY. There are so many missed opportunities when the scenery and the carnival are simply embellished and not captured in order to find the film in the exotic setting of the novel. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere in the viewer's comments on this site, one very astute observer complained about the variety of devilishly bad accents in this film. Since I saw George Scott in the role of Rochester in the movie “Jane Eyre”, I have prayed for him that NEVER accept the role that required a British accent. From time to time he could simply pass for a British or very British with a South African sound, played, obviously, by an American actor. I can absorb the extraordinarily difficult accents of Meryl Streep (both British and Australian) - at least she understands this correctly, although with every statement she demands that we admire her skill. Well, I regret that Mr. Scott is not Meryl Streep, and he simply destroys the illusion - just as Michelle Yeo speaks a torturous mandarin with a strong Singaporean accent in “The Stalking Tiger” etc. <br /> <br /> Peterson acts in no other way than what we see on CSI. Except that he is still very handsome and more or less slender in this film. He is Harrison Ford TV. The same old expressions for every emotion, every situation. No, if you think Ford has two - bewilderment / pain and happiness. I have never seen a smile on Mr. CSI!
