I can accept the fact that it was the NEXT karate kid, so Ralph Macchio can be safely removed from the series, and although Hillary Swank is great for the role .... the plot of the film is terrible. <br /> <br /> Mr. An old friend of Miyagi from World War II dies, leaving his widow to take care of her rebellious granddaughter when her parents die in an accident. The girl has no discipline, but she is a hero, because the local ROTC ... which I will explain in a minute will find her to get her. You know the training ... Miyagi takes her under his wing, and in the end they beat the bad guys, and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> His deception, his stupidity, is the 90s .... but it is not even long and short. My first case is "eh?" Why is there a “military unit” in high school? I thought that such things appeared in the 1960s, especially in a public school. As much as Michael Ironside kicks loot in his role as the main heel, since when have the military been involved in high school? My next complaint is that during the prom, bungee fighters jump to scare people ... why? What I noticed in all 4 films was at the very end, heels suddenly turn their faces after all the stupidity they make the main character (Billy in part 1, Sato in part 2, Chris in part 3). This film is no different. After Ned and his friends sabotage the senior prom, they blow up Erik's car and threaten Hillary Swank with the whole movie ... Ironside tells them to beat her, and they like "hmm ... no" if you are going to make pathetic turns of the face, at least least, make sure the characters didn't do too much, for example, they blew up a hot rod. <br /> <br /> Regarding the rest of the love plot between Eric and Hillary Swank. ... trite, but nothing melodramatic, which is a breath of fresh air from the garbage that Ralph Macchio pulled out in the first 3 films. <br /> <br /> I will say for my own movie, after watching the first 3 films, I can accept the fact that it more or less split ... but I cannot accept the whole military thing that is too unusual to taken seriously. Now, if Ironside and his team were a wrestling / football team, and he was a coach, THIS would be more likely. <br /> <br /> Ironside and Morita delivered the goods, Swank is fine ... everything else is the same however, one highlight is that when they blow up a hot rod, THAT was cool 4 out of 10
