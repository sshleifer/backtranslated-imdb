I went to this movie full of hope. With so many capable and humorous actors, led by Sir Ben, I thought it would be a little pleasure. <br /> <br /> Oh, how I felt, as if knocking out my eyes when the credits roll. That I spent 93 minutes of my life on this film, which clearly was DOA. There are some real problems with this film, and it will probably be easier to list them; 1. No jokes, it is not particularly difficult for me to please comedies - high or low - but in this film there is really no laughter. <br /> <br /> 2. Sir Ben muttered every line, should he be drunk or not?!? 3. There is no effort to start, let alone develop a relationship between love interests in this. 2 people, accidentally bumping into each other on the street, instantly found mutual understanding. <br /> <br /> 4. All the acting talent that has been assembled is completely wasted. Don't be fooled by the names. <br /> <br /> 5. For an assassin with a cold ass, he erased more people in Gandhi than this sluggish waste of time (by the way, painted beards look very creepy) Any life - and justice - in this Frank pulls out his 9 and removes the whole cast, starting with Tea and ending with myself - sorry, it was so bad.
