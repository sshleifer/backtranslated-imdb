This film was released shortly after the ex-wife of Sylvester Stalloness Bridget Nilsen played in the films about Conan, the woman of Conan, “Red Sonya”. Unfortunately, she is not a very good actress, as shown by Rocky IV and Cobra. The whole film seems cheap, but, oddly enough, Arnold Swarzenegger appears in this film, but not like Conan, although he looks, behaves and fights like Conan from two films about Conan, I don't know what this is about. In any case, it appears only every twenty minutes and does not stick out for a long time. Maybe Arnold filmed this in his free time from filming Conan the Destroyer or something? In any case, the film is too slow and boring for an action movie, skip it and see Conan the Barbarian instead.
