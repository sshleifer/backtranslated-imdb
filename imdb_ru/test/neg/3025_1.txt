Lord <br /> <br /> I have to say right away that I watched only 20 minutes of this film. Since I am a fan of Eraserhead, "what, you can not watch a strange black and white film with a dialogue" almost none "?" protection does not apply. I just can not watch HORRIBLE strange black-and-white films with a "almost no" dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film is what happens when you give a restless gothic child without talent and nothing to say the camera and budget, and let him / her put as many meaningless insulting images as possible on the screen. From the very beginning it was clear that this film should have lasted 5 minutes (provided that it should exist at all). The frames, which should last a few seconds, are delayed for several minutes, because the director has the syndrome “I just love the love of the sound of my own voice” and refuses to switch to another frame until all the footage has been shot. was viewed. From the moment the masked girl began to masturbate the corpse of “God” (the first scene of the film! Joy!), I knew that it was just a matter of time until I turned off the tape. At least 10 minutes after the gang of secretly hidden men were wrapped, another body was shaking on a rope, I realized that it was time to surrender. Rarely do I refuse a movie. I sat through the whole Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows, though not happily. It did not deserve the 20 minutes I gave. <br /> <br /> If you're an Eraserhead fan, DO NOT let simple comparisons with this movie convince you to rent this piece of amateur garbage. Let me refer you to Tetsuo: The Iron Man, for a watchable and pleasant piece of incoherent black and white oddity.
