The return to the Sender convicted is almost imperfect. The only good thing about this movie was that I never got bored. However, reviews that assess this film as a low-budget success may not have watched the same film that I saw. <br /> <br /> Instead of writing a review and telling what is happening, what is working and what is not. does not work, I just comment that nothing works. In this film there are holes in the plot through which you can drive the semi-final. The acting role in the film is not very good, although it may be the result of a script so poorly formulated that it could be a ghost written by George Lucas. For this particular film there was no need for exceptional sets or costumes, and everything seemed appropriate. Did I mention there were some holes in the plot? By the end of the film, you wonder how a blind man can shoot a gun so well, why Kelly Preston trusts Aidan Quinn, why she falls asleep the night before her client has to be killed, how Aidan Quinn can drive 400 miles in such a short time by car which breaks all the time during the rest of the film, why Aidan Quinn did not yield one-fifth, instead of biting, etc. <br /> <br /> C Despite all this, this is definitely B- film, and terrible. Unfortunately, it is not bad enough to be good. If you value your time, please let it serve as a public service message to stay away from it.
