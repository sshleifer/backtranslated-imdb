Project Vampire is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The wooden game, the flimsy effects and the terrible storyline - this is a movie that you do not even want to watch. PV is one of those films that don't even have the good to be in a bad pleasant way; instead, this bile seems to be trying to make itself as offensively boring, stupid and stupid as humanly possible. <br /> <br /> Vampire created a serum, which he sells to older people as a life stimulant, and those who take it fall under his control. A former lab trainee teams up with a nurse to try and stop him. Someone had to stop the creators of this trash. <br /> <br /> No one has any reason to watch this movie, and Iâ€™m really shocked by the human race on the grounds that at the time of this writing, 2 people gave this atrocity 10 out of 10.
