This short film does not get there. A clich√© and not a very funny attempt at dark humor. Humor is not so funny to interest you, and the main character is not cute, so you do not care what happens. The manufacturer has spent some money on this flop, and this is reflected in the cost of production, which is the only saving benefit.
