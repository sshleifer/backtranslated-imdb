Oh, why is this over? The last film by Laurel and Hardy, from the rough-twisted theme of "The Cuckoo" (with erroneous thanks to Hal Roach) to the final "Good Mess" / "I Could Not Do It," is a duet like a grotesque parody of myself, among them their relationship is now built solely from uncertain action, stupid dialogue and indecisive farce. People choose the king of New York, but Chaplin’s last margin was not as unworthy as this one. <br /> <br /> What really hurts someone who loves Laurel and Hardy is the appearance of two comedians. The cover of the video I hold shows them at their best, all boyish smiles and glowing skin, with a spot on the back that says: “The photo on this sleeve is intended for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the content of the film. “Necessarily? It doesn't even come close. The actual film sees them at least fifteen years older than the photos that adorn the sleeves, with Olli painfully overweight. It's not funny and not funny as usual, but it looks bad and on the verge of obesity. He would have been dead seven years after this film was made, after a series of blows. Meanwhile, Stan, suffering from prostate problems and dysentery, looks disgusting because his weight has plummeted. Every time with something bad happens to him, for example, when you are jammed You’re scared for his life between the lifeboat and the table. Even Ollie, who gave him the traditional slap in the face, makes you afraid that he could be killed. It will last fifteen years after the film ends, ending up in 1965 after a heart attack. It is sad that such cherished performers are aging and dying painful deaths, and it is sad to see their deterioration both on health and at work, on the screen. When I, and I’m sure almost everyone else, likes to think about Laurel and Hardy, I think of Way Out West, the bodies involved, or our relationship. Seeing them in such poor physical condition and doing difficult routines at the very end of their careers is a decline in my happy memories of them. <br /> <br /> Warning signs are visible directly from the introductory titles, which are listed not only four writers, but also someone who came up with the concept, and a credit for "jokes." So, if Monty Collins wrote “gags,” what did the other four write? And in that case, why did Monty Collins pay a fee, given that there was not a single “gag” in the film? More than 40% of the film is spent on a trip to the island of the same name, during which we experience some of the most painfully unfriendly scenes boys have ever participated in. When I saw the scene with the bats, I wanted to curl up and die, so great was his childish inability. And yet, that kills the stone of the film dead is that all the supporting actors are duplicated and cannot speak English. This not only makes the film incoherent, but also drains Stan and Ollie’s reaction to their colleagues. Directed by horrible movies and absolutely horrible montage, this is completely contrary to rumors of the 2 million dollars spent on it. Honestly, it looks terrible, and although the release of the DVD can clear the picture, the quality of the sound and image is significantly inferior to any of their Hal Roach's work. <br /> <br /> “Friends” Wall and Ollie, Giovani and Antoine are charismatic nerves that stand out from the outdated repertoire of Laurel and Hardy. This is another serious problem with the film, since none of the minor characters are funny or connected with the innocent mentality of boys. The duplicated sharpness shown by L & H (“you are fat”) sets them apart as separate social losers, and not as likeable subanarchists. There is evidence of some darker political satire - although this is not “Duck Soup”, but the concept of the island without rules is an interesting topic. Perhaps more relevant than ever, a film that deals with immigration issues and the American constitution is suddenly becoming most relevant in 2003. Unfortunately, however, outside of the funny scene where Stan is elected “by the people”, this is not so. go anywhere. And this somewhat black humor has its sharp edges - or is it a Laurel and Hardy film, where rape is directly implied, and Stan threatens a man with a bottle, just to accidentally pour someone in the face, do you think you have a good time? After all the years when Stan and Ollie are sharing a bed, we also get a certain reference when Stan accidentally kisses him - Ollie erases the kiss with disgust. It is also disturbing that a friend of Stan and the illegal immigrant Olli, Antoine, ends his life being eaten by a lion. Keep in mind, I never thought I would see the film Laurel and Hardy, where they were supposed to be hung. The need for an obsessive and unfunny storytelling is another indication of how confusing everything is when the American release (the same version available on video) cracked 16 minutes in a vain attempt to improve it. <br /> <br /> This film, created in a terrible way, ruthlessly unfunny, is almost completely unavailable for spying on Stan and Ollie's reputation - to avoid at all costs.
