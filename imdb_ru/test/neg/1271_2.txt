Luxurious scenery and luxurious costumes, well photographed by Theodore Sparkulem, and Jennings' good (not very) performance, since Henry cannot overcome poor writing and static camera work. Henny Porten is chewing the landscape like Ann. <br /> <br /> Everything is very beautiful; but it is all surface and without depth. The melodramatic tale of an unjust woman made her a hit in America, where in the same year (1920) the expressionist Cabinet of Dr. Caligari failed, proving that popularity is not something that suffers. Lyubich will be remembered for his live comedies, and not for such fruitless spectacles.
