The atmosphere in this show is great. There are many great builds, but this is where this show fails. There is a way to build a lot of gift. You will constantly see a terrible installation that makes you feel that something really strange is coming out of the corner, and then ... nothing. Again and again nothing. You hear a lot of stories about people talking about bizarre events, but you don’t see any. They appear at the door of these people, talk about their deep and emotional experiences, install lame equipment and find nothing! There is nothing in this show that makes me believe in something paranormal. I laugh every time they need to manifest a “terrible spirit,” about which we, as spectators, have seen nothing. They get rid of the spirit that never existed, and everything folds into a neat little bag. A show that looked so weird and had so much potential leads to one thing ... Nothing!
