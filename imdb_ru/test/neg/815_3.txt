It’s hard to imagine what they thought about when they made this film (that is, scriptwriters, directors, producers, actors, editors, etc.). Christopher Plummer, a veteran of 129 films, frolics among many other actors, obviously not motivating more than collecting salaries. I suppose there is nothing bad in it, but as soon as they get paid, it does not mean that someone should watch them. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that there are actually good reviews of this film here on imdb. Art? If you want to see art, go to the art gallery, do not watch this film. Comedy? Watch the Flintstown re-run about the same story with less time. <br /> <br /> Dabni Coleman, however, shows off her usual game. And some of the young actors may have gotten some good experience from making this film. But Plummer was embarrassed to watch his performance, in fact, I was delighted with him throughout the film, knowing that it was the glory of the Sound of Music! I can see from his biography that he called “The Sound of Music” “the sound of mucus,” so I think he did not like it as much as the hundreds of millions who liked it. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, today he was asked how you assess the sound of music compared to where the heart is, what will it say .....? <br /> <br /> Perhaps something like "where's the money" ....
