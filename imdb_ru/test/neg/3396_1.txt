This is my opinion on this film, expressed in his dialogues. <br /> <br /> To be more serious, I cannot say that this film is a bad moment, but I didn’t like it either. <br /> <br /> First, I was simply indifferent and could not penetrate into the world of monkeys. Although the makeup is very realistic, the constant shouts were annoying. Let the film change monkeys for cats, and for me this is a cult film due to my love for the latter. <br /> <br /> The second part is more interesting, with talent and the freshness of newbies (McDowell Lambert), but I felt alienated: the whole story is in a big British mansion: no matter how luxurious it was, it was like a prison me. <br /> <br /> Finally, can it be a good adaptation of the story of Tarzan Burroughs? I don’t know, never reading a book (or not seeing Disney): <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I don’t have good moments to remember, so one viewing is enough for me. <br /> <br /> I had to guess my boredom after an endless freeze called “Overture” at the beginning ... What is the point? Only the director knows this.
