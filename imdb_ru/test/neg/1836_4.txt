Medical student Paula Henning wins a place at an exclusive Heidelberg Medical School. When the body of a young man she met on the train appears on the autopsy table, she begins to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death, and discovers a horrible plot committed by an antihypocratic secret society operating in school. Anxious and rude, a lot of scary parts. He even has a good script and ending. But this one has a poor part. What else can you see from this movie? This is a good mystery movie and horror. But, of course, if you like it, go buy it. If you do not do this, there is still no reason to spend your money on it. <br /> <br /> Rated R for extreme graphic abuse, sexual situations and profanity.
