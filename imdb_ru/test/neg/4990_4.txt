They did it again: tore off the name of the old show, then destroyed nostalgia with boring "rethought" things. The 60s cartoon was one of the funniest comics in its time, a good-natured satire about superheroes. The character was drawn as half way between an animal and a person, like Mickey Mouse. Here they use a real beagle; This is about the same as making a Mickey Mouse watch with a real rat. <br /> <br /> Most of the crafty jokes that made the original show funny are missing from this movie. Instead, we get a clumsy former police dog that is even dumber than Cad. And some pet owners who add nothing to the story. Crappy effects (dog animation confuses). Bad script. Stereotypical dwarf playing Simon Bar Sinister. The guy with the loud noise they hired to voice the Underdog is painful. You might think that they at least got a voice impressionist to get close to the humorically distinctive voice of Wally Cox for Underdog. But no. There are at least a few gentle references to the source material (for example, rhymed lines) that raise it to 4. <br /> <br /> Only small children who love dogs can enjoy it. All others should receive a DVD with the original cartoon series. Watch it only in desperation.
