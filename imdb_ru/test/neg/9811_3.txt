Slaughter Trail is a B-Western with some big claims. But it went down in Hollywood history for the most shameful reason. <br /> <br /> Watching this film with its musical score, which can only be described as domineering, I feel that Howard Hughes is trying to do this to type a singing cowboy for RKO films. They already had Tim Holt, who was the same reliable hero of a cowboy who was ever, but he was not a singer. I think Hughes saw how much money Herbert Yates raked up with Roy Rogers in the Republic, and decided that he too would receive them. <br /> <br /> So Terry Gilkison is a very good singer and a much better song. The writer was recruited and sang some of his material, which was neither the best nor the worst, and looked as if they were included in the picture. But even worse, there is this annoying chorus, which sang a lot of history and frankly stunned actors, extras, even horses. Needless to say, Terry was never a singing cowboy. But he wrote such classic works as “Bare needs” and Dean Martin’s magnificent hit “Memories are made from this.” <br /> <br /> The plot concerns a woman inside, robbing a stagecoach jewel. That's right, criminals, such as Gig Young, Miron Healy and Ken Koutnik, put Virginia Gray on the bus as a passenger, which, as they learned, carry some valuable jewels. <br /> <br /> Gray and Young do a great job. Young takes her away from the coach, apparently to a fate worse than death, and they do act out the scene within the reach of the passengers, but he does her trick. The last place where the authorities could take a look, if she does not run away with him. <br /> <br /> But when they run from a robbery, it's on tired horses, so they stop in the cockpit to take a few interchangeable horses and shoot three Navajo who object It puts the Navajo back on the warpath, it did not help One of the victims was the brother of chieftain Rick Roman. <br /> <br /> This situation is faced by Captain Brian Donlevi in ​​the fort, when the coach and the criminals arrive there for protection. The way it all works is predictable, but a tasteless way of overproduction. <br /> <br /> This is actually the problem of the Slaughter Trail. It is a simple, no-nonsense western that has become almost grotesque. <br /> <br /> But the real reason Slaughter Trail went down in history is that this film seems to mark the official beginning of the blacklist. Initially, Howard Da Silva was supposed to play the role of Donlevi and may have actually completed his scenes when Howard Hughes officially fired him for his communist sympathies. His scenes were completely retaken with Brian Donlev at the head. <br /> <br /> Given the fiasco of this film, I’m not sure whether Donlevi or DaSilva should thank Hughes or kick him in his private sanctuary.
