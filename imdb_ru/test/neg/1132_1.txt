Who gave these people the money to make the film? There was nothing funny about it. The fact that the farting dog was the funniest thing in this part of the disease is all about it. First of all, it has nothing to do with Christmas, it just took the name and counted on all those people who liked the original Chevy Chase. They took Randy "I have no talent, I'm just a fat and sweaty pig" Quaid (the only thing wrong in part 1) and made a "film" about him ... In his family there are only morons, but not "Are they cute, kind of idiotic, but don't touch me like idiotic. Watching this pile of dirt will help you to hope that everyone who participates in it is Dying! They didnâ€™t even bother to tidy up the effects ... when they are on the boat, the only thing that moves is a fake background ... when the pig is in the water in the water, you can tell from the lighting that it is in the studio. This film was sexist (Uncle Nick), racist (Uncle Nick), and it should never have been done ... never ... throwing money into a volcano would be much more useful. <br /> <br /> Well, I hope that I have reached some of you ... Nobody warned me, and now I have suffered all my life from happiness.
