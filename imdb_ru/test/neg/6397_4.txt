In general, do not expect much, and you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And if you want to watch a movie that brings you back to 1983, it surely will. The only reason I gave this film 2 points more than it deserves is for two reasons: <br /> <br /> # 1. Michael Kane. # 2. people, sights. Brazilian culture and music <br /> <br /> Kane is almost completely removed from the film when he tackles the seemingly impossible task of turning it into a viable and semi-believable story. Even Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper fail. <br /> <br /> Michael Kane, as always, is a pure class. In addition to being a gifted classic and comic actor, Kane brings a mixture of introspection, mischief and sensitivity to every film he makes ... at the center of his charm still in his role in Alfie ... and why he won the Oscar for Hanna and her sisters 2 years later. In this farce, he gently seduces ... funny and vulnerable ... melancholic and sentimental .... and besides the jewel, which is Rio de Janeiro, the ONLY reason not to look for the best form of entertainment. <Br /> <br /> Well ... maybe a glimpse of Johnson and Demi Moore might take a look at two beautiful young actresses. But look - this is all you can do in Michelle (although her look seems to be extremely outdated) ... there could be no more painful experience in the cinema than to watch how she “tries” to act (most of her dialogue also seems to be overwritten) . Demi's acting is 100 times better, and you can easily transfer it as it is to any movie today (honestly, it doesn’t look very different). Miss Moore is certainly undervalued, especially considering that she was the biggest star of the two. <br /> <br /> Except for the fact that this is a stupid farce, in the end, I really like the maturity with which all these people deal with this scandalous situation ... that it does not end friendships or marriages, and that the business, even with the minor daughter of your best friend, can be forgiven, and everyone can move on. The injured parties are really angry and frustrated about what happened, but everything works for the better ... a little unrealistically accurate, but surprisingly refreshing. There is always hope.
