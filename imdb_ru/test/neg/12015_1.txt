“Problem child 2” was a waste of my time. The original film was not very good, but it is classic compared to this film. The first film went out of order with his scenes of the devilish child destroying the main chaos in the life of everyone he surrounds. Here, it goes even further beyond. And one scene in this film confirms this theory. This sequence of carnival trips was too big for me to survive. It's horrible. This film should not have been shot. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
