Ok, now I know where all those boring police / murder shows came from. I believe that they can be traced to this movie. "Scene of the crime" is more like a TV series or series. Complete with full-time characters and situations - a desperate cop who encounters his superiors ... an aging cop who doesn't want to work at the table, despite bad eyesight ... a reckless recruit ... a double lady, etc. <br /> <br /> I like many of the actors here, and they do a good job with their work, but in general this film seemed boring to me, since I'm not a fan of the genre. I continued to tune in when they discussed the matter ... something about bookmakers and informants. And oh, yes, there was a stripper who was played by the previously useful Gloria DeHavev. What I want to know is: why did she keep calling Van Johnson "Uncle Wiggley"? Wasn't Uncle Wiggley a rabbit? The character from the children's book? What does this have to do with anything? I guess I just don't understand the cool guy. The film Noir is a kind of jargon. <br /> <br /> In fact, most of the dialogue made me mumble: “Nobody says that!” However, I could mention one scene where the policeman’s wife (Arlene Dahl), who is worried every time when she goes to work, she realizes that perhaps she should not have made her husband the center of her life. Yes, I know this feeling of loving someone so much, being so dependent on him that there is a constant fear for his safety. So there are moments of truth in this film, under a stylized dialogue and atmosphere that is so self-consciously trying to be tough and REAL that it actually seems unreal to me. <br /> <br /> A little backstory: this film was made when Dore Shary received MGM from Louis B. Meier and began to do away with useful musicals that made MGM so great. Dore Shary was determined to bring more “realism” to the movies. I hate Dore Shari. Maybe we can blame him for all the pretentious, gloomy films that are being shot today, wallowing in ugly “truths” about life, focusing on (and, in my opinion, helping to perpetuate) the worst of humanity, not the best. It no longer inspires us to create classic films — providing the necessary distractions during the Great Depression and World War II. <br /> <br /> Well, damn it, we still need such a distraction today! There is still a lot of depression and a lot of war. And what do people turn to these days when they want to run away? Dirty, mind-blowing reality of TV. Thank you very much, Dore!
