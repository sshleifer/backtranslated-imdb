This film was unfortunately terrible. <br /> <br /> Cliche, battered, unnatural dialogues and acting make it almost imperceptible. <br /> <br /> A well-being ending ridiculous sucks <br /> There is a reason why Reinholdâ€™s career has disappeared. <br /> <br /> If you do not live in New York and are not Jewish, some jokes will be incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> I also found it offensive that the unrecognized lesbian goes straight to the end. <br /> <br /> I just can't understand how this film was so popular at festivals. <br /> <br /> This is without a doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen.
