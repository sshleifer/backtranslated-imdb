no matter what someone says, this is a b-movie, and the effects are badly made .. if you are a vampire fan, I think everything will be fine, and not 10 out of 10, you, others here, cannot sincerely to tell? we should consider it as a film, not read as a book, so the effects and characters are important, as well as the story. The story is good, but the film does not carry, it is not surprising that he has a low rating. I am writing this because I decided to watch this movie when I saw good IMDb reviews, but I was very disappointed. don't get me wrong, I thought the blade films were awesome, and I liked the movies about the underworld, but these characters are not close. makeup on vampires is bad and the consequences are worse. it sucks I would not be so disappointed if I had not read the reviews here, which would say how great it is. The reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something else, seriously, if you think it's cool, you donâ€™t care about acting or makeup. it's better like a book. 3 out of 10 for a good story ..
