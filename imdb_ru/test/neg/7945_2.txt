Los Angeles, 1976. John Carpenter, the drummer of the independent cinema, who has just left the film school and with one film - a budgetless travesty of his 2001 school project called “The Dark Star” - completes the cruel act called “Attack on the plot 13” under his belt . The story from an almost abandoned police station under siege by an unseen gang from Los Angeles was a minor blow to the entry chain and received a small amount of praise from a few critics who cared, but it barely set the movie world on fire, unlike the followers of Carpenter. Defeat of Halloween (1978). At Precinct, Carpenter was still learning how to use his almost non-existent budget, using low-level actors, transferring the action to one hellish little place and moving the film at a narrow pace using a combination of editing and a smart camera. genre savvy in the work and in the on state. <br /> <br /> No one else wants or needs hunger in Hollywood, especially if the weekly food bill in the Assault On Precinct 13 version of 2005 exceeds the total cost of the original. This really leads to a certain laziness on the part of the director - you have a stupidly large trade union team, a studio and a marketing firm who all think for you. That's why, twenty years after watching the Carpenter film, I can still see every great moment: from a little girl, shot in cold blood when buying ice cream, to ruthless shelling in a synthesizer. A week after “The Attack 2005”, I remember the still eyes of Larry Fishburn and a bit of another. <br /> <br /> “Unforgettable popcorn” fits perfectly into the top of the poster. This is New Year's Eve at the 13th station, the station is closing due to the skeleton of the staff to see it in the last hours. On the call, Jake Renick (Ethan Hawke), a former drug addict, who is now deeply concerned and jumped from Jack Daniels and Seconal after his partners froze in the opening; Iris (“Sopreia” Drea de Matteo), a nymphomaniac with things for criminal types, and Jasper (Brian Dennehy), a solid old timer just one step from retirement. As in “Carpenter's Assault ...”, the bus with four heavy criminals was redirected to the station. All the fussy eyes look at the thief in law gangster Bishop (Fishburn, still burdened with his time in the Matrix), who barely survived the assassination attempt by the undercover policeman and plans to destroy the local corruption in the organized crime division led by Markus Duval (tired Gabriel Byrne) Soon the phones were turned off, the power lines were turned off, and the criminals and the police were heavily armed with a serious police arsenal and paranoid when they were fighting a war against the operational group. s corrupt police Duval, dressed in white balaclavas, bulletproof vests, infrared red bazookas and more high-tech equipment than Skywalker Ranch. We have to believe it, because the helicopters, buzzing around the top of the police station, firing rockets at the windows, are a clandestine operation covering the tracks of Duvall. With the same success, he could shoot billboards on Hollywood Boulevard. <br /> <br /> As in the recent seventies genre, reworking Dawn of the Dead, in Assault 2005, the main plot fundamentals of the original by John Carpenter are used and, according to the seventies, “man does his job”. The main question is why? 1976 John Carpenter is a cult favorite among fans of the genre, but is unlikely to be firm in the public mind. Carpenter himself was busy reworking Howard Hawks's classic western Rio Bravo into a tough, claustrophobic urban thriller for just $ 20,000. French film prodigy and rap producer Jean-François Richet, a dedicated fan of John Carpenter, seem less concerned about paying homage to the Hawks or JC - although the script is replete with references to cowboys and obedience - and seems intent on cramming as many flashes and firepower as a multimillion budget can withstand. The result: some tense moments with hand-held POV cameras, an unexpectedly high (and bloody) body count, some neat plot twists, but, in fact, a class B city fighter with a heavily inflated price tag. As for the name check, Carpenter, this is pure vanity on the part of the directors, which does not pay off. <br /> <br /> Monsieur Riesch, I say “happy journey” and wish you good luck in your musical career.
