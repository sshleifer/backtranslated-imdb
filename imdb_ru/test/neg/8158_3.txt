I expected to see the film in a more exploitative style, but, unfortunately, it turned out to be just a poorly done low-budget action, which simply has no talent for it. The story of a very beautiful woman named Teri Marshall (Heather Thomas), her boyfriend Rick (Jeffrey Combs) working in a secret agency, he invented a motorcycle that is bulletproof and can shoot lasers and rockets, and has a helmet that can shoot lasers too. The head of the Bosarian agency (Martin Landau) made a $ 5 million deal to sell it, and sent two hired thugs to kill Rick and Teri and pick up the bike. A tall blond thug named Rolf (Dar Robinson) and his partner Hannah (Dawn Wild Blacksmith) manage to kill Rick, but Teri survives. While at home, she discovers the videotape Rick had left telling about his invention, which helps Teri know what to do next. <br /> <br /> ***** WARNING ABOUT SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Teri is harassed by several agents and is caught and tortured, but she doesn’t tell where she’s needed a piece of motorcycle, but she gets help from a federal agent named Waters (Martina Beswick), where they end up using a motorcycle. for a bloody shootout. <br /> <br /> This film was made by Fred Olen Ray, who made his career making films about an ultra-low budget, but he made a terrible mistake here, not paying attention to the aspect of exploitation. and trying to make an action movie. With the exception of the quick showering scene at the beginning, there is no nude, and the usual sight that viewers used to see in Ray’s film is not where to find it. I do not think that someone expected that Thomas would become naked, but she does not wear a single sexual outfit. Not that it stopped me from staring at her in these tight jeans and admiring her almost perfect shape, but Ray really messed it up in this case. As in all of his films, the cast is interesting to watch, and many familiar faces have roles such as Robert Quarry, Hans Hall, Troy Donahue, Tim Conway Jr., Michael Reagan and Rass Tamblyn. Stuntman Dar Robinson died shortly after this was done, and this is his last acting effort, and the film is dedicated to him. You have to wonder why Landau is wasting his time on such junk as this, but it was interesting for me to play Combs in a very rare romantic role. Is thomas good at this movie? What's the difference! I think she showed that she could become a popular star of the movie "B" if she wanted to, but this did not happen. Ray spends everyone’s time on this effort, although the cast is fun to watch, but he didn’t consider the elements that make him a pleasant director.
