This film is replete with sentimentality, unprofessional flight, which makes the pilot, like me, cringe, and inappropriate material. Why, for example, represent Rachel? She has nothing to do with the film, except to let her “Follow Me” truck go crazy and crash into Dorinda’s fence. This should be one of the stupid sequences among many in the film. The other - at the end, when the plane (was it B-26 or A-26? - both are used in the film) remains with twisted supports and without shoes. This, of course, serves the plot, but to reveal it would be a terrible spoiler. Anyway, the plane would start to steer without control. The finale (again, avoiding spoilers) involves too many conversations - as in the beginning of the sound films of the 30s with all these final speeches. Here, Dreyfuss just chats again and again. The final also includes other radical violations of the aviation protocol and a couple of unbelievable / impossible things that I will not describe. What a boring and incoherent effort!
