Tediously long dreary cinematic wafer. I could not believe how bad this film is. I watched it simply because of the many people who talked about this on this site. I watched the same movie? The whole episode is one-dimensional. Nothing of what happened in Harps’s past affected his (or anyone’s) future, and no one suffered from their past. I think what Socrates said about the plays, that if the scene can be removed from the play without any effect, then it should not be. Obviously, the director did not know this rule and therefore filled his “work” with one awful scene after another. Even the collision of the plane with the house was unexpected, unexpected, but unexpected! <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that at the time of this writing (December 1, 2002), although many People say that this is one of their favorite films, no one bothered to add a memorable quote. The reason is that they simply do not exist. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time watching this, instead look at the deformation of the board.
