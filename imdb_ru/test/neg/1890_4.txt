I did not understand what the selected title has to do with the film. This is another collection of monsters, like FRANKENSTEIN'S HOUSE. Not quite a master plot, but Universal needed to reap the benefits. <br /> <br /> Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens) is either very ambitious or too high in the ego department. He is working on a cure so that Larry Talbot doesnâ€™t become a Wolfman. Somehow, Count Dracula accidentally peeps over his vampirism. And the completion of the experiments of a good doctor is the restoration of the energy of the monster Frankenstein. Along the way, the blood of a kindhearted doctor is stained with the blood of Dracula. <br /> <br /> John Carradine plays Dracula again. This time he is more persuasive. Lon Cheney, Jr., as usual, soulful Wolfman. Glenn Strange - the monster of Frankenstein, who has very few opportunities for this walk. Also with notable roles are Lionel Atville and Martha O'Driscoll.
