Well, I was hoping that I had heard the wrong thing about this film, since I’m a big fan of Ruggero Deodato and really didn’t want him to fall; but, unfortunately, this supernatural load of nonsense in the style of Giallo is as bad as I could believe it would be - and it is pretty awful! The plot doesn't work at all, as the film tries to mix murder and the paranormal theme on the phone, and it all looks very forced and stupid. In addition, the plot does not make much sense, and you have to ask yourself "what is the point" many times throughout the film. The plot is devoted to a young woman living in an apartment building and terrorized by telephone. The best thing about the film is undoubtedly the presence of the beautiful English actress Charlotte Lewis, and, unfortunately, the good moments almost end there. There are several scenes of death, some of which are bloody; but all this is incredibly stupid, especially in this respect, the one who sees how someone is killed by coins stands out. Overall, I really can't recommend this to anyone; Fans who are not Deodato are unlikely to be impressed, and Deodato fans will probably find the film depressing. Avoid!
