Julia Andrews satirically pushes her own image of “naughty two” in this overproduced musical comedy-drama, but if she approaches her role with aplomb, she remains alone in this. Blake Edwards film about a woman who is also a music hall artist and a German spy during World War I, does not know what tone to strive for, and Rock Hudson has the ungrateful task of playing a romantic second violin. By 1970, musicals had ceased to be popular, and such elephant productions as "The Star!" and this film really tarnished Andrews reputation, leaving a lot of dead space in her catalog until the Tamarind Seed appeared. I always thought that Julie Andrews could be a great villain or a shadow lady; her strong voice can really get attention, and she hits a few low notes that can be either impressive or seductive. The husband / director Edwards seems to understand this, but neither he nor Julie can spend a lot of energy in this scenario. Screenwriter William Peter Blatti is not a good partner for Edwards, and not a single person has a heart in this material. Beatty’s script offers Andrews only one incredible sequence - striptease. * 1/2 of ****
