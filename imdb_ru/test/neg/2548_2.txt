I rented the Matrix, Revised with my friend. We both loved The Matrix, and we both like to make films, so we wanted to see what was going on behind the scenes of the Matrix. It turns out that The Matrix Revisited tells you almost nothing about the art of filmmaking or even how Matrix was created. In fact, this is a huge commercial for The Matrix, a film that The Matrix Revisited has already seen! <br /> <br /> If you really want to know about the process, the troubles, the stress and the details that went into creating the Matrix, look no further than the bonus features on the original Matrix DVD. There are things that they show in those documentaries that I didn’t even realize what had to be done or was done. The Matrix was so complex and complex that it deserves more respect than a “documentary,” as informative and interesting as the special MTV.
