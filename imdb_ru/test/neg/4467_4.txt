Being a longtime fan of Steve Martin, it was painful to see him in a film with such a stamped script. The writer must have just shot a few videos and shot a part here and there - she certainly was about the most extraordinary film that I saw in a long time - I knew exactly what would happen in every scene as soon as it began. African-American stereotypes and slave references are also quite offensive. But the worst thing for me was to see Martin in the film without a mind. He is probably one of the smartest actors, and here he is completely sold to a completely stupid script. He must be behind in his alimony to be in such an unsuccessful effort.
