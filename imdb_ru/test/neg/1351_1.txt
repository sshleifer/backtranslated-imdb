I would really like me to read all the reviews before watching the movie ... it was one of the most painful movies I've ever seen. I was ready to leave the theater 5 minutes after the beginning of the film; I had to follow my instinct. The film did not offer anything new or clever, it was boring and very cliche. I was surprised to find that it was sent by a woman! The characters did not represent women I know, they were boring, bitter and melodramatic. The film was unrealistic, depressing and a waste of time and money. And the actors looked tired, badly made up and combed. It was recently compared to Sex and in the City Cinema; it was not even twice as bad. My suggestion, do not watch this movie!
