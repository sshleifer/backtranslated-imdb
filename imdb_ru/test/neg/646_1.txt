I thought about this movie when I watched Nash's pluton ... why ... because Randy Cade was playing a retarded robot in both films, this film was shot several years earlier, but it was probably written by a screenwriter who drank the same biotoxic coffee or something like that. .. Whoa ... AVOID ALL COST, even to pay tribute to the late great Andy Kaufman, it's hard to do here ... find another movie or just watch a taxi at the nightly TV show ... his latka-gravas character is much more Favorite . TANK YOU BERRY MUCH
