Be very afraid of everyone who likes this movie. In childhood, they probably breathed in too much paint. It's so terrible, I refuse to take a conspiracy. Oh yes, there was not one! This film is the true definition of what Hollywood creates for people who do not want to think in a theater. Are the bad guys winning? Do the good guys win? What's the difference!
