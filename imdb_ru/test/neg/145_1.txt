This film is a really big piece of trash trying to make itself look like a Hollywood production. A bad story scheme (stupid robot story) ... a very bad game of incompetent pop idols ... and they are trying to "FIGHT" !! Oh my god ... these pathetic actors use wires to make them look like “good fighters” ... :( and I hate that arrogant Edison Chen ... the worst actor I've ever seen !!! touch his movies again. AVOID this movie at any cost !!! I wanted to give it a negative value out of ten ... not even worth 0/10.
