STARS RATING: ***** Saturday evening **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Former policeman from New Orleans, killer of Jack Robido (Jean-Claude Van Damme), is reassigned to Columbus, a small but brutal city in Mexico, to assist the police in their efforts to stop a major heroin smuggling operation to their city. The culprits are the former military, led by former commander Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord, also known as Jas from East Enders), who uses a special method that he learned in Afghanistan to repel his opponents. But Jack has a more personal reason to kill him, which involves two men in an explosive final duel, where only one leaves alive. <br /> <br /> After his death, Van Damme was on top of the show that he can make the best films right on the action market. While it was a much more dramatic film, with The Shepherd, he returned to the highest, mindless action that first made him famous and, unfortunately, created his worst movie since he went off the rails. This is not as bad as in this film, but what I said is still valid. <br /> <br /> A boring, predictable film, with very little any exciting action. The fact that there is little is mainly composed of scenes with silent fights, trying to look cool and trendy with the addition of cheap slowdown / acceleration effects, which, unfortunately, instead make them look more desperate. Being a Mexican set film, director Isaac Florentin tried to give the film a feeling of Robert Rodriguez / Desperate, but this only adds to despair. <br /> <br /> VD gives a particularly boring idea and, given that he was never an actor with Robert De Niro, this cannot be good. Being a villain, the Lord should not expect to leave the bib soon. At first, he talks little, as he struggles to get an American accent, but in a mysterious way becomes better by the end. All auxiliary actors are equally soft and do nothing to elevate the spirit of films in general. <br /> <br /> This is one shepherd who has deviated straight from the flock. *
