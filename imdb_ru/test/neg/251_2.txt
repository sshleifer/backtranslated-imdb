This film was supposed to be presented as three film summaries combined to form a full-length feature film (including many shots of people walking slowly along dark corridors and streets). KEEP IN MIND! The first hour of this film is simply a rethinking of the first two Aztec films, as the main character said. The actual movie does not start until the thing is almost finished. I have to say that Bat replaying is pretty funny. <br /> <br /> As for the robot, I thought that the robot is a mechanical device that can or cannot resemble a human being. A “robot” of a bat consists of a radioactive, reanimated corpse encased in a lead robot. As Tom Servo said: “He’s not so impressive, he doesn’t even have any knees!” This is, and it will take the robot about an hour to get through the room. But as soon as he catches you, look! It will touch you (powered by radium? Pluh-easy!). <br /> <br /> This is a great movie accompanied by Joel and bots. Otherwise, you are just a glutton for abuse.
