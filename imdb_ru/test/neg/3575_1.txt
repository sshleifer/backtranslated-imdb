I really enjoyed Hidden Camera with Dom DeLuise, and I was surprised to see that over the years, Suzanne Somers had become one of the main roles of the show. But it was the only positive side of the show - the whole studio, the introduction, the presenters - everything that gives new meaning to the word “pompous”. <br /> <br /> Well, it would be nice if the materials were not so good, I mean, come on, the best thing you can do is show a few men who have problems extracting ketchup from bottles, Suzanne Somers, walking with a Halloween basket in July, a place for ice cream that only vanilla is for sale ...? I saw several episodes, and each time it was awful. They posed as if it were the greatest show in history, and then filled the time with such sad scenes that I was embarrassed to watch. Even the people in them looked dull, and it just can't be good.
