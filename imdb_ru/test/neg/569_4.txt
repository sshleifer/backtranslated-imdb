I liked most of the dialogue, I liked the cast, I thought it was well played. I especially enjoyed the perfect performance of Ellen DeGeneres. <br /> <br /> What didn’t help me was: (1) a prolonged relationship with a young man (too long, it would seem, not in character for Helen)), (2) seemingly endless cinematic clichés, mostly visual , but including the endless ones voiced by rereading the most love letter (its content should have a riddle); (3) a young feminist woman and, ironically, a firework scene (not surprisingly, it reminded me of this horrible film How to Make an American Quilt); (4) clumsy policeman "Gotcha", who everywhere smells of "doping" (there is also no cliche!); and (5) the nauseatingly romanticized setting of a small town. <br /> <br /> I would prefer the film to more convincingly reveal the source (or even glorify) Helen’s bitterness, incorporating much more of DeGeneres’s character into it, eliminate or reduce various artifacts from generation to generation, and be a little less critical small town. <br /> <br /> If it were designed as a play, these criticisms could be considered before the material was transmitted to this film, which, unfortunately, is mediocre.
