John Waters owes me 2 hours of my life. I saw a preview of this film back in 1990, and it still hurts. Neither before, nor since then have I seen such a terrible piece of cinematic waste thrown onto the screen. I can't say anything positive about this movie. Acting is terrible; the plot is ridiculous; music is disgusting. After the film, my friends and I demanded a refund from the theater manager. He explained that since it was a free viewing, he could not give us anything in return, no matter how much agony we experienced. As the career of Johnny Depp survived this film wreck, no one guesses.
