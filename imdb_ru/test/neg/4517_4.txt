I found my tape of this long-forgotten "show". In addition to the thematic song "DISCO BEAVER FROM OUTER SPACE". This show can hardly be seen. You will scroll through the channels like a couple watching TV channels. This is a parody of the TV. <br /> <br /> Cool beaver. Homosexual Dracula, a girl discussing her experiences with Peria, and a lady with overly large lips discussing homosexuality, show us everything thatâ€™s wrong with television. This is all bad. Just like a beaver from space, who seems to be lost in this new world, you too will. *** outside *****
