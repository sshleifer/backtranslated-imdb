I found the first episode of the stop motion animation intriguing and, mostly, a lively short film in which the girl went to any country where I was interested, but the remaining 11 strange shorts really did not arouse my interest and made me think in all. The music and 8mm footage seemed so random that they seemed random. I would not recommend it to anyone, unless you can see it for free. <br /> <br /> With regard to music, which is so stepped up, it also did not work. I rented a DVD because I thought it was all motion stop animation or SMA mixed with live action, and only the first short was SMA, the second had a small stop move mixed mostly with live action. One was a paper clipping, and the rest were taken outdoors from an 8 mm camera with a music bed. I just did not see any point in this.
