How do I deserve to watch this shit ??? The worst. The game was terrible when I read that it was a comedy, I expected to at least smile once or twice, but ... If you want to lose an hour and a half of your life, this is the right movie. I recommend simply to look at the wall or something else, except to watch this “movie”. Yoi may even watch a documentary (if you're a boyfriend) about pregnant women, I guarantee it will be a more entertaining role. In any case, “I want someone to eat cheese” is the right movie if you want to punish someone.
