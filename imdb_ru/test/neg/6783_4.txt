I watched this film with a group of friends at the 1999 Melbourne International Film Festival, and no one said a single good word about it. <br /> <br /> I like Bluegrass and country music, so I don’t "m not sympathetic to the topic. But the problem is that deep down it is a very conservative film - a little more than a filmed story of Mills and Boone. A bra the simplest and most sentimental look. <br /> <br /> Not only a love story at heart, but also the fact that it’s not just incredible between Rhys and Dr. Lily Penlerik. (Why doesn’t any man draw me to flaming nostrils devouring Lily, and, frankly, Mike Harding as Rice seems to be just going through the motions). <br /> <br /> Just All The film is too tamed and educated for its own good. There is very little danger, dirt or drama. Of course, there is a moment of "excitement" in which the school is run, led by younger sister Lily, but this whole episode is funnier than dramatic (just so bad written and played.) And the film gives out its conservative agenda, as this story is decided. <br /> <br /> As for the good old Rhys Kincaid (now, what is not so with a name like Eberneezer Bumpass?), I asking you! Is the ending of this movie believable? Corresponds to the character that this film previously built? I think no...
