I heard that Novo was compared to Memento for the simple fact that they both rely on protagonists suffering from short-term memory loss. Well, it’s like comparing “The Silence of the Lambs” and Friday the 13th, since both characters killed several people. They could not be further apart in their ideas. <br /> <br /> Novo deals with a copyist in a company that has short-term memory loss. He is constantly followed by another gentleman, and his boss likes to have sex with him in the office. A temporary employee arrives who also contacts him and can / cannot use him for sex. Needless to say, he has a lot of sex on the screen. <br /> <br /> Wait, that's not all. There is a boy who is confronted with a worried man suffering from amnesia, and it is obvious that this boy just bumps into him. And there is a notebook that a man keeps to try to recall important clues. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am not one of the films of foreign production. I don’t mind reading subtitles, but I think that sometimes it takes away from me one of my favorite aspects of the film: a great dialogue. Since they have to translate, or I could not understand for the most part, I truly believe that they simplify what the characters say. This film was no exception; the dialogue was just, well, blah. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it was interesting enough to hold me for 98 minutes. Strange, yes, but again, I don’t live in France, so I’m not so familiar with their likes / dislikes or lifestyle. (For example, I believe that it is acceptable for a father to lie down and frolic in the ass with his son on the beach - this should be a cultural affair.) Fortunately, there was not more than two hours of time spent for this person to return. his past and gradually move forward to his cure. For when the “secret” was learned, I was like, right? OK then. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend myself for some decent acting, good looking people and sexual situations (for example, every 2-4 minutes), however, if you aren’t in that scene, I’d sincerely miss this slow and memory-recovering movie.
