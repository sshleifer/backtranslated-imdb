Even the cooking of Emeril Lagassa cannot save this incoherent, overwhelmed by the idiotic nonsense, the role of Emeril Lagass as a television chef from the food channel, who with the help of the team is trying to make the show better, the poor plot and the stupid script drop this show exhaustion, Robert Urich was wasted in a poorly supporting role, and, unfortunately, it was his last in history (RIP), <br /> <br /> This is the worst show of 2001, and it will be on the list of the worst shows of this Ten Years. <br /> <br /> I am very sorry for Emiril Lagass for creating this comedic film, he even said himself that he was smelly. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s hard to believe that they are the same producers of female design. who made this mess. <br /> <br /> TV Review: 1 star
