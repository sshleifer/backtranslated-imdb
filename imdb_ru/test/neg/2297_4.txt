Glorious Edward begins to move around the world when his leader tells him that he can throw these dirty Swedish dramas and climb the stairs to the department of sprays and blood. Excited, as well as high hopes for a new type of film, which he is going to edit soon, he asks all sorts of questions about salary, his workplace and the lunch break. Well, not quite. Edward may be quite the opposite. Calm, stuttering guy, in addition, he got points. Except when he's mad. I guess this created a much more eerie atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Evil Ed is, in all likelihood, a Swedish film, but somehow the magical power came upon good actors and turned their lovely Swedish accents into stereotypical American voices. I believe this is what the actor needs these days. The action is very wooden, as it is inflexible, not bendable (well, hey, what did you really expect?). In addition to this, the film has a man-made killing theme song, similar to the E-Type. In any case, it only worsens the impression of the film. Since I am still quite a bit harsh against this film, there will usually be a turning point when I increase the level of happiness. But in fact, nothing special to say. The drawings look good, but somehow, the “Hunz” spilled coffee on it and partially destroyed it. That's how I watch this movie. If the film ended up being sent to an insane asylum and they restored the details from which he went crazy and killed people, the result would have been much better, but this is only my radical view. I would also like to see more videos from films about loss of limbs. <br /> <br /> There are illogical things in this film. Let's just say: the actors are really Americans living in America, why would they then act in a Swedish film, as Edward did? And also this delivery man, why he never uses the doorbell that is right next to him? Instead, he leaves, tapping softly on the door. Good old Edward really has good ears to hear it all while editing. <br /> <br /> In any case, this film had its own moments, it's just a pity that there were not so many of them. But this does not mean that I would not recommend it. It's a pretty cheap movie, go buy it. As if I see a sample of the price and the movie. On the other side; if you like watching dubbed movies becoming more and more hoarse, it could be IT. Then my verdict will be flawless 4.
