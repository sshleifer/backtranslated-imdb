This is the answer "Pulp Fiction." I thought it would be good for a few decent laughter. Well, it turns out that this film was really terrible. The whole plot does not follow the plot "Pulp Fiction." It turns out another movie like Forrest Gump and more. There was a laugh from this movie, but it all took me 90 minutes of my life. If you are thinking about renting this movie, do not lose 90 minutes of your life. Review the rental issue and find a movie that really makes sense. Please, if there is “Chubby fiction 2”, I definitely will not continue and withdraw the sequel. Just giving heads to those who are there.
