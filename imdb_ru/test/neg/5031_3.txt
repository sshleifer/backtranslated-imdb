I did not make big assumptions about the fact that it must have been a very, very free adaptation from the work of Eça de Queiroz, and I must say that this free adaptation forms the book as a set of possible good ideas and characters. The problem is how it is done, without any care, without any taste, just a booming cliché of bad taste everywhere. The script is so fake, and the characters are so unreal that because of this, small characters see such good actors as Unas, Briner, Morgado, Lagarto and others who are lost in the network of everything except the movie or story-telling. To my surprise, newcomers Jorge Corrula and Soraya Chavez boldly continue their performances, but you can see them lost like a drifting boat without any direction. And if we talk about the direction, then in this film this is completely lacking - where is the director? All bad taste; frames - anything, and whenever a hand-held camera is used for no good reason, the light design that should create an environment does not exist (and there is no excuse that this is a dark real story). A common problem with this movie is "trying to be" is that it has no taste or very, very bad taste. It is sad to see Jorge and Soraya melt into such fake and unjustified sex scenes, drawn here and there through the entire film, like closing holes in the narrative or used as fake transition motives. Perhaps Carlos Coelho da Silva should see the 2002 adaptation of Carlos Carrera to the same book, Ash, and figure out how to make a real movie.
