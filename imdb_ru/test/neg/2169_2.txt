Although the letter was terrible, the game was terrible, the only thing that saved this “shit” was chest counting, but it was not enough for me to look at it again. All said and done. I'm actually dumber watching this movie. It was a new minimum for Troma. Lloyd Kaufman, who started the movie in the trash bag and made some fluffy sounds, should have made me understand what I was getting into. It was by far one of the worst Troma teams ever released. The best place to show this film is people with disabilities who feel they can't get up to change the channel. To conclude that this is not a quick recommendation to watch this film only for the chest.
