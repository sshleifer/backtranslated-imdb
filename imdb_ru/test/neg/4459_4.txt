Although I enjoyed the SATANIC PARTS of Dracula (1974), I knew that one should not expect too much from his even more vicious predecessor! Of course, the smallest of Dracula's Hammer (Marcus Hearn in the audio commentary for CREEPING FLESH [1973] even goes so far as to call him the studio nadir), the film really tormented because of its absolute unity - and now with an awkward date updating the myth (the modern situation is actually better suited for SATANIAN RETRONS) ... even if, in truth, it is still much more preferable to shy away, like Dracula 2000 (2000) or VAN HELSING (2004)! <br /> <br /> Despite Christopher Lee’s loud voice, he still cuts an undeniably striking figure like an undead vampire (even if he appears very little and inexplicably limited to one setting); Similarly, Peter Cushing demonstrates his usual perfect performance. The only remarkable acting in the film is the work of Christopher Nîmes (the son of director Ronald) as Johnny Alucar (!) - even if it’s just because it’s incredibly stupid! Unfortunately, the two most famous female actors (both of whom are regular heroes of horror) - Stephanie Beecham and Caroline Munro - cannot rise above their physical qualities. <br /> <br /> The shooting of Dick Bush (who shot “Blood on Satan’s Claw” [1971] and, for Hammer, when dinosaurs ruled the earth [1970] and the twins of evil [1971] - but perhaps most famous for their long-standing ties to Ken Russell), who controls some pleasant atmosphere throughout, especially during three important episodes: a carriage fight at the beginning of the Gothic; hysterical black mass with subsequent resuscitation of Dracula; and the latest standoff between Lee and Cushing Van Helsing.
