While traveling with a team of misses due to a dispute over Miss Galaxy, the plane, piloted by Maximus Powers (Eric Roberts) and Mike Saunders (Charlie Schlatter), falls in an isolated place where Noah's Ark lies, protected by a Jurassic pork. While the group is fighting for survival, the alien monkeys are planning to use the ark to destroy the human race and dominate planet Earth. <br /> <br /> I like parodies, but Miss Castaway is an insult to the human brain. The terrible story and the special effects are very, but actually very bad. There are parodies of “Lost”, “Castaway”, “Jurassic Park”, “The Sixth Sense”, “Titanic”, “Planet of the Apes”, “Raiders of the Lost Ark”, “Congo”, “IIB”, “Ideal Storm” Austin Powers, Jaws, Mission Impossible, Close Relations of the Third Kind, Star Wars and Hulk, but the problem is that most of them are very stupid and not funny, After all, the trailer better than the movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “Missão Quase Impossível” (“Mission Almost Impossible”)
