As Ben Elton once said, nothing gets out of fashion faster than comedy. Steve Martin's latest offering, Pink Panther 2, recently opened up for bad reviews and dark box office, while Mike Myers’s Love Guru seems to have won few fans. <br /> <br /> In 1970, it was Jerry Lewis’s turn to feel the pain of rejection (oddly enough, his character in this film experiences a funny twist when someone uses this word in his presence) when “Which way to the front ? ”Effectively ousted him from the big screen for almost a decade. <br /> <br /> In this comedy of World War II, he plays “Brendan Byers 111”, the richest man in the world who wants to join the army, his patriotic duty (and also because he is bored of being successful), but he rejected because it is not suitable from a medical point of view. He then decides to create his own privately funded army, recruiting the other 4th. <br /> <br /> Dressed in a ridiculous uniform, similar to the one that was worn by the International Rescue Service in the Thunderbirds, they go to training. A few good visual jokes here. When they launch rocket launchers, they look pleased with themselves until they know that they have just destroyed the Texaco oil station! Wanting to learn German, Brendan performs a long-playing disc called "Songs To Mein Kampf By". When this army sits down to eat, instead of being in a messy dining room, they are in a luxurious room decorated with a chandelier. <br /> <br /> John Wood is very funny, like “Finkel”, Byers -So English butler. His best scene is when he blackmails a mafia gangster to teach the Byers brigade to kill. <br /> <br /> The script was written not by Jerry himself, but by Gerald Gardiner and Di Caruso, the author of a number of episodes. "Monkey". “Front” often looks like a television comedy series, indeed, sometimes you almost expect to hear a track of laughter. <br /> <br /> Where he goes badly in the last thirty minutes, when Byers replaces the supreme Nazi commander and, after the Germans order to leave the front, he gets involved in a plot to kill Hitler (and Tom Cruise is nowhere to be seen!) As commander, Jerry demonstrates such mind-blowing incompetence that defies description. He gives Bryan the Blissful race for his money in stakes "The loudest of the living." This is a relief when end credits appear. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the time was simply wrong — the release of a military comedy when the conflict in Vietnam was raging was not a good idea. Or the Jerry just got tired of the public (this beard probably didn't help!). Here he needed a good producer, someone who would pick it up and say: “This stench stinks. Throw him out! ” “Do not raise the bridge, lower the river” is a masterpiece compared to this picture. <br /> <br /> When the 70s begin, Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Monty will be the new comedic icons. Python is a fresher, sharper, and in the case of Allen, more human comedy styles have replaced the slapstick mark of Jerry. Only in 1982 will he be able to make something like a successful return - as the vain host of the Jerry Langford talk show host in the brilliant King of Comedy, Martin Scorsese.
