Sylvester, a cat, runs away on a ship on which the bird Tweety turns out to be with his owner Grandmother. Oh, I don’t even have enough words to convey how much I despise the characters of Tweety and Grandmother. They are just not funny for me and made this short job quite difficult. Sylvester is a great character in and of itself, but he can do a lot if he faces a terrible, horrible, damned application and a grandmother’s old man. This animated short film can be found on disk 4 of volume 1 of the Looney Tunes Gold Collection and contains an additional commentary by Michael Barrier. <br /> <br /> My rating: D +
