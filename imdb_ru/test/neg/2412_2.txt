The only thing that is good about this film is the artwork on the poster of J. G. Geiger. Protesters against nuclear weapons that looked like punk rockers of the late 1970s and somehow became non-violent (with the exception of their leader, Splashes), occupy cities. Brothers from the fraternity go down to the punkers to attack them and turn them into victims. A bad game and a bad story hit a real victim, you, the viewer. I gave it a “2” because a few sex scenes at least give it the potential of MST3K. <br /> <br />
