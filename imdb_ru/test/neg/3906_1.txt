I saw this movie partly due to some positive comments here on IMDb. After I wished that these 90 minutes of my life would return, I feel that I must get here myself and say ... Please do not worry about watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I can not argue with the efforts of the actors - they did everything they could, gave the material, but this material is terrible. The pace was deadly - slow, winding, and you saw that everything was approaching in about an hour, and then it took forever. The dialogue was boring, meaningless, not at all ridiculous. All the characters were completely non-sympathetic. And the cinematography was, in my opinion, of very poor quality - the cliche "the character uses the home video!" accustomed to a very bad effect. <br /> <br /> Yes, Jeri Ryan is a cool person. Do not let this waste your time on this film.
