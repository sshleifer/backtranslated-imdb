Bad, bad, movie, so bad, that is worth seeing. While you are watching this movie, knowing that it is bad, and you will spend 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie, it's worth it. The special effects are stupid, the animals look fake, the acting is bad, but watching the faces of the actors who are trying to look scared is just very funny. If your sister is going to be eaten by a giant Komodo dragon, won't you do something to try to save her? If you had eaten it, would you not have fallen on your knees and would not have begun to cry? This guy just sat in a chair and ran his fingers through his hair. How anti-climate is it? Maybe he should have been in shock or something. He joins his sister in the chest of a chest of drawers - oh, did not want to spoil him.
