The simple premise of Overnight is to try to convey a message: “Look at this guy, he messed up everything”, when in fact he has a strong underground, he faced violent blows from friends and managers in the name of getting. . Frankly, the only result that any of these guys played in the overall performance of the Bundoc Saints ended with nothing more than excess bodies in the first scene of the bar, after which all they did was whining why they were not bigger based on climbing their rancid efforts at the top of the triple shoulders.
