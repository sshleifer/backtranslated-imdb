It's unique in the Hitchcock films that I saw because I didn't like it very much. <br /> <br /> In fact, I find it quite predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine - newlyweds. He is the type of “sweet crook” you have seen in many films, although, as far as I understand, he was never cute! <br /> <br /> In fact, at best, this was hardly a plausible relationship, and at times it seemed especially false and implausible. <br /> <br /> Not being able to stay at work and trying to live a luxurious lifestyle, Grant is forced to borrow money that he cannot return. <br /> <br /> Fontaine is convinced that he is trying to kill her in order to get the money for which she is insured; and, apparently, of what her late father was worth. <br /> <br /> Medium and rather uninteresting in fact, but, as usual, you can see the effects on films that appeared later.
