<br /> <br /> As a fan of bad movies (both MST3K and MFT3K member), I have to say that I saw my share of them. But god! Even the worst that I saw, at least, was the soundtrack. As George Lazenby wanders around Hong Kong, doing what he knows, you can guarantee that you will not be distracted by any background music that fills a modern cinema. Or some kind of music that fills the elevators. I don't think anyone in this movie is even humming. <br /> <br /> Now this is not quite true - there is * sound track. if you listen carefully, you will hear it about half a dozen times during the movie. Of course, time will be completely inappropriate, and it will not last for a very long time, but something that can be attributed to "music" really happens. It is best, however, to sit while your child, armed with a wooden spoon, is in front of the television with a set of pots and pans while you are watching. Rhythm and flow would be better than anything the movie offers. <br /> <br /> Watch Sammo Hung as a secondary figure in this film. Are we not glad that he found Jackie Chan to work?
