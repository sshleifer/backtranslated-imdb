“Escape from Hell” is not done artistically enough to hide what it is: rough exploitation. The direction and the letter are inaccurate: for example, camera work during the battle between Cynthia Lodetti and Ajita Wilson is so bad that you can barely make out what is going on; In addition, if an alcoholic, but a kind-hearted doctor had not killed the warden, the guards would never have followed him and the girls after they escaped - until then, the “fake plague” plan worked well, but he just had to destroy It. I would give this film 4 out of 10 (the sweaty lesbian scene is not bad, and Christina Lai has an amazingly beautiful face and body), but a particularly disgusting scene of violence made me cut another 2 points. Of course, some patients will take this as a recommendation. In the end, one thing even more disturbing than this film is that some people actually gave him positive feedback!
