Have you ever seen the movie "Marathoner"? To part with the dentist? I would prefer it to happen to me than to sit in “Random Hearts” again. It was not just uninteresting or without incident ... It was terribly, painfully and painfully boring. At some point I lost consciousness for a moment. To an ordinary amateur I might have seemed sleeping, but the other patrons of the film consciously realized that I had actually disconnected from the bordoma. I thought I was going to die. When the movie finally ended (I think it was twelve o'clock, but I'm not sure), I issued an exasperated “Thank you, Lord, it's over!”, To which all the other viewers of the film cheered. If I had to listen to the drone Harrison Ford for one more second in this monotonous cheekbone, I would have to look for something sharp to get stuck in my eyes to divert my attention. This is 136 minutes of my life, I will never come back.
