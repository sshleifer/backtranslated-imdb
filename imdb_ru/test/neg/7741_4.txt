I watched the MST3K version of the film, and this review includes minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this film, it looked like it promised to be a stupid science fiction film, but the more I watched it, the more disappointing it became. The first reason is rather peculiar - I liked the shy girl with glasses much more than the Wanda model, which became the end of the film. More deeply, it was the fact that the loss of glasses and the change in clothing replaced any actual growth in character. Instead of becoming a character who could take care of herself, Wanda was just as dependent on men to do everything for her as at the beginning of the movie. The acting could have been better (although I was tired of the cracks about the voice of Ireland - they were even in the movie itself! It's not that bad.) The background was ok, but it was a bit strange (aliens = people with face paint) and could use a more detailed explanation. <br /> <br /> Maybe I was just interested in the film itself, but Joel and the bots did little for me. The film could be better without them at all. <br /> <br /> In general (for the film itself, not for MST3K), 3 out of 10. It was a normal film, whatever it was.
