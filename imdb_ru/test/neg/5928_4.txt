Sometimes I think that somewhere in the office complex of the channel “Lifetime” there is a room where a writer is hanging out, with a big wheel on the wall - something like a “big six” in a casino. The latter have a lot of places where you even win money, and less for large sums, until there may be a couple who pay big money. <br /> <br /> But I imagine the channel wheel, which has about six different genres. his wheel, with two of them looking the most, is labeled "Psychotic Neighbor", or "Spouse with Hidden Past or Secret or Both." Lifetime movies have several recurring plot lines, and the two seem to be the most omnipresent. <br /> <br /> In the category “Spouse ...” there may be a long-standing spouse, but some person appears or an event occurs, showing that the once-good wife was a prostitute, one of the spouses has long been involved in what something vile act, or that something else on the same background was different than expected - and so on. Or, as in this film, one of them entered into marriage with the most vile purposes. <br /> <br /> One of the constants in all their genres is that the husband or other men are usually ignorant, meaningless, and slowly, to have an idea of ​​what the hell is happening before the climax, or, in best, very late in the process (unless the man is a criminal). That's not the point. <br /> <br /> Whether the aforementioned attacker can be a “neighbor” or, as in this sentence, a “wife”, it is always surprising how easily, successfully and effortlessly they continue their mean business. affairs They manipulate many others, beat them as needed, take different poses and manipulate more deceptions than you can count - with unchanged success until the very end. <br /> <br /> The main actor here, like many in the films of this channel, is the old hand. I noticed that another film in which he starred was titled "The Perfect Neighbor." <br /> <br /> Finally, the vindictive “ideal wife” in this film sends those who stand in her way with more experience and ease than the most experienced. and a competent "button man" in the family of Don Corleone could collect. And I could not help but imagine that the character of Melvin Udall Jack Noholson from the movie As Good As He Is, with his huge OCD disease, could give advice to an anti-hero to help her cope with the obsession that was the basis of the opus.
