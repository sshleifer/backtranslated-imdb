OK. First, I just wanted to check if this movie has an average rating below or exactly -1. But 5.9. This is worse than any of the killer actions. It made me curious because people wrote here ... which, after all, made me create an account to give my 2 cents of truth to this “source of delusion” that I find here. <br /> <br /> How do you guys even dare INTEND this movie in the same sentences as, for example, Seven? The only thing they have in common is that they show different crime scenes. This is this. And "The best thriller of 1999!" ? Have you ever watched another movie this year? Or any other film in your life at all? The year 1999 is not the year people remember about the Resurrection ... what about real FILMS, such as 8 mm, eyes wide closed, Arlington Road, Double Jeopardy? (In fact, they are more "thriller" than this ...). Resurrection does not even deserve to be dedicated to SECOND IN 1999. <br /> <br /> Indeed, you guys can't be serious. Yesterday I watched this movie with my girlfriend, highly recommended by her friend. "Great movie with Christopher Lambert"! ... which I have not seen yet? Hmm .. <br /> <br /> Well, first look at the covers: OK, nothing special. At the second glance, you do not need to have supernatural abilities to realize that they simply mirror the head of Lambert, cut off his nose, etc., and then make a freakish negative pattern on top of it to get an image of the killer on the CAP. You can even think that they have a student who ate a gallon of marshmallow only to sign this creepy (boo! -.-) mouth ... whatever. Turned it over, and the story begins with: "It rains in Chicago ... a talker talker." C'mon, a six-year-old kid could make this piece more exciting. Now, with this tremendous excitement coming from the amazing presentation of films, you absolutely want to start watching it. Because it can't be so bad, it's still Christopher Lambert. This assumption turned out to be wrong. With a “proven mistake”, I mean that it was brutally performed with a deadly mixture of the worst imaginable action ever known to mankind (every actor, but the top is “I can make 1 airliners!”), Police Chief, wife Prudhommes __ in fact, a better detective than Prudhom, when she recombines several incidents with another ABSOLUTELY UNKNOWN hint at the case !!!! -.- __ and ... yes ... Prudhom himself), showing a squadron of inhuman fake feelings, logical mistakes in a 1 minute cycle, light years, contrived conclusions, which, in my opinion, are an insult to any thinking person and finally, not least for the operator who was clearly a hyperventilating kangaroo. Oh, well, and if you haven't completely turned off your brain (this is not a room to watch it), then you should know who is who and what is what after max. 30 minutes, simply because you know ANY scene after the first one. This is exciting. Exciting, because this movie almost makes you think that you can tell the future. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: this is in the PAST the worst movie I can remember. Believe me, I have seen a lot of horrible films, which in some ways were at least just failed attempts or poor copies of another movie. Resurrection, however, is the best example of how to fail in all possible aspects. It was so bad that after I was shocked by the unimaginably low quality in the e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g movie, I laughed more often than in any recent comedy, simply because I was fascinated by the audacity of the film crew that produced such an extraordinary film. It is good that for Lambert he was in Highlander: after a year in the endgame, so he can be pardoned. ; ^ O <br /> <br /> In any case, I recommend watching this movie to EVERYONE. In the end, we had a lot of fun watching this: ^ D. I guarantee you that after you have completely watched “Resurrection” (be brave, you can do it!), You will worship the level of action in any given daily soap <br /> <br /> Or just go and look at the Highlander again ... that's what I'm going to do.
