This movie was terrible. The game was terrible. The script was terrible. What was even worse, there were camera shots and sound. Half the time of the voice did not coincide with the lips of the actors, and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different shades. Worst of all was when one of the actors was on top of a huge building in the shape of a cross. The building should have been 50 floors and probably 100 feet wide. However, when the actor was on top of this in another frame, they “recreated” the upper part of the building. The width of the building was reduced to about eight feet wide. How can a building hundreds of feet tall be eight feet wide? I know that the film was low-budget, but it is unforgivable. The film itself only put forward ideas about "delight," and then about the plot or plot. This led to the scenario becoming trash, the characters seemed to be selling ideas in their lines, rather than transferring emotions and moving the film in some direction. It was a complete waste of time watching. The film gives Christians notoriety if it is one of the best Christian films.
