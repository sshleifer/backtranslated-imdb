All I can do is laugh. Wow. I like the films of Jim Winsky, really. I mean, Chopping Mall is a classic. But what happened to this guy? He made funny horror movies that tried to be good. But it was hardly even funny ... I mean, probably because I was laughing. The villain is incredible. I mean, terrible CGI. It looks ... terrible. And the film has no blood, and no naked people as redeeming qualities. This is a PG-13 rating. A movie called Bone Eater that you know will not be a blockbuster, you know that there probably won't be a smart script. A film like this can rely on blood ... but no. In fact, it doesn't rely on anything, just ... shit. Check it out if you want to laugh. But do not expect a good movie. I hope that Jim Vinorski will return to films like Chopping Mall and Ghoulies IV, because this is Komodo Vs. Cobra does not cut it.
