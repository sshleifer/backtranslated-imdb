This film has disappointed for at least one of two reasons. The created uncertainty disappeared due to terrible acting skills or the director’s lack of guidance ... I don’t know ... it was like a delicious chewing gum that seemed to end, but you continue to chew it because once it had tastes great, Like most thrillers, Avtostoper promised, but could not perform when I had bright eyes and I was ready to turn down the volume (I watched the movie alone ... in the dark) This so-called thriller just fell apart, as if he were made from lego turning into something School. It just ran out of gas, and I was left to watch a movie that looked like a television, with one exception ... It was probably the "R" rating.
