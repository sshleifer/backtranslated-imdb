I must have been in a good mood to give this shameful, predictable, embarrassing film even 3. What is wrong with it? Let's start with useless sex, although I admit that the rotational style of deception was something that I had not seen before (and had not experienced). And I think they also saved a few dollars by showing the same sex scene three times. Then there are inconsistencies. The Oakville Tribune seems to be in the green part of town, as it should have been. (Hamilton Ontario ???) And yet in the scenes on the roof, he seems to be in an industrial zone with a steel plant spewing smoke and flames. In addition, the interior of the building — the editorial office — the stairs — seem much larger than the outside. SPOILERS HERE Then, when our fearless reporter is finally fired, she returns to the building several times, once after hours. Hardly likely. The ending is also very predictable ... classic bait and capers, in which a good guy turns out to be a bad guy. But my main objection is that this is another film funded by the tax benefits of Canada and Ontario, which is ashamed to install in Canada, proving once again that the Canadian film industry is passionate and opportunistic. Country films must do more than just provide work. They must reflect culture. It is enough that American studios use Toronto as a replacement for New York. But it is confusing and frustrating when Canadian manufacturers (in this case, CanWest Global) do this with the help of federal and provincial governments. In a word ... BANG!
