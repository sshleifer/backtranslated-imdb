Why is C Thomas Howell making these films? Cruise (once Howell's colleague) is filmed in a huge WOTW blockbuster, and Howell follows this unsuccessful effort. <br /> <br /> How to start? Production values ​​- I will start with good things. The appearance of some of the scenes in this film is not so bad to be honest. In some places, everything is in order, and the direction is not bad. <br /> <br /> Script - awful. A series of clumsy scenes that could be put in any order, penetrate throughout the film. The number of times that the scene disappeared to black and appeared a second later in the same room was incalculable. A very bad storyline (like Cruise WOTW, by the way) takes on some guilt, but a terrible script kills it. <br /> <br /> Special FX - Well, I don’t want to be too harsh, as I imagine the budget was less than the bill for Cruise’s dinner - but in the general context of the film, the effects are poorly done. Some shots are pretty impressive - mostly remote shots of bridges, Washington, airliner. But basically the “alien” cars themselves and the tentacles are terrible. In addition, the quality of the pictures in some pictures is not clear, and in others - completely. <br /> <br /> Acting - I'm a fan of Howell, but since he reduced himself to be filmed in these low-budget films, he succumbed to the “excessive” mistake a long time ago. Look at his performance in The Hitcher and compare it with this movie. There is no comparison. He overdidded his face, fluttered his arms and legs (where did he get this style of running ???) and for the final coup he glanced at the scene where he was losing a photo of his family. Hysterical. But after all that has been said, he's still the best actor on the show here. Buzie is embarrassed to watch, and Peter Green (Zed is really dead, baby) mumbles incoherently around his only stage. I honestly could not understand one word that he said - I even went so far that I tried to turn on the subtitles on this stage - but there were no subtitles on the DVD. It looks like this is a real “stay in the family,” since Howell’s son, the director’s wife, and the producer do it in the film. None of them is good. <br /> <br /> The direction is not bad, but not good either. <br /> <br /> The rating is gloomy. <br /> <br /> Overall, the failure effort will do nothing for Howell in his attempt to get him back to a great time. He should take a look at Rourke and try to figure out how he returned to List A, but if he continues to do such things, he will not have enough career. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
