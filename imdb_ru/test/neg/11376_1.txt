Comparing this film with something Almodovar is an insult to Almodovar. The best I can say about this is that he is desperately trying to be like the film of Almodovar and fails. The scenario is terrible, the characters are one-dimensional, and the performances are the quality of school drama (except for Marcia Gay Harden, which is pretty good considering the material she has to work with). In addition, cinematography does absolutely nothing to convey the bizarre beauty of Gaudiâ€™s architecture or the infectious charm of Barcelona. If you like a grain of sand, pathos and a dark, whimsical comedy from Almodovar films, you will not find any of them here. Spend your money on something other than this celluloid waste.
