For various reasons, this is a very bad fighter. First, Seagal is terribly out of shape. He looks old and fat, plays like he has to perform an annoying commitment, and his fighting scenes require creative editing or simple replacement. Secondly, his opponent is a very weak villain. This is about the clever and vile main brain, but Chestnut does not deliver. So what about the action? Well, both sides are constantly shooting at each other in different places in Alcatraz prison. They shoot wildly and badly, because compared to the amount of ammunition needed, the number of people is rather low. There is nothing to save this movie. There are no good lines and no good jokes. A little psychological interlude with 49er One and Judge MacPherson is ridiculous. So what does he have? Well, ordinary Bell helicopters, silhouettes moving in blue light and slow motion, doors pierced with 1000-watt bullets and lights shining through holes, characters jumping in the air during shooting, many weapons coming from nowhere, long black coat with a bold black guy and a thin wooden box containing 25 tons of gold. The pain continues until the very last hopeless approach to facilitate final loans. California beach boy Don Michael Paul wrote and directed. At least this mountain of boredom comes from just one simple mind.
