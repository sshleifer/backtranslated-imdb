I expected much more from this movie. The preview looked interesting, so I decided to check it out. The bottom line is that in “The Adventures of Sebastian Cole” there was only one decent thing: Adrian Grenier. <br /> <br /> I really like Grenier, and I find his performance very pleasant. The character is well developed, but everything else seems to drift throughout the entire movie. Clark Gregg is really good, but I don't think his character was explained too well. I mean, there are not so many explanations; he wants to be a woman. However, something was missing. <br /> <br /> The obvious low budget of the film was good to see. I liked that the film was shot only according to the scenario (bad) and in total for several actors. It was a pleasant change. <br /> <br /> Although the main idea of ​​the film was really good, it was disappointing to see a lot of scenes that have nothing to do with it, just added here and there. As I said, the script looked promising, and I must say that I was wondering where the director Todd Williams was going, but it was basically a very slow movie with not very good dialogue. <br /> <br /> “Sebastian” began to look good by the end, but again, he fell back into the hole. The acting was mostly good, the script needs some work, but the film’s budget helped him in the long run. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to someone if they want to watch a movie quietly with a strong lead character, but apart from that I would stay away. Personally, I would not watch it twice.
