The plot itself is pretty well crafted for such a picture, which is a pleasant surprise, as is the acting, which, although a bit boorish, is better than usual for these types of clicks. <br /> <br /> Effects "funny - translucent giant and obviously polystyrene / papier-mâché hand uncontrollably oscillates on a piece of wire. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth looking at the value of kitsch entertainment once. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
