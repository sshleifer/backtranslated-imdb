Maybe spoilers, so don’t read if you don’t want to. Just like watching television news, everything has already happened, a great tsunami is hanging over the city bay and CUT, no longer visible, Tokay suffers from a strong earthquake, has anyone seen more than 5 seconds that I saw? If you want to create a love story, create a love story, but if you want to use the name of the film about the disaster, please be kind enough to show me “Disaster”, after watching this movie, watch “JISHIN RETTO” or any film “GODZILLA” to satisfy the part that was ready to see people screaming and collapsing buildings, which was not in this film. Don't get me wrong, I love disaster movies, and I like the original Nihon chimbotsu and Jishin retto, I even like the last Poseidon, not much of the story there, but a very good and graphic sequence of disasters, New Nihon chimbotsu loses meaning like many times like Pearl Harbor or the day after tomorrow, but at least these two films show good sequences of catastrophes and also quite expensive FX that showed nothing, give me fake buildings, if you like, if you destroy them properly I know that must star teach as a sadistic freak, but I really went to “Love” when I wanted to watch a romantic film, grrrrrrr, even when kimpuchi-sensei makes me cry, and this film is not: t. there is another series called “dormant chimbotsu” of 1975, I have on DVD and it is much better
