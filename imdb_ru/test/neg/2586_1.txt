I saw this movie last night and went online specifically to see if others thought it was just as terrible as me. <br /> <br /> Of course, some people see a lot in this film, which I haven’t seen, so if you're one of those people, well, good luck to you. But I am a patient person. I have enjoyed extremely long films before. But it was an exercise in torture for me. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I felt that this was one of those films about which little can be said, and that this is more about style than essence - however, style also made me feel like tear your hair out Practically everything interesting that happens during the movie happens off-screen. It's like a deliberate attempt to make a movie entirely from commercials - fragments that are usually reserved for the section of deleted scenes on DVD, if they were shown to the public at all. <br /> <br /> You are not In the end, nothing to learn about the main character, Francois. I had no sympathy for any of the characters in this film, except perhaps the violinist and his goat, as well as the old man, who believes that octopuses live up to 300, because they are really smart. Seriously, I was excited when he shot Francois holding a gun to his head. I felt so torn off when even his inevitable suicide was painfully boring. <br /> <br /> Oh, where was the editor? Do not smoke opium too? I swear, I almost shouted every time when I was subjected to a long shot of absolutely nothing happening, except maybe someone walking around back and forth, and then, finally, there will be a very sharp transition to the next scene, and this will be for a year. . AND WE HAVE MISSED EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS, THAT HAPPENED INTO THE MEANTHEM, and EVERYTHING IS ALONE IN ONE BLOOD CLOTHING ....!?!?! <br /> <br /> So in conclusion, if you liked it - great. But this review is intended as an antidote to the petrified petrified “you will love this movie if you like movies”, which I have seen here and in other places. (See? I hated the movie, and I still included a tricky link to its content!)
