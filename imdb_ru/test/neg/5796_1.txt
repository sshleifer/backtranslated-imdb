Unfortunately, this film had potential with such an actor, but everything was so poorly thought out and poorly executed. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where every scene just falls loudly, like it was here. In addition, I do not think that I have ever seen the stoner sexual comedy, which did not give at least one laugh, but this whirlpool of pain did not give anything but moans and suffering. The last time I was stunned by how funny a comedy with the terrible Big Mama House can be. Scene behind the scenes, these films jelly your brain. Stupid and stupid can sometimes be funny, but here stupid and stupid are used as a means of torture against the viewer. Absolute, idler
