In WASTED, I hated two things: directing and writing. I know I open myself to mockery, but Stephen Tay Kay's direction is too much like ... like ... well ... like MTV pop videos. This is filmed (I think) in digital video against an obsessive soundtrack, often out of focus and often with fast cross-cutting. If you are not a teenager, you will find that many segments of WASTED are not viewable due to the stylistic approach. No matter how bad the leadership was, it was the script that pulled my chain. The story is told through Samantha, a poor little rich girl who spends most of the film telling a voice-over (itâ€™s strange that a voice-over never seems peculiar enough to come from the same character), telling us about the pressure of her exams, family pressure life, her social loneliness, and all this made her take drugs. For the same reasons as the parental gap, her two male friends (I thought she had to be lonely?) They started taking drugs. Oh, poor little Sammy in her good home and her problems, how my heart was bleeding for you and your buddies - NO. What WASTED doesn't mention is that no matter who you are addicted to, be it alcohol, drugs, nicotine or chocolate, this person must work to become a drug addict, he is not a victim of external forces, he commits an act of free will. Both TRAFFIC and TRAINSPOTTING understood this very well, people become addicts because they want it. To represent them as victims in some way is wrong, patronizing, and perhaps very dangerous. <br /> <br /> By the way, if MTV are anti-drugs, will they stop playing videos from stars who freely admit that they are taking drugs?
