Presumably, this is the last film from the series “Left behind the back,” which is a fundamentalist preacher and novelist Tim Lahey about what we can expect in our future in the last days of Planet Earth. If so, we can expect the presidency of activists in every sense of the word, if Barack Obama becomes president next year. <br /> <br /> The Fantastic Four of Revelation has returned with one change of composition, Arnold Pinnock, who will most know as an adviser in life with Derek, the current Minister is Clarence Gilier. Brad Johnson plays the role of the pilot of the antichrist in the daytime, and Christian at night - along with his daughter Janaya Stevens and investigative reporter Kirk Cameron. These are the only four people on Earth who have foreseen the true nature of UN Secretary-General Nikolai Karpati and are again throwing sand into his car. <br /> <br /> This time they became an ally, the president of the United States, played by Louis Gossett Jr. He has a hell of a hard time, especially when partisans launch an RPG attack on a presidential motorcade that kills Vice President Charles Martin Smith. That's right, the toad is vice president. Someone really messed things up here because everyone, including those who could harm them, knows that the president and vice president NEVER travel together. <br /> <br /> All they need is the whole movie to convince Gossett who Carpathi is. Once again, the best in the film - Gordon Kerry as Karpati. <br /> <br /> We can still see another film “Left Behind”, the door is left open, although people assure me that they have run out of source material from Tim Le-Hey. I believe, while they earn money, and these players cannot get a job in the main industry of the cinema. And there are some unsolved conspiracy issues with Brad Johnson and Chelsea Noble, which is Mrs. Kirk Cameron in real life. <br /> <br /> One of the Fantastic Four really dies in this film, so it will be the Fantastic Three or they will get another fourth. Stay up to date.
