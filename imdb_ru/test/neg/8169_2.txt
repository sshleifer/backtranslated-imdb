Watching Bagban is the equivalent of trying to eat your way out of a salt water tank for almost three hours. This Indian film is a sticky, sweet, sentimental soap opera that starts as “King Lear”, then moves to Romeo and Juliet in the middle section, and then returns to King Lear for its tear-soaked finale. br /> <br /> Raj Malhotra is a bank accountant who seems to have everything a man might want from life: a wife who loves him, a family who loves him, and a job with which he going to retire after a lifetime of faithful service. Despite the fact that Raj and his wife Pooja have been married for 40 years and have four sons, they still behave like a couple in love, struck by newlyweds, grumbling and sighing, beating each other's eyes and whispering sweet things into each other's ears . almost to the point of nausea. In fact, this whole bloody brood is so happy, loving and harmonious, that compared to him, von Trapps looks like an unfortunate family. Parents and children joke together, laugh together, even perform carefully thought out choreographic, “spontaneous” songs and dances together (as in many Bollywood productions, “Bagban” is a drama interspersed with a lot of - in this case, too big a few musical episodes. <br /> <br /> Anyone who knows anything about story-telling at all knows that such pure bliss cannot be left unpunished for a long time, and that all this joy is only a prelude to some horrible catastrophe doomed to the collapse of our g the tin of the unsuspecting revelers. Knowing this, we spend the first hour of the movie in terrible anticipation, wondering what form this disaster will take when it finally comes. Thunder crashed about an hour after Raj announced to his children that he and the mother decided to move in with one of their families, leaving the choice that the children and their respective spouses would decide. Suddenly, as King Lear discovered the vipers hidden in the family womb, Raj discovers that his children are not so loving, disinterested and want to share their home and life and with his parents, as he originally thought. It is clear that, in horror from such a prospect, the children, in order to thwart the plans of their parents, came up with a scheme according to which Raj would live with one of his children, and Pooja would live with another; then they will turn off until, in the end, each of the children has the opportunity to accept both parents, and then the cycle will be repeated indefinitely. Much to the chagrin of the children, the parents join the plan, even if they are deeply in love with each other and have never separated. Thus, the second and the third hour is spent on how two aging (albeit married) lovers yearn for each other, while their ungrateful, insensitive kids do everything in their power so that parents understand how undesirable they are in their homes. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems of Bagbana is that it lacks subtlety both in telling stories and in the direction. The love that Ray and Pooja feel for each other, as well as the almost frivolous closeness of the family cell, lays so much in the first hour that the film is almost destroyed under the weight of sentimentality. Then, with little or no warning, the script turns on a dime and turns children into insensible, selfish monsters, and parents into passive, tearful victims of this callousness. Raj and Pooja are a bit too long in the tooth and too independent to make love with dreamy eyes, puffed up and unresponsive, more suitable for school students in love than parents of four-legged children. The violet style of prose, in which every emotion is underlined and underlined, leads to an intense reappraisal and heavy dependence on banal snapshots of reaction and melodramatic music for punctuation. Musical numbers initially convey a certain liberating joy, but they last so long and appear so often that they quickly lose their effectiveness and serve only to gain material in unbearable proportions. For at least an hour it would be possible to cut out of this bloated production without visible harm - and quite a bit of benefit. In fact, there is no reason why this film should last for three hours. The most glaring of all is the seemingly endless dispute to which we are exposed - a speech in which Raj (who somehow managed to turn his experience into an award-winning bestseller) gives us a lecture on the truth of the relationship between parents and children for at least least ten minutes in a row. <br /> <br /> Bagban is a juicy banal saga filled with more sugar and sticky liquid than a box of king-size chocolates. Sample at your own risk.
