A whole group of teenagers gather around to discuss their fears, but an uninvited guest appeared and kills everyone. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst horror film of the 90s - Camp Blood (1999) - the only film that can challenge him for this title, contains some of the silliest characters and situations that have ever been decorated television screen. The so-called unexpected ending is awful, like the rest of this movie. Mildly entertaining at sooo bad - this is a good level. My rating: 2 out of 10.
