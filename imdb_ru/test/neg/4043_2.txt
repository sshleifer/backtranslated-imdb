This film was so stupid that I could not believe what I saw when I watched it, it looked like a huge train wreck - I could not look away, because it was SO horribly awful! I can honestly say that I have never seen anything so bad in my entire life. It was so stupid, and the acting was so deplorable that I just kept thinking: “It's just some kind of joke, right? Nobody really makes a movie so shitty on purpose, right? ”I really hope this is just a bad joke, and these people don't really expect people to look at it with an open face, and I really hope that did the people who were in this film do horrible actions on purpose and don't believe that they are good actors ?! However, looking at transvestites is quite funny, like cheese special effects right from a science fiction film from the 80s. <br /> <br /> View it only if you have already seen all the other films in existence in the first place, and there is nothing more to watch! I would give this a “0” if it were possible.
