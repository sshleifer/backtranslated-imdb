I am now 22 years old, and I remember watching this movie in theaters when it just came out. You heard me right, I was 5 years old, and yet I still clearly remember what I saw that day so many years ago. Was this a mystical journey through the fantasy world of Mark Twain? ... No, on the other hand, it was a rather creepy movie about the dark, depressed and actually suicidal side of Mark Twain. One scene that still bothers me was a particularly strange scene in which Mark Twain plays the organ at his own funeral. <br /> <br /> Will an adult watch this movie? Well, in this film, quite possibly, there are some interesting points of view that a person with a practical knowledge of the writings of Mark Twain might like; but believe me, Adventure is NOT the movie you want to use to introduce your young children to Mark Twain.
