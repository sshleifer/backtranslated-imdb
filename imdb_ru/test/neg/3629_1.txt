Zeoy101 ?? Indeed, this should be one of the most stupid attempts to attract the attention of people in my age group. This is about some neat girl named Zoya and her friends who are attending a boarding school. !!! boring All she does is whimpers and complains and behaves like a spoiled idiot. I remember this show was released in 2005, I was 13 and I was 14, and even then I thought it was meaningless. The only episode I ever liked was when the boys hid the camera in a girls' hostel. THAT'S ALL. Anyway, I just don’t understand why Nickel - Oh, my bad Nick feels the need to syndicate this pathetic bad excuse of “entertainment.” What is with this generation? <br /> <br /> In any case, R.I.P. Nickelodeon 1979-1998? / 2005?
