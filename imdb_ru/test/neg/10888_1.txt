This film should receive the title of "Welcome to the jungle", "Hitcher" and "Dream Catcher" for sheer godlessness. You have the most annoying heroine in the story of blood, who spends most of her time, sobbing, screaming and screaming - all the time in the most terrible toilet where the toilet was ever removed. Why she spends so much time in this terrible bathroom from hell is never explained. Even when an ordinary killer truck driver tries to kill her, she refuses to leave the shit. When a police motorcycle comes to her aid, the killer truck driver runs around the policeman's legs, and the heroine just looks. Instead of grabbing his weapon for protection, she drags the poor bib at the crapper and locks the door. Then the policeman orders her to knock out his brains because of the pain. She does it - crying, sobbing and shrill - and flings it off the back of his head. Then the policeman, still alive, begs her to shoot him again, because he is still in pain. He says this while the whole head is on the floor. The sobbing, crying heroine shoots him again. The film goes on and on and there is no point in it. The heroine is so unpleasant that you really want the killer to kill her early. I saw this movie on Sci-Fi, so it didn't cost me to watch, but I still watched, out of pure admiration for how a movie can turn out to be so terrible.
