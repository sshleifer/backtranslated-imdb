Hello everyone, I just wanted to tell you some crazy facts about this movie. In fact, I was one of the Make-up FX artists who help create the “monster” for this film, and I must say that the original creature looked absolutely amazing. I remember when we got the first photos from the set, we all talked about how sorry it was that the creature was in a movie that probably would have been pretty poor. <br /> <br /> What actually happened, although it was that Jason Palmer did the original make-up for Sasquatch, for some reason they had to go back and shoot most of the creature. The sad part was that Jason had passed away a few weeks before, and the altered creature was far from as amazing as the original. <br /> <br /> For me, it was pretty sad, because it was the final of Jason's film, and he seemed to have been deceived because of his bad skirmish. In any case, I thought you guys might find it a bit interesting, and if you want, you can go to mmmyeah.com and check out some backstage photos. <br /> <br /> Later, Jeff
