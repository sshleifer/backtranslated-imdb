I believe that the company that made this film wanted people to think about films about Conan, but unfortunately, for those who made this film, he does just that. You're gonna think, dude, the movies with Conan were pretty cool ... this is absolutely boring and sucks. History, who cares? It will not help you to enjoy this movie more or less, as it looks like a really cheap movie. Arnold, it does not seem that he belongs to this, why he agreed to play this role, I canâ€™t do it. Well, probably for the money. I just love the monster in the water, which turns out to be a machine. Lame! This movie is just plain awful.
