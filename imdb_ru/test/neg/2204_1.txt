This film is such an incredible piece of shit. First let me tell you about the pros: Sandra Bullock in a black bathing suit. <br /> <br /> Now the rest of the story, which is pretty bad. We said that programmer Angela Bennett (whose online profile is ANGEL, DOWNLOAD !!! I bet that the directors cheered for him for one hour), basically checks the software of another company for errors / glitches, etc. So , we start with her pizza order. on the Internet and then put a fireplace on her (EXTREME computer skills shown so far). This happens after it has detected a virus in a macintosh program that destroys the entire system after pressing the escape key. This is obviously a HUGE problem, but the virus created for this can be created in about 1 minute using a simple batch file. <br /> <br /> Any event that we promote. She gets this call from some other guy (who works for the same company), and this fool says to click this symbol, which seems to open some kind of secret internet gateway to a bunch of unprotected “top secret” data woohoo! Angela keeps this shit on the disk, and now the people who created this loophole want to get it. This, of course, only after she contacts only one of the bad guys, BEFORE he tries to kill her, BEFORE she jumps into the ocean from his boat, BEFORE she gets into a random hospital. <br /> <br /> Problem # 1: You cannot create a loophole on the Internet to access the most secret FBI data. Where the hell did this happen? Since when is a group of hackers able to control the main stream of the Internet (even at 95)? Problem # 2: Angela will need proper identification before being released in a hospital or clinic. She couldn't just pack her things and leave. <br /> <br /> Then these “hackers” or someone else will change Angela’s identity card so that she cannot get help from anyone, and it’s convenient enough for her entire identity card to disappear. Therefore, she returns home, and the pursuit of a cat and mouse continues and continues. <br /> <br /> Apparently, all the police and the FBI officers are stupid and do not believe her. Then she will have to use a bunch of tactics to get into the building where she works (where the person who replaces her is now working) and return to her old computer. She starts talking to some other random guy and finds out who is behind everything through some BS IP address, and the director knows that the audience is too stupid to believe it. <br /> <br /> Then she runs to some center to send all this information to the FBI. She apparently should have used the mainframe to send letters to the FBI. But then the same fool who tried to kill her BEFORE throwing her into the water, catches her and again easily breaks the FBI (indistinctly?). But remember this cool virus? Well, somehow she was lucky, and although the virus worked only on software, now it works on the entire system. It destroys the whole mainframe, which contains all the fake information, because the mainframe just sat in the middle of some kind of convention ... WHAT IS HELL! In any case, now the uber-virus works, and Angela (now real) runs away, and then kills the evil dude with a fire extinguisher. He, of course, has a gun, he runs up to her, so that he is at a distance of 2 feet, and then decides to take aim. CLASSIC Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is full of bullshit and crap. Anyone who knows little about computers will be fooled wildly into thinking that this shit is possible, but there is nothing exact about computers or the network. And I sincerely doubt that I will see a multiplatform Mac virus and mainframe (* LMAO cough *).
