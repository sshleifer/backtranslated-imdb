Michael Caine usually appears in very good ones (“To blame for Rio”, “Suta”, “Without a key”, “Gambit”, “Dirty rotten villains”) or in really bad comedies (“Noise away”, “Death becomes her”) . "," Harry and Walter go to New York "). This falls into the latter category. <br /> <br /> TA is a comedy that does well in only two things: the ability to spend the cast, including Kane, Gambon and Richardson, each of whom has comedic abilities, and succeed in this. The mission does not make the viewer laugh. There is not a single really funny moment. The main reason is a lousy script, so much vain effort was invested in writing a meaningless confusing story, just too much bother (given that it's just a comedy) that the author (s) forgot to make this damn thing funny, which, as I recall, is the whole point of comedy. <br /> <br /> I have never seen this jerk before. Some people even say : "If you're a fan of morons, will you like it", blah blah blah. A fan of morons? Does this indescribable person really have fans? A comedy written as bad as this one requires laughter from a mega-talent or two like Steve Coogan, and not the usual jerk. <br /> <br /> If you're going to make a comedy. As for the actors, then at least make them the complete idiots they usually are. The characters Kane and Moron are not stupid enough. <br /> <br /> The single most annoying thing in this unfunny collection of scenes is the little girl. Only a truly horrible writer would have thought that in order to make the lousy scenario more acute, it would be advisable to include a super-intelligent wise child. Smart kids ** are no longer funny to Bill Cosby's fans. In "Little Miss Sunshine" we had a completely normal baby, and she was very funny. This stupid kid "smarter than an adult" belongs to the film about the Marx brothers, who turned a century.
