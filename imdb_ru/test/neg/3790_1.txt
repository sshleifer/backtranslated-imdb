I think I finally saw the Worst movie ever made, and it hurts me to say that. As a big fan of indie movies, gay or not, I had high hopes. However, a few minutes later a sheriff appeared in the film, and I voted for the worst actor of this or any other century. His performance and dialogue, which he was forced to perform, caused me an unusual step - to stop the DVD on my track. A few hours later, when I had the courage to press the play button again, it was no better. <br /> <br /> In addition to the sheriff and his racist deputies, the film has an attractive cast in which I felt sincere sympathy, as they had such a pathetic script. The idea of ​​the film is beautiful - to use the lynching of gays in the "New South" in the same way that blacks in the Old South did, leaving "strange fruits" hanging from the trees. <br /> <br /> With an experienced writer and director, we could have a film. Instead, we get fake detective work, platitudes about homosexuality and cliches with one good white man trying to save the day. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that racism is still flourishing. Currently, the FBI is investigating the actions of the driver of a white school bus in the back forest of Louisiana, which forced black children to get to the back of the bus. But this city is a caricature, and it’s hard to believe anything you see or hear. <br /> <br /> There are several plots in a weak attempt to make the main character more three-dimensional, but for the most part they also fail. <br /> <br /> On the very masochistic DVD there are some deleted scenes that will leave you on the run. <br /> <br /> This is probably the first film that makes me believe that the writers / directors have to pass the test and get the license before they can make the film. Although I would look forward to seeing several actors in the best films, it would be difficult for me to see anything else from this director.
