As a complete movie fan with a successful video shop manager, I tend to watch all kinds of movies, from good to very bad. It was a film that had so many lines like a rib, idiotic CGI effects and predictable plot plots, and I continued to laugh before turning it off after 30-40 minutes. In the films of the genre of "creature feature" in recent years quite awful things have been released (Godzilla 2000, anyone?), But this film makes me think that the creators did not even try. It may be worth checking out only the potential of “making fun of me” (count the shots!), But I couldn’t recommend this film to anyone with a clear conscience.
