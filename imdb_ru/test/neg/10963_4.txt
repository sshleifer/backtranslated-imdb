“Fast and Undead” is finally the first film that actually makes its own storyline invalid. In fact, this is one giant hole in the plot. <br /> <br /> In addition, the acting was rather bad, there was no character motivation, or they were just incredible, and there was not a single character worthy of putting on our hat. The most interesting cast (who had a lot of potential to be the protagonist of the dark horse) was killed halfway through the hearing. <br /> <br /> What Fast and Undeath serve as is an excellent example of how to do good color synchronization. It looked great if you take into account budget considerations. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it looks like the guy took hundreds of thousands into his hands and watched a few westerns (especially “Good”, “Bad” and “The”). Awful), and then just accidentally threw a bunch of elements into the movie ... "You know, they have films where characters do IT! Is it suitable here? No, but who cares! They do it in other films, that's why should do it here! " <br /> <br /> Maybe this is a good view for beginning filmmakers and colorists (first-year filmmakers). Otherwise, be sure to skip.
