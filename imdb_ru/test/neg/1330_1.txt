This movie was terrible! My friend and I were so bored that we quickly advanced in the last half of the film to see what happened. This is a typical sporting thing, it either wins or loses. The only remotely interesting thing was when one guy called someone Veg-e-tab-le. This will be a feature that my friend and I have been bringing up for years to come, reminding us of this colossal stupid waste of time.
