A group of four young people attending a prestigious private school belongs to the old Testament, which was formed by their ancestors during a witch hunt in the late 1600s. Each of them has the power to age them whenever they use it, and they suspect that the new child at the academy may be from a family that is believed to have died long ago. This new guy wants everyone’s strength to be for himself. <br /> <br /> This is not a horror film, as he tries to imagine. Yes, there is magic and all such supernatural, but in reality it’s just an action movie. Very mediocre fighter. Focusing almost exclusively on being cool and sleek and paying only minimal attention to the plot, which has a lot of sadly unused room for interesting twists. But no one has been inserted, and even before the movie is half finished, you will understand what is being played and by whom. <br /> <br /> There are several good scenes here and there, first of all an exploding machine that magically recovers after a collision with a big rig, but that's about it. Worst of all, director Rennie Harlin, who is credited with some very interesting, if not clever films, relies heavily on explosive metal music and leads the film too sexy, making him possibly the stupidest horror film from the time of the disastrous Alone in the Dark. " It's not as bad as Alone in the Dark, as some attractive scenes are actually sleek and not ridiculously incompetent, but in the end, the highest that this film can count on is a good and cozy home. on late night cable. 3/10 <br /> <br /> PG-13 rating: violent acts
