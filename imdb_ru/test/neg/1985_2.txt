I bought this film on DVD, despite the "stale" review, and it was idiocy ... This review was absolutely accurate, and I have never seen a single worst "erotic" film in my long life! Even if it was partly perfectly filmed and had an interesting setting, plus a good cover ... But my own Extreme Erotica films (c) are more than 100 times more erotic (only in the soft delightful aspect), probably less than 100 times films budget! The story has no logical connection with the first film or the famous book ... Or any new (exciting) element of teaching slaves, with the exception of some very strange and sad events ... Then the main male character, Klaus Kinski, did not watch a little it looks like the second Master "O", which he is trying to play ... And even the beautiful Ariel Dombal did not look amazing in any scene!
