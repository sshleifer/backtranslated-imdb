In this film were all components of a good adventure film, but he showed incompetence on almost every level. <br /> <br /> Roger Moore’s presence on the cast is usually a sign that the film will not be more than mediocre, because Moore always has the lead roles and cannot act. But there were also Yen Holm and Lee Marvin in this film, and it was based on Smith Wilbur's book, so I thought I would give him a chance by seeing the DVD for sale in the shopping basket ... <br /> <br /> This there was a mistake. The initial scene seemed to start in the middle of the video, and the sound suddenly appeared, as if the first second of the sound was cut off. The scene showed a dreadnought at sea with the German team. This bad editing was a sign of future events, but the dreadnought scene was interesting enough to keep me in sight. The special effects were good, and the team wore a proper uniform and spoke German, indicating that the director at least paid attention to the historical details. I am surprised. <br /> <br /> I kept watching, and then Moore appeared, and my suspicions were confirmed. Bad play, clichéd lines, clichéd cinematography and cheap humor ... but worst of all, a catastrophic attempt was made to blend the film’s carefree sensation with serious drama and tragedy. It just does not work. <br /> <br /> The movie ends just as suddenly and as bad as it started ?? in the middle of the drum.
