American television AZN acquired the rights to this film, and the network shows it using the English name THE PICKPOCKET. <br /> <br /> In 1997, THE PICKPOCKET raises an amateur movie in the style of home cinema to incredible levels of trouble. The film depicts a boring series of boring wanderings uninteresting, confused guy. This main character, Xiao Wu, is not just wandering aimlessly. Viewers, unfortunately, will soon realize that Xiao Wu has an unsurpassed talent to seek, and will remain inactive near the most unpleasant sounds that can be found in China. Empty tin buckets ring, beaten with a stick - he is there. Every old motor in China suffers in agony - he is there. Crying baby? Yes, you guessed it, it's here! According to KEY, China is the most annoying and unpleasant place on planet Earth. <br /> <br /> The only element that is worse than the BRICK sound is photography. The camera shakes, shakes and shakes a little more. Finally, the camera stops, but then falls on the actor's knees and just stays there until someone on the team is aware of the mistake and starts shaking the camera again. Most of the shaky film is created in the form of long, long, long, long frames. Several times, when the camera approaches, nothing can convince the viewer what is happening. <br /> <br /> The photo is muddy, faded and often blurred. Use of color - well, there are no signs of intelligence controlling the use of color. Most of each shot is held 20 times longer. Few movies are so painful to watch. This film is painful to watch and painful to hear. And then everything just ends. <br /> <br /> Fans of John Woo may like the opportunity to hear part of the soundtrack to DIE XUE SHUANG XIONG (THE KILLER), as the main character hangs outside the video store for many minutes. In any case, be careful - the pickpocket will steal your good time.
