Thomas Edison may have made many wonderful inventions, but WTF is !!!! I'm sorry, but this movie is just awful. The plot is that this elephant goes to a certain point and gets an electric shock. Well, the image quality looked like someone was using it for toilet paper. I thought Charlie Chaplinâ€™s early films were terrible. Well, Thomas Edison may have been an inventor, but why he made this film, he could have made the child fed, and it would have been better. People may say that I am harsh at times, but you would enjoy something similar to what I said, Edison could have made a light bulb, but why did he make this particular film? Well, I could sound like a complete hole # but watch it on Youtube, then you will see this filth. I still can not believe that this film is absolutely terrible. In general, the worst short film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10
