Hello from Lithuania. <br /> <br /> This is the first question that comes up after watching this “movie”. <br /> <br /> You know, I saw a lot of bad movies in my life, but after watching it, I had only two questions: 1) It was just a parody (deception) <br /> <2) How people could create such a thing!? <br /> <br /> If you have never seen this “film”, then you REALLY do not know what a REALLY bad “film” is. I mean BAD. Scenario - Are you kidding me? The acting is so terrible that I play the role of "actors" where I just have fun in this movie. I know this movie is "B", but come on ?? Should this be a reason to be such garbage ?? <br /> <br /> Oh! And what an end !!! Must miss the end! Just when you realize that this is the worst thing you have ever seen, wait until the end - because you have NEVER seen THAT end (and I hope that you will never see). <br /> <br /> Excluded this “film” at any cost, and do not say that I did not warn you ...
