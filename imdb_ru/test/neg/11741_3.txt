What an embarrassment ... It is not true to the original with the terrible play of everyone in this film, Hitchcock must be spinning in his grave. The scene where Marion is murdered in the shower is simply ineffective and unoriginal. The only thing that is good is that they used the same music, and it is so obvious who killed her in the shower. I rate this movie 3/10
