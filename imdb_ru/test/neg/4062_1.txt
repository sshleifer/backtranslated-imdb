Aircraft 747 Jumbo. The cabin is located on the upper deck of the 747 aircraft. In the film, pilots do not climb stairs in the 1st class cabin to get to the cabin. They go to the front of the cabin of the 1st class and through the door to the cabin. What a bug !!! The front of the first class cabin has a wardrobe for jackets and a TV screen. Behind this is the radar dome. Before takeoff 747 shows the start of a taxi to the runway. On takeoff, the plane has only two engines. Area 747 has four engines. Who was responsible for the continuity in this film? At the beginning of the flight, toilets suddenly appear in front of the plane - another farcical blunder !!! After that, the front of the aircraft becomes rear and vice versa. At that moment I stopped watching. Absolute trash !!!
