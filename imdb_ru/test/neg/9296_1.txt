Perhaps this is one of the worst films I have experienced with discontent in my entire life. The plot is funny and the characters are terrible people. I watched this movie with 3 friends, and we all agreed to turn it off 30 minutes before the end. The character of Ben Kingsley is just stupid, but not funny at all. It's amazing why the actor of his talent was involved in such a hoax. Leoni's tea makes a wonderful impression on Hillary Clinton, depicting a very cold and uninteresting woman leader, with all the charming qualities of a broom handle. Add a meaningless and inexplicable plot and terribly shrinking worthy installation, and in the end you will waste 93 minutes (60 in my case). Avoid this movie at all costs!
