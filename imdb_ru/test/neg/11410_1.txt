I saw this movie about 6 or 7 times, and it really gets funnier every time. Perhaps what I like most about the tired character paradigms that the film offers us: a gloomy American hero, his blond girlfriend, a spectacled theater nerd, a brunette, an antagonistic athlete and a brunette No. 2. Nevertheless, we have two martial arts specialists magician with mullet driving a convertible. If someone can explain this, please contact me. Other highlights include Bobby Johnston’s image of the joker character, Dell, and his trademark: “That's why I keep her close.” Observing the work of Johnston, it is not surprising that his career quickly descended into the area of ​​soft core porn. (SPOILER) In addition, after several views, I still have absolutely no idea what this big demon is saying at the end at any moment; it's just electronically muffled noises. Well, okay, this is probably the best. And finally, why are all demons so slippery? Is wet skin more terrible? This, of course, did not help in this film.
