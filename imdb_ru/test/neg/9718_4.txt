Think "Charmed" with testosterone instead of estrogen, and you get a general idea of ​​this picture. A very unpleasant story with mediocre effects and an anti-climax opening the door for the second part. Let's hope that someone has a reason to spend their money wiser. I would suggest “Enchanted - film”, because compared to this “Enchanted” kicked my ass, and I only watched this show to please my girlfriend !!!! Wait and watch it on the DVD on a rainy Sunday when you have nothing to do. Or even better to download it, so as not to waste money. The first 15 minutes were fine. But the funniest line from the film, as well as the only highlight of this film, is when Reed says: “Kiss me in the ass, Harry Potter,” as you ride along the rock. Although they are not worthy of kissing Potter's ass, because Potter is much cooler and, at least, his films have a story. The cup of fire was even worse than this !!!
