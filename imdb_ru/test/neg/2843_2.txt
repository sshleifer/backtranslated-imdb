At first I thought that this film was supposed to be a comedy / horror, when I saw the body in the bathroom with the lady who stood there and screamed again and again, but when the film continued, the film became more and more flat. , The plot was stupid due to the fact that the person was upset that real estate prices rose, and now he decides to call a radio psychiatrist and babble rage because he has nothing to do. Then the law comes into force and desperately tries to make us feel that they really do not care who is calling and try their best to track down this guy. One suspect after another is being charged. This film is terrible, and the slow love scenes of Adrian B. and her husband are boring and made me just rewind the movie forward. Avoid it!
