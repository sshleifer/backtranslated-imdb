Zombie Revenge is a rather weak and barely passable zombie attempt. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Journey to Bayou, Larry Adams (Robert Lowry) and Scott Warrington (Maurits Hugo) report that a friend has died. Meeting with the local doctor von Altermann (John Carradine), he repeats the thought that they mysteriously died. While they are there, they realize that help consists of zombies, the walking dead, who follow the orders of their master. When bodies accumulate, he discovers that he made creatures for use in various experiments, and everyone tries to stop him before it is too late. <br /> <br /> Good News: here it becomes very little right. Opening is easy, best of all, because it has some excellent marks for it. From the place where it begins, with eerie silhouettes walking in the dark and right up to the revelations, this one works wonders with its mystery and magnificent images. Big is really the scene where the creature comes out of the coffin with a long, slow and creepy shot. All this is done before the opening credits, and this is an amusing picture of the Scene in the middle, where the creature awakens inside the coffin, rather frightening and looks really gorgeous. The last big positive is a really fun final. With a finale that recalls the many attempts at Universal, this one fits into this style. From eerie resuscitation to real action related to the swamp, this is fun and really works together with others to give only real positives. <br /> <br /> Bad news: there are only a couple of flaws here, but they are major. The first is the main boredom of the film from inaction. Almost nothing happens here, mainly because of the tendency to do everything with the help of conversation, and not anything else. There are only intermittent scenes reserved for zombies, but there is nothing here that would devote an action to the film. It simply has no action, and this is what hurts the film. He rarely generates scenes that hold interest, and sometimes it makes him feel much longer than it actually is. The final drawback of the film is the pitiful zombie excuses. Those who are accustomed to more modern fare will find it difficult to get rid of these creatures, and in fact they serve only a few scenes. This does not refer to zombies as threats, which makes them even less frightening. A little screen time, non-threatening nature and non-modernist behavior of these zombies really ruins it. That's what really hurt the film. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: with bad zombies and hardly worth watching, this is a curious effort. Those who are used to modern zombies are unlikely to be interested in this and get the same thing as this one, while only classic horror fans are encouraged to give it a chance. <br /> <br /> Today's Rating-PG: Mild Violence
