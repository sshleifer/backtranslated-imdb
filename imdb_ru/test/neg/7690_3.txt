The mass of excitement and the tremendous success that this film has encountered testifies to how desperately our people suffer in regard to a good independent Saudi film. In fact, the huge success of “Tash Mathash” is also evidence. <br /> <br /> I’m not going to start talking about how important it is to make films, since it’s obvious to those who are in the dim light how movies have changed the world. <br /> <br /> And I'm not going to say how much our society needs a lot of films to clarify many of the problems that exist in our country. Religion, politics, women's rights, education, general health, terrorism, law and much more. <br /> <br /> At the same time, there was news about the first Saudi film, which was to become a means of solving some of our problems. especially in relation to youth. Instead, we experienced a bald movie for that matter. <br /> <br /> The ignorance and naivety of the script were obvious. As if it was written by a 13 year old teenager. <br /> <br /> Now I heard that the budget for this film is huge. I would like to know where the money went, eh? The effects were really terrible, editing was bad. The script was "Harabit". You really do not know what this story is and what the director of this film is directed at. <br /> <br /> A note about an actor who played a religious brother, his performance was good, but with poor leadership. Another thing with the role of the religious friends he had was not how religious guys act here in Saudi Arabia! They are not "Evil," as this film intends. In fact, this is one of the nicest people you have ever met, having an unusual lifestyle, and this is exactly what should have appeared in the film. <br /> <br /> Youth follow religiosity here, because of reason, namely, the youth is the most passionate and sentimental. And with well-formed principles on which religious leaders live, young people follow them. Again, this is what should have appeared. <br /> <br /> We need another “First Film” with a Saudi writer, actor, director, composer and even an operator. So that they all worked with enthusiasm on their experiment, and not just for the sake of money! <br /> <br /> And we must do what Shakespeare did hundreds of years ago; we must include phrases from the Quran in the script of the film. Since people in our society still see art as a form of sin, the challenge faced by Saudi filmmakers is changing the mentality from this angle.
