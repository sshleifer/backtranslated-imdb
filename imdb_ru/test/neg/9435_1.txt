At the beginning of the film it is easy to say exactly what will happen and who will die. These are about 4 women and a man who is on vacation. This was done at the end of the ultra-Nazi seventies, when blondes were supposedly surviving ultra-Americans, and brunettes deserved to die. <br /> <br /> This film, like the others in that era, tries it on, and the viewer knows it. There is no secret, no waiting. People quarrel, but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of that time, it is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Five people meet with two wild young characters and go crazy. All crazy, so a team of directors and directors can justify their Nazi propaganda. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the guy is attracted to a blonde who really doesnâ€™t have much to watch, and she ignores the super hot brunette that any heterosexual man will go crazy. It should be remembered that in the seventies films were intended for women, not for men. <br /> <br /> Absolutely shitty and totally depressing.
