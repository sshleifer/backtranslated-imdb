This show reminds me of an episode of The Simpsons, where Smithers was fired by Mr. Burns and was forced to lead a miserable life, being unemployed. Everything he did while it was time to drink and watch Comedy Central. The implication was that Comedy Central was a miserable television channel for unfortunate people who had nothing more to waste time. “Mind of Mencia” is slightly better than most Comedy Central programs, but it still serves as an example of why this channel is a poor-quality filler for people who have absolutely no lives. <br /> <br /> In truth, Mencia is a fairly competent comedian who throws out banal, humorous ethnic jokes and cheats on tasteless stereotypes of people based on race, gender or economic status, or a combination of the two of these three characteristics . If you heard one of these jokes by one of your friends at a bar or at work, trust me, you heard what sounds like the comedy "The Mind of Mencia." Carlos is also trying to make fun of current events, but he lacks creativity or originality. This is not to say that Carlos is constantly washed out. I found some of his parodies funny, such as his rap video as an oil sheik. If you find a relaxed, mediocre comedy in your side street, you will probably like The Mind of Mencia. For those people who are tired of repetitive, pedestrian comedians, sticking out the same old time worn jokes, stay away.
