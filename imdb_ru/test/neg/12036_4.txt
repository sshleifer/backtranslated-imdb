MARY, MARY, BLOODY MARY is a normal time killer. He has a uniformly attractive cast, the action is rarely boring. There are a lot of kills. And production values ​​are not bad. But in the end, he plays like a standard 1970s TV episode with the addition of nude. The film is the end product of an “author” trying to make a purely commercial film. There is very little depth, and the film spends too much time on chases and action films. With the exception of a scene on the beach with an old man, MMBM is practically devoid of any scares, suspense or fear. The director understands the horror genre very little. <br /> <br /> This is watchable, although it does not leave an indelible impression.
