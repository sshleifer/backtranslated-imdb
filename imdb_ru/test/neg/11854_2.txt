I'm a big fan of Eric Roberts, I collect his films and still get to 60. But honestly, sometimes he really makes horrible films. But hey, that's why I like him — he's interesting. <br /> <br /> But this one has to take the price, I can't stop wondering why. Somehow they managed to attract Eric, as well as Corbin Burnsen to the picture. <br /> <br /> While Bernsen is just awful (I really don’t like him), Roberts manages to be the best in the film (and that doesn’t mean much) He practically does it on a routine basis. <br /> <br /> A woman's leash (Brasselle) is like a plastic doll and behaves like one. And Tim Abell and his team are like plastic action dolls and behave like those. <br /> <br /> The plot is really confusing. I have not seen a single film of Carnosaur, so I can not remember the footage that was added from there, but this explains some things. But still there are huge holes on the site, similar to craters. <br /> <br /> WARNING ABOUT SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The first attacks are outside the laboratory in a nearby forest. But in the end, they tear the whole laboratory to pieces and just relax when it's over, but they forget about those outside. ?????? <br /> <br /> When a helicopter pilot eats alive, I wonder she could not see how the T-Rex climbs into the helicopter ???? <br /> <br /> Guys in orange jumpsuits are my favorite - what are they doing for jogging or something like that? <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a standard B-film sex scene with silicone boobs. This time we are met by Lorissa McComas. I have no problem with this (it looks terrible), but I look at the guy who is clutching her boobs and is on the verge of climax for 8 !!!! minutes are too long. <br /> <br /> Shame on you all (including Eric Roberts) - now I look forward to watching Con Games (interesting ???)
