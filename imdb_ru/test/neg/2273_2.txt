Oh yes, I have to agree with others who describe it as terrible. The acting in this four-hour film is equally bad, so bad that I find it impossible to believe that any of the actors in this performance could make a living as an actor. I'm still wondering who made the casting. Each supplies their own lines, without showing any involvement or emotional attachments with any other character. It seems that no one has a real, family or other relationship with another. The direction is also terrible, and any action scene is ridiculous and inconclusive. Were the film editors asleep? <br /> <br /> The costumes seem authentic for the Regency era, but the fabrics look like the 20th century and the colors (especially blue!) sound awful, and I don't think they were available at the beginning of the 19th. The fabric of the century, with the possible exception of silk. <br /> <br /> Also hair: men have obvious haircuts from the 1970s, and women have “big hair” - especially a woman who plays Ann Elliot. <br /> <br /> All female characters, young and old, are quite cute, but this does not compensate for the lack of acting ability. The actress, playing "Ann", looks like she is over forty, and Ann Elliot is 27 years old. I mean, where was the team of make-up artists and illuminators, if we could find a believable woman playing Ann? She spends most of her time, staring thoughtfully at the level of the horizon, whether indoors or out. I'm still interested in what it was supposed to convey. Regret possible? Yes, this production is regrettable! <br /> <br /> The actress playing Louise was really terrible. She screams, squeals, giggles and jumps around like a poorly educated twelve-year-old (my apologies to everyone who reads this for twelve years), that I was looking forward to the moment when she knocked herself out. How this behavior involves bringing in an adult man, outside of me. Most will retreat when she first opens her mouth to giggle and scream. <br /> <br /> An actor playing the role of captain Wentworth portrays someone so insensitive and colorless, someone wonders why any woman could peck at him for eight years. > <br /> Couple reunion at the end is not convincingly done or explained. How did they come together again? Not because Louise was in a coma; that's for sure. No, there must be something more, and this is not explained in the film. <br /> <br /> I rate this performance with two stars: one because it is the work of Ostens, and the other because some of the scenes in the open air were beautiful. The only reason I could watch the whole play was because I got the flu and got it from the library. <br /> <br /> If you liked the book, look at the 1995 version with Amanda Ruth and Ciaran Hinds. I would recommend this film, even if you have not read the book.
