I sincerely agree with Greg in Ontario. Today I watched this film with a friend, who then went to the theater manager and told him: "Perhaps it was the worst film I have ever seen." I have seen a lot of movies with this person, and he is pretty simple, so I was shocked. (The manager gave him a free pass!) <br /> <br /> I was offended by a lot of humor in the film (yes, the baked potato scene was at the top of the list!). My friend and I were white and watched a movie with a mostly black audience. For a while I thought maybe I just won’t get this film because I’m white. Then I realized that no one was laughing. The letter was bad; the direction was bad; there was almost no time. <br /> <br /> There were some funny moments, there were just too many WAYS between them. Even Plane Two was more fun than that, and that says a lot. <br /> <br /> Snoop Dogg in Starsky and Hatch (like Huggy Bear) impressed me so much that I felt that I would definitely like this movie. Not. <br /> <br /> D.L. Hewley, as usual, was funny, but his role was rather small. Tom Arnold had some funny moments in the role of the “white guy,” but most of the other attempts at humor did not match the goal. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I could not assign a negative star rating to this movie,
