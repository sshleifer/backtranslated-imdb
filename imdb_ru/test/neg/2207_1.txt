I would prefer someone to cut my eyeballs with a razor blade than to watch this movie again. I watched it from beginning to end, thinking that it could not be worse ... BUT IT'S MADE. Screenwriters and producers need to be slapped for putting this nonsense on television. The actors are ALL terrible. Get out of Hollywood, fools, and work at McDonalds, sweeping the floors and scavenging. Anyone who thinks this film is even remotely decent should be hanged. They confuse humanity. To think that we have soldiers who risk their lives for anyone who produces this meaningless trash. I am embarrassed to say that I am American.
