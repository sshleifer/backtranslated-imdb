This film is really quite strange. It is clear that some * events * depict the main character as a Dublin criminal, known as the “General,” but almost everything else is simply wrong. We are not talking about the distortion of ancient history ... but about the complete distortion of irrefutable, documented facts. The question really is, why? Garda is depicted as Keystone's latest cops, his gang is not intimidating, and the man himself is Kevin Spacey. In any case, almost pure fiction, why try to give the appearance of realism? Having said all this, this is a bad exercise * any * way you want to look at it. Not worth a second one time.
