This is one weird movie. He seems to be aimed at a youth audience, but is filled with sexual hints. The whole premise is quite absurd, not only the idea that several shriveled heads of three dead children are involved in the fight against crime, but the same thing says that children who take a gang of cool older guys are a bit contrived, but again, parents are mostly absent in the film and there are not enough authority figures to keep children in line. <br /> <br /> Although the actors are good, Meg Foster plays a very mafia-like leader, with beautiful AJ Damato as the leader of the hooligans. Aerky Egan and Rebecca Herbst have played well the role of young lovers, although the comic actress of her talent, Lee Allin Baker, is known to have been wasted in this film. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is unusual, but I don’t think that this is enough to compensate for poor quality and awkward performance. All the scenery is pretty boring, and the “special effects” are rather gloomy. Sit down if not in the mood.
