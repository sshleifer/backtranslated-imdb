Blood corridors <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.66: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: mono <br /> <br /> (black and white) <br /> <br / > London, 1840: trying to formulate an anesthetic solution, a dedicated surgeon (Boris Karloff) became addicted to drugs and was blackmailed by local drug addicts. <br /> <br /> Went on the tails of the Gothic revival caused by Hammer’s recent success, The Course of Frankenstein (1957), The Blood Corridors by Robert Day is a strange mixture of historical drama and the Great Guinoll Theater. Producer Richard Gordon lured Karloff from Hollywood, where his film career stalled on the sidelines of a B-film (VOODOO ISLAND, FRANKENSTEIN 1970, etc.), - with a couple of disgusting shockers in which good people are hindered by circumstances beyond their control. In GRIP OF THE STRANGLER (1958), he played a novelist who came across a terrible secret by exploring a series of murders from recent history, while in The Blood Corridors he is a drug addicted surgeon who falls victim to the criminal group of criminals in East End pub landowner Francis de Wolff. Rather, a horror film than a melodrama with vile triumphs, the film hedges its commercial stakes, including many thrills (cut leg, face destroyed by acid, etc.), But the story is motivated mainly by Karl’s altruistic aspiration. an anesthetic formula that will ease the terrible suffering of patients during surgery. <br /> <br /> Produced under the title "Doctor of Seven Dials", the finished film was not released until 1962 due to indifference from MGM distributors. This time, film colleague Christopher Lee earned an outstanding credit on the screen, despite playing a small but significant role in the role of Joe Resurrection, Cockney's sinister goon who kills de Wolff's carefully selected patrons and sells the remains to local doctors Lee shot this illustrious cameo before “COURSE FRANKENSTEIN” led him to international fame, which explains his limited time on the screen, although his intense performance is one of the highlights of the film. Adrienne Corrie (VAMPIRE CIRCUS) stands out as a de-Wolf partner for criminal motives, and there are several familiar faces in the lead roles, including Francis Matthews (DRACULA: PRINCE DARKNESS), Bettu St. John (CITY OF THE DEAD), Finlay Curry and Nigel Green . Excellent artistic direction (Anthony Masters) and cinematography (Jeffrey Fatful).
