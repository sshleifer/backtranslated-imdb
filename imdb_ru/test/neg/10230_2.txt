I liked the first movie, the second was fine, disappointed, John Cleese was no longer Jeanne Bob, since he is my favorite character. But the third ... what happened to the animation ??? It looks low-budget, like a morning cartoon! except for the memories that were taken from the first movie. They really should have stopped after number 2, it just makes the rest look bad !! Derek's voice has changed, but he is not as recognizable as Jean Bob. Rogers also looks very strange. I also do not understand where Rothbart came from. I thought he was dead! This film made me want to turn it off, since I love the first one, I was very disappointed with this article. They will never beat the original! :)
