Nothing but emptiness, pleasant for those who knew the eighties, but, well, pretty boring for those who are not interested in it. In this film, the script is NO, but the hero wanders through an underground New York full of artists and nightclubs. This is aimless, pointless and naive. But not entirely unpleasant.
