This, of course, is not a comedy - I do not know what it was that way. Like a serious film, it lacks any substance. Unless you have completed Sunday school or need to correct Noah, you will be bored to tears. <br /> <br /> Auxiliary composition took what was left of the film. Lauren Graham plays an empty housewife without real depth. His children add nothing to the film. It seems that at first they were just thinking about their absent father. Jonah Hill is playing a creepy internet junkie who doesn't look so humorous. <br /> <br /> I found the original worthy movie. Disappointed that this has not gone away.
