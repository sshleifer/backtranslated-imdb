Oh, gape No other chick, where all the men are pigs, and the women will benefit even from the abuse they have been subjected to. The only difference is that in this film everyone is a pig or a cereal on the brain. I hated this film because of the moral question of why it is right to send a person to prison for life for a murder that he did not commit. This is a more immoral act than his insult and deceit. This film shows all the situational ethics of bad writing. I saw it on the CBC series "Best of Britain". If this is the best of Britain, it is not surprising that the British film industry is in trouble. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in this film is David Tennant, he plays his character so disgusting that I probably will not care about the next person who speaks with a Scottish accent. Kate Ashfield tries to play the role of the victim, but in the end it turns out to be as immoral as the character of David Tennant. They deserve each other. <br /> <br /> In the “brain cough” category there are parents who see nothing wrong with the clearly psychotic Brendan. The English police look so incompetent that they cannot issue travel tickets. The union of British police officers must sue the creators of this film for defamation. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth the electricity you need to run and watch your DVD.
