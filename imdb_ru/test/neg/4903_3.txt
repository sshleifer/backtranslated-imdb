After some internet surfing, I found the series "Homefront" on DVD on ioffer.com. Before anyone got excited, the DVD I received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded on their TV 15 years ago. Permission and quality leaves much to be desired. Images look as if you were expecting to see an old rewritten video. Although the commercials were edited, the final credits of each episode still contain voice announcements for a segway in the ABC "Nightline" news program, supplemented with headlines from top news since the early 1990s. Even with low image quality, you could watch shows, and the sound quality was good. <br /> <br /> To the credit of this show, the casting was almost perfect. All were believable and really looked from the outside. Their game was also above average. The role of Jeff Metcalf especially well played by Kyle Chandler (the last time he was seen in the remake of King Kong, 2005). The costumes of the period were very authentic, as were the scenery, especially the kitchens of the 1940s with antique fixtures and decorations. The direction was also creative and great for TV shows at the time. For example, conversations between characters sometimes overlapped with conversations on the same topic between other characters in different scenes. The dialogue of various conversations was constant, despite the fact that it was shortened and the fourth between different characters and locations. This requires good direction and editing, and they made it work in this case. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this show again, I suddenly remembered why I lost interest in him 15 years ago. Despite all the components of a good show, the plots and storylines from the very beginning are frustrating and confusing. On the one hand, the very name of the show is misleading. When the Second World War ended in 1945, there was no more fighting, therefore, obviously, there was no longer any “homeland”. Curiously, the first episode of the show "Homefront" begins in 1945 after the end of the war. It's like shooting the first episode of Gilligan Island, showing the escape of the runaways. The entire premise of the namesake of the show is completely lost. I still held the hope that the rest of the series will become a memory, but no, the whole performance takes place from 1946 to 1948. In addition, this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately depict any historical events of the late 1940s. By the third episode, it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled means for ultra-left political tasks. The show takes place in River Run Ohio, near Toledo. However, the continuing theme of the racism show makes it look more like Jackson Mississippi than Ohio. Part of the cast are Dick Williams, Hattie Winston and Sterling Mazer, Jr., who portray the Davis family. Much of the series shows that the Davis family is being discriminated against by evil “whites” to such an extent that it is ridiculous and completely absurd, if not ridiculous. The racism map has been played and replayed by Hollywood for over 40 years. We get it. We are also tired of daily rubbing noses into it. The theme of racism is also unpopular with the audience, and this is the kiss of death for any show, as it was for Homefront. Williams, Winston, and Maser's acting talents were wasted as a stereotypical “scared / evil black family.” The wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes you think that everyone in Ohio was KKK members or something like that. The problem of racism could be dealt with in this show in one episode with a simple punch on the nose or a fist fight in which the fanatic gets a well-deserved beating, and leave it at that. The dedication of most of the series to things of racism is aging very quickly, and this is just silly. <br /> <br /> Another ridiculous storyline depicts the main boss of a local factory (Ken Jenkins) as a character similar to Ebenezer Scrooge, who is against pensions and promotion, and does not care about acid dripping on his employees. The workers revolt and seize the factory in a clear pro-communist propaganda message for the viewer. <br /> <br /> Personally, I believe that this series had great potential. Could authors easily place a chart in 1941? 1945, as the name implies, shows the difficulties of food and gas rationing and working 14 hours a day at military factories. Of course, the loss of brothers, sons and husbands fighting abroad would also add drama. The situation was also ideal for writing special guest stars as military or USO personnel passing through their city while studying or on their way to Europe or the Pacific Ocean. The possibilities for good storylines and plots are endless. But no, Homefront authors (David Assael and James Grissom) completely ignored any relevant or interesting stories. Instead, they completely missed the point and went into a strange and inappropriate obsession with racism and leftist politics. It would be unfair if the actors condemned the entire series, but the stories and the situations in which they were placed are garbage.
