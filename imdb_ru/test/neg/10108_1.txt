<br /> <br /> Spoilers <br /> <br /> I'll be so kind with this movie (some people, including directors, can get upset when the reviewers give their opinion), therefore ... <br /> < br /> A pleasant car accident happened and the opening credits look good and ... that's all; everything else bites big. All actions are terrible, the script is embarrassing, special effects look like they were done by schoolchildren on cheap computers. In general, this film has serious tendencies to bowling. <br /> <br /> Like a horror film, it’s not very scary, and if he assumed that the “thinking man” horror film was good, then at some level it was possible, I continued to think that the end of this film is very far . In fact, it may be an ironic look at bad horror films, and I miss the point, but for some reason I doubt it. <br /> <br /> This is a complete automotive warehouse of films, and I could not recommend it to anyone. and it hurts me to say that, since I look forward to the resurrection of British Terror. <br /> <br /> If you disagree with this review, this is normal, this is just my own opinion, and I’m sure that someone there will love it (for example, the director’s mother).
