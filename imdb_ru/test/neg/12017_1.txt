It was just a terrible movie. I watched it once when I was about 12 years old, now I am 19, and I donâ€™t think I will ever forget this film. <br /> <br /> I still feel nauseous when I think about it, it was all terrible that could fit in one movie. I really do not understand what kind of person will enjoy this complete garbage. It is not enough just to turn off your mind to enjoy this movie, I can enjoy the most stupid Disney movies made for television, just like the next person, but this is completely different. <br /> <br /> I usually don't like to judge a movie until I watch it myself, but believe me, I do you a favor. Do not watch this movie.
