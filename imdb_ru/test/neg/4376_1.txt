It was painful. I forced myself to watch it to the end, although I was not at all interested in the plot, if there was one. My patience was not rewarded. The ending was even worse than the rest of the film. Chuckie enters the hospital with a priest, and his concubine says, "I do." How ugly can a movie be?
