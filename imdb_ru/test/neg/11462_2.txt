Do so many people in this film believe that the girl is a witch? Just because she has dark hair and she wears dark makeup, should she be a witch? And I got the impression that the film is trying to present her as someone who is “different,” someone who nobody understands ... She’s just a teenager, and some stupid girl in her school says she’s a witch and everyone believes her. In addition, Brandi is either portrayed very badly, or the character himself is made so ... Fake. She did not convince me that she was not a witch, and I would not have believed it. Everyone blames her for being a witch, and she behaves as if she’s not quite sure whether she is a witch or not. And the way they dressed her for the yard - I see older women every day who don’t wear it, even if it was the last outfit in the world! Brother Brandy was also not very convincing ... But, you see, the important thing is that "she put this bad, bad girl back on the ground at the end of the movie." "She won the battle, proved to everyone that she is different." <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the worst films I've ever watched in May, too superficial. I only watched it because at the moment there was nothing else on TV, so I was convicted of this garbage. Please do not waste your time watching this movie. When I saw the 7-star rating, I almost fainted ... It does not deserve this, compared to some other films, which also received 7 stars.
