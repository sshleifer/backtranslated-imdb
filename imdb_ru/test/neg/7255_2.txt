Thirty percent of this film seems to be the prototype for the Map Channel. You see a giant map for about ten minutes, then they release the video while they are buzzing (buzzing, you know?) On the radar. Obviously, there are many radar stations in the High North that protect the borders of North America from the attacks of deadly polar bears. Bears never appear, but a giant mantis appears. It was frozen on ice for more than a million years or so until it was released as a result of an earthquake somewhere else in the world (yes, that's right. For my money, it was released by global warming). This is a huge prehistoric insect, and it needs a lot of food. Since there are no cows in the frozen north, he decides to treat himself to the most bullish creatures that one can find. I.E., people. He starts attacking radar stations, probably due to the fact that the buzzing of radar plates is getting on his nerves. <br /> <br /> Enter Colonel Joe Parkman, the local smart guy from the movie. He explores the plane that fell, and is puzzled why there are no bodies in the wreckage. The only thing he finds is one of the claws of the praying mantis. Obviously, he decided to trim his nails while the plane crew was snacking. Parkman takes the tip of the claw with him so that he can analyze the millennial scientist. <br /> <br /> Grandpa-scientist cannot make a claw because of the head or tail, mainly because he lacked a nap, so his mind does not function too well. Therefore, he calls a smug paleontologist, played by a guy who was PI. in perry mason. He and his friend, a transvestite photographer, are flying north because he decided that the claw must have come from the Mantis. Just one the size of a suburban train. <br /> <br /> This is Luke with love at first sight, when Colonel Parkman first sees a male photographer. People at the base, apparently deprived of many years, think that it is the hottest thing since Grandma Clampett’s time. A smug scholar and intelligent soldier soldiers begin to work together to track the path of the praying mantis, which has devastated some footage from the Eskimo village. He comes to the base in search of snacks after lunch and rather effectively breaks some cheap sets. Then he flies south and disappears. <br /> <br /> Now it’s tense hours, when the core of a civilian ground observer is called upon to sweep the sky in search of something big flying overhead. I doubt that in reality they would be told that they are looking for a giant flying praying mantis that eats people, as this will cause panic. They were probably told to look for a giant 727, which was painted green and buzzed because its engine was out of order. <br /> <br /> Colonel Parkman gets on the plane to try and shoot down Mantis and fails the mission. Mantis is landing in New York, probably because he wanted to take part in a Broadway show or visit Sex World in Times Square. The army pushes him into the tunnel, and Parkman and his men don the silly costumes that they borrowed from Orkin to enter and try to blow up the mantis. Success! Well, almost, since the praying mantis is still twitching so much that it almost kills the courageous lady of the photographer Eva Arden. At the end there is a cool love scene, and the paleontologist takes a picture of a dead praying mantis, because Colonel Hair Lubricant and Mrs. Paul are not specified specified. So it's a nauseous ending.
