This film was Flippin Awful .... I wanted to return those hours of my life. For God's sake, stay away from this terrible crumb movie at any cost. The name is not to be mentioned, but the ratings of this film are quite generous for a movie about vomiting. And where should I start? Stupid A ** children in the film ..... Null plot or story? ... Scene from a slap towel in a college / boy of a diverse garden? Or very poorly acted, the understatement of a teenager? $$$ # @% @! My God, this is NEVER over! ..... I remember that I thought it was better to kiss the floor of the cinema, and then go through it again. <br /> <br /> But what are you waiting for? Most people who have brain potential for seeking feedback will never become a target audience - so again GO SEE Pirites 2 or Jet Jet - if you're arguing with yourself. Listen, this film will just cost you your soul, your money, your energy and your brain cells. NOTE.
