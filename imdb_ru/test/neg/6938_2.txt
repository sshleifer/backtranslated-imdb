If you are a six year old boy who enjoys dinosaurs, you will love this movie. If you are someone else, you will roll your eyes every 15 seconds. If you want to start choosing things like action, special effects, dialogue, or the lack of a consistent plot that makes even the slightest sense, you will have a lot of material. If all you need is a safe, fantastic dinosaur movie for your child, then everything will be fine. However, there is a lot of fun for children who are much smarter, and some of them are even tolerant or enjoyable for adults. If your child is not in the uncompromising mood of a dinosaur, you are probably better off looking for something else.
