* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> This film is sometimes called Eternal Life. This is often perceived as a reference to the final scene, but more accurately describes how dead and buried this once-worthy show is after this careless and illogical sending. <br /> <br /> There is "hey guys, let's put on Show-ether" about this telewiki, which can be cute on the air. Some fans will feel like insiders, as they like to pick all the different cameo episodes. Co-author, co-producer Tom Fontana and his pals collect things with friends and favorites from other shows, as well as with real Baltimore characters. <br /> <br /> This is in addition to the incomes of almost all The participants of the television show were of a different type, your old favorites, and then not loved ones. <br /> <br /> There was always an executive producer caring for tug-of-war, Barry Levinson, Fontana, James Yoshimura, and the rest of the creative team against NBC's budget leaders who just wanted another moronic police process, such as Nash Bridges who regularly beat "Murder" in the ratings. The pressure affected, as the show bounced off between exciting realism, which surpassed its form, and the filthy sensationalism that humiliated it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for this film, Fontana, co-authors Yoshimura and Eric Overmeyer and director Jean de Segonzak just threw in a towel. They took the most ridiculous story from the series, crowned it with an incredible and artistically barren new storyline and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker actors. <br /> <br /> In brief, it has been some time since the last episode of the show. The former heart of the Baltimore murder investigation unit, Japhet Cotto as Lieutenant Al-Jardello, is now a candidate for mayor, similar to Kurt Schmock, and Schmock himself appears in a cameo. But this promising start immediately and incredibly takes a tragic turn. <br /> <br /> Giancarlo Esposito takes the spotlight as Jardello’s son, Mike. A handsome man who did a good job elsewhere, Esposito was one of those pretty people who were brought late to supposedly liven up the show. But the question for the audience has always been: is Mike as uncomfortable as the son of Ji, or Esposito so uncomfortable in the role? <br /> <br /> To be honest, Esposito has no chance to play the main story. nonstop. This is because the scriptwriters are choosing this moment to revive another storyline, which spat on the intelligence of the loyal voters of the show. <br /> <br /> Internet was advertised, and then it seemed to be happening, apparently, streaming video. After several red herrings, detectives arrested the suspect. But the deputy Minister of Justice, exhausted and overworked, Zal'ko Ivaneka forgot to file a petition in time, and the suspect was released, only to be killed later. <br /> <br /> To summarize: he forgot to file documents because it was not the most sensational case in his career, because the mayor, the attorney general, the governor, the entire legislative body of Maryland, the attorney general of the United States, NBC, Court TV , BBC, AP, Reuters, People, The Sun, Washington Post, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Time Magazine, London Times, The Economist, Mail and Keeper of Johannesburg, “Romance of L'Osservatore”, “Figaro”, “Match Paris”, “Equip” and “Computer World” called not every 10 minutes. to ask about the state of affairs. <br /> <br /> However, an old brigade of detectives and staff is flocking to Baltimore to help. The exhibition presents many talents. Unfortunately, due to the limited number of dialogs, some of them are simply demonstrated. <br /> <br /> Two of the strongest actors, Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo, are criminally undervalued, while John Seda wasted time. and Michael Michel is better spent on advertising. The authors seem to make fun of it, presenting Jason Priestley as the last important detective story. On the other hand, they give the frivolous, frivolous Michel Forbes a very touching scene. <br /> <br /> There are other tricky actors with real lieutenant Gary D'Addario, the center of the book that spawned the show by playing another detective story. Guests look into other shows, such as Whitney Allen, performing their ruthless and ignorant "Miss Sally" from the children's show, beloved by the prisoners from "Oz" Fontana. Dina Napoli from WBAL TV appears as herself. <br /> <br /> Although this entertainment can distract even those who entertain them. Ed Begley Jr. actually promotes the story in his short speech, playing Dr. Victor Ehrlich from Fontana in “St. In the other place". He is still a bright character and fits in the hospital. Then you remember, didn't the Holy Elegy turn out to be an autistic boy fantasy? <br /> <br /> The most useful cameo reflects corporate synergy. This film was made when Court TV bought the rights to repeat the show. This network made a legal waiver from Helen Lukitis, who interviewed the homicide investigation team and later appeared in Oz. The television correspondent does an effective job of summarizing the news, that is, the plot moments for the latecomers. <br /> <br /> Although she is so thin that she disappears when she turns sideways, Lukaytis also skillfully copes with a little physical comedy with Esposito. He shows more juice in his scenes with Lucaitis than with any of his usual colleagues. Perhaps these two should have had a side effect. <br /> <br /> When the movie ends, the cream of the cast will rise to the top. Although they are burdened with a loser scenario, Andre Brauger and Kyle Secor overcome it. Their performances remind viewers of what made Murder for many years the best show on the air and one of the best ever created on television. <br /> <br /> It's funny to see how the best professionals do their job; it's just a shame that this film does not give them more chances. Fanatics may still want to watch this movie, but you can live without it.
