The original GRUDGE (original American remake) unexpectedly showed almost everything you could do right with a ghost click. It was tense, gloomy and gloomy atmosphere, good shocks and really creepy images. GRUDGE 2 tries all these tricks, but ultimately fails, showing us only the old things we saw in the first film, as well as the dirty story line, constantly switching from Tokyo to California. It begins in Tokyo with some schoolgirls roaming the house, now heavily blocked by one strip of police tape. One of them comes face to face with a ghost-like girl with wide eyes when he is locked in a closet. She walks out, screaming frantically, and they all run out of there. Then we go to America, where Sister Karen goes to Japan with their mother to find her and bring her home. Ultimately, we discover that we are following a very familiar concept in which a curious boy and girl explore the history of a mysterious house. We are from the very beginning intersect with girls who disappear one after another, as well as with a little boy who hears strange sounds in a neighboring apartment at night, and all this leads to a very unsatisfactory ending. “Scary” scenes are boring and ineffective. Like The Ring 2, avoid this horrible sequel ...
