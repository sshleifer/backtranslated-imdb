I don't care what anybody says, this movie was crap. The only thing he had was camera work, which was very well done. As for the dialogue that I heard, so many people talk ... it sucks too. Yes, it was honest and true to life, but well, I hear someone talking like that on the street or in fast food. What made the dialogue good in films like Pulp Fiction and Gosford Park is the fact that it is the WRITING dialogue that takes time to think about. Another thing is that the director was not supposed to show himself in the picture. I believe that the male character could have been much stronger, but instead he seemed weak. In fact, the film seemed to revolve around a male character, and then it completely disappears in the last twenty minutes. The girl in the film seemed to me to be absolutely disgusting, not in appearance, but in its need, in need of ways. Say that she is in love with a guy, and, in fact, jealous of him the next day, what nonsense. One last thing: the sound was terrible, and I hope that this is just what tormented my theater, instead of being in the final version of the film. For several scenes there was a constant buzzing sound, and it really distracted from talking. One good thing again was the work of Blood as DP, but the actress who played the ex-girlfriend of the main guy also did a very good job. These two things could not save an extremely horrible film, which I refuse to call a movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
