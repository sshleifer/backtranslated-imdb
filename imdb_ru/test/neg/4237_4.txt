Making a movie had a lot of sense, however, despite the novelty of models selling someone else's furniture to live a high life, nothing happens in this movie. Characters are cardboard. The dialogue is so painfully written that it is difficult to come to terms with it, and if there were any jokes in the film, I missed them. Marilyn Monroe goes to the walls because she does not want to wear glasses, it’s just unbelievable and not funny. Grable’s stupidity is too stupid to believe in it. Gold digger Bacall is so forced that it annoys him to listen. Why would anyone want to accept this outside of me.
