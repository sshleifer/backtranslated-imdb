Would it be too commonplace for me to repeat the same word “Stupid” again and again? Probably. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Seriously. There are the best movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I first saw this movie at a friend's birthday when he was still in theaters. Although it was actually * with friends * and at one of their birthday parties, * I had to leave. I really had to leave. I just apologized and went out. Fortunately, some parents did the same thing, so I didn’t look like a complete moron ... In any case, this film is terrible. There is nothing to love. It is painful (as actually causes physical pain) slowly and disgustingly (literally causing vomiting) unfunny. You almost feel sorry for Tom Arnold, but then not, because you remember that he really was in the film. It really hurts me to even think about it. <br /> <br /> It was on TV a few months ago, and I decided that I would have to watch it all the time, only once. Then I remembered why I came out, and felt guilty for having raised my ratings even by one viewer. The jokes are not funny, the characters are not interesting. it's just a meaningless mess and stupidity. <br /> <br /> There is a small crowd of then eight-year-old children who watched the movie when it came out and considered it “brilliant.” If you think that removing your face in pieces with a scoop of ice cream is great, then by all means take it for rent. But if you have any merit, avoid this big silly mess at all. ACCOUNT: 0/10 ... possibly negative 1, in fact.
