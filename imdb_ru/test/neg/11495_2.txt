I just watched Icon on a DVD, and despite the fact that it is a great book, the film is a weak substrate. Those responsible for writing should be sent to Siberia. Why they have spoiled the great story with all kinds of sub-populations of the C-film, which are completely irrelevant to this story, is completely unknown to me. <br /> <br /> However, the directors and actors do their best to do something about it, after all, the film was not satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Can someone make a decent film out of it to show how this is done. I am sure that the crowds will gather for such a masterpiece of the novel, which turned into a book, and not into a cheap C-film.
