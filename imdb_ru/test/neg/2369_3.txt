The version of the film “Rising Damp” was released two years after the end of the television series. Like many fans, I duly went to the movies when it opened. I left bitterly disappointed. Eric Chappell could not spend a lot of time writing the script; Most rephrased ideas from old episodes. At the time of the film's release, the TV series “Rising Damp” was still regularly repeated on I.T.V. therefore, the public was asked to pay to see what they had already seen. At least, the films “On the buses” can boast of original scenarios. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Richard Beckinsale died a year earlier, so they excluded the character “Alan” as a sign of respect, replacing the drawing student. ” John, played by Christopher Strauli from the movie "Only When I Laugh." It is simply not the same. <br /> <br /> As indicated by another poster, Rigsby Guest House didn’t look like the one used in the series was bigger and cleaner. <br /> <br /> Director Joe McGrath was one of the directors who worked on the original Casino Royale, a film immersed in surrealistic humor. "Rising Damp" also has its share of the fantasy episodes in the style of "Walter Mitty", such as a parody of "Saturday Night Fever". Personally, I found them terribly inappropriate. The case of "overdoing the pudding." <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Leonard Rossiter is as magnificent as the poor Rigsby, like Frances De La Tour in the role of Ruth and Don. Warrington in the role of Philip. The only pity is that the film is not worthy of their talents. <br /> <br /> When Rossiter died in 1984, it was shown by I.T.V. as a tribute, with its final scene - showing Rigsby, lying prostrate at the foot of the stairs - removed in the interest of good taste.
