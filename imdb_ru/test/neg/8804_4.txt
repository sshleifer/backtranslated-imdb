(spoiler) this may be one of the worst movies you see, you might like, like me, I really like it. This is one of those movie chances. <br /> <br /> There is a man who saw that he had a day in his life. Black rats somehow feel sorry for him (which, in my opinion, was a good idea). <br /> <br /> Killer rats made friends with a man, two big men come, feeling unwanted, so the man puts a rat killer on them and the floor on the floor of both bodies covered with big black rats, not so much blood. <br /> <br /> but think about big black rats all over your body), but start killing people a little, but the rats get bored until the rats kill his friends and girlfriends <br /> <br /> One scene sat on the toilet, while the rats enter the pipes leading to the toilet, and the rat rises, as you know, and comes out of the mouth (which means rats). I had to eat everything in the body) I laughed for weeks. <br /> <br /> Why I liked this film, yes, it is different from the rest, for example, I like it when a small creature captures humanity. <br /> <br /> If you have seen any of these movie slugs, then they slip, Them, spiders, snakes, tremors, Cujo, crocodile, shark, octopus. <br /> <br /> If you like them, check out Rats Hood, <br /> <br /> this is better than the Horror Cartoons, which is all I can say! 4/10
