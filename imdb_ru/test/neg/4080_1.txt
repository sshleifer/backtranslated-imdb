Was that supposed to be funny? This is one of those films that simply do not work. The first, Bruce Almighty with Jim Carey, had some very funny moments. It didn't have one. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrell, brilliant in Bruce Almighty, could not deliver here. His performance is very ordinary, and he cannot carry it away like Carey. <br /> <br /> The only thing thatâ€™s good is that I paid only $ 1.95 for the rent. This is a film for children ... very young children who have seen only about 4 films in their short life. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that where Jim Carey is shot in the film, and they make a sequel without him, this is usually a huge turkey. Does anyone remember the Son of the Mask? (IMDB Worst 100 films of all time) Avoid this one movie buff.
