Oh, my Poor Jane must have done the old thing rolling over in the grave. Even considering the low production figures for time (1971) and format (a kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad. Whatever you do with Austin, the dialogue should break out (even in this, perhaps her most serious work), and the melodrama should be strictly beyond the boundaries. Alas, not so with this production. By the time you get to Anna’s “Frederick, Frederick, Frederick,” you’ll be laughing or crying. If you just don’t want to visually “collect” all existing films about Austin’s work, you can skip this one. However, if you watch it, there will be little consolation: the actresses who play Anna’s sisters do an excellent job with their roles.
