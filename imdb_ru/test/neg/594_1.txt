Do not waste your money or time. Scary film. Bad game plot all over the place. Actually, it works very badly. Dude, this movie is just bad. I turned it off for 7 minutes. The scenario is bad, the direction is bad, it seems to me that the school group got together to make a project for their theatrical lesson. Yes, this is so bad. The game is not at all convincing, mind you, I only saw 7 minutes. How this movie got on the DVD is not clear to me. <br /> <br /> He should have been left in storage for editing. I saw the cover and thought it was pretty cool, I'm sure the hell it won't do next time: _)
