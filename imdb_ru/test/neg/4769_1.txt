First, I saw another reviewer say that this film is “fantastic.” Well, nothing could be further from the truth! This movie is bullshit !!! Idiot horror comedy that is even a little funny! Do not think that it is so bad, that it is good, because it is not. This is a waste of time and money! <br /> <br /> This is what I see in this DVD waste. A group of friends gathers at the weekend, gets drunk and decides to shoot a video in the backyard. They grab the mom and dad camcorder and start making scenes on the spot. They all enjoy watching the mug in front of the camera. They think that if they think it’s funny, then everyone will think that it’s funny. Well, they are wrong. This is a homemade backyard video - trash. The effects of "acting" and "comedic bleeding" are lousy, but I think this was to be expected, since it is nothing more than a home video. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I think the fact that this shit worked out gives hope to anyone who wants to make a movie. If these people can make their own film and release it on DVD, then anyone can! <br /> <br /> 0 / 10-- Save your money.
