At the very beginning, a look at the control panel, which says "8 miles from the cost of California," and no, I was not mistaken in that, they really did not understand how much it cost, and not from the coast. These people must have been idiots. <br /> <br /> Well, if you are into horrendous films, but the fact that they could not catch the simple spelling problem makes me believe that they really didnâ€™t make any effort to create a film at all. The naval form is not entirely correct. <br /> <br /> Wow, absolutely ridiculous, but it's good if you are looking for something insanely stupid to watch. How these people made money from it, I do not know.
