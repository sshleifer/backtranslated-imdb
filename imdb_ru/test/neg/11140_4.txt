Yes, it is clean rubbish. For each guy who loves experimental cinema (like me), it would be interesting to watch low rolls babble and do nothing for almost two hours, but it becomes very painful when you realize that you actually paid for it. This is probably one of those films that you love to watch because of its complete emptiness and nihilism. I take it for its shock value decades before Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction.
