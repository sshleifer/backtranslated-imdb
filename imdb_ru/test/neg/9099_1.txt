Watching the first few moments, you realize that this will be a parody - and, of course, this is * parody *, but I'm not sure that (fairy tale? Opera? Hollywood C-film?), If there was something like this), and I can assure you that it is not worth watching. This is just a meaningless film (cf. Good parody - all but meaningless), with pretentious, shallow speeches of extremely sketchy characters. It is like commedia dell'arte. Or better, it's like a spoiled commedia dell'arte. And the score ... sung intentionally in an incompetent way (something Greenway will use much more effectively) is * painful * to listen (unless someone puts on some modern earplugs, haha). Go for quality movies (for example, like A. Mitt, Like Tsar Peter the Great Married His Swamps, 1976) and stay away from this mistake.
