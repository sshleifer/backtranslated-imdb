A ruthless killer was hired to destroy someone at the very top of the US government. Constantly changing his personality and location, he is known only as a jackal. Everything about this hired killer is a secret. Aware of the presence of the Jackal, but not understanding his purpose, the deputy director of the FBI faces the biggest challenge in his career. To track down this cold-blooded killer, he and the usual Russian intelligence officer enlisted the support of an imprisoned Irish terrorist. These unlikely allies enter the global race against time to stop the mysterious mercenary before he can complete his mission. If you're looking for a non-stop action movie such as Die Hard, then The Jackal is not your movie. This is a slow spy thriller with lots of cool gadgets and weapons. Richard Gere plays the role of a passionate terrorist who helps the FBI more deeply than just freedom. And Willis makes great efforts as a jackal. Well, the film, but no more.
