The best thing about this movie for me was that Brian Dick played Rafe and made me melt. Rafe and all his glories made the film worth seeing, although I could not wait to get up and scream. I have never seen a hotter man. <br /> <br /> -ahem- But that's not the point. <br /> <br /> Title? This is really what it is. They took the beautiful story written by Annette Curtis Clause and threw it away. I, in all my anal-preserving fame, will point out what was missing, what has changed, and everything else is wrong with the film. <br /> <br /> Sit down and see: <br /> <br /> - Apparently, RAFE is the son of ASTRID and GABRIEL, and, apparently, ULF is no longer an ASTRID child, as in the book. And, as I remember from the book, RAFE and ASTRID were LOVERS. <br /> <br /> - ASTRID, apparently Blond, unlike the bright red hair described in the book. I believe the book says that it looks more like a fox than a wolf. And the film also shows that Astrid is Aunt Vivian. <br /> <br /> WHERE DOES ACCEL GO? <br /> <br /> Vivian is 19 years old. In the book, she was 16. <br /> <br /> Vivian and Aiden meet in high school, which they both attend in the book. Vivian goes to Aiden because of his poem "The Change of the Wolf." But according to the film, Aiden beat up his father, escaped, and now lives in Romania and draws graphic novels. It made me go "What the F ** K." <br /> <br /> - There is no Kelly in the movie. WHERE WAS KELLY IN FILM. KELLY in the book, however, hated VIVIAN. And she also met with Aiden after they broke up. Vivian even gets drunk in a book and breaks her room. <br /> <br /> Gabriel bears a striking resemblance to the Colombian drug lord in the film. And he sort of, too. His acting was very good, but his appearance pushed me away. <br /> <br /> - In the film VIVIAN there were no parents. Her father, mother and two other brothers and sisters died in the film. However, in the book, when one evening she comes home, her Mom, ESME, sits on the couch, after the battle with Astrid for Gabriel. And Vivian has no brothers and sisters. Only her father died in the book. <br /> <br /> IDENT takes VIVAN as it is. It really got me. He kills the RAFE in a creepy church, confronts Vivian, and she rescues him from other wolves, except that Aiden shoots her, so they leave in search of medicines, and then try to leave the city together. WTF ?! In the book, Aiden is horrified when she turns into a wolf, and cries like a chick, throws something at her, and so she panics and jumps out the window. Then he comes up with a story he tried to break with her, and she threw the chair out of the window. I do not like it. <br /> <br /> Eiden wants her to run away with him. In the book, he does not want to have anything to do with Vivan after she turns to him. Nor does he lovingly hold her face and says that she can control it. He cries like a woman because he fears her. <br /> <br /> And the last outrage ... the one that almost gave my three best friends, and I OUR HEARTS IN OUR PLACES: <br /> <br /> - In the film, Aiden and Vivian run away together, and Vivan killed Gabriel. As in she shoots him. Gabriel dies. In the "Book" Vivian not only does not kill Gabriel, but also believe that they end TOGETHER. As in, she does not end with Aiden, she ends with Gabriel. What the hell. <br /> <br /> Small things were also noticed: Ulfâ€™s red hair, which he receives from Astrid, changed to brown in the film, and Vivian works in a chocolate shop. <br /> <br /> A terrible shock; I am ashamed. The book really was not difficult to follow. If Disney can use random H! School, why did the principal not find the random H! School? <br /> <br /> * sigh * I was really looking forward to this film, I really liked the book, sadly, that it did not follow him a bit. I give him 2, just because (as the beginning of this review says) Rafe (played by Brian Dick) was incredibly sexy, and Agnes Bruckner did a wonderful job. And they kept the poem with the Steppe Wolf <br /> <br /> With love, <br /> <br /> Caitlin
