Stop me if you do this earlier, some cheerleaders, their trainer and a couple of guys are trapped in a hut in the woods when an invisible killer kills them one by one. Shame on me, after I completely wrote off Jim Vinorsky after the terrible Busty Cop (it was a long time since his last really good movie was Hard to Die in the 1990s), I still revived for some reason my hopes Anticipated sequel to "Slaughter a bedtime party." Unfortunately, even my mediocre expectations did not materialize. This walk is not as fun as even the three previous films in the franchise (and yes, I turn on SPM 2, it should tell you something). Also, how can you get a slasher movie with this little blood ??? I mean, come on now !! <br /> <br /> My rating: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Ricky Ray becomes topless; April Flowers and Mercy Rahmer show boobs and buns in the shower scene (April gets naked again later in the film), and Tami Sheffield becomes topless and exposes buns
