If this film becomes a holiday tradition, I will have to hide on Christmas until the end of my life. How do you even think to compare it with the "Beautiful Life"! It was absolutely horrible! The boy's singing made my fingers squeeze. And what's the deal with his hair? Emmy is a decent performance ?! You are welcome. Of course, Lucci is fine, but Emmy? I think this film is a waste of money. The fact that they so closely followed the original story, pretending to be modern and retro-dashed, made it even worse. He lacked enthusiasm and perseverance in all respects. Lighting, wardrobe, makeup, it seemed everyone wanted to go home. Just a big NO from me.
