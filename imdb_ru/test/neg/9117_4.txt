The critics were like “a film that will break your heart,” and so on. Therefore, my friend and I had high hopes when we decided to watch this film. <br /> <br /> I will make it short and leave it before others to write about its content. This film is trying to touch you to reach your heart. But it fails. At least for me. And for my friend too. <br /> <br /> Everything that happened, happened only on the screen. It has always been THERE, not HERE, where I am. I thought that most of the time, “hm, something happens on the screen, but it's only on the screen. It is not real. " <br /> <br /> Films that touched me much better: east of paradise (1955), Conditions of tenderness (1983), Jerry Maguire (1996), Babe (1995), Mies vailla menneisyyttä (2002)
