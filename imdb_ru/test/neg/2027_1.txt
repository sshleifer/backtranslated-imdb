I found this DVD in the store and decided why not to support some indie film and watch a cool horror movie. Please save your time and money and pass by. Acting, script, almost everything with this film is a sub. There really is not much history, and there is no character development. I found that I didnâ€™t care what happened to the people in the film while something was going on. It is assumed that all people are in college age, but they all look as if they are over thirty shown in a master shot. There is no editing, no scrapbooks or close-ups. Do yourself a favor and skip it.
