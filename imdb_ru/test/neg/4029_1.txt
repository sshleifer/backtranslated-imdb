It's such a shitty movie, I have no idea how it got on the shelves, they must have paid in the movie store to make them put it in earnest! This story makes absolutely no sense, if you don’t take any hard drugs, you will definitely need to do something to watch this whole piece of garbage, so much so that you don’t care what was on TV, since almost coma The letter seems like it was made by a 5-year-old, and the game is worse than primary school games. The disgusting special effects that they tried to do look so stupid that they spent as much as 5 dollars to make the whole movie, it seems so! Oh dear, this scene with an old woman who has a hairstyle from the 80s and ugly girls in rubber suits, my friends and I laughed so hard. Did someone actually think it was a good idea to do this in a movie? I find that hard to believe!
