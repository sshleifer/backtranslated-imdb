When viewers hear two popular villains / characters fighting, they flock to theaters to see how the battle will end. There is Freddie vs. Jason, in which two very popular horror icons try to kill each other. And, more like this, there is a Godzilla against (insert name here). But a very common Komodo vs. Python is just a terrible title and even the worst premise. Obviously, a movie is a picture from the D-list, but at least itâ€™s a more convincing title, maybe something that can fool an unsuspecting viewer into watching it. With that name, you know what you are aiming for. <br /> <br /> A military group, including a 20-year-old sex scientist, was left for military death. island inhabited by a giant komodo dragon. As long as they get to the island and the boat, everything will be fine, but ... no ... a giant python guards the ocean and leaves. Let's hope that all these guys will be able to leave the island, and that the python and the komodo will not teach each other in some terrible battle with special effects. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this film is bad in almost every way. The acting is pretty bad, or maybe because the special effects are so stupid that the acting is incredible, because no one believes these people are in danger with creatures that look like they are made on a computer. early 90s. However, this film is actually quite funny. The creatures look awkward, and the actors really do all this, pretending they are in danger. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this film is a steaming pile of screams! * ... but I can not. This movie with a PG-13 rating actually impersonates itself. Every time a curse appears, the parrot makes a sound. Even the words that can be said on network television. How * screaming * is cheap, that they publish words, and with a parrot no less. In the end, these parrot sounds reached me, and I could not help but laugh at incompetence. <br /> <br /> This film is bad, from a silly start to the ridiculous ending of The Night of the Living Dead, but also quite funny. Like a horror movie, it fails with a bang, like an action movie, it fails a little less, but still pretty bad, and like comedy it shines. <br /> <br /> My rating: * out ****. 95 minutes of PG-13 for some violence and squawked beyond curse.
