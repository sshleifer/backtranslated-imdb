This film has a heart in the right place, but unfortunately it is not so much. It is rather a documentary under the guise of narration. Bamako is basically a newspaper article on celluloid. However, your average well-designed article is much more convincing and concise than any of those presented here. The filmmaker is trying to convey to the viewer the difficulties of African life, in particular the country of Mali, because of the unethical practices of the IMF, the G8 and the World Bank, using a contrived trial of the above. Throughout the film, the extra 10 minutes are scattered, which make an indecisive attempt at a narrative plot, and a bizarre scene of Western-style gunfights in Hollywood, where the director seems very pleased with his mind (hence the frequent comparisons of Godard). <br /> <br /> Of course, when the film begins, what and who is on trial was not explained, but, as we already know, the French refuse to feed their audience with a spoon. <br /> <br /> There are many passionate arguments, but they are often verbose, put in a shrill monotone (one that becomes quite easy to turn off after a while), and is very easy in detail. The last point is the most disappointing of all, because there is a very reasoned case against the institutions in question. Unfortunately, all that we get in 2 hours is that the IMF and the G8 are evil oppressors and must forgive the debt of the 3rd world. We are given no more than an occasional hint at the specific reasons why organizations involved in the proceedings are guilty, but there is never a clear case. The arguments of the trial and the footage from the surrounding village clearly show the suffering of these African residents, but the question arises why we should sit 2 hours later, when a 20-minute Newsweek article could draw a much more accurate picture or episode of Bill Moyers. In the end, there is something very important that can be said about this issue, it is simply not very well or very clearly represented in this pretentious, indulgent part.
