This film is probably the worst film ever made. This is by far the worst thing I've ever seen, and I have seen A LOT of bad movies. <br /> <br /> Nothing interesting happens in this movie. You can literally start a movie, take a nap, and then wake up safely, knowing that nothing interesting happened during sleep. And I saw this movie three times, not sleeping everywhere. I feel that I must congratulate. <br /> <br /> The film goes as one would expect, according to the formula, unchanged. Hunters capture a snowman toddler, his parents kill him, and the nearby town falls into insane murder. This is surprisingly boring for Troma release. <br /> <br /> So do yourself a favor and skip this movie. If you need to see this, you will understand why.
