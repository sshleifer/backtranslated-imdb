For some reason, my father-in-law gave me a copy of this tape. I think because my great uncle, Buddy Baer, ​​was a giant in this film, and my father-in-law thought I would like to see him. A few years ago, when I was a child, I didn’t like it either. <br /> <br /> My son, who was then two years old, watched and hooked. Every awake moment in front of the TV played this terrible video. I went to work with meaningless songs stuck in my head. Two “leads” were worse than in the junior review. The dancers looked like a rejection of Ed Wood's horror film, and the Abbot and Costello phoned their roles. Fortunately, I was able to distract my son long enough to lose this video. Honestly, I think it was a ribbon from the “Ring”. <br /> <br /> To fix another reviewer, Buddy Baer is Uncle Jethro (Max Baer Jr.), not his father. 0 out of 10
