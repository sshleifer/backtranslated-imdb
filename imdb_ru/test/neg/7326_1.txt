again this kind of rubbish of digital video with a zero budget. and again I fell into this trap, because the name had a zombie (German name: ZOMBIE ATTACK!) story: on Halloween some people visit the Museum of the Dead, it's a trap, an insane doctor wants to kill people, then the aztec cult. so they fight some zombies there. <br /> <br /> ultra cheap landscape: some corridors with black ribbon on it. several amateurish drawings and a few skulls, which you can find in every entertainment store. no actors, only low-grade models that roam without any idea what to do. no effects. ludicrous makeup, your local hobby-zombie makeup fan will do it better, for a while it seemed they didn’t have enough money for enough color, otherwise they just couldn’t do it like that, dude, they have to realize their looks zombie". Some funny martial arts with zombies, slow motion. just when the director wants it to be scary, he uses some kind of standard digital camcorder effect when everything flickers. unbelievable! 0 out of 10!
