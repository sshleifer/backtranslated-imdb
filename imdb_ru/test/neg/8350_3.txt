Although this film (and I freely use this term) was filmed in 1997, we just watched it for the first time tonight. My husband said that the Tommy Lee Jones film, which we had never heard of, made him a little wary. In any case, I blithely watched, confident that if Jones was in the film, it should be worth at least two hours of my time. After all, he was one of our actors for years. Although Heche is not one of my favorite actresses, I was even more confident when I saw another famous face. The list of outstanding actors / actresses continued to grow, so I tolerated more and more of this film, being sure that if I went through enough cliches and banal social statements, I would be the winner on the other side of the plot. Alas, there was no plot. Looks like he was burned by eternal lava of doom. <br /> <br /> Characters were paper thin. The plot was so crowded with holes that it literally distracted me from most of the special effects and filming in the film. Was the charge for a short consultation with a primary science teacher too big for the budget of this film? No acid rain ... no toxic gases (like sulfur or hydrochloride) ... no deadly ash ... no burning skin just a few feet from the lava. Wow ... this is the most friendly lava in the world! <br /> <br /> Events were no better than characters. Every incident was so contrived and contrived ... as if the authors said: "Well, we need to get rid of the little girl NOW" ... and the poof, she is sprayed with a lava bomb that burns her so much that she has to be delivered to a safe place (not from lava, but from her own helpless stupor) ... but just a few moments later in the car she does not feel obvious pain and soon after that she effortlessly runs through (moan!) a building that (oh no!) is about to explode. After all this, your reward is a line from the little boy at the end (that all people look the same) ... which should be one of the worst movie lines I've ever heard. Even if it was not so painfully written, it was a ridiculous time for all the characters. The child and the cop aside, as if the mother would still be in the area, and she just needs to point out because she just doesnâ€™t say ... what ... does she hope to go into the shadows and get away from the baby once and for all? I do not think so. Obviously, the mother of the child would have disappeared or died - or would have shouted her head to find her baby. <br /> <br /> A hard black gangster swindler with a secret soft spot and a chip on the shoulder of a narrow-minded burglar-cop with a secret scene of a soft spot made my eyes bleed. Even if such characteristic characters existed, they would not behave as they are portrayed in the film, given the circumstances. You know, something about the imminent fiery death and mass destruction can take people by surprise. <br /> <br /> There are too many moments in movies like these to mention ... in fact, this is just an awkward movie to watch. These poor writers ... where are they now?
