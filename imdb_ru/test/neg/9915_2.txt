Wasted effort. At first glance, this is a typical film about disasters: we are involved in the lives of several people in a big event. Nevertheless, the script is so terrible, and the background of the characters is so much explained in the dialogue that we feel that we are treated like idiots. Even Sesame Street didn’t explain Mr. Snufflupus’s origins or how Mr. Hooper died: we can find out. Someone thought that the inclusion of Enron in the script would give him the currency when discussing energy companies. Acting is generally mild, with the exception of senior performers (Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy), and after the first hour I didn’t care which of them was gone. <br /> <br /> But maybe there are special effects to watch. Unfortunately not. Even on a 20-year-old TV, I could see that one tractor and trailer were generated by a computer — not good. Maybe there are budget constraints, so I can forgive it. The shots of the plane trying to land looked pretty real, but I kept telling myself that I had seen it before. This site confirms this: it was from an earlier film “Nowhere to Land”. <br /> <br /> So, in general, the only good moments are taken from another movie, and when you see the best sequences of actions compressed into 30- The second network promo, it makes category 6 quite good. My advice: rely on your network to make good 30-second clips, watch them and save two nights.
