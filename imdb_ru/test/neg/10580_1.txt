I happened to shoot this film with my sister in the hope of watching a wonderful entertaining film that was funny, but my expectations were not fulfilled. This film was beyond the hideous and disgusting for the PG-13 film, it had to be rated R for the many mature references that continued in this film. I would not recommend that a 13 year old teen see this. <br /> <br /> Even if no one under the age of 17 watches this movie, beware of a really stupid movie, thereâ€™s no humor in the movie, just a bunch of disgusting sexual references, including a light touch of pedophilia, something about don't even have to joke. <br /> <br /> I would like to know what happened to the PG-13 films, which were safe for a 13-year-old child? It is beyond the limits of a deplorable film and should be overrated.
