I have no doubt that the film does NOT capture New Jersey (like Zack, I'm from there). Good. No difference. I lived there long enough. I do not need to watch a film that tells about the Garden State. <br /> <br /> I have doubts about how bad this film is. Let's make it easier for you. We will use some markers. There are probably several spoilers that follow. (Not that you can’t predict the movie anyway): <br /> <br /> - The placement of the music was insanely forced and patronizing. Example: Big: "What are you listening to?" Sam: Shins. Have you ever heard of them? “No.” “Listen to this song - it will change your life!” And then they continue to play that song Shins, which was in an advertisement for McDonalds. (Do you not like when the characters in the film brazenly tell you - the viewer - how to react to something? I like it! "" Cry "," inspire ", etc.) <br /> <br /> - The scenes were SO BAD, SO CLICHER, SO MELODRAMATIC. Example: the whole film. But no, really, an example: they are in a rainy quarry near the ark. screams! Oh, how touching! But wait! Here comes Sam and his buddy (an annoying addict), and they ALL scream !!!! BUT WAIT !!!! MY GOD !!!! That's it! THEY KISS !! LONG DEEP !!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Dialogue was SO BAD, SO CLICK, SO MELODRAMATIC. Example. They leave the ark, and Sam says something like: " Hey. Good luck exploring the endless abyss. ”And the guy replies:“ You too. ”Oh ... Oh, my! I didn’t understand ... it could be? My God, this is so! Big life is like. .. omigod ... endless bottomless !!!! Another example: Big and Sam at the airport. Sam says something like: "Is it goodbye?" Not enough for you? Well, Largeman says something like: "This is not the point at the end of a sentence ... these are ellipses." And guess what happens when he tries to go down the jet road and return to his life in Los Angeles. You know? Do not guess This is a waste of your time. <br /> <br /> - This is the robbery of the film Wes Anderson. Without being engaged in being melodramatic and cliché, the film spends many times with insanely strange characters. Hi, Sam's brother ... thanks to Zach Braff for turning it on because it really made the film much more textured. Also tear off Anderson: dialogue. Scene: Sam and the Big Man in the bar. In walks of friends "Vagina!" says one of them. Then they see that he is sitting with Sam, so one of the friends says, "Sorry, I said vagina." And Sam says, "It's all right." <br /> <br /> - Inventive cinematography, which is not inventive, but senseless and annoying. Give me a break with speeding up / slowing down the movie. Again, Wes Anderson does this effectively in his films. And it was well done at Donnie Darko. But, really, it was pointless. Wow. A crazy party where people take X and sniff a Coke. Better roll all the tricks! <br /> <br /> - You can count the good moments on one hand (even if you do not have enough fingers). This is what makes it even worse. A retarded defender ... well, that was good! The little thing that he (a big man) says when they are about to enter the quarry (something about turpentine pant) ... that was good! Oh wait, that's all. <br /> <br /> You know, Zach Braff, I think, is always too cute. But he is pleasant. But, dude, this is compulsory, pretentious, melodramatic (do you understand already?) This movie is terrible. Obviously, I am in the minority, as this waste of time is currently estimated at 8.0. <br /> <br /> Please, if you are looking for something really sharp, subtle and unique DO. NOT. RENT. THIS. MOVIE.
