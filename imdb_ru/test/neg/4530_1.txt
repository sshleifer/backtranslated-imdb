The audience sat silently in almost the entire film, with occasional rare giggles. The nature of Maxwell Smart was so inconsistent that I felt him being whipped. When it is convenient for a plot, the Smart behaves as the main spy. In other cases, he acts like a fool. They shoot a lot of classic lines from the television series, but they do not work in this version. The classic “missed it so much” is funny if it is talked about with an attempt to braggadosio someone who is an obvious failure - but he loses all the humor when someone who is qualified speaks. To a lesser degree, many other characters move at breakneck speeds from experienced to caricature incompetent. Siegfried, the main villain, may seem smart, but he makes decisions that make no sense. However, none of the film’s characters are as incompetent as the authors of this mess. I am very upset that so many IMDb users think that this is good.
