The only reason I bought the DVD was to satisfy my curiosity about the scene when Liz (Kim Basinger) undresses to the music of Joe Cocker: “You can leave your hat on! It was the best part of the whole movie. Not because the scene was any good; just a song. I'm not saying that it was a terribly bad movie, just not so good. Disappointingly so! <br /> <br /> Especially when the study of male and female sexuality could be expanded. Instead of spreading to the dangerous side of lust, obsession and hobbies and what it may lead to, it drags its heels from one idea to another. For example, when John (who is played by Rourke) can leave her on top of the Big Wheel, Liz (Kim Basinger) is unconvincingly shocked by John's curious experience, but not so shocked by his sexual exploits associated with the eternal Giza; and, as one reader mentioned, for a woman to enjoy sex, she must experience a dangerous side, unconvincingly. This “dangerous” side is not sufficiently exploited in the film, and from the point of view that things can go wrong, there can be a feeling of anti-climax. The subject of bondage appears often, but only to the point of danger, and then everything goes well. The film sends out a message stating that this kind of “prelude” is EXCELLENT! If the film talked about the traps of slavery and, as a result, about the terrible consequences of sad masochism, then perhaps this would be a good moral argument. Instead, the film awkwardly jumps out of one “hissing” scene, where Rourke feeds Basinger and blindfolded her. In a film that could be good, he fails because he does not expand and does not expand the themes that the film CAN try to relate; thus, for me, this is not a plot or a topic, but simply a mixture of ideas.
