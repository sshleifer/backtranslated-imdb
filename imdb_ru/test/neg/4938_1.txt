OK, this will contain spoilers. Now I have never seen such a big pile of poop, as a laxative / feed mixed in an elephant enclosure at the zoo! It has more openings for the plot than in laces eaten by moths, and as for the “realistic” line of the plot. Well, sexual slavery is a terrible and very real problem all over the world, and this heap of holds uses this plague as a plot to deceive and tease, shame to everyone who participated in this dubious proposition. But back to the film: if you are going to kidnap people from the airport, by the way, one of the safest and most secluded places in the modern world, by the way, then why put a van in a chair that tinkles everything and needs a plot. Just wait until you leave the airport, pull out a gun, put handcuffs on passengers, calmly drive up to the warehouse and kill the guys, the work is done. On the passenger side, at least three times the good guys put the bad guys out of action and are armed, LOSE THEM! Once in a film, it may just be acceptable not to put a bullet in the skull of the bad guys, but GO three times! And after he killed most of you. In addition, the guy is ready to lower the gun to stop the scar on his cheek, but he kills the girl because of a yeast infection, which can be cured with drugs for $ 20. I could go on about the number of holes in this, but I will not waste any more of my time. Suffice it to say that I have rarely been subjected to such an insult because of such terrible nonsense, and as for the real problem of sexual slavery, girls voluntarily go to new “jobs” in distant countries and are subjected to violence, rape and frequent killings by the gang. A master who meets them from a boat / plane and picks up their passports and freedom. This s ** t is an insult to anyone whose life has been affected by it! Do not waste time!
