Problems: 1) Despite the fact that many consider this a “loving tribute to“ Running from poverty ”,” many old shots are not even from the films “Poverty”, but most of the “Most Dangerous Game” by RKO (1932), with some of the quiet (!?) version of The Lost World (1926)! <br /> <br /> 2) Many old frames are simply used as a filler (old frames on a ship) or as frequently repeated silent shots (for example, when Bela is walking, looking or looking); <br /> <br /> 3) Where is the pantheon of the Fespians-Owners of the Poor Rows (Bela, Boris, Lon Cheney, Jr., George Zucco, John Carradine, Buster Crabb, Tom Neal, etc.) practicing their lines as punch line to jokes with "new" characters (as in "What is the matter, tiger lily?" Woody Allen or in "Dead people do not wear plaid" by Steve Martin)? Even Mike Nelson’s faint commentary on the colored “Madness of the Referee” is funnier than this. <br /> <br /> High Point: a long, but extremely instructive lecture by Gregory Munk, which makes you re-read Belo, John Carradine and George Zucco. It costs only the price of a DVD!
