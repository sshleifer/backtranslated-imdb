I was a college sophomore when this film came out and I never saw it until last night. I finally decided to watch it because I like good dances and because the film had such a cultural influence. After watching the film, I was completely bewildered by how it had any influence other than putting people to sleep. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty ridiculous, if you think about it. Does anyone actually buy the idea that that beer club, full of black old steelmakers and workers, could keep its clientele with high conceptual dances that these girls were doing? All of them would be on Zanzibar faster than you can say "performance." Can you imagine the reaction of the real versions of this audience to this strange television, watching “There is no theatrical dance” that it did? You are welcome. <br /> <br /> It seems plausible to me that there could be a woman who worked at a steel mill and was also a dancer - after all, both of them are physically demanding to work. But I did not buy for a second that this girl was working on a steel courtyard. And I did not buy for a second that I was looking at a real steel courtyard. Steel works are dangerous. You do not make your work area look like a landfill and do not lose limbs. I like some silly pictures, for example, when two welders sit in welding large corrugated pipes. What the hell are they doing there? Or when she cuts six inches of rusty steel bar with a cutter. She was obviously the board and just started cutting random things. <br /> <br /> But such holes in the story can not be noticed if the movie is funny or at least stimulating. However, Flashdance offers nothing to balance it. <br /> <br /> awesome dancing This is the spastic style of twitching and poses that destroyed American musicals until ... well, have we really finished this already? The sensuality sought by the film is ruined by the complete lack of personality of Jennifer Beale. I mean, when I was 42 years old, and when she was supposed to eat lobsters, my only reaction was to think that she should get a lobster breastplate. <br /> <br /> You can't keep up with Alex and dream of her, because her character is so stupid and shallow. The dog had more chances than hers. <br /> <br /> Love affair is flat. It looks like nothing more than a hot-headed boss for one of his employees. Zero Passion. <br /> <br /> Even the last scene where she dances for Orville Redenbacher and some other guys is unsatisfactory, because the reaction of the panels is incredible. What serious dancers will not roll their eyes from the clumsy cheerleader Alex's routine? In short, the film was nothing but leggings and large sweaters. Oh, yes, there is a large portion of nudity, when Alex "rescues" his friend from a useless erotic dancer (ridiculous little hypocrisy). In addition, the film - a waste of time. I would like the MST3K team to still be in business. That would make them good food.
