Unlike some of the reviews written here, I did not hate this film. This is a film that CAN be much better than it was. True, this is not Oscar material, but much better than it was. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot was well crafted. Of course, this film was poorly written. And terribly directed and produced. I mean, how many inappropriate memories can you have? Why were we there? What exactly is the meaning of the opening sequence? It seems that the producer (s) watched "American Beauty" too many times and thought: "I will use this in the action movie." I thought the film didn't act that bad. Wesley Snipes did a decent job, he just stumbled upon some bad direction. And as soon as this film got into the production room, everything got worse. The main actress, I think, had the same problems. Some of the other actions were suspicious, yes, but it was a low-budget film. Again, I would say that the director’s job is to raise and fix it. <br /> <br /> As a general recommendation, I would agree with the first review I read, in which this film is not worth watching. Or maybe it’s worth seeing if you’re a film student and want to see what NOT to do.
