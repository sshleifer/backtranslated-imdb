There is an inherent problem of commenting or reviewing a movie such as this. I remember that I felt the same after I disliked Dogma. If you do not like such a strange and controversial film as “Dr. Mulholland”, you are considered “not receiving”. Of course, for those who have already watched this film, you know that in any case, its meaning does not reach. <br /> <br /> I heard from several different sources that the unique and enjoyable aspect of this film is a dream. how quality it has. In other words, the plot is not structured like other films. In the case of Dr. Mulholland, this is more like an unfocused collage made by a third-grade boy, who put it off until the last second to make his art project. It does not make sense, it should not, but I know that at first it had to be a series. It seems that Lynch had a bunch of unused movies, and they decided to make a bunch of new things out of them. You will notice that near the end of nudity, sex and obscene vocabulary increase. All the things he wouldn't take off for television. <br /> <br /> For the best film, not told in the traditional linear way, rent the Thin Red Line since 1998. It was a great movie, it is not. <br /> Rating: 2 out of 10
