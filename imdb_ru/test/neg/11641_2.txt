Why there are no good reviews? Because this film is hysterically bad. <br /> <br /> Being in a Japanese prison camp during World War II, Jim Brown became a hero who put up with an incredibly incredible racist officer, and the same hysterical character of Jim Brown in Japanese brown officers. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie these actors ever made. There are not only enough stereotypes, but they dominate this film. The music of the sixties and seventies may be the best thing in the film, perhaps because it has nothing to do with the film. <br /> <br /> It is even difficult to sit back and enjoy meaningless entertainment. This film is even more racist than the message about racism, which he is trying to convey. And believe me, I was alive in the seventies, and we thought that shit was as stupid as it was then. It has never been popular.
