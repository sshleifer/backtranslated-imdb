If Daphne du Mourier installed REBECCA in the 1950s in San Francisco, this might well resemble this tense, rather unusual noir from Robert Wise. Valentina Cortese plays a survivor in a concentration camp that steals the identity of a dead woman and takes root in the life of Richard Beyshart (who is also the guardian of the dead woman's son) ... this is absurd and overly also topflight entertainment. Cortese is awesome, slowly falling apart because she understands the mistake she made. Basehart is fine, if a little soft ... although the lighting at the end makes it seem very formidable. Faye Baker is a very good Mrs. Danvers, like a caretaker. The wise is an excellent director, and he continues to move in a rather busy clip. He also puts the classic unmanaged car accident with Cortese (or at least Cortese stunt) behind the wheel.
