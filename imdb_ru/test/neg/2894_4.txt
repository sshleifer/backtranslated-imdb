This is a very boring movie with poorly developed characters, plots that have come to nothing, and are tolerably playable. It looks like a poorly thought-over plagiarism of "2001". <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes it worthy of attention is the scenery, costumes and visual effects. But even this was not enough to keep me awake. I would like to get a soundtrack, especially music during a space flight, for nights when I have trouble falling asleep.
