I do not mind continuing; sometimes they are better than the original. However, in many cases it is better to leave the originals alone ... especially if you cannot duplicate the cast. One of the main reasons that the “Magnificent Seven” was such a hit was a very popular cast. <br /> <br /> This is almost the “magnificent seven” when only Yul Brynner returns as one of the participants of this famous group in the “Magnificent seven”. Since six of the seven guys are missing and replaced by much less well-known actors, this loses its appeal in a hurry. In other words, besides Brynner, these guys have no charisma! It looks like a championship sports team that exposes all substitutes except one. <br /> <br /> Brynner is good, once again: fun to watch, fun to hear with his characteristic deep voice, but the story is not just the rest of the team, limping. This film should never have been made. In the original, we took care of the "seven"; we don't give a damn here
