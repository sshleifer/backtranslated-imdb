The untold origin of the Lone Ranger. He shows who he was and how and why he became a Ranger. <br /> <br /> Legendary bomb. The idea was not bad - to re-invent and present the Lone Ranger to viewers of the 1980s. Immediately, although there were problems. The studio ordered Clayton Moore (the original Ranger) to stop appearing anywhere as the Lone Ranger. This led to a nasty little battle that made headlines. I know people who refused to watch the movie because of the way Moore was treated. They also hired the amazingly incompetent Clinton Spilsbury to play Ranger. Spilsbury was very handsome and muscular, but he had absolutely no charisma and simply could not act. In fact, all his vocal performance was understated by another actor! Also, his behind-the-scenes antics (public drunkenness and beating people) did not help. Acting aside, the script is boring and slow. In addition, the Ranger itself does not appear until an HOUR is in! At the time, there were some complaints that the film was too cruel for PG. However, I do not think it was so bad. <br /> <br /> A few (very few) things were done here - the photo was really beautiful; Michael Horse was as excellent as Tonto; Christopher Lloyd is very funny as a villain, and when the Lone Ranger finally appears (with the inscription William Tell Overture from the soundtrack), it really inspires. But, in general, this is a boring and terrible attempt to reclaim the Lone Ranger. It's easy to see why it was bombed. And 4 - mainly for photography.
