It must be the most boring movie I've ever seen. It is depressing and gloomy, without excitement, the acting of Güls is terrible, since Hulk cannot carry out the correct accent necessary for this film. The story is stupid, and I’m sure that I don’t recommend this nonsense to anyone if you don’t want to die of boredom.
