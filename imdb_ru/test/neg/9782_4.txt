This horror film starts quite promisingly, and there is a moment when I thought to myself: “It will be really good.” However, it gets pretty boring, pretty quickly at the end. The acting is pretty good, as is the location, and the story begins pretty well. The problem is that the screen doesn’t have enough kills and the final is where you have a monster, basically turning tail and running. I wanted to see more, especially after the very good scene of the sleeping bag, where I thought the film was going up and about to become a winner. Unfortunately, after this film showed the monster very little, and the back of the DVD lied, because he told me that the desert literally came alive under the people and was able to devour their flesh ... now it was a movie, an inevitable situation. Of course, it would have made the audience uncomfortable, and this could increase the tension, but this is exactly what horror movies should do! Instead, we have very few shots of a creature or creatures, as it would be, and when we see it, it’s mostly in defense. However, everything was not so bad, just needed more horror, less hunting and more panting.
