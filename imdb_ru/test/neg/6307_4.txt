Dennis Quaid is trying to prove to us that Jerry Lee Lewis was a stupid guy. And he does too much to prove it. Television sequences are very good, like a photocopy of old black and white subjects. The music is fine too, because Mr. Lewis himself sings. But the rest is just the B-Movie Hollywood style with the complex of the Happy Days of the fifties. I think the only good thing about this film is to see young Winona Ryder.
