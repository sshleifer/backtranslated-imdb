I became interested in the film. It seems that it can be a serious drama concerning death, grief and healing, with the addition of some realistic human conflict. Alas, he could not resist. <br /> <br /> I need a movie with somewhat consistent and believable characters. Too many characters in this film are depicted as extremely gullible and inconsistent. Listen, I know that this should not have been Shakespeare, but come on, I need some quality in the script and characteristics. <br /> <br /> With the acting, everything was fine, the script is not that big. At some point, James Brolinâ€™s character is scolded for appearing on a picnic in under-dressed clothes. He declares that to order it will not work. His new wife says that if he goes home and changes clothes, she will tear his clothes off later. This is a howler. There were some unintentionally funny lines in this movie. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to take care of the character of James Brolin. When he so readily gave things to his first wife to his new wife, even allowing him to hurt his daughter, I lost most of my sympathy. Who really cares what happens to him. I must confess that I did not finish the film. If in the last 45 minutes the quality turned out to be 180, let me know. It was just unpleasant to look at and so predictable that I felt that there was no need to end it.
