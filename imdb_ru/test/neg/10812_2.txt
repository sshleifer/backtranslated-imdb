Take your video camera, turn off all the lights in your house and shoot people running around with flashlights for an hour and a half, and you will understand how this movie looks. Watch this movie is very annoying. To be fair, there are scenes of daylight at the very beginning and at the very end of the film. I like scary movies and features of creatures, but this one just did nothing for me. So sorry. I really tried to please. It seems that the plot was a little bit, except that we have to find a way out of here. I didn't learn too much about any of the characters, so it didn't matter if we lost one or two along the way. This is not the worst movie in the world. "Open Water" holds this title for the moment.
