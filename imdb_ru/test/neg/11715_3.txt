A few friends and I visited a video store a few years ago, and we were in one of those moods to rent a few inconspicuous films. My friend grabbed the head of the family, and we were met by a head sitting in a wheelchair. Well, it made us laugh, and we decided to argue about who of those who had to go to the table and pay for the film, argued. Well, you guessed it, it was me !!!!!!!! I have never been so embarrassed in my whole life. We got to the house and put it on, and we rolled on the floor, laughing, about 45 minutes, because it was the funniest film in the world. I can't remember a lot about it, but the one thing I remember was that the blonde girl started this up with some guy in the back of the store every 5 minutes. This head made me laugh, and when I look at other people's comments about this film, it makes me laugh even more. The head of the family is so good, and the head is funny, and I still laugh, ha ha ha ha ha ha
