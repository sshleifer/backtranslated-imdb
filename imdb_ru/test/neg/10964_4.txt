The plot of the film is quite simple: a viral outbreak turned the population into zombies eating meat. Those who left became "hunters." <br /> <br /> Well, firstly, this is NOT the worst movie about zombies. Among the worst are "Zombies" and the infamous "Zombie Lake". <br /> <br /> Actually, I think the idea of ​​"Fast and Undead" was very good, just poorly executed. Given the budget with which they had to work, this film looks very good. I was not at all bored while watching. The special effects were solid, although they once used CGI (a fat zombie wounded in the head), but everything else (blood, guts) was pretty good. Act terribly however. Our main guy looks like a young Clint Eastwood, the other "actors" are not even worth mentioning. As for the plot, they did not work enough to develop the plot. <br /> <br /> Bad: acting, low budget. Good: special effects, an idea for a movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film deserves 4/10 from me. This is not as bad as people say. Imagine ZOMBIE WEST, and then watch this movie.
