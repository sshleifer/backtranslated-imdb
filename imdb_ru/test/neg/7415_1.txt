I think this is one of my ten worst films I've ever seen! There, they fade away every two minutes. If it was on TV, they would have a preview every 2-3 minutes. But there is one look that I personally liked: when the blonde goes to a bath with boiling water, when a man looks, and for about 10 seconds you see her whole body without a towel! It was the best scene in the whole movie, because you see the sasquatch playing the main role in them, but the last 10 minutes is when we see his whole body. In addition, most deaths overs and only scream or roar. And I expected Sasquatch to die. But he did not shoot him, and only 4 or 5 people die in the whole film, I expected 8-10 people to die. Do not watch this movie. I give him F-. Do not waste your time.
