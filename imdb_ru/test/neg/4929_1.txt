“Shuttle” - it was / was more than a boring film that had an interesting beginning, but after half an hour it ended in the most awful way that I could only imagine. This movie has lost its story, if you can call it a story? ... after half an hour. All subsequent scenes are completely disproportionate. The driver is a kind of superman, because he survives every attack with a pistol-knife, etc. Even after he was hit in the leg, he was able to put it in the box. But what a coincidence that in this garage was a box. I really felt sick and confused when the film ended. It could be so great if the story were much better. In my opinion, even a child would make a better story. And why ship the girl with water and food. I stopped counting holes in the plot halfway. And when the film reached its almost delightful final turn, I completely gave up (better to say, tossing). The worst thing about the Shuttle is that it cannot be even worse than worse. Maybe the Scriptwriter / Director Anderson will learn from this lesson and next time give us a decent thriller. I think the better it goes into another genre. I keep my fingers crossed. But now I will read the comments on his future films. first before watching. Waste of time.
