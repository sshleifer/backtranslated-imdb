After I saw this, I concluded that it was most likely a click of a chick; then I found out that Keira’s mother wrote the script in such a way that it was largely confirmed. However, clicking a chicken may have some appeal to men; this one is not very good, and it seems that women are not really well suited (looking at gloomy box office). One point with which, I believe, both sexes agree, is the nonsense of the scene in the film, according to which an analogy is made between the pain of childbirth and the pain of a limb amputated without anesthesia. Although men do not experience pain during childbirth, we understand that this is a painful process; yet it is a natural pain, while amputation is certainly not! Women understand this even better. I suspect that some woman tried to make a feminist statement with bad taste. In fact, many things in this film are of very bad taste. Although movies are now known for their bad taste, this film truly “surpasses” this department. It could be a good film that shows the struggles of Dylan Thomas during World War II; and how strong were the moods against people who somehow managed to avoid military service. Keira's mother, writing on the screen, tries to show how this feeling was used against Dylan, but actually confuses it. Instead, we see two young mothers linking each other; sort of, sort of, sort of. On my way. May be. Somehow. It should be noted that a soldier (husband of a friend of Dylan’s wife) goes home after serving in battle; it is unclear whether the war is over !! Much in this film is also unclear; and although I have already said that I will do it again, since this seems to be the main motive of this mess.
