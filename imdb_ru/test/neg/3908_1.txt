About five years ago, my friend and I went to the video rental store to find something to see. My friend saw the space truckers on the shelf, and we got it. As soon as we got to the house and started watching it, we realized what a piece of shit it was! Can beer swim in space? Is the guy dumping the toilet? A guy with a mechanical member who is trying to excite women by saying: WTF !!! The dumbest, most stupid, most backward, terribly throne piece of garbage that my eyes have ever been exposed to. My friend and I still call him the worst movie we have ever seen. Only one other film came close to its scab (and it would be Jackie Chan's stupid Medallion). If you have ever seen this piece of garbage on the shelf in your video store, do the following: 1. Remove it from the shelf and throw it on the ground. 2. Stomp at least 30 seconds. 3. Continue to set on fire indoors (in the bathroom). 4. Finally, deliver it immediately to your local hazardous waste management facility so that you can get it right. <br /> <br /> REMAIN FROM "SPACE TRUCKERS" !!!!!!!!
