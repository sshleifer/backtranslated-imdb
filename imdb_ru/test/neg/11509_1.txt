Naturally, Sadie sucks, I have no idea what people were thinking when they wrote this garbage. It’s not funny, it’s not cute in any form or form, it’s just disturbing and a waste of money. Sadie is such a bad actor. I lost all my brain cells, watching this show, to be honest, it seemed that this show was forced, it was such a huge, too bloated bunch of crap. <br /> <br /> This show sucks. <br /> <br /> This is a waste of time and money, do not worry, watching this garbage. Characters are so stupid and funny. In the first season, it's just stupid and stupid, then when I saw the second season, I just couldn't take it anymore, it made me want to kill Charlotte Arnold. The second season is just a shame for Disney. This show is also a racist piece.
