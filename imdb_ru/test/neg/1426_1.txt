Just saw which way to the front? on TCM (UK) is a really awful movie. If I paid for the photos, I would go out. <br /> <br /> A terrible mess of the movie. Byers (Lewis) and his comrades hid in uniform from an Italian science fiction film of the 1960s. Were the badges with the symbolism of the CND / Peace on the uniforms ironic? The TV shows were pure 1970s, and I’m sure that the back-up Hollywood TV party could provide a more realistic set. <br /> <br /> The film is riddled with racism. The film removes Mickey from veterans. <br /> <br /> It’s not funny how Lewis each shoots a different film, I can't do it.
