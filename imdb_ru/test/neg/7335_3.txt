The film begins magnificently, with false instructions about the habits of Swedish housewives. After this, we get a detailed reconstruction of post-war Scandinavia with many amazing cars, electronic equipment and interior design; minimal jazz score, good cinematography and stylish design. There is also some funny Scandinavian rivalry, as in von Trier's Riget. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after the installation “Kitchen Stories” collapse like twin towers 9/11. The actors who are trying to portray the emotion of "jealousy", just looking in front of them. The roots of the dialogs filled with stale, funny symbolism are in vain: “I don’t like white swans, I prefer bears and wolves ... have you ever tried bear meat?” In the worst case than Yann Tiersen. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the director did his best in this magnificent production, just to spoil everything.
