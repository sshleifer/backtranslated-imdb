Now I am going to do it without spoilers, if I can. My cousin and I made films on a different weekend, and we stumbled upon it, with a big goofy stuffed animal on the cover. It looked cool, so we rented it next to Kungfu Hustle. <br /> <br /> Wow ... Just ... Wow. <br /> <br /> For a start, the movie was terrible. Now, the box's decoration, opening scenes and music have been decently made, but the film itself is terrible. The action does not correspond to the norm (Sean, the leader, almost does not show any emotions and / or efforts in his character), the stuffed animals are not similar to those on the cover (perhaps false advertising?), And the frames and views are a bad fight event. <br /> <br /> And believe me, I'm a fan of wrestling. I KNOW bad camera angles. And frankly, it's right there with Gigli and the Path of Tan. This made it so bad that it surprises me. It makes me laugh. Anyway, this film takes its place as a good comedy for me. <br /> <br /> But frankly, it serves what you need to do and what not in movies, especially slasher. genre. I recommend that people watch this, just to understand what should be avoided.
