What a crime. I'm not the one who demands the full credibility of the film, but the plot and script of Zoe's Murders is so ingenuous that I found myself wincing through everything (fortunately short) ninety minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> Readers of these reviews have already figured out the plot: Zoe, a call girl who falls in love with American safe cracker Zed, also works at the bank, which Zed will help to rob in high-rate Bastille robbery. <br /> The film erodes confidence from the start. Zed and Zoe’s magic night is very prosaic, and Zoe’s assertions that they have experienced an orgasm for the rest of their lives are more likely to reflect the writer's protracted teenage fantasies than any real chemistry on the screen. Zed’s complete indifference, when his friend Eric throws Zoya out of the hotel room, hardly sets the stage for their later strong attachment. <br /> <br /> In the second act, a group of Eric Bohemians — addicts who are unlucky and leading a small life of petty crime — prepare for their big robbery with an overnight stay in the city. Here, it seems, Roger Avaria’s main goal is to prove that he knows something about drugs. The secondary topic is to convince us (endless repetition) that Eric is really, REALLY happy to see his old friend Zed again. Very glad. Erik’s monstrous, excessive brightness and affection for Zed Erik are not even remotely believable - see, for example, his fake embarrassment at finding a dead cat in his apartment building. The development of the characters who will accompany us to the end of the film is an afterthought. <br /> <br /> A robbery is a catastrophe - understandable, since the plan is ridiculous, and the criminals are complete lovers. It was here that the Accident continues to pay tribute to its idol Quentin Tarantino, showing that he can be more cruel than violent. In fact, he is just more boring than boring. To increase the excitement, an extra guard is hidden in the main safe. It was boring in video games, and now boring. <br /> <br /> Zoya became a hostage during a robbery, but despite our expectations that she would play a key role, she just sits pretty. More precisely, Avarih can do nothing with it. Literally in the last five minutes, she comes to life, breaks the situation with the hostages and rescues grateful, but still dazed, Zed from suffering from any consequences of his crime. Why she does not object to his involvement in the crime - or why she does not care about him - is impossible to say. In the end, she had no chance to see that he was more decent than the rest of the gang. <br /> <br /> Everywhere dialogue is unnatural and false. Much of this in French. As a native speaker, I can assure you that this does not even remotely sound. Eric's sweet-sweet discourse, quickly alternating with the tough-guy bragging, is meant to be charming and scary when cornering, but simply annoying instead. At the same time, his accomplices, frightening cats, are more Scooby-Doo than Thomas Crown. When Eric is shot in a ridiculous example of excessive force, we can all breathe a sigh of relief: like the bank hostages, we will soon be freed from this terrible ordeal.
