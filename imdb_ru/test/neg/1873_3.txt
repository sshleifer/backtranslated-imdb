This is not a good film by standards. It is very poorly written, and the game is slightly higher than nominal (some performances are much lower than nominal, but Swayze and Gray do a very good job). <br /> <br /> What was good: <br /> <br /> The dance episodes were very well set, and as mentioned above, Swayze and Gray were the best. <br /> <br /> What was bad: <br /> <br /> Scenario, “Bad” guys were just too angry to be believable. The best villains are not so evil. These guys (the owner's nephew, the waiter who pervades the girl) do and say ANYTHING that would make me believe that they can be real people (maybe there are guys like them, but I'm sure I don't want to watch a movie about it ). <br /> <br /> Another scene, the first, where Gray and Swayze meet when resort staff “dance”. Swayze and Gray dance together and seem to enjoy themselves. The next time they meet, Swayze is hostile to her. What for? What happened between what made him dislike her so much when they danced well together? <br /> <br /> And some of these lines, I mean “COME” (I cringed at the end when Swayze muttered: “No one enters the child.” As he EVER did it with an imperturbable face. ) <br /> <br /> Another thing is wrong, the situation of the 1960s. Everyone looked and dressed like in the 1980s! Who was in charge of the costumes and hairstyles? <br /> <br /> Music (original music for the film) was ridiculous (with the exception of “I spent my life time”, which was a good song). <br /> <br /> Not the worst movie I’ve ever seen, but certainly the most overrated
