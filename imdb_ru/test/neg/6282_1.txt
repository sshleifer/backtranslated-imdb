SPOILERS <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Is it Tenchi? <br /> This is not Tenchi. <br /> <br /> Virtually all are written terribly by nature ... When it comes to characterization, the only bright spot is the friendship between Ayek and Ryouko. <br /> Furthermore, villainy is not punished for its actions, which are tantamount to rape with mind control. If a male villain had done the same thing Harun had done to Tenchi with one of the women, he would (painfully) have painfully bought her at the end of the movie, dying terribly, and the audience would have been delighted. But Haruna not only does not pay for her crimes, Reko actually forgives and understands her actions. Not! A real Ryoko would destroy her for what Haruna did to her beloved Tenchi; The audience with whom I saw it, including me, all laughed at this scene <br /> <br /> Anime fans, avoid this movie. Fans of Tenchi, avoiding this movie is even more difficult.
