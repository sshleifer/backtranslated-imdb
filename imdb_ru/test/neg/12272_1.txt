Let's face it, a really awful movie, no ... I mean a “really” awful movie, it's a rare, strange and beautiful thing to see. I admire the fact that there is a special place in my heart for such films as Plan 9 from Space, Half-Blood, Views and so on. And although I give this film 1, I strongly urge everyone who loves a bad movie, because he really (a bad movie) found a friend, a snack, something to drink and make the special occasion he deserves: Aussie Park Boyz. <br /> <br /> From the very first moments of the role of the lead actor towards a stunning performance, when he tries to enter the intensity directly into the film, without even looking at the camera (a piece of ham straight from quiet pictures - eat your heart from Rudolph Valentino) to the sudden conclusion "hey, we're out of the movie," you ... don't ... don't ... stop ... laughing. <br /> <br /> To sum up, we can say that these are “Warriors of the Poor”, completed - and this description alone should be enough, but then miracles occur “of the spaghetti food scene”, “We Have Tickets, they are not leave the city, now the "scene", "It's Asians! Run !!" and more. The only really undesirable part is gratuitous rape. Besides that, I dare you to watch this movie. And I dare you to find evidence of action, or lines, or directions, or any of those other boring and unnecessary elements that so-called critics say that the film should be rated as good. <br /> <br /> If this film doesn’t cause uncontrollable laughter before it ends, all I can do is roll my eyes threatening from side to side and shout: “You're a dog! You're a dog! You're a dog !"
