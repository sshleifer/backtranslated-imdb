Because this is exactly what Hell Journey is. Larry Bishop and Tarantino have Weinstein's money parties with the promise to release the film sometime in the future. I'm for a fake loaf and a drink as much as the next guy, but do we really need a movie? In fact, there is nothing worse than warmed remnants of old things that were in use. And I'm not even talking about the cinema of the 70s, because in Hell Ride there is nothing raw and immaculate sensation of the era in which he intends to pay tribute. No, it's sleek and shiny through MTV Hollywood. The old trend Iâ€™m talking about is the self-consciously perverted pseudo-fashionable cinematic world where Tarantino meets Guy Richie and Robert Rodriguez. All three were at least talented and successful for a specific reason. Hell Ride is just a second-hand copy, fickle and boring, sharpened to the maximum, when it must be raw, the aspect of "supercooling" flies forcedly and stupidly. <br /> <br /> For example, there is no reason why such a simple and completely meaningless story should be told in confusing, direct and reverse time. This is just a fad after Tarantino. There is also no reason why the dialogues should be so meaningless that people clap their gums, saying NOTHING: at least when Travolta talked about cheeseburgers in Pulp Fiction, it was fresh. Dialogues here are a bit more than pseudo. There is also no reason why a guitar and rock'n'roll guitar should aimlessly dangle throughout the film. Perhaps the lowest hit in the Hellish Journey is when it tries to be quasi-existential. In the desert there is a merry dream / illusion scene where the bishop eats peyote and sees colors. I almost expected the old Indian to come out and offer pieces of wisdom. <br /> <br /> The only salutary grace of this bottomless poop is the monster of saliva and Vinnie Jones about the tattoo of his wings (and perhaps some of the desert outdoor images). A lot of boobs and hot, lean-dressed babies. Now this is what I can get, but a film that they do not. Everything else is just an empty shell, an imitation of other infinitely more talented imitators.
