The earth was destroyed by a nuclear catastrophe. Well, parts of the Earth, because somewhere in Italy, a group of purebred survivors - those who do not have radioactive contamination - is hiding in a huge mansion surrounded by lush vegetation, waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for people with contaminated blood. The final executioner is the story of one of their potential victims, Alan (William Mang, who, unsurprisingly, is very similar to Kurt Russell), and his efforts to destroy the legally sanctioned hunters, led by Edra (Marina Costa) and Erasmus ( Harrison Muller Jr.) Alan was trained to kill the former police officer of the New York Sam (Woody Strode), who mostly loafed around, giving the student moral support and drinking canned meat. Strode is definitely the best thing in the film, although it doesnâ€™t look very good and only about a third of the running time appears. As for the story, it is a mixture of elements from the best films and stories, including "Ten Little Indians", "The Most Dangerous Game" and "Escape from New York". The ultimate performer moves at a fair pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less demanding action fans.
