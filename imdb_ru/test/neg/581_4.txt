“May contain spoilers.” Unfortunately, the last film by Lou Costellos is slightly better than the last film by Abbott and Costello together “Dance With Me, Henry. This film is not so terrible - it is an amusing career failure. Dorothy Provin is a pleasure to watch, and she makes the film somewhat tolerable. You can't blame Lou Costello for this because a large studio released him, which meant that someone had to give him a green light. In my opinion, Lou Costello dealt with problems related to the loss of her son a few years earlier and the unreasonable attacks of the IRS. If you watch the last 3-4 films of Abbott & Costello, you will notice that the magic has disappeared. Check out “Dance with me, Henry,” now it's a painful movie to watch.
