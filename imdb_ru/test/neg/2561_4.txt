I remember when it came out, it was the first Kung Fu movie we ever met on our way, and we were all glad to see it for sure. Although the action was mediocre at best, it gave us our first Kung Fu taste and our first taste bad dubbing, poor filmmaking or, more precisely, how the Chinese made films at that time. They were admittedly inferior with no questions asked, but here was the value of entertainment, and it certainly caught on. The kung-fu madness began, and Bruce Lee and The Chinese Connection soon followed, or The Chinese Boxer with Jimmy Van Yu. In any case, this film was chosen to pave the way.
