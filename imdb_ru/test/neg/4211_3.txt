I have always been a fan of Chuck Norris for his achievements and his films. For a while I wanted to watch this movie, but for some reason I had no chance. Apparently, I did not miss much. It must be one of Chuck's worst films. Thus, this trucker, Billy Dawes (Ogenstein), is given the opportunity to make his delivery, but bypassing him and forcing him to go to the mob city, where local corrupt judge Trimings (Murdoch), who controls the whole city, arrested him and the fake charges brought on him. He denies the charges and rushes at it. The local cops beat him and he disappears. But now his brother JD Dawes (Norris), another long-haul trucker, is looking for him. Soon he discovers that the city is ruled by a judge of a loser and that his brother is nowhere to be found. Soon after, he begins to beat off almost everyone in the city. Meanwhile, a woman from the movie calls the local truckers on CB radio, and they all burst into the city, destroying it. LOL with there big rigs. In the end, Norris finds his brother and beats off more goons. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty bad. In fact, everything starts well, and you feel great when Norris begins to smash some of these local corrupt policemen, because there are such losers. But there is practically no story, the acting is bad, and the ending ... well, in fact, it does not exist. The judge rammed his house with big equipment and you never know what's going on. He lives? Norris can't even kill him. Meanwhile, Norris eventually takes on a gangster. What's the difference? Norris also manages to grab everyone in the city, he breaks his arm and shot in the side and continues to fight. Come on! This film was obviously made to earn on the CB hobby of the time, why there was one outside of me. They even use barley in the film. In addition, the film closer to the end, it seems, is delayed, and you wonder why this is not the end. This film is bad, but if you are bored and you need to see something, it will take time. As for Norris, he continued to make much better films than this one. 3 out of 10
