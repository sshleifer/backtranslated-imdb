As an avid Disney fan, I was not completely impressed with this film, of course, not motivated enough to shoot it in cinemas. However, I am so glad that I recorded it on DVD and looked at special features. <br /> <br /> You MUST familiarize yourself with the “moose comment”: you can watch the entire film with the commentary by Ratt and Tuke comic relief moose, voiced by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas. Two veterans of the famous comedy troupe Second City ad-lib - by character - for an hour and a half about the film, which they clearly like. I laughed all the time. The pleasure I received from this commentary completely filled the cool reaction that I had to the film itself. Do yourself a favor and listen to him!
