Well, this film begins, and it * looks * like it's a pretty comedy about a completely possessed fan of a soap opera. She has nothing to do with reality outside of soap (something like the inversion of the main characters of "Pleasantville") and runs off to Los Angeles to meet a fictional character. Well, this is a cute movie ... but at the same time it is also a dark, very cruel movie about two hitmen who are going to kill Betty for reasons that are difficult to describe here. Any storyline would be sufficient in itself, but Nurse Betty contains both stories at the same time, and the effect is very unpleasant. I didn't like it very much.
