I fully enter this type of storyline, but as soon as the movie caught fire, I honestly said out loud: "I just rented a two-dollar budget Christian POS." The only thing I liked about this film is the story of the origin, but it was awfully performed. Terrible actors, horrible directors and directors. <br /> <br /> The director and producer must watch the cube before making a movie in the same room. There was absolutely nothing that could intrigue you to such an extent that you did not notice that the entire film was in the same room. Terrible! The two main actresses were very light, and you could say that the director expects to keep your attention. But these two and their biography can talk about it, they are terrible in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Don't give up. If you are not blind, because it can climb several stars if you are only listening to it.
