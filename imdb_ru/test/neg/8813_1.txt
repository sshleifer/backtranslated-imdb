It was the most unrealistic film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can’t believe that the screenwriter and director didn’t see that almost the whole movie looks fantastic. <br /> <br /> For example: <br /> <br /> 1. A killer cannot stay in cold glaze and after 10 hours get up so quickly. <br /> <br /> 2. You cannot get electric current through a water pipe, like in a movie. (Believe me, this is my area) <br /> <br /> 3. With a saw, you can very easily cut 10 pipes in 10 hours. Suppose the chain was made of steel, but the water pipe was rusty and made of iron. <br /> <br /> 4. If you try to cut your leg with a weak saw (at best, it is more likely to die because your hart will fail) before you get to the bone (shin). <br /> <br /> And there are other examples.
