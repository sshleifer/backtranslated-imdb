“ALL GROWN UP” is, in general, an echo and not so much of the original Nickalodeon RUGRATS cartoon featuring children Tommy Pickles, Chuckie Finster, Leela and Phil DeVille, Angelica, Suzy and (later) Kimi (sister Chucky) and Dille (brother Tommy). I grew up on RUGRATS and thought it was a great cartoon. He had a great sense of humor, good stories, and the creators of the show, Klasky & Csupo, were obviously very original and creative with the concept of the adventures of babies. The new show ALL GROWN UP is trying to restore the magic of the original cartoon. I was disappointed when I saw this. I found that the “adult” Chucky was just annoying, and the whole “pre-teenage-mature-acting / trying to be popular”, which was applied (unfortunately) * to all * characters, was sad and swept away. The new series still has some funny scenes and jokes, and it was interesting how the artists would make the whole RUGRATS gang look like the original show ten years after their age. In general, this show is “fair” and watchable, only if a) you are a devoted RUGRATS fan, b) have never seen the original show, c) you are a teenager who has nothing to do, or d) you are so bored that somehow forced to watch this show. This show is not so good. This is not comparable with older episodes of RUGRATS in quality, humor and everything else.
