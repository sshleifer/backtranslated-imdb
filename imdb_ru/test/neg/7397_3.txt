This is one of those films with great potential. Brilliant actors, the debut of a very interesting director and the haunting plot of "Survivor". <br /> <br /> But this does not work at all. <br /> <br /> Start good: Cinematography is awesome. The beauty of the Namibian desert is manifested in a merciless environment, also in photographs. And then there is the action. Everything is good. Jennifer Jason Lee has never been better. Bruce Davison also seems to have developed his character from Altman's Shortcuts. <br /> <br /> Then disappointment: Janet McTeere. Romana Beringer. And the plot. Why on earth did Levring choose "Lyra" for his game? The idea of ​​letting Shakespeare express his despair and inner desires does not work. It looks like a facade. And it is clear that the tragedies occur because of the choice of "Lear." They just need to fit into the “Scenario” of Levring and the Oscar winner Anders Thomas Jensen. <br /> <br /> And the floor. It will take about three days, then all the characters will be more or less upset. Dahh !! Sex is always an easy way out when you need a crisis in the conspiracy. Janet McTier’s part is falling apart completely, mainly because of this ridiculous idea. Sex makes the plot quickly fall to the ground. Instead, they could focus on the dialogue. There must have been a conversation between all the characters, but we mostly see them talking in small groups. Their talk is as dead as Lear and the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> “The King Is Alive” is still not the worst film of a Danish dog in '95. But if you compare it with the latest Dogme 95 from the domestic film Italian Runner, Lone Scherfig, this film falls through. This is not a good movie. This is bad. But it is beautiful.
