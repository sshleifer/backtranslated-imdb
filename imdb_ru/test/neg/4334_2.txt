The evil gang of fables in this film was called “Savages”, hence the name, but “Minor Trouble” would be the best name for this pathetic crowd of weak actors trying to look dangerous. Whenever they wanted to kill someone, they generously rode their motorcycles very slowly, so that their intended victim could easily escape them or push them away from their bikes. Their leader had a strong limp, but he still thought he could beat the hero and win. As for Karen Black, she doesn’t seem to know where she was for most of the film.
