I'm a fan of good, believable action films. And I'm a big fan of elite military units such as Navy Seals. Finally, I'm a big fan of Michael Bean. Unfortunately, none of them allowed me to truly enjoy this film at the time. I gave him another chance just recently when I bought a DVD. Here is a brief list of problems with this movie: 1. This is the best weapon for a poor person, for example, including a virtual music video of the SEAL team playing golf, with the sound “Boys returned to the city”, which ends with Charlie. Sheen makes a senseless pursuit of his towed machine. <br /> <br /> 2. This is quite a Charlie Sheen movie when Sheen tried to become famous before he started doing things like Hot Shots. Reports that I heard show that Shin was a kid on the set, and that influenced the roles and direction that the rest of the cast in the film got. <br /> <br /> 3. Bean is the head of the SEAL team, but Shin rarely obeys him. Any SEAL that shows a lack of discipline that the character has on Tire, or that puts a team in danger, like himself, would not even go through BUDS, let alone get into the team. <br /> <br /> 4. Seals are cross-trained on arms. However, in one part of the film, PRESS must "figure out" how to use the Stinger rocket in the United States. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes in the movie. The beginning of the assault, Bill Paxton as “God,” and some shots from what was supposed to be in Beirut at the time. In general, although this film is a loser.
