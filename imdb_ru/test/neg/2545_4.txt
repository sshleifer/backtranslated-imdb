This film has some nice special effects that rip apart the Japanese archipelago to such an extent that it will humble Godzilla. Two leads are also placed in the above actions. Moreover, in this understated distressing scenario, everything is a bit strange. The inconsistencies in the alignment are bizarre. At some point, Hokkaido plunges into the sea and pyroclastic snow falls to the rest of Japan, and Osaka is buried under a huge tsunami. However, in other parts of the country, people still walk around the sights and lick the ice cream when another tsunami flies into it ... Kusanagi also manages to travel long distances without any interference or even creases in his cream shirt. Other people appear with burns, torn clothes and dirty spots on their faces. <br /> <br /> The Japanese side of the film is touching and disgusting. The sacrifice of Kusanagi on the last evening with Shibasaki is a knightly touch, rarely found in this genre today. However, the ill-starred prime ministers ponder over the Japanese psyche and the seduction of death, and the fact that Japan has been abandoned by everyone and has no friends in the past, hints at a darker paranoia that infects Japanese fears about their status in the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the last sequence is the plagiarism of Armageddon, edited using cookies. <br /> <br /> Finally, my special bear beetle is a ponderous product placement on cigarettes. This time, this is the insane (or is he?) Scientist Toyokawa, who will become the emblem for Japan Tobacco. At some point he manages to light up 5,000 meters below the surface of the ocean, in a miniature submarine the size of a telephone booth. Let me rest.
