A divorced single mother in a picturesque seaside town finds an anonymous love letter and allows him to step up her dormant love life. A favorite project for actress / co-producer Kate Capshaw, who gives a warm, well-modulated lead role, but the story is so thin, and the direction and editing is so messy that a slight dissatisfaction creeps in. Initially, Helen Capshaw presents several friends reading a love letter to her (an interesting visual joke), but the first person with whom they do this trick is Ellen DeGeneres, who does not play a lesbian, but because of this trick comes off as a whole. Different ideas are embodied in the hope that someone will stick, and the continuity is extremely variable. The support of actors (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott, who mostly works without a shirt) is very good, but they cannot save the final act, which is disappointing. Modest, dodgy, pleasant, but politely good-natured, nothing more. ** 1/2 of ****
