If I rated this movie based solely on the actor / script / production, etc., I would give it one star. All these elements are terrible. I can partially forgive this in light of the film’s $ 250 budget. The film contains many entertaining scenes, mostly unintentionally funny. Some of them include: a 14-year-old kid stealing and driving a bus, teenage hooligans (one of whom is wearing a Joy Division T-shirt), frightened by the prosecution of the film’s main characters by a woman waving an apparently fake firearm and clashing with a plastic bull skull in the desert Arizona <br /> <br /> I would give him 5 stars only for entertainment value, if not for the presence of this terribly annoying, morally pontifical old grandmother. I had to dock one star just because of it. Who the hell is making a wedding cake with black icing?
