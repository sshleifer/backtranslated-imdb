Ron Howard and his “editors” had only one work ... Follow the instructions of the book, which was “rich”, “mysterious”, “touching” and extremely cinematic in its approach! <br /> <br /> What did they do? They changed EVERYTHING, and I mean EVERYTHING! What remains is that which has no right to be called “Angels and Demons”! <br /> <br /> I really like the book, and it's very difficult for me to see how they treat her like this! <br /> <br /> I wonder what was the opinion of Dan Brown himself about “this” film? <br /> <br /> I really don’t have the patience to sit down and correct the 1,000,000 changes made, it’s pointless .......
