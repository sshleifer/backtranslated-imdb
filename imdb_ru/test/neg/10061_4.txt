This is truly one of the weakest films based on the work of Agatha Christie, a lifeless, tangled puzzle, which is clearly lacking in grace (and budget!) Of his predecessors (Death on the Nile, Evil Under the Sun) and Donald. Sutherland - the pale shadow of Peter Ustinov in regard to screen detectives (of course, he plays a character that is much less interesting than Poirot). The film manages to move as far as possible only thanks to the plot of Christie (all of her stories have a certain interest), but the direction is hopelessly flat. (* 1/2)
