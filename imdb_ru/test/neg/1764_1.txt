*** SMALL SPOILERS *** Dear Inman, I find it difficult to find kind words to describe the film that I just subjected you to the stars. Problems are widespread and painful for me. .. and yet I feel that I must, if only so that others do not suffer as much as I do. This is not a movie for those less than 50, it is sloooowwwww, soooooo slowwww, and when the great reunion of Ada and Inman takes place. The biggest and most important scene in the film, NOTHING Happens, this is an epic disappointment. Now, as the director should have done, I will briefly express my words and end with this warning, your film is unrelated, boring, has no flow, and Jude Law is tragically mistakenly accepted, he showed more emotions like a robot in AI - be careful, the film should be renamed. A boring mountain. Love hell
