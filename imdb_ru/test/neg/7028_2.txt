This film could be much better than it would have been if it were not for the Disney film. I thought it was all right with the young girl playing Shirley, you could say that she really tried to do her job right. Shirley Temple was completely wrong. I think they should have spent the last time on her childhood, the first hour should have been about young Shirley, then the last hour should have been about senior Shirley. It was a boring movie, not a good Shirley Temple story.
