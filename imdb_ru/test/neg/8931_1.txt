It's on my TV now ... but long enough for me to finish panning in this comment. The previous comment made me understand that this film will not get better, no matter how much I hope and pray. I agree that this film is a huge waste of my time, and it will be your time ... it wonâ€™t get any better! I can't believe this screenwriter makes Atlas shrug! I hope he improved a million times! In his resume, I see other reviews that have been positive reviews, but I'm still not convinced. If you are familiar with his work, please post something here because I really want to see how Atlas straightened his shoulders and would hate him if this guy turned him into the trash that this film turned out to be.
