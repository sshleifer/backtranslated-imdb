I sincerely despair of women when they discuss this joke of the program, as if it is intellectually interesting and contributes to women's liberation and independence. This show is the biggest insult for women next to all these libidinal hip-hop videos. If you talk as a group of reckless teenage boys for $ 100 for dinner in chic restaurants, shopping indiscriminately and jumping into bed with the closest man on the spot is considered inspiring, the fate of Western women may be doomed while we speak. > <br /> In addition to the damage to the female sex, “Sex and the City” is NOT FUN. Never was it funny, fascinating, exciting or original. Episodes are played monotonously. Each character is a factory dummy that behaves the same in every episode. None of these small, unattractive women has ever developed. Perhaps the worst is leading character Carrie Bradshaw. Besides the fact that she looks disgusting, her tendency to over-analyze the relationship is very worthy. On top of all this, the show portrays men as a group of empty-headed marshes that are not able to maintain healthy relationships. Even when there is a decent man, he was somehow painted as a villain. The complete lack of sympathy for men is clearly the work of some kind of “progressive” pseudo-feminists. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this show is that these women live a miserable life. Any intelligent woman will never be jealous of them. This is a banal show with even more banal characters. The New York City Tourism Board should hate how this garbage shows them a beautiful city as a whole! Fortunately, this train wreck is over! Desperate housewives are considered a suitable replacement for SATC. While DH can be quite far-fetched, at least it treats women in more multifaceted ways. Plus, this applies to men more respectfully, and it is really interesting!
