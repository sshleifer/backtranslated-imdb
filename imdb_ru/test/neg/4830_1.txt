Welcome to the world of Vikram Bhatt, a man who was once successful and received several hits with small actors such as KASOOR, RAAZ, as well as the multistar AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA and his one film with Aamir GULAM <br /> <br /> One peak of run About this film they say that they are all Hollywood remakes, and some are worthy, such as those who once worked. <br /> <br /> SPEED is a remake of CELLULAR, and this is terrible too. <br /> <br /> Looking at the Stars, we once had a sell, but now without work, Urmila and Sanjay Suri, then we have the flop Aftab, Ashish Chaudhary, Zayed Khan and others <br /> <br /> The film may be a worthy thriller, but many problems there. Storytelling has several attractive scenes, such as Zayed, hijacking a mobile company, and many others, and the stunts are also ridiculous, and the stories are too funny. The film also took a long time to get to cinemas that lose their spark. <br /> <br /> Direction is awful Music is outdated <br /> <br /> Zayed Khan screams, does faces.e Whatever he does, Urmila is good in his part, Sanjay Suri is not so convincing that Ashish Chaudhary is all forces trying in a negative role, and he is fine. Aftab is terrible, and he makes you laugh in a negative role. It's amazing that the same director gave him his only solo hit KASOOR. Sophie is terrible. Tanushri is not an actress.
