What crack do you smoke? This film, although gloriously entertaining, is terrible! <br /> <br /> The action scenes are so fake that it's sad. The daughter of the colonel is painfully annoying. The ninja training camp is so hilarious that it is almost not worth mentioning. And when Joe puts on a bucket and beats up another army guy, I almost urinated. I could go on ... <br /> <br /> Interestingly, perhaps so. Good no. Well done, of course not. <br /> <br /> As a comment to America as an empire, this is actually very good. Joe as a typical white conqueror is not so amazing, especially in the context of American cinema of the mid-1980s.
