This is one of those films where I was rooting for someone who could finish the film the fastest. I wanted the police to kill Keton and Garcia to get it over with. In fact, this is a deal - two policemen must die, and the third must get terrible burns on Garcia’s son’s face in order to receive a bone marrow transplant from convicted killer Keaton. Is it worth it? Not!
