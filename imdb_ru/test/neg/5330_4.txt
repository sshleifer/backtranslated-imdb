I was duped into watching this by many friendly reviews here. Boy, they are far from the mark! Writing 9-10 points and calling it "one of the best films of the 1990s" is simply unjustified. The big problem here is the lack of tempo and subtle plot. It's like a farce on Prozac. Everything moves forward predictably and sluggishly. The plot for the beginning is rather weak - two scavengers spy on their cunning neighbor, they become witnesses of the murder and solve a conspiracy to recycle waste - and the film does not manage to go much further. There are some funny situations and decent acting skills, but this is not enough to save this prank from the film. <br /> <br /> This is just a comedy that doesn't take its fat ass off the ground, so why waste your time?
