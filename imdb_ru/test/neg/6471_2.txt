I really liked the first film, and when it reappeared, without thinking or checking, I took a family of friends to watch it. I was ashamed that I was so fascinated by it. <br /> <br /> Disney handled the original film in the same way that the human body processes delicious food â€” accepts something good and turns out ... well, you know. And having a black man as an FBI man, the results of the fingerprinting of the informant were muffled. <br /> <br /> Taken as an isolated film, I suppose it's not so bad if someone likes this weird thing, but when someone reads a book or sees the first film, it's terrible!
