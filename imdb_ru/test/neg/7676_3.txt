The real star of the latest films of the Airport is the supersonic carrier created by the French, called the Concord. If you remember that the whole film is dedicated to showing what this plane with a needle on its nose can do in the sky, then the whole film makes sense. <br /> <br /> But if you expect a serious drama here, than by all means take some evasive actions that Concord shows here when some nasty people try to shoot her. <br /> <br /> Susan Blakely plays a television news reporter who also turns out to be the mistress of the military industrial tycoon Robert Wagner. One of Wagner's assistants is just telling her about some of Wagner’s dirty business dealings that sell weapons to people who are not US friendly. When the source, Macon McCalman, was killed in front of her, and she was almost struck by a bounty hunter, from whom she escapes, of course, she confronts Wagner with information. And of course he denies it. But right before Blakely sits on the Concord, McCalman’s widow, Kathleen Maguire, hands her the necessary documents. <br /> <br /> But on the way to Moscow with a stop in Paris, Wagner and his henchmen are trying to shoot down a large bird. But the fearless team of Alain Delon, David Warner and George Kennedy cope with all their tricks. This is quite a lot, as you will see if you want to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> If you are an aviation enthusiast, you are completely indifferent to the plot. This is similar to Le Mans with Steve McQueen, which has a legion of auto racing fans that made it a cult subject. Perhaps Le Mans is better at this, because they simply did not bother with any story. <br /> <br /> Among the passengers is a potted saxophonist played by Jimmy Walker, a distraught mother accompanying a new heart for her. a child played by Cecily Tyson and Martha Ray, a woman with a weak bladder, who is conducting the entire trip from Washington to Paris to the toilet. In fact, she is the best here. <br /> <br /> Robert Wagner must have been a psychic, although I’m sure that thanks to this film he got the role of the second doctor of Dr. Evil in the TV series Austin Powers. /> <br /> I am sure that all interested parties received a large salary from this film, but it looks like it killed the movie saga from the airport.
