When in 1973, Pam Greer co-starred in KOFFI, it was an exciting, albeit flawed film. The plot was sandy and satisfying - even if the acting was often amateurish. It was so successful that American International Pictures decided to rephrase the formula next year with FOXY BROWN - a good movie, but, of course, almost like “COFFY II”. Now, only a year later, the studio apparently refused to create something new for Miss Greer, since SHEBA, BABY, in fact, was essentially the same plot from COFFY and FOXY BROWN. Since the idea was so reworked, and the acting and acting skills are very tedious and low-energy, this really scratches the bottom of the Blacksploitting barrel. <br /> <br /> Just like these other films, SHECA, BABY begins with local black gangsters who crush and end up killing someone whom Pam Greer loves. In the past, they were drug dealers and pimps, now they were gangsters who tried to manage all the credit companies and pawnshops outside the city so that they could corner the market. And, as in other films, Pam - a hit squad from one woman - gives justice and fusses well. And, as in other films, there is a “cat fight” between Pam and the White Lady right in front of “Mr. Big”. And, like in other films, Mr. Big is a white guy pulling all the strings. And, like other films, she is captured by Mr. Big. And, as in other films, he does NOT kill her right away, but gives her enough opportunity to escape (here, leaving the knife to lie comfortably around). And, like in other films, she is finally released and kills his jive - @ $$. <br /> <br /> Although this formula really seemed interesting in 1973, this film was a frankly predictable exercise. Even if you did not see other films, it was still bad, because the action was so slow - the punches and kicks seemed so slow and staged. The same can be said about the shootout. In one scene, four guys with machine guns, AR-15 and shotguns are attacking. Pam responds by opening fire with a .357 revolver and killing 3 out of 4 and forcing the other to surrender !!! Even if she was a good shot, she was rather slow, and the guys seemed to be just waiting for her to kill them !!! Plus, even the shooter of the world champion or Rambo would not have been able to succeed with such one-sided chances - after all, these guys had very impressive weapons, and they were already aimed at her when she “cleverly” drew her pistol and easily sent these professional killers !! <br /> <br /> In addition to the slow and unconvincing action films compared to any other Blaxpoitation film, there are many logical gaps in the film that indicate that the script is terrible, but the studio just doesn't care. On one occasion, her boyfriend, Williams, knew about the yacht and Nu-tronic at the end of the film, but Pam never told him - how did he know about it? In another, the police approach a boat filled with hoods, and the hood immediately opens fire. However, the police did not have any evidence that something was happening, and the fraudsters started firing with a little provocation. And the scammers had machine guns of .30 caliber and other amazingly powerful weapons, but in many cases they were killed by policemen wearing snub-nosed .38s! <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this is a great example of what "was done / done, that .... BETTER." I love Blaxploitation movies, but this one is too dumb and slow to deserve watching, with the exception of very loyal fans of the genre.
