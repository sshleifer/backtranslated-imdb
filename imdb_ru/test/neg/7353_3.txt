Why did Bert Lancaster allow himself to play poor shnuk, which was finally undermined by the femme fatale, Anna Dundee, who Yvonne DeCarlo played in Chris Cross? For the same reason that Robert Mitchum allowed himself to become another loser who fell in love with the femme fatale Faith Domegg in the movie “Where the Danger Lives” in 1950. Perhaps they both felt that it was a good way to show that they had a “range” as actors — that playing with the type, the usual role of the “tough guy” they were known for, would improve their image as actors who can play any Role, But the problem was that roles like Steve Thompson, the criss-cross dairy film, miserable to the sick with love, did nothing to help Lancaster's career. Not only does Lancaster completely disagree with the role of Thompson in one note, but there is something incredible (and, one can say, pitiful) about the main character of the film. <br /> <br /> “Chris Cross” is an infinitely slow movie. Among the many unnecessary scenes in the film there is a beginning: a memory in which it is told about Thompson’s confrontation with “Dundee” Dan Durya in a nightclub. Everything that happens in this initial memory is explained later in the picture: the illicit connection between Steve and Anna, Steve's tense relationship with police officer Martinez, and his bad blood with Dundee. If the director Siodmark felt obliged to start the film with memories, why not leave it less than three minutes? I think it would be more efficient. <br /> <br /> In Criss Cross, it takes some time before the main character commits himself and leaves the “ordinary” world of the First Act. This is the scene in which he “passes by” and “collides” with Anna at a nightclub. And notice how Siodmak spends so much time going back and forth between Anna's dances and Steve staring at her? In addition to end-to-end, he also spends a lot of time concentrating on Esi Morales and his Rumba group, rather than on promoting the story. <br /> <br /> Up to the crisis of the second act, the story unfolds with Thompson, who is experiencing various unpleasant encounters with Anna, and then drowning in grief at her usual watering place. In the middle of the second act, he learns that Anna fled and married Dundee. At this point, it is becoming increasingly clear that one of the main weaknesses of the film is that Dundee never appears on the screen. for most of the second act. There are no confrontations between Thompson and Dundee at this time, and we still have quite uninteresting frauds between two birds in love. As it turns out (and Anna “explains” this later to Steve), the reason why she left was not only because he disappeared for eight months, but she also felt pressure from Steve’s mother, as well as direct threats from police officer Martinez, who hinted that he would make sure she was in the Women's House of detention. Anna returns to Steve because she realizes that she has made a big mistake with Dundee. It turns out that he beats her, and now she is afraid of him. <br /> <br /> One of the stupid objections uttered by more than one Character in Criss Cross is that you can never steal an armored car. But everyone is surprised when Steve notes that this can be done if this is “inner work”! You would think that Dundee would know about the “profession” of Steve as the driver of an armored car and offered him in advance. But, of course, Steve must propose that Dundee not kill him after finding his affair with Anna (if they are so afraid of being caught, why are Steve and Anna meeting in his apartment, where can Dundee find them so easily?) I really enjoyed Finchley (played by Alan Napier), the “brains” of the operation. Dundee is so stupid that he has to hire this former alcoholic professor who is putting a card with a robbery. Oh, there is the question of acquiring components for creating gas bombs used during the robbery, and, of course, Finchley is also good at it! <br /> <br /> The only really well-made scene in the entire film is an armored car. robbery. The editing was quite good, as it depicted the growing effect of the robbery, the spoiled one. When gas bombs explode, gang brutality manifests itself in high relief, when Dundee kills an innocent security guard of an armored car. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film is as tight as the entire movie. Why is one of the dundee fools kidnapping Thompson? Here is this nurse, then the rogue is waiting outside, then he enters and pretends that he is a friend, Steve falls asleep, and finally, after he wakes up, he kills him. <br /> <br /> When Steve finally meets with Anna at the house, I wonder how Anna got the cash. She somehow stole him from Dundee after the robbery, when he went out for dinner? This is never explained. Even worse, Anna suddenly becomes an evil femme fatale out of the blue. Previously, her egoism and attraction to Dundee could be explained by her supposed failure from the threats of Steve and Martinez. But after returning to Steve, because she is afraid of Dundee, she inexplicably turns to him when he is most vulnerable. Just as there is "instant coffee", you have "soluble femme fatale". <br /> <br /> In the film “Noir ?? Encyclopedic reference to the American style "Silver and Ward, the authors welcome" Criss by the Cross "as" one of the most tragic and compelling films of noir. " I beg to differ. In order to have a tragedy, you need characters that have greater depth, but in order to be convincing, you need a believable story. Criss Cross has neither. This is the overrated “B Movie,” which somehow ended up in the pantheon of art houses. Once again, the herd mentality won in the evaluation of paintings of past years.
