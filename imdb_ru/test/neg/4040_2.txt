This is the same old shit that is being cast out by amateur idiots who have no idea how to make a movie — well, maybe that's why this movie has an interesting video! <br /> <br /> I think it’s my fault that I spent the money to see it (one of the worst decisions I have ever made). What a waste. I usually like B movies, some of them are actually pretty good - but it's just too funny and stupid to be funny. <br /> <br /> The losers who did this junk deserve to be ruined to waste everyone’s time and money on making a film that obviously doesn’t even deserve to be in a movie! These so-called filmmakers have absolutely NO talent! <br /> <br /> A stupid conspiracy, a terrible game (especially transvestites - what kind of patient would have really found so sexy?!), inept letter (even if there was a script - it looks like a kind of bull **** which someone just came up with on the spot) <br /> <br /> What is surprising about this film is its complete absence of something well done. <br /> <br /> How much attention should be paid to the details to ensure that every frame of the film is far below reasonable standards? I do not think that it would be possible to make such a bad film intentionally, and it is unthinkable that simply failure could lead to such terrible results. <br /> <br /> In any case, avoid this smelly bomb at any cost! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
