A dark but humorous story involving a policeman who has direct experience with vampires and decides that he should quit his job in order to pursue these evil creatures. The battle scenes were just as frivolous as the average schoolchildren in the battle of the Second World War. The set lines spoke as if the actors had no motivation to be there. The props were bad because he didn’t even look as if he could function to the least. most of the film seemed to be filmed in someone’s basement (in some scenes you could see rafters in a scene that shouldn’t look like in the basement). The plot had no motivation to move forward or backward, it just stopped from time to time without a reason for the actions of some characters. At times I felt that the sound effects were inappropriate for this horror genre and other animated series. He looks like the movie "Blade" in that he is a hunter of African American vampires. However, this is where the similarities end, and the film looks closer to the Saturday Night Live parody.
