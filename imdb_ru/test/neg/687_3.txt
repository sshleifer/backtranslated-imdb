I have as much testosterone as the next guy, and Raquel Welch in all its glory is definitely worth a look; but the fact is that a cardboard cutout could act better, and an hour and a half of showing her significant assets, Mrs. V. does not make the film. <br /> <br /> Given the cast, it’s surprising that it’s as bad as it is. I've never been a big fan of Wagner, and his tough guy Harry is about as convincing as a $ 9 bill. Godfrey Cambridge and Vittorio de Sica, whom I usually enjoy, seem to be sleeping along their lines; and as for Edward J. ... well, I can only assume that he was there for salary. <br /> <br /> This film is a mess: from a non-existent conspiracy, through an action of the beginning and an unfunny script to a childish farce and annoying music of the 60s. If it were not for Miss Welch, I would give her 0. <br /> <br /> However, she is a pleasure for the eyes - even better than her delightful cameo in “Blinded” - and for that reason alone I gave she is 3.
