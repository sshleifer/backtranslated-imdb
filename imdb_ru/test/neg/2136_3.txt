WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Waves after the first film “Jaws” were noticeable both in the 1980s and in subsequent years. Cinema monsters have evolved from radioactive monsters into unknown and voracious animals hiding in unexplored corners of human experience (i.e. Ocean, deep space, genetics). Although Jaws was an important milestone in this particular horror movie kingdom, few films could compare with the inherent impact of the original. "Shark rosso nell'oceano" (aka Fish-Devil or Red Ocean) is a faithful follower of the original formula "Jaws". After some sea creature was brutally killed by several unfortunate boats and sea creatures, the initial desire to discover the beast occurs, then it is not possible to study it without terrible results and the final push to destroy it. Despite the fact that the filmmakers tried to bring some freshness into the equation by adding elements of technology and a corporate conspiracy, the result was simply disastrous. This film is sinking under the weight of its own terrible editing, fragile games and cheap fright. <br /> <br /> The most painful feature of the Devil Fish is the editing of the molds. From the very beginning of the film, when 3 different scenes are mixed together, the viewer feels that the film lacks technical certainty. It seems that the editors cut scenes around an established musical score instead of cutting the film and then making the necessary changes to the music. In addition, each section is a segment, and it seems that the editors have never heard of the terms “fade out”, “erase” or “dissolve”. The effects of scenes can never be set, because they are immediately interrupted after the last line and a new scene begins. There are many stupid camera tricks, for example, when two main characters share a personal moment on the beach, and some time-lapse images of their actions are combined on their bodies. <br /> <br /> Music is equally soft. The theme of the creature is a hopeless duplicate of the Jaws theme with a few variations. Although I like to keep my reviews devoid of the influence of MST3K, Mike most accurately described the dismal rating as "soft core porn music." The inability to cause tension in a film that depends so heavily on it is a fatal blow to Devil Fish. Acting is outdated, relationships are confusing, and the whole plot is ridiculous. The question remains: if genetics reached such a level as to create a huge sea monster chimera to protect the interests of the ocean, why it was impossible to use more practical uses for better humanity? One of the few positive aspects of this film is the idea of ​​a monster, although its presence in the film is less than stellar. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is bad enough to sink below mediocre. If Jaws had never been made, then the film could have been described as medium, because its subject would be new and exciting, even if it was performed ineffectively. Unfortunately, as an exact copy of Spielberg's original thriller, it is most conveniently located on a pile of cheese.
