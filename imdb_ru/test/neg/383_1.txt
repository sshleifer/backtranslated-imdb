What do you do with all the material that does not make the final editing of the film? You can leave this aside if a stripped down or extended version of the director is released one day. You can sell it in the form of video to use it in another movie. You could just litter it. Or you can collect it, accumulating more and more from each film you make, and then use it to create another film, without regard to the sequence or any meaning. Throw a very primitive narrative skeleton into it and build a number of possibilities (no, no excuses) to insert into your celluloid lists. Sorry for the completely pointless nature of the plot, substituting all this in the head director of a horror movie, and you get yourself a terrible movie. All this can be done in just a few days of shooting. And idiots like me will spend two hours of their lives on it. And then come here and try to warn others. The whole chain of events is a big waste of time.
