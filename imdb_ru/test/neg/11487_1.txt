It will be difficult to do so in order to fill 10 lines .... But I will try (just so that others do not make the same mistake as I did - watch this (horrible and boring) movie. <br /> <br /> I like Patrick Swayze - he played well in films like Ghost - Dirty Dancing - Point Break - North & South (TV series), but in this film ..... ARGH .... This movie is such a cool acting game is terrible - the script sucks - well .. I can't even find ONE good thing, nothing, absolutely NOTHING. I watched it with two other friends, and we all agreed that it was one of the most boring films The MOV we have ever seen is visible, and the fact that it lasts more than 3 hours (which we did not know) - when Part 1 ended and it was said “to be continued”, we almost shouted “Ooooooooooooooooo, 90 minutes of this movie !!!! ". <br /> <br /> It hurts to watch this movie: it never gives the impression that the actors are Russian, the militants are extremely bad. It is ONLY a good scene when the Truck explodes at the beginning of the movie! The rest is Cotton! GO to the toilet, instead of watching this film (and not running, crying, if you see this film - you were warned in advance!) Personally, I would recommend Patrick Swayze to call his agent and ask them to remember this film - it is bad.
