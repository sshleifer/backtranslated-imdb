I watched it mainly for the sole reason that there should have been references from the Third Reich. It turned out to be a rather brainless and predictable slash film that seemed to be designed to appeal to feminists or something like that. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something, if you wait a whole movie to see an attractive female breast the last thing you want is a “tasteful” filmed sex scene with annoying camera angles that have nothing show Her busty friend didn’t pull her out either, but we saw a lot of male asses and pubic hair, as well as guys without shirts. And at the end you have our heroine, magically dodging the pushes of a scalpel and the villain’s sweeps (which turns out to be cool, funny enough), and she easily fights with him (aha), while her male love interest is bound and waiting to be saved. The funniest thing was when she lifted a chair and "swung" his boyfriend, and he broke down over him. Now it will be about as much as she can lift into a chair, not to mention breaking it against a person who has enough strength to break it! It looks ridiculous, it basically presses him to her, and it falls apart. If you are going to make such a “role changing” garbage (which has already been done before death), then you should at least make it almost believable. <br /> <br /> Although there was one good point. The bad guy managed to overcome his slutty friend, who taught her a lesson that he is such a tramp and sleeps around. This is not exactly what feminists would like. <br /> <br /> Pretty silly. Not that American clicking slashes are usually much better, but you have to wonder why they are concerned. There is nothing new in this genre. <br /> <br /> 5/10
