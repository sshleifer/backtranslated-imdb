I haven't even watched this whole movie. Now I like science fiction movies of the 50s, even when they are wildly inaccurate, but this one just annoyed me. On the one hand, one of the crew members on the spacecraft speaks and behaves as if he had moved into the tenth grade. It looks like he should be in a bowling league, not on a spaceship. From the window of the spacecraft, the crew admires the Earth, and this chest says: “Do you see Brooklyn?” And the other guy says “Of course.” And tit says: “Gee, I wonder who the pitching is?” I beg your pardon, I think my parties have split. <br /> <br /> When they first go into orbit, the tit says: “The moon is just to watch! Take me back! Observing how the team makes mouths stretched out and screams from G acceleration during takeoff is also not one of the best moments of the film. (Perhaps the best moment of the film can be identified by the big “END” icon on the screen.) <br /> <br /> We also discover that they cannot open the hatch, because the tit has smeared it before it took off. Undoubtedly, the spacecraft will be "oiled" by a member of the crew, who, as we will find out later, never wore a spacesuit before and knows nothing about weightlessness. As baby Huey once said, an overgrown fat cartoon duck: “It sounds logical!” The effects without gravity in space are so bad that it hurts to watch. (Everyone knows that in the absence of gravity everything tends to increase.) <br /> <br /> How this film gets 6.3 out of 10 stars when other significantly better films are not rated higher is a mystery to me. I really like old science fiction movies, but this one is unrealistic, and unsuccessful attempts at a character’s humor by adding this chest from the lube pit at the gas station do not work at all — they just destroy the movie. I think that in retrospect I do not hate the entire film, but the fact that the tit is obviously not the one who will be on the spacecraft - not even to “lubricate the hatch”. OH MY GOD. I wonder if he checked the fan belts too? Perhaps, if they left the "boob" on the trip, it might not be so painful. Despite this, it is only average. I don't know what all the others are raving about. <br /> <br /> Would you like to see a space film from the 1950s? "Rocketship X-M" is superior to all this, damn it. Perhaps not so much "realism" as a more serious story and less stupid characters.
