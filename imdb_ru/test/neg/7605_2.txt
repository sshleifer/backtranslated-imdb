This sequel is pretty awful, to be honest. I'm a fan of kung fu movies, and this is definitely the worst I've ever seen. Bride with White Hair 1 was actually pretty good, and this is a huge disappointment. BWWH 1 was brilliant in some way with a unique evil bad guy. <br /> <br /> The couple from the first film played a small role in this film. Instead, the film revolves around a group of uninteresting characters trying to get revenge on their fallen clans. But there is no antagonist in this film, so revenge is mute. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is Kung Fu or lack of it. They literally had a street style fight. The character at the end refused to fight, because there was not enough choreography.
