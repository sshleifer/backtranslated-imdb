This is a snuff film. I'm shocked, he even counts in the IMDb library. And Bill, Julia, and all the other “professional” actors should be ashamed to be part of this sick movie. I thought I was going to watch a somewhat classic horror film with a creative purpose that writers like to invent ... it doesn't usually make sense when I write a horror movie, but as a spectator we try to rationalize and understand. This ending was not creative. He was sick and has all the signs of a snuff film. I am shocked that it was edited for this final, and even more shocked that it will be released for distribution by the end of June 2009. It can not be shown in the theater. It is harmful for innocent minds on many levels .... see the film, the final, and you will understand this statement. Plus, the plot includes a cute little girl "not yet 9," says her character. She is not in a snuffbox, but she is an integral part of the film. Why do directors feel they need to shock a sick click to get a confession? Directed in the wrong direction, if he believes that this is a feature film.
