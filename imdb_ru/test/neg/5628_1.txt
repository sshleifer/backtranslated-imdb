Known as a British film, so bad that it needed to be distributed free of charge with a newspaper, the quality of this “Thriller” of the Children's Cinema Fund can be guessed by the abnormal number of votes it receives and a large number of rave reviews from posters without publication history and other reviews on their name. The regulars know what it means, the gullible can be deceived. If they really plunge into the waters of this, they will not last long until he tightens them. Technically inept, when a microphone shoots at him or a reflection of a team is reflected, it all goes on forever in the forgetful DAWNCHI CODE for $ 5 a day. The end is just offensive, but do not worry. It is not as if you got it far!
