I suppose to say that this is a terrible movie would be unfair, but it is pretty bad. Sub-Disney storyline includes dogs playing football and falling in love (oh, how cute!). The game is not bad, but it could definitely be better, especially for the young Canadian actor Kevin Zegers, who throughout the whole film looks confused, as if he doesn't even want to be there. In any case, children will like it, but parents beware!
