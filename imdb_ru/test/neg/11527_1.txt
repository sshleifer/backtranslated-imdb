Admittedly, you can put an airplane model on a black background and call it science fiction, and that's enough to interest me, so if you are such, Black Horizon will at least interest you before you look at it. The best part of the movie is when they rephrase some real shots of the shuttle launch. <br /> <br /> The film is similar to the Naked Gun series, faking police dramas with bad clichés and bad play. Unfortunately, I don’t think they should have been funny, the actors are really made of cardboard, the dialogue really sucks, so you just have to laugh at them, not with them. <br /> <br /> incl. note: you rarely see a movie that happens half in space, half on earth and does not mix with expected aliens and supernatural events. I really crave a more realistic drama based on our cosmic endeavors.
