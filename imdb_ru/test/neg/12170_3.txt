First, it is NOT an adaptation of Stephen King’s book, story, short story, or anything else. From the EW website and their review in the series, when it first went on the air, "... he never records his audience and never reveals contempt for his subjects. His first original work for television, Stephen King's Golden Years (CBS, July 16, 9-11 pm), is no exception. "<br /> <br /> The series seems to be (as others have mentioned) the ongoing series, so we never saw the ending after climbing they left us. But this was never clearly explained to viewers who could not understand , how will it all end ?? <br /> <br /> When the series went on videotape, he advertised himself as “an unprecedented ending!” “It was necessary to say:“ Never seen the end! ”<br /> <br / > *** Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> The ending itself was the only significant part changed for the video (although parts of the whole were omitted) and that changed the ending was what ruined the story. For example, instead of two of our fearless FBI agents who understand that they were now tagged as bad guys and fleeing from the evil Jude Anderson from the Store (as originally broadcast), Jude just approaches them ... And they shoot him, Blast, dead, and no real emotions to talk about the scene. Same with Harlan and his wife. Whereas the original ending left us with an impressive cliff hanger, in the video they just get out of the bully's car. <br /> <br /> *** End Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> It was the sad end of a pretty well-shot mini-series, due to which the video is absolutely not worth buying or even renting. Regards, save your money and your time.
