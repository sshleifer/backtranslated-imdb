This film is really incredible, in every sense of the word. I could not believe what I saw and heard, and I still did not believe. Hepburn is probably my favorite actress, but it was funny. Being a complacent man, I know how it should sound, and this is not Kate Bay Bay accent. The only thing I found funnier was the fact that the guy who played Charlie Chan so many times, Sidney Toler, was played as another hillbilly with an emphasis on coincidence. Maybe it was a practical joke, if you think about it. I can not think of any other reason for such a kind of casting. Well, maybe it is. I noticed that Natalie Schaefer, Lavi Howell on Gilligan Island, appeared in this play on Broadway. Can you imagine what role she could play?
