Formula to max. None of the titles reflect the actual content of the series “The Fight against the Nazis in Morocco” (in fact, Iverson's ranch). The plot is only to fill the lull between the fist fights. Packaging requires more than 40 "fist meetings" in 15 chapters. These are at least three chapters! Apart from the fact that Duncan Renaldo was filmed as a Spanish accented Frenchman, watching how much furniture was turned upside down, broken, thrown, burned, or blown up, this is what the show really is. When the main characters start fighting, you can bet that everyone in the room will be in it too. So, thank the battle choreographer, who is the real star of this series! <br /> <br /> Two positive remarks: the characters sometimes lose their hats during fights, and, best of all, we have a side impact with a girl (often a journalist like her here), actually participating in the chaos, mostly shooting and killing the bad guys. Ahead is Linda Sterling, who kills the main villain in The Hunt for the Secret Island (1945). On the negative side, too many jumping out of the way escapes - before the slab falls, before the car crosses the rock, before the speed boat explodes, before the building explodes, before the truck collides with you, etc. T. . D. <br /> <br /> It’s alleged that this series was partially “inspired” by George Lucas to create the first Indiana Jones film, but this is an implied concept rather than an actual story or development of the series. <br /> <br /> Rod Cameron “shines” like moving rock, the role he played in all his films. In addition, you observe how all the furniture is broken, nothing happens here, compared to other TV shows, in which there are fewer fights, more scenes, better actors and more developed characters. <br /> <br /> I give 3 for all breaking furniture.
