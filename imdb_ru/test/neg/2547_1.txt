What a horrible movie! It perfectly reflects the state of degeneration of French society, where the most basic respect for healthy values ​​and traditions has completely disappeared. The plot is meaningless, the film is not funny, but the characters are completely small and uninteresting. At the very least, the direction and cinema is very bad and boring. Catherine Deneuve is just as bad an actress as ever, even when she was directed by Bunuel in Belle De Jour. The rest are usually good actors (Vincent Lyndon, Lin Renault, Jean Yang) seem completely lost in the ocean of vulgarity, banality and anxiety. I cannot fail to draw a parallel with James Ivory’s wonderful “Le Divorce,” with his thoughtful depiction of French and American morals, his superb cinematic and stellar cast that finds good use. Having seen “Le Divorce”, you can feel some sympathy for the French, regardless of their weaknesses. Belle Maman leaves you with sickening contempt for your morally bankrupt and ignorant heroes.
