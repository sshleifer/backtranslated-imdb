Van Sant copies Hitchcock's masterpiece, shot for a shot, including some modern aspects: the player and nudity from Anne Heche. If you do not have a strong desire to see Miss Heche naked, there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie instead of the original. Hitchcock's masterpiece is much better, and Van Sant does not understand that by hiding nudity and blood, the original scene of the soul becomes even more terrifying. Ask Janet Lee about this. The game is also much flatter and the technical aspects are much less impressive.
