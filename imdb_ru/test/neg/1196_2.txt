This film was fine, but, like most television series, it would be better if it was made only for television. The best and most loved characters had only five minute roles, while three mediocre characters were throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Unlike most television series based on British films, this film begins and seems like a winner, but the tempo stops suddenly when three mediocre characters in the real world are waiting to capture three comedians. <br /> <br /> The film is not going anywhere when Hillary is in a room with a captured Steve, Lipp, disguised as Steve, and Jeff, somehow recording himself in medieval times. What made me think "hold on?" Why does he not need the key to enter this world, unlike the characters of Royston Vasya? The medieval scene was fine, but Monty Python did it much better and, of course, funnier, with the cameos from Peter Kay and Simon Pegg, both didnâ€™t say anything funny, Kay had a line, and Pegg just sat on the wall, looking bored. br /> <br /> What pleased me is that they seem to have forgotten what happened in previous episodes such as Hillary fled to the Caribbean on television in episode 2, but in the film he escaped from prison as well Lipp is a pedophile vampire who was not mentioned at all in the film, which was also very disturbing when he was alone, looking after the children. <br /> <br /> There were many holes in the plot and unexplained situations, for example, how did Jeff and the Dark escape from the Middle Ages back to Royston Wasi? As in the 3rd series, the film began well, but as the film progressed, it slowly descended and had a very weak predictable end. <br /> <br /> It would be better for them to do what Monty Python did and remake everything possible, both classic sketches from the 1-3 series and the Christmas special, which turned it into a film that will re-introduce the characters to a whole new audience. which can not be asked to watch the show or buy DVDs. . <br /> <br /> The best advice is to save your money and wait until it appears on television.
