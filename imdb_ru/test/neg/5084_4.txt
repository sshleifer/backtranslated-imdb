Perhaps it was exciting for the audience in 1946, but now the film is a bit boring. It was hard for me to watch it all, and it was very predictable: I mean, we know from the very beginning of the film that Wells is a Nazi war criminal, and I will give you one assumption as to whether he was caught and punished accordingly . <br /> <br /> Not worth watching. Sadly, Wells has only made three films worthy of attention during his long career: Kane, Ambersons, and Touch of Evil.
