I have yet to look at STARCRASH (1979) - this obviously stupid Italian look at STAR WARS (1977) - but it cannot be much worse than this unhealthy piece of garbage, which, suffice it to say, makes Mel Brooks look so-so SPACE (1987) like a work of art! In fact, the main reason why GALAKSIN is remembered at all in our day lies in the tragic fate that befell her leading lady - the central personality of Playboy Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her insanely jealous estranged husband - even before the film received its official premiere ! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Statten (who later made two biographies about her, in which she was portrayed by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) plays the main role, in the first half of the film she was removed from the backup. in a chair, allegedly at the wheel of a 27-year-old spacecraft on a particular planet; In fact, Galaxina is a versatile android, which also serves the stupid team with its snacks, warms them all up under the collar and even goes in search of the Blue Star (cue choral music) after landing! Having said that, Statten certainly looks bright in her white outfit, and even if her role hardly requires a lot of effort from any acting talent she can possess, this is also not entirely humiliating. <br /> <br /> However, it is ironic that for the film that bears her name, she is clouded by the courtesy and potential mischief of her teammates, especially the annoying captain Cornelius Butt (which gives you an idea of ​​the level of comedy shown here ), a long time eared, painted guy, smoking pot, an old Chinese with a quote from proverbs and, best of all (relatively speaking), a dirty, stony, hairy alien creature, which they hold captive. The villain of the play is a metal-clad non-being who, nevertheless, laughs most in the film when, hearing the choral music after each mention of the Blue Star, exclaims: “What the fuck is this ** t?” - fantastic classics, which is perverted by this bastard in his ridiculous attempts to fake the genre, because they are not only unconvincing, but also obvious; oddly enough, but crazy, but ultimately, a benevolent alien seems to be playing miniature Hollywood veteran Angelo Rossitto! <br /> <br /> Then what is it that the scenes shot on the planet that they visit (which is more like a Western set, and not a planetary landscape) has a yellowish tinge like the sun, and its inhabitants are “gourmet people” (their menu includes Skin and Tonic delicacies, Scotch on the rocks, Hip Pies, Baked Alaskan, etc.), but don’t mention the motorcycle gang that serves its particular deity (Harley Davidson ), and when our heroes run away in the background, they dare not shoot at them for fear of hitting their “Lord ". God (terrible) really ...
