This disaster film is a remake of a 1973 film with the same title based on the Sakyo Komatsu novel. Japan is located next to the Pacific Ring of Fire (active volcanoes), as well as along plate tectonics, a shift which would cause earthquakes and tsunamis (in itself, the Japanese term for a tidal wave). Naturally, this creates a natural background for the disaster picture, as Hollywood spends the field day with films such as Armageddon, Deep Strike and, more recently, Day After Tomorrow, which looks at how global warming becomes a natural catalyst. disasters have become insane. world. <br /> <br /> But I have to say the following: “Flooding of Japan” makes all the films mentioned earlier look like classics. This film about the disaster - it is a disaster, and large-scale. The need to look at my watch every 10-15 minutes is a signal that the film is not involved and feels that it has dispersed the lead time. <br /> <br /> The special effects just look great. From space shots in space style to a bright re-creation of all conceivable natural disasters that can hit the land of the rising sun, the effect is the star of the show. However, the presence of impressive computer graphics does not in itself make the film taste good, since too much good is just boring. <br /> <br /> If you saw a trailer where effects and specific scenes of chaos and chaos entice you, then yes, in fact these scenes are just that. No details, and everything can be seen from afar, in a godlike mode. Everything happens exactly as on the screen, without trying to try to study the problems further. This is similar to how Godzilla overturns buildings, and it looks like there are no people or human victims in this single act. No matter how painful this may be, show us the victims! A densely populated nation, such as Japan, does not just crash after disaster with an extremely low death toll, not when directors unleash chaos on such an epic scale. <br /> <br /> Trying to weave a romance into a movie, it stood out like a sore finger. There are many characters in the film, but each of them lack real characteristics or humanity, and they look like wandering zombies, without expression, without emotions, and are definitely very tough and unconvincing. Heroes get stuck in general control rooms, issue statements, instructions and policy forms, and respond to incidents as if they were a computer game, and everything is solved at the touch of a button. These are characters you don’t talk about. <br /> <br /> If I can just use Day after Tomorrow for comparison, although there are stunning effects, at least there is an attempt to give a microscopic view of the whole disaster from different points of view. Inside there are many sequences of actions, large, such as the disasters themselves, and small, with an emphasis on the triumph of the human spirit, which makes it relatively irresistible. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for the sinking of Japan, it is desirable that this film be one of the best, and hopefully undergo a short and quick death at the local box office to find a place for the best things.
