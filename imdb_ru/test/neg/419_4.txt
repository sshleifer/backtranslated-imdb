Tonight I went to see this movie, trying to be open-minded. I was hoping to enjoy a movie that I expected would be different from a book. There were significant differences from the book, very similar to the changes made to the DiVinci code. I went to see the DiVinci Code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the film, despite the changes from the book. It was still pleasant, filled with action, and the process of deciphering the characters was interesting and mentally stimulating. Unfortunately, Angels and Demons are disappointed at almost every level. Throughout the film, the characters are found and calculated quickly, without any interest to the viewer. They rush past the various Immunate characters so quickly that we did not have the opportunity to look at them and evaluate how they work. The last symbol of the Illuminati, which was the most interesting and creative in the book, was replaced by the symbol of crossed keys. In my opinion, it was a missed opportunity to concentrate and spend a little more time on characters, which is the nature of Langdon. In general, this film is a very poor interpretation of the book, and it fails when trying to become a fighter / thriller. 4 out of 10
