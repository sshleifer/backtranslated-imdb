Boring characters with one note, with little or no development, not impressive performances by people who sound like they just read the lines, and ridiculous special effects combine to make it really stinky. The story begins with an extremely soft commando, Rousseau and his fellow soldiers, who attack al-Qaeda's training base. The scene tells us that al-Qaida has recently come in search of perfect weapons, and also serves as an illustration of Rousseau’s only character trait — the tendency to avoid teamwork. Using a set of clean sheets and walking stereotypes, including a Russian spy, Rousseau is sent to Chechnya to catch a mad scientist working for terrorists. Along the way, they encounter huge swaths of bats, which for some reason fly in broad daylight. From there, the film becomes nothing more than a wave of ridiculous actions, including a scene in which a swarm of bats cuts off the soldier’s hand!
