I saw it in Toronto Inter. Film Festival in September 2005. The description seemed intriguing - how wrong I was! This may be the worst movie I've ever seen - in 50 years! I see that the director is my age (born 1948) and lived with Niko from the Velvet Metropolitan, which brings us to Andy Warhol, who, by coincidence, is the one I was thinking of, watching Warhol's 24-hour films, which nothing special happens. This is not art, this is boredom. <br /> <br /> In particular: black and white. OK, maybe ... but what is the purpose here? Of course, they had color in 1968! And there is no contrast with the present. And yes, the subtitles were white, of course. I don't think I missed a lot, but that made about 20% of them illegible. <br /> <br /> Next, this is a pure chronological order, but with the addition of seemingly random events. What is the purpose of a conversation with an old man at the dinner table? It adds nothing to the film. There were many similar scenes - as if someone had taken a video camera, shot random people and put them together to make a film. <br /> <br /> Story? No one. "Revolt" consists of several figures at a distance, which sometimes raise a stone off the screen. This is basically a painful period of time when people (at a distance!) Are standing around. Repeated smoking of opium is just as boring. When the cute girlfriend appeared in the main character, I became animated, but no, she was also bored! This is perhaps the only French film I have seen where no one takes off their clothes. Perhaps they were too bored to worry. <br /> <br /> Romance? No one. The girl seems completely indifferent to everything - perhaps her sculpture is of some interest, but if so, we do not show it. We are completely indifferent to the fate of the characters, because they are all unattractive. Maybe this is the meaning of all this?
