Jefferson in Paris is a really funny movie. He represents Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) in the most unflattering light, portraying him as a liar, racist, and pedophile, but does not offer the slightest conviction for these sins. So he is, it seems, the film says. The end of the sentence, the end of the film, the door behind you. <br /> <br /> Arriving in Paris with his daughter Patsy (Gwenith Paltrow), Jefferson continues to win the heart of Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), the wife of an English homosexual artist (criminal underrated Simon Callow). However, the course of events makes Maria go to England, and Jefferson with amazing speed begins to forget her about the man who, just a few minutes before, had asked her to live with him in America. <br /> <br /> You see, he was bewitched by Sally Hemmings (Tandi Newton), one of his slaves, who had just arrived from America. Just why he is bewitched is hard to say - although Sally is undeniably beautiful, she acts like a simple-minded child in front of Jefferson. When she does not tell ghost stories in exaggerated “dark” speech patterns, she wanders about in his bedroom, almost exuding a passion for her outstanding mass. <br /> <br /> If her behavior is an attempt to justify the behavior of Jefferson, it is not. Jefferson curses himself even further when Maria, tired of his letters, leaves England to see him. I have not changed in relation to you, he insists, offering weak excuses not to write. To her credit, Maria immediately sees her brazen lies. When Sally appears, and she and Jefferson openly (and, in my opinion, ruthlessly) flirt in the presence of Mary, the illusion completely collapses. <br /> <br /> No one believes today that Jefferson, Washington and the rest were perfect examples of virtue and morality. Nonetheless, we have to believe that the scientist, the eminent Jefferson will be attracted to Sally, the woman whose wisest conversation is about how "the masses 'French friends do not make unnastan' aw corn" and who rubs on his front when she passes, right before Mary's eyes? <br /> <br /> Even if we let this slide follow the horrific revelation that Sally was only 15 years old when this story happened (Jefferson was 41). Strange, but this fact manifests itself only at the very end, when brother Sally James, for obvious reasons, is enraged by her insulting statement that she is carrying the baby Jefferson. <br /> <br /> Jefferson is equally guilty when he is told that Sally is carrying his child and patronizing her tells her that she will be much better under his protection than in freedom and living in France with her brother. But he promises that I will release her when I die, and our children (including everything that will come, ”says Jefferson, in a terrible statement to Sally as“ him ”) when they reach 21 years old. Oh, thank you, Mass, you feel like talking on the screen. Big deal. <br /> <br /> However, the worst scene is yet to come with Jefferson’s daughter, Patsy. She is already angry with him, first of all for having broken his oath made by her mother on her deathbed so as not to marry again. (Obviously, the woman didn’t just talk about marriage.) Jefferson also refused to allow Patsy to become a nun as she wanted, despite earlier moralizers about religious freedom (which seems to mean freedom to agree with him). <Br /> <br /> By promising Sally and her brother their freedom, Jefferson calls on Patsy to testify to the deal and promise to execute it if anything happens to him. Brother Sally blurts out the imminent birth of a child, and Jefferson asks: "Do you swear?" Paltrow's performance in this scene is great, although she has almost nothing to say. Her face is almost distorted from the excruciating pain of this revelation, but she controls her grief and whispers yes. <br /> <br /> If anything, and the filmmakers could have something, if they emphasized this point more, Jefferson in Paris "is an indicator of the status of a woman at the end of the 18th century, which even men such as Jefferson, was seen as an attractive property, pleasant, but without true intellect or souls. We see Jefferson shed a few tears because of a letter from Maria, which obviously told him where to go, but he soon laughed at wild dance from Sally, complete with abandoned hair and heaving piles w. <br /> <br /> I don’t know if this is an accurate portrait of Jefferson or not. I don’t want to watch it, however, just to watch it. This Jefferson is not a hero and not even an antihero. He is selfish, a lying child molester - and the one to whom this gets away with is not the person I want to watch a movie about.
