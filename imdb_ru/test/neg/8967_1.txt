This is really a stupid job of mistaken prediction - as bad as Hepburn, playing Chinese in DRAMON CEM. The main role played by Hepburn is a combination of the grandmother from Beverly Hillbillis and the healer of faith! This film is even worse than God-Swing Your Lady, Bogart, because, at least, Bogart didn’t play assertively - he was just surrounded by them. And the dialogue sounds like it is coming straight from the Li'l Abner! The problems do not really end in an outrageous caste, since the plot is completely confused, and the “love story” can damage your head. For no reason WHAT IS, married to Robert Young falls in love with this goat Ozark. Was her beautiful personality captivated his heart? I doubt it, because she, like a fiery “spittle” in honor of the film, is named after her, and she really seemed to like to fight, dig, and scream! Was it her feminine charms? Without make-up and fashion that looked as if they were designed by Ma Kettle, I doubt that this is so. To complete this, in the end, Ralph Bellamy also fell in love with her, although, again, this does not seem to make any sense. <br /> <br /> So, here we have two scavengers of the city for a patchwork of not feminine little animals, played by Miss Hepburn, now this is a recipe for a good movie!
