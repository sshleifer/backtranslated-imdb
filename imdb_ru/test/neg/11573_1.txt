During the first 5 minutes of this film, I knew that I was in for one of those films that told me how to “find mistakes”. The game was terrible, the script was even worse. Who has ever allowed these people to write, write such nonsense for a film that needs to be fed by Komodo himself. With Russian Mig planes posing as USAF planes and pistols that can miraculously shoot 50 to 60 shots with fast fire without reloading, this is a bad detail in any story. In one scene, Komodo is killed by special forces troops at night, and in another they explain how Komodos and cobras are cold-blooded and do not go out at night !!!! Also with the fantastic special effects available in the modern film industry, they were average even for this low budget movie. <br /> <br /> Despite this, I watched it to the end, curious about what other wonders a bad film creation can produce. Shame Shame Shame, for creating such a rot !!! <br /> <br /> This film should have been left on the floor of the cutting room !!!
