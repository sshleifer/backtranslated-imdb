I love this film. Even though I rated it "4", it is because the action, plot and budget were all scheduled for the "B" universe even before this film was released. But it normal! This is an entertaining movie that has a lot to offer! <br /> <br /> I remember what Leonard Maltin said about Plan 9 from Space: the film is so bad that it's great! Without a story about a UFO - an alien, "The Thing the Could't Die" relies on the supernatural (fortune telling, drowned head, looking for your body, hypnosis, etc.) to tell your story. Acting on stilts, the camera is second-class and settings are limited, but boy! what movie! This movie is available on the bootleg market. If you find a copy, buy it!
