Bled is a very good name for this. When you watch it, you will feel that your life is bleeding from you. Cliches in horror about what people do exactly what they should not (going down to the basement or going up to the attic). Then there is a problem. Be careful not to watch this movie. Show the brains of the victims in horror movies never stay clean Do not enter. And if you need more incentive, this film? it's as bad as the worst movie of Uwe Boll, I mean, House of the Dead is bad. I often thought about writing a review of a film about I.M.D.B. and, looking at some of them, based on the comments, I found that everyone agrees with his / her opinion. Please believe me
