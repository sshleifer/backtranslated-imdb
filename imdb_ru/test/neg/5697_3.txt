Usually, I would say that I liked this movie. Not for acting, although it was normal. Not for the script, which was so-so. The reason I would normally love this film is an intense act that starts from the beginning. To go and not to finish, until the end credits end. But the problem with this film, and I felt that it was a big problem, was a terrible CGI.it, it looks like they ran out of money and could not complete the effects of the shots. many effects look elegant, they are in their roughest form. Since it is obvious that they did not have enough money to finish the film, they should not have released it. I found the effects to be offensive. did not care to make a decent final product for the consumer. if not for that, I would give this film a much higher rating. my vote for Air Panic - 3/10
