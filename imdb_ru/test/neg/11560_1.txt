Some films are stupid without explanation. This is one of them. Words cannot do justice to the wooden game, the stupid storyline and the always predictable result. About the only thing that makes this movie half worth watching are scantly dressed women (and the dumb guy for you, ladies) in it. The leader of the warriors and Valeria are quite attractive to the eyes. But that's all that has to do with this movie. <br /> <br /> A little stupidity: one scene, when they begin to travel to the den of the Dark, they move away from the supposedly destroyed land. But we clearly see the New York of the 1980s behind them. About 2/3 of this film looks like it was shot in the basement of a high school. Deadly puppets in a sock look as scary as street sesame monsters. I have to agree with Latronic that many junk bi-movies of the 1950s did a better job than this. The only one I can remember was not “Teens from space”.
