This hockey film left me moaning after almost any exchange of dialogues or plot complications. Patricia Arquette, although it is pleasant to look at, shows the result, below her usual mediocrity. My friends and I came up with the phrase "Outside of Rangoon" to mean something really bad. Low point for Bormann.
