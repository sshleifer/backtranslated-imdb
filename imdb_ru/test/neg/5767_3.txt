Let me start by saying that I LOVE horror movies. Big budget, low budget, actors with big names, actors without names, it does not matter. And when it comes to judging films, I really forgive. This film, however, is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Actors show little emotion or no emotion when they come out with their roles, and the actions are worse than many horror films with a smaller budget that I've seen. When actors are killed, you do not care. There is very little blood (I don’t know which film other reviewers watched when they say that there is good blood in this film because it doesn’t exist), and the special effects are poor at best. They steal so much from so many of the best horror films (Jeepers Creepers, Friday, 13th, Leprakon), and it still does not help. <br /> <br /> Luckily, I saw it on Showtime and actually didn’t have to pay any extra money to see it or waste my Netflix queue on it. There are so many of the best horror films, and I recommend that you watch them instead of this big disappointment.
