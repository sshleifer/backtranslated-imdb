This vicious little movie is terrible. My low rating for this happens for two main reasons. First, it's a snuff movie with animals, and I find this concept so disgusting that it turns my stomach around. Filmed over a hundred years ago, I can only hope that we have become something more humane and compassionate. This film is a complete and total exploitation, made to cash in on the sensational aspects of the film and the subject. Except for historical interest, this is something to look at only if you find yourself in the grip of a painful charm. <br /> <br /> Reason two? See how the camera is set up. It is located in the best possible place to catch the full effect: a long step ahead of the elephant, an excellent view of the platform with electric current and a cold and clinically impartial view of the elephant with smoke coming out of it before it finally collapses. Disgust. <br /> <br /> Thomas Edison did a lot of great things for civilization, and his talents and intelligence are beyond doubt. No one is perfect, but when you realize that this film provided A) the opportunity to outperform early cinema competitors with a sensational film that an elephant was electrocuted, and B) he shot a performance to demonstrate greater DC efficiency compared to AC you donâ€™t You may not wonder if the scientist in it was a little TOO passionless and cold. Any number of mad scientists Peter Cushing will be proud. The rest of us should be embarrassed and indignant.
