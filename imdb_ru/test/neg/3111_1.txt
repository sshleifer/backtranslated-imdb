I bought this movie for about $ 2.5 at a local flea market. I thought the actors in this movie (Ice-T, Rob Lowe and Mario Van Peebles are all right) would be pretty good. Boy, I was wrong. This film fucking annoyed me. Almost every scene takes too long. The scene where Rob Lowe watches this girl sing and dance in the bar lasts forever! It was one of the worst scenes I've ever seen in a movie. The rest is also not a picnic. I assume that when they finished the movie, they only had 30 minutes of the movie, so they extended everything 3 times longer. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: the current rating of 1.9 here on imdb is the right choice. It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. See how a little paint dries in 1.5 hours, and not watch it! <br /> <br /> If you want to watch some of the best films shot by this director, check out “Mean Guns” (with Christopher Lambert and Ice T) or “After Death” (with Charlie Sheen) instead.
