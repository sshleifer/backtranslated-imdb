Extremely formulaic with cosmic logical openings and a pretense of comedy. Oh, poor New York lawyer! He just goes crazy, and when he gets a pay cut, he doesn't go out to find another job, although he is one of the most respected lawyers in the field. We see him arguing in court, so that others come and congratulate him on his fiery, winning supply, but he cannot stand up to anyone in his firm. Home problems are ignored until people run out of the house. <br /> <br /> The only character you want to root for is the last servant who seems to be a real person who uses logic and communication to survive in the World. How ridiculous that the maid brought the lawyer and his wife chicken and wine on New Year's Eve because she felt sorry for them! (The bit is not played due to laughter.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, just incredible and with the ** SPOILER ** patch, each one ends at 180 degrees. How did they get top-notch stars for it? If I were in the studio, I would send it back for complete rewriting.
