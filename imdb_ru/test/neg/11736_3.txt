Normal ally, I am not against remakes. There are some pretty good ones there, BUT this one is nasty! Given that it was almost a scene behind the scenes, she had a good story and great actors. Van Sant almost unmistakably copied the direction of Al, and it added color (I am not one of those who think that it should be black and white to be classic). It was supposed to be at least a mediocre film ... but it was a pee-ki-cha! I donâ€™t understand how it could fail so badly. If you need, look at it as a curiosity, but I would advise you not to worry.
