It came from an adult who accidentally stumbled upon the first, expecting film aimed at children, and was surprised by the humor of adults who were in the Emperors New Groove. The character that I liked the most was Kronk, so I was delighted when I heard about the sequel (sp) with the participation of something other than Kronk. <br /> <br /> I just looked at Kronk's New Groove, it took me two days, because I had to turn it off, I was so bored halfway through it. In the end, I looked at the rest the next day, and, unfortunately, the second half was as lame as the first. <br /> <br /> As a Disney movie, I expected to see several musical scenes, but this one was filled with them, and they weren't funny. The great thing I found at Emperors New Groove was that it could be appreciated by a wide audience, from toddlers to adults. Kronks New Groove, to be honest, did nothing for me or my girlfriend, and we both loved the first one. He really aimed at young children, the comedy is quite childish, the music scenes are not very well made, and the plot itself is very banal. <br /> <br /> Save yourself some money and rent this movie, if possible, because it is definitely not worthy of a second viewing. I was extremely disappointed and shocked at how this film was compiled. They really managed to make the character (Kronk) not funny in this film, which in itself is amazing. <br /> <br /> Obviously, each personâ€™s opinion is different, but it is easy to amuse me, I usually enjoy the continuation (sp) even when others discredit them, mainly because I loved the first thing I need more characters , and no matter how bad the plot, I enjoyed the movie. I can not say the same for this, I would never have thought that I would turn it off halfway due to pure boredom. <br /> <br /> Buy at your own risk.
