A group of friends discovers gold deep in an old mine. But, taking gold and thinking that it struck him, they awaken the long-dead miner, who is damn inclined to protect his treasure. Miner’s Massacre is an extreme horror movie b-horror. You have all your familiar clichés, your group of teenagers with intellectual disabilities, characters going alone to explore strange sounds, a few parrot, a mysterious sheriff, an old woman who everyone thinks is crazy. -Finished Karen Black, no less) and so on. However, this is done in a fun, not pretentious way, which makes the film in an incredibly interesting way that “so bad is good.” Characters and dialogues - this is what you expect from this film - familiar, routine and non-original. All the actors all do a decent job, considering that I actually saw more budget films of this type with the worst acting (I know what you did last summer, anyone?) And added a bit of confidence to the film itself. The villain in this film (49'er) obviously comes from the creepers from Jeepers Creepers, right down to the brown coat, hat and long white hair. Like a liana, it never talks and boots roughly. The mountain is somewhat disappointing in my opinion. There are some pretty awful moments, but too much behind the scenes, and death scenes are often funny (Spoiler ahead!). There is one truly cheerful moment when this villain beheads the girl, and in order to achieve this “effect”, the filmmakers hid the body of the actress under the villain's jacket, thrusting her head out of her head, and blood got on her neck. Seriously, you could see the outline of her shoulders! I think they could have done a little better there, even if the budget was low (And I’m sure it was, but still ??). Special effects are cheap, but effective enough and for the most part moderately well made for a low-budget film. Either the effects guys, or the director, seems to be something for explosions and fire. In almost every scene by the end of the film there are at least a couple of characters who are burned to death (always removed in slow motion) or something explodes, be it a car or an old mine cave. Seriously, no one ever heard the term; “Stop, throw and throw”!?!?!? <br /> <br /> “Miners' Massacre” (or “The Curse of the Forty-Ninth,” whatever you call it) is stupid and dull, though entertaining, and as long as you have no expectations through the roof, you will enough fun. <br /> <br /> I feel generous, so I will give him 4/10.
