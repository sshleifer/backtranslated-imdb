If any film ever made the Italians look bad, that's all. <br /> <br /> Herzog Mitchell - what a hole. Duke Mitchell, I'm at your grave. Seeing that practically every person shot by coward Mimi in this film is either black or from some other racial or ethnic minority, it's hard not to be sure that this guy is ultimately obliged by his loyalty to the Ku Klux Klan or skinheads . Awww, but he doesn't shoot the little black guy in the elevator in an opening sequence, so that means he can't be bad, right? WRONG. Typical soft sentimental joke. <br /> <br /> Although I understand why some people can be amazed and even, to a certain extent, admire the impudent, completely heartless inspiration of the film (this is certainly not a shame for your own hate and sense of belonging) but this does not change the fact that the main character, Mimi (and, as a result, the Duke of Mitchell), is an absolutely disgusting person who does not receive a single drop of sympathy or interest, especially considering that Duke Mitchell is such a FULL BOREAN as a performer. But what do you expect from a guy whose main claim to fame (besides this dog - film) were Dean Martin's second-class imitator?
