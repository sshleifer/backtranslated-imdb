I say that Ben Johnson and my compatriots say: "Ben Johnson?!" The “deadly swarms of killer bees”, which everyone obviously thought they were going to get us at that time. So, there are these bees, and they kill some people, flying into their mouths and chasing them under water. Eventually, these idiots find a swarm and die, and this woman is trapped in her car from the whole swarm. Cops like what we do? Bees die when it's cold. So where could we make it cold? I know - the stadium in New Orleans! Thus, they drive this car and its accompanying swarm of killer bees through the streets of New Orleans with a mouthpiece with the inscription “WALK OUT THE STREETS, OR YOU EXPECT TO DEATH”. And the future home of tens of thousands of flood victims with its broken toilets becomes the drug death of this particular bee. I do not know what is the biggest humiliation in this great city ... well, I know, but this one also sucks. It is best to look at a 16 mm print with an extremely faded orange, although Betamax is a good alternative!
