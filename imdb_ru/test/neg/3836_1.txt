Worst movie I've ever seen. I still do not understand what Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen intend to do. Maybe they had bills to pay ... The best and iconic part happens during the memory that brings us during World War II, when a Nazi officer hides his Jewish wife. This is the beginning of the typical life of a serial killer! It seems that he was sent in the early 80s, but then the New Beatle appears ... Amazing! This film was shot in 2001 ... I’m sure it took less than two weeks to create this film. I heard that Dennis Hopper's wife asked for a divorce after seeing this photo, and Michael Madsen’s mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted that he was a man under a yellow baseball hat. Pathetic!
