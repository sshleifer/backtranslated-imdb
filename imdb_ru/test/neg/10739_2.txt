The only reason I gave this episode of “The Masters of Horror” 2 instead of 1 is because the two main actors are good and it was not filmed on VHS. History, dialogue and plot are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Talking / Driving zombies who return to vote and influence the political wave of war! Give me a break! What's next, the zombies who are returning to go skydiving? Maybe zombies are returning to the QVC show? <br /> <br /> I have never supported the war in Iraq, but I support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces; and “Homecoming” was disrespectful in the sense that it mocked the TRUE horror of war. <br /> <br /> With mass production of zombies on the current market ... this is SPAM associated with zombies. How “Returning Home” got into the “Masters of Horror” is not clear to me.
