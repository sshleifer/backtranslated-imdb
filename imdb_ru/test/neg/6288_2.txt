The funny thing about Fortunes is that one of the main characters, Lewis (Urbaniac), has a writer's block, and, obviously, just like the film's script writer. It's also sad because, I think, it's a comedy or drama, but it's the funniest thing I can remember watching it. <br /> <br /> Three friends go out for a drink one night. On the way home, the two decide to talk about their fortunes to the "gypsy," as they call her. These two lives are falling apart, while the third friend is left behind. Then nothing happens. <br /> <br /> I hope I didn’t spoil the film there, but in fact this very low-budget film of poor quality had some idea when it started, but quickly flew into the depths of hell. Yes, I’m rude. Honestly, this it wasn't so bad, it was just blah. <br /> <br /> The aforementioned writer was annoyed to watch, although he said maybe one or two of the two funny lines. The cliche "ladies", the only one who did not get his fortune, just annoyed. The only bright spot was the remaining friend, a married dad, whose fortune was said that something big should happen to his son, and he should be ready. He was funny, sincere and clearly the best actor in the film. Unfortunately, this says little. <br /> <br /> I may be too cruel. Damn it, they had a desire to make a film, they went, received funding and achieved something. Unfortunately, however, I generally cannot recommend a film based on, there are hundreds of thousands of other independent films that have hundreds of thousands of best ideas and performances. This one was literally 10 minutes from the idea stretched out for another 81 boring minute.
