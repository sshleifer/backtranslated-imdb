Christopher Lambert attracted me to this film. What a waste! There are more holes in the plot than in my string vest, the special effects were not very good, it did not take long to figure out who the creature's mother was, and the creature owed the Predator more than a small debt. An anti-climate film could be much better. However, this raises an interesting point. When is Hollywood going to discover the rich vein of European folklore awaiting booty?
