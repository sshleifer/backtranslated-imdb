It's a mystery to me how this cartoon from films has ever spread. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is terrible, and there is a significant proportion of nudity, but, God, the production value is the lowest I have ever seen used equipment worse than standard home equipment, everything is clear, which gives everything amateur mind makes you think about the worst home video in America or how this show was called. <br /> <br /> Please, people, right? too much to ask, what do you really make an effort when you expect to spend 90 minutes of people's lives watching this? You really should have done some short projects, because it’s obvious that you’re just an amateur! 1/10
