So this ugly guy with long dirty hair and his girlfriend were in this house, and they argue and argue about his old girlfriend. It was supposed that there was something terrible in it, but I did not see anything terrible at all. There are some references to the demon from the sea, but he is not going anywhere. I would, because then it would take the pressure off of a jealous love triangle. The name of the film makes you think that it will be a scary and exciting movie, but it is so far away that I could not believe it. I waited and waited for it to end, and was so happy when it happened. It did not fit the name, as it should be, so, boo-hoo-hoo. There was a cool picture on the cover, but I shouldnâ€™t judge a stupid movie by the cover.
