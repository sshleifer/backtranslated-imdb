With humor, which will appeal to an exclusive small audience, the average viewer will find it meaningless and monotonous. When the Cartoon Network advertised this show, it looked as if it was a major drama or event, with a real rain scene and government officials trying to catch the Sheep. <br /> <br /> When she came out on the air, I was disappointed that all the characters were so one-dimensional and completely soft. The only thing that made it look like humor was the names of such characters as “Private Public” and “General Specific”, some vague references to cultural aspects and how Lady Richington beat the sheep with her steel wig. <Br /> <br /> A little off topic, but I don’t understand why the Sheep would fall in love with this ball of dirty cotton balls called “Suonki”. It was disgusting!
