Why did the Italians make the best films in the 50s and 60s, and in the 70s and 80s they only made films about zombies and cannibals? Perhaps because feature films do not make money. The film "Cannibal", unlike the film "Zombies", created by the Americans and "exploited" by the Italians, is a purely Italian work, conceived as a demonstration of exploitation in the style of "mondo" and allowing you to earn as much money as possible (without artistic integrity by the way here) . Eaten Alive arrived at the heyday of Cinema Cannibal. Director Umberto Lenzi has not even achieved his success; until its classic genre Cannibal Ferox there was still a year. <br /> <br /> In plots similar to (read: ripped off) seed cannibal Ruggiero Deodato, a cannibal Holocaust, a woman (Janet Agren) is hearing from the police that they have received an 8mm film from her sister. She disappeared in Africa, and it is suspected that the tribal ritual described in the film may have something to do with it. Mel Ferrer, as professor of Somethingoranother, tells her that a man named Jonas (Ivan Rassimov) founded a cult similar to Johnstown in New Guinea, and his sister is there. A woman hires a guide (Robert Kerman) to guide her through the jungle to find the cult and her sister. And, don't you know, the jungle is full of cannibals. <br /> <br /> One sentence should summarize: if you saw in the film “Cannibal,” you saw them all, mainly because these films shamelessly stole each other (Lenzi copied “Cannibal Holocaust” to create this of the film, and reworked it to make Cannibal Ferox; Deodato copied parts of it for Hit and Run) And since they all use the same material, they all have the same features: terrible photography, boring landscapes, terrible dubbing, replay and exploitation, exploitation, exploitation. Fans of the genre will have a ball, since everything in it is a veteran of the genre. Rassimov and Kerman organize a contest for eating scenery. Agren exists solely to be naked, raped, or in danger. A lot of blood for all patients there. Cannibals, who actually seem to be local cannibals, eat lunch in the guise of human flesh. And, according to the great tradition of the Cannibal Films, any living animal shown on the screen is usually killed shortly thereafter. In general, this is not a very good experience, but I am sure that there are psychopaths who find this excrement interesting. I know what I did.
