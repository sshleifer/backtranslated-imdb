I checked it for free in the library, and I still feel torn off. Yes, Sandra Bullock is actually in this, but only in five scenes, just up to 5 minutes, and even those that are quite painful to watch. The rest of the film is so bad that you spend most of your time hoping that it will end soon, but only if you are one of those people who need to finish the movie as soon as he starts it. All others will just turn it off. Do not worry, you do not miss anything. Bullock strings (assuming you were deceived because her name is plastered on the case) are, in essence, just a parrot of other character strings, like in this dialog: <br /> <br /> Lisa (Bullock) - “Danny please tell me what's going on. "<br /> <br /> Danny -" I don't know. "<br /> <br /> Lisa -" What do you mean? "<br /> <br /> Danny -" I don't know, it's somehow connected to my father. ”<br /> <br /> Lisa -“ What does your dad mean? ”<br /> <br /> Danny -“ I don’t know - he started or something in that kind of ". <br /> <br /> Lisa -" Why am I here? "<br /> <br /> Danny -" Sorry, Lisa. I don't know. "<br /> <br /> (a few minutes later) Danny - “Some of my dad's army buddies ...” <br /> <br /> Lisa - “What kind of army buddies?” <br /> <br /> Do you see what I mean? <br /> < br /> Bottom line - just say no.
