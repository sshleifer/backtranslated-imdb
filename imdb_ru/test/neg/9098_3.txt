I remember watching this movie on HBO when I was a kid, and it scared me endlessly. When I found it, I watched it. I wish I didn't do that. The film was not scary. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the plot is an old woman who controls the castle. She feeds this horribly mutilated man in the basement of a 12th century castle. She constantly hits the poor guy every day and feeds him. Well, that day she dies. Then, a few months later, the family enters. Father, mother and their blind daughter. The father got into a terrible car accident, as a result of which their son was killed and his daughter remained blind. <br /> <br /> Later in the film, the daughter hears sounds, something breaks, and so on. And everyone does not worry about anything. altogether. Until a few people are dead. Apparently, the creature in the basement broke free and kills people. How this thing has survived the last few months without food and water is impossible! Every time I saw a creature, it gave me goosebumps. This monstrous murder occurs, and the police blame the father for the death. <br /> <br /> It was a pretty bad movie. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 stars out of 10. Terribly not scary!
