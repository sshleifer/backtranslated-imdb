I really wanted this film, but I just could not. He had the potential to be a really cool, fashionable remake of a cool show, but it was there that he fell apart. It was too fashionable, too cool. First of all, all the cool lines and scenes were shown in commercials that I have seen many times. And the editing was very fragmented, so the scenes didn't seem to stick together, and they all seemed out of place. Claire Danes, whom I love as an actress, could not get her to break into acting roles outside of high school. The only bright spot was Giovanni Ribisi in the role of Pete. Its a bit silly, but actually clever style was funny and refreshing. In general, I would recommend just watching the preview, not watching the movie and wanting it to be more.
