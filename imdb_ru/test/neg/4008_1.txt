Let me tell you a story. <br /> <br /> Once on the streets of Athens, the director encountered a male prostitute and decided that the world simply MUST know his story, because ... you know ... they are deprived ... and he takes off his shirt a lot. .. and so on. <br /> <br /> This film is the result of his revelation. Disgusting, depraved, homophobic, woman-hater ... but, of course, full of nice guys with their chests. If this is your idea of ​​a good movie, then enjoy, if not avoid, like the plague. <br /> <br /> This will surely let me go when I go to Greece.
