Calling this movie a disaster would be an understatement. I don't even know where to start! I have questions, and a lot of them. I would like to know who conceived this script? Who gave them the money to make this movie? Who was responsible for casting and costumes? All of them must be held accountable! I saw this film in the catalog of my local library and thought: “Hey, great!” I just watched two FOG films that Hollywood produced, and then I realized that Bollywood has a version. Not knowing that this will be a complete and full of crappy holiday! <br /> <br /> Dhund is a fog, this is a film about four friends (actually only one of them, but you should know that there are four friends), one of them is the beauty queen (performed by the 1st Mrs. India). Mir, Aditi Govitricar) and the director do not spare money to let you know. The script even states that her (character’s name is Simran) has Aishwarya’s eyes, Karina Kapoor’s lips and Rani Mukherjee’s hair. If you want, do not hesitate, at least at this moment you have not seen the film, unlike the poor me. : * (<br /> <br /> In any case, Simran once receives a mortal threat from one of the participants' uncles, who tells her to drop out of the competition so that his niece has a better chance of winning, but the Simran Guy does not allow she does this, and therefore she enters the competition and wins. This leads to the fact that her former classmate's uncle, Tanya comes after her. from the body. It's tough, but in the end they are sharing this. <br /> <br /> In the scene borrowed from the Hollywood movie Diabolique, the pool where the dead body is hidden merges only to show that the corpse is gone, and the mystery this is it? "I still know last summer, Cry 1, Cry 2, Cry 3, Murder she wrote, not Anthony, Colombo and Scooby Doo! Shameless, I tell you! <br /> <br /> Inconsistencies and problems in the film include, but are not limited to: <br /> <br /> 1. Poorly dressed Simran answers phone calls three times from his potential killer, the camera shows as she hangs up the phone, but the phone can ring again each time, and she picks up the phone to answer. <br /> <br /> 2. Is Tanya trying to commit suicide because she hasn’t won a beauty contest? WTF? Even Aishwarya Paradise, who is ten times more beautiful, did not try to commit suicide when she did not win Miss India! <br /> <br /> 3. On the pool scene, the children who come for the ball that fell into the pool conveniently disappear as soon as the police arrive. And the ball also disappears. <br /> <br /> 4. The cliché blue killer contact lenses change from blue to brown in the drowning scene, but when his corpse reappears, his eyes are blue. <br /> <br /> 5. No one who dies in the film is mourned (strange, especially for Indian society). <br /> <br /> 6. When Vikram jumps into a dirty dark pool, the underwater camera shows us his actions, and miraculously the pool turns into an Olympic size and becomes as clean and clear as day. <br /> <br /> 7. A sexy belly dancer performs a pseudo-orgasm-filled song and dance number about adulthood. It would be cool for some bachelor parties, but they celebrated their victory in the Simran competition! Hello!!!! <br /> <br /> 8. Kunal, Samir, Simran and Kadzhal can neither dance nor synchronize lips. But don't blame them, just admit that there was no choreographer for dance numbers. <br /> <br /> 9. Nothing in the film was staged, as if they had just told the actors to appear and do whatever they wanted. <br /> <br /> 10. The film was played out as if there was no script. Either that, or the director was tall and drunk when shooting this stuff! <br /> <br /> 11. When Simran’s photo was published without her consent in a magazine, she flew to the police station to arrest the photographers, but she was threatened with death, and she did not bother to warn the police. of course. This film was painful for me, and I advise everyone to skip it in all possible and necessary ways. Bollywood should be terribly ashamed of this kind of filmmaking.
