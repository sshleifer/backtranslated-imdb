An octopus eating flesh, where is this guy, Boaz (what the ..?) Davidson, continues to get inspired? In any case, even for the low and low standards of a giant sea animal that kills people and me, this genre is simply terrible. Octopus is one of the lamest, laziest, and weakest monsters I've ever seen. I think he just ended up in the (Akhum) East River because the Sea World got sick of him. Actors can be seen repeatedly by helping the octopus to strangle them. A bunch of idiots, so he never learns! killer octopuses (by the way, is that a correct plural) to laugh at him? Meanis. <br /> <br /> An octopus can stop the wind, razors that are difficult to handle, as well as special marine agent Nick Hartfield and his partner, who will retire in a week, but must be eaten first by an octopus. Hooray, the octopus won the fight! Another couple, and he is going to develop (the scars in my mind remain). Nick, of course, trying to help him is not doing a damn (doesn't he have a gun or something else?), But no, that doesn’t help in a magical way either. <br /> <br /> All right, enter the love interest of the sea cop Rachel Starberd. Is it based on some comic book or something else? In any case, they are together trying to stop the octopus, walking through the park. They hope it will help, because it's July 4 in a couple of days, and the octopus can join the party. And you don't know what he looks like when he's drunk. Rachel takes the school bus out of nowhere to make sure this movie isn’t over while Nick feeds the octopus with several more sea cops. <br /> <br /> But all the crap that ends in crap, Nick manages to blow up an octopus a couple of times, and a bunch of kids who were there, having fun and laughing. You know, with vision in the stomach, this is likely to be obtained by R.In in real life, I would say that all times, but I seem to be like all ages, so my last idea: absolutely suitable for anyone. No sex, no blood, no nothing. Now forget that this movie ever existed. Join the club.
