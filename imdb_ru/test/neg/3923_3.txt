It is said that there are people who actually admire Monogram films. Well, why not? Monogram Studios lived on the basis of cost plus; cost, plus enough to pay the rent and buy pizza and a bottle of strong nutmeg from time to time. Of course, they are cheap. But let's face it: they are rough, fast, Philistine, vulgar, but exciting. They have no complaints at all. They are designed to distract the audience for an hour or so at the expense of double counting. So what if John Wayne rides through the Wild West along a road littered with telephone poles? This is not art, this is entertainment. <br /> <br /> Take this movie “Flight to Mars”. At the beginning, when we first meet with the characters, a man can suddenly present his companion, avoiding tedious subtlety: “Professor, this is my bride and assistant, a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman. She loves me, but I lose my patience because I am always busy with my scientific work. You may be able to steal her from me, marry her, give her children and the fenced house she wants. travel to see her dreams. Besides, she likes it a bit rude. “It saves a lot of time on recording and filming, isn't it? That's what people mean when they say the narration is“ fast. ”(This one was shot in five days.) Why should we hint about these things? I have See what the hell is a cheap science fiction film or Henry James? In fact, this is a particularly well-funded example of a monogrammed movie. It’s in color on one side. “Cinecolor,” to be exact. (You can say that not some other "color" that you would know.) And look at the cast. Female leadership is not starts up, as is usually the case with Monogram, but the male leadership is definitely there on List B. Cameron Mitchell, as a reporter, has not yet achieved his success as a male leader, which, if you think about it, he never did. And Arthur Franz as the main pipe smoker, Perth Amboy's pride, New Jersey, and for science fiction lovers, how about THIS pair of aces: both Morris Ankrum and John Litel! There isn’t much point in a detailed description of the plot. Five crew members crash on the ground on Mars, where they find an underground civilization populated by organisms whose evolution was isomorphic to ours, to the point that they had five numbers and flexible babies in short skirts. And they caught English from listening to our programs. American broadcasts, that is, judging by their speech. They are led by an ominous clique that is trying to seize a spacecraft, build many of its imitations and colonize the earth. They do not succeed. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not very special. Men walk around a pair of spare sets dressed in black suits with stylized zippers adorning their chests and scarlet capes fluttering behind them. Their names consist exclusively of English phonemes - Alzar, Terris, Ikron. A terrible Martian who falls in love with Arthur Franz is called Alita with a tiny appendage of Indo-Europe, and she already knows what kisses are. <br /> <br /> In general, I found him as fast as expected, but also boring. The story is from any of the 1930s Buck Rogers TV series. As soon as earthlings and Martians meet, it is established that they have a common language, and that the Martians have an ominous program, that's all. In two hours, even an indifferent screenwriter can turn this into a story about Nazi spies in World War II. The plot is made by numbers, there is no brilliance in the dialogue, the acting is pedestrian. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, enthusiastic monogram lovers should like this. In the end, Jean-Luc Goddard, the opposite French egg head, dedicated the monogram "Bout de Soufflé", so that they could not be so bad.
