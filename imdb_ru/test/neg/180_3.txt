It seems that this film demonstrates the current trend towards globalization and homogenization in the wine industry. Wineries around the world are increasingly joining large conglomerates (American producer Mondavi, in the case of this film) or paying expensive experts to help them create the "perfect wine" - and as a result, the wine becomes very standard and predictable. For some, this is good (especially since few can afford to pay 50 or more dollars for ordinary wine), but for others it is terrible, since the uniqueness of small wineries disappears. I really can understand the problems of both sides and do not think that there is a villain or a hero in this business. Of course, a good and cheaper wine is good, but like what happened with beer (with such giants as Unibrew and Anheiser-Busch), food (McDonalds), shopping (European shopping centers are almost indistinguishable from American ones) and megastores ( as Walmart / Asda) take away most of the uniqueness of the “little guys”. So I was definitely ready and willing to listen to these directors. However, with a product that lasts almost two and a half hours. And in general the lack of focus, the film just became too much work to watch, and I lost interest. A film focused on 80-90 minutes would be MUCH more effective - especially since the average viewer is NOT enofil (this is the word for "wine fan"). <br /> <br /> In fact On the positive side, the filmmakers are smart not to talk at all, but simply allow those on both sides to speak. Plus, the topic is so relevant and relevant. However, despite the choice of a good style of creating a documentary, the film simply goes too far, for too long and the result is a very boring movie.
