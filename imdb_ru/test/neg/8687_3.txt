Evil Down begins in the Straits of San Sebastian 1683 as a 17th-century treasure ship when El Diablo sinks in a strong thunderstorm. Jump to the “straits of San Sebastian”, where two divers explore the beautiful underwater coral reefs that are rich in wildlife, meet the sunken sunken El Diablo and explore it, but are attacked and killed by something like an evil eel, Captain Max Cash (Wayne Crawford) owns and manages a hired boat called "Vagabond", which serves tourists who want to fish, dive and explore the island in general. Sarah Livingston (June Chadwick) - an art teacher who enjoys treasure as a hobby (well, we all have to do something to pass the time, right?), She hires Max and his poorly dressed assistant Tracy (Sherry Able) so that she can I could try to find El Diablo and get rich. Talking about sunken treasures worries some of the most unscrupulous members of the local community as they shy away from criminals and thugs who bring to the attention of Max and Sarah that El Diablo has an ominous past, a past that presumably still leaves its supernatural legacy. even now ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Jean-Claude Dubois, according to IMDb with a little help from Crawford's star, although the version I saw only on Dubois’s list, I thought “Evil Below” has some the potential is slightly different, but unfortunately this is not enough to save it from sinking to the bottom of the sea, like a stone. Arthur Payne's scenario begins well: two divers are killed by some sea creature, but this discovery is NEVER mentioned, the creature is NEVER seen again, and there are no more supernatural killings. Evil Below then suffers from a serious and final case of identity crisis; he does not seem to know who he wants to be, as he throws off pieces of various genres from underwater adventure, horror, action, thriller, crime and he even has time to add some secrets of murder and religious nonsense. As a result, the “sinister bottom” seems very tiny, fragmented, and since the best scene in the whole film is the intro part, I found myself sitting there, becoming more and more upset because of the lack of any consistent horror, because he quickly went down and the fact that we would never again see sea creatures. “Ominous bottom” is a dull, slow, uneventful, predictable, stupid, and devoid of any charm or intelligence, in short, “Evil bottom” does nothing good, as a good film should do. <br /> <br /> Directed by Dubois fails to revive events, although he obviously filmed a lot of underwater material about the wild, as I sometimes thought I was watching a National Geographic documentary with all the footage of fish, corals and wild nature in general. Forget about any blood, a little water stained with blood, and a bloody cough is almost like blood I’m afraid of. <br /> <br /> Technically, “Evil Below” is very simple, it is light and completely forgettable, except for a good underwater photo. fish. This “shoot and shoot” and, in general, production performance is very low, even the place where it was shot does not look very sunny or attractive. The acting is bad, but again, did you expect anything else? <br /> <br /> “Evil Below” is a bad film, its main story is everywhere, and he cannot decide who he wants to be, and as a result it ends in a mess. Add to this low production figures, the fact that there is no blood and absolutely minimal horror content, you have a film that you probably should avoid, unless you are completely desperate, and even then there are certainly better ways to spend more than 90 minutes of your life. ,
