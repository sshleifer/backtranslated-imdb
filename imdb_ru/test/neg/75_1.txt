This film is about a couple who decide to take a vacation in the Everglades with another couple and a family dog. When they first get there, they are not welcomed by a nearby gas attendant who warms them so that they stay away from the cabin in which they have to spend the night for a week. After pestering an old man, the three mountain nomads also do not accept their arrival when they approach their car and threaten to leave. After they asked the local mannequins who cannot speak or simply do not want to answer, they finally find a cabin. After they settle down, strange things happen to visitors, including finding shit on their car, the man who heads this trip, the idiot shoots a family dog, thinking it was a killer scratching a door and a series of deaths later end. Adding a church group did not improve the story. Then, in the end, an idiot who survived all the trials, toured the city with a gun. Lame. that's what kind of movie it is.
