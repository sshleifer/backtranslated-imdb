this film had a lot of potential - it's a great story and the potential to be very creepy. but, of course, Tim Burton doesnâ€™t really make scary movies, he makes stupid cartoon films. and I usually like Tim Burton's stuff. but I thought this movie was really weak. The best thing about the film (and it really is worth seeing just for this) was the artistic direction - the film has an amazing intangible quality. The script was not good. it was boring in some parts and confusing in other parts, and there was no formation of characters. I never cared that people deprive their heads of a headless creature. I thought that Johnny Depp coped well with his approach to the character, but given that the script was weak, he could not go too far with him - and I was very annoyed at trying to slightly emphasize him and Christina Ricci parts. <br /> <br /> In any case, this, unfortunately, is not a very good film and should not be watched if you are not interested in the artistic direction.
