“Bloody Birthday” is an absolutely nonsense movie from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I think the acting is pretty good considering the genre of the film and its obvious low budget. I do not know what was happening with the cinematography, but it looked awful. Too saturated. Maybe this is a bad translation to DVD or maybe it always looked like that, I don't know. <br /> <br /> There are really no redemptive qualities to talk about. There are several deaths, but not really scary. I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. The best in the DVD was a 15-minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg, which was very funny and honest. He had nothing good about director Ed Kanta, and he admitted that the film had failed, but he would like to make it again, since he believes that he has a decent plot. However, he died in 2004, so I think it will be someone else to accept this challenge. Taking into account how everything happened in the past few years, this did not surprise me, on this day at least one processing is carried out at the cinema a week. I suppose it could not be worse than the original, but I didn’t care whether it was redone or not.
