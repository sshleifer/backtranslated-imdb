This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is assumed that this will be a remake or update of the “One-armed Swordsman” by Chang Chek. Clumsy direction and shitty choreography of the battle means that the battle scenes are not even worth watching. The script desperately tries to seem serious, but it is full of phrases like "And I knew that then there would never be anything like that ..." or "If I only knew what price I would have to pay." Ugh! And who is this girl who plays Sing? Someone will find it and eliminate it !! She's terrible. If you like Chinese martial arts movies, you’ll be better off with Lau Gar Leung. It stinks.
