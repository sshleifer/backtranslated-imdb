There is something intriguing about disaster films. A simple, primary premise can lead to several great stories. Of course, most disaster films tend to explore familiar territories, but I can usually deal with it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Flood probably marks a low point in the history of this subgenre. Robert Carlisle is undoubtedly the star of the film, although screen time is divided between different places and characters. He gives a barely decent performance. In addition, Joan Walley is very uneven. Veteran actor Tom Courtney (he played in Doctor Zhivago for God's sake) is especially bad. I mean that his time is almost completely absent, and his characteristics are extremely bad. What an awkward idea for this person. The rest of the cast varies from decent to really bad, with one exception: Jessaline Gilsig, who, I thought, could be there as a plot device / candy in the eye, certainly gives the most convincing performance. It does not really matter, considering how bad everyone else is, but it's still nice to see that she cares. <br /> <br /> The script is really bad, confusing and cliché. Some of the worst lines I've heard for a long time are pronounced by the actors one by one. You have seen this story a thousand times. It involves all the dramatic hooks and jerks that you saw in Flash, Armageddon, Poseidon films (original and remake) and in many others. <br /> <br /> Direction is terrible. No sense of time, nothing inspiring. The frames are soft, the dialogues and actions do not pass. Editing is bad, but how do you edit such a mess? Without a doubt, this film relied too heavily on a (rather bad) CGI. The human factor, drama, and character struggles are clouded. Scenes where characters must face the flood are rare and poorly made. The feeling created for television causes nausea. Some guy has to go down the rope from a helicopter? No problem, let's show it in a helicopter and do a really bad job of cutting / editing, and the next frame with it will safely lie on the ground in the most obvious way possible. <br /> <br /> The rating of the film is rather poor. Everywhere, without time. <br /> <br /> The end is probably worse than I have seen in a long time. Very similar to the fact that they ran out of ideas. Discard it, you cannot exhaust something if you have never had it in the first place. Must not have enough budget. <br /> <br /> This is truly amateur work. I give him 2 points for using London as a place, which is a good change, because Gilsig actually plays a key support role in a decent way and for a few CGI shots that were decent (the water approaches London and the gate). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and watch “The Day After Tomorrow” or any other disaster film before. This includes old classics such as The Towering Inferno.
