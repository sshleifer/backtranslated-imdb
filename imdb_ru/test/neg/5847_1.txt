Demi and Woody are married, but they are poor. They meet Robert Redford, and he is REALLY rich. He is keen on Demi, and since he is a gambling man, he makes a “indecent proposal”: one million dollars a night with a small woman. <br /> <br /> Now you no longer need to look. the movie because you can fold the details in a dream. Of course, Demi is going to accept the offer. If not, then there is no first half of the film. Of course, this will affect the marriage of Demi and Woody. If this does not happen, there is no second half of the film. And, of course, everything will be fine by the time the loans roll. If this does not happen, there will be no happy ending for box office. <br /> <br /> The absolute best thing you can say about an INDEPENDENT OFFER is that Demi Moore looks good in a black dress. For the rest ... The script is incompetent, the direction is amateurish, the performances are insignificant. I suspect that Redford, Moore and Harrelson blush and change the subject every time a movie is mentioned. Do it - and more importantly than yourself - a favor. If someone does not offer you a million ... Miss It! <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer
