Here is another movie with dysfunctional leading characters who are completely immoral, and yet, should we root for them? Not me. Not a single character in this film was worth a damn. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams plays as a car salesman for Joey O'Brien. A person does not have a class, he is a loser in all moral senses and a guy who thinks he can find a way out of everything. Knowing Williams' ability to speak, he was good for the role. Women in his life also drive him crazy. Some of them are not much better than him. <br /> <br /> Tim Robbins plays a similar role, making a film when he, fully charged with explosives, crashes into a car dealership and holds people, including his wife, hostage. Robbins, as usual for him, plays an agitated and funny character. I believe that these crazy roles are easily given to these two actors. Gee, I wonder why. <br /> <br /> There are so many shouts and screams in this film that it will cause you a headache. Combine these two screamers with Fran Drescher's nasal voice, and you really get an annoying, over-acting cast. It's like listening to chalk on the board for half an hour. This is a comedy? No, it is not convincing. <br /> <br /> In fact, for the film about Robin Williams, where only a dozen reviews are posted here, something tells you. This is far from his best movie.
