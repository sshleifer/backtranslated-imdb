I had a good time the first 45 minutes. or so, but then suddenly everything fell. The surprise began to thin a little, and the jokes were almost the same. What supported it were good actors. <br /> <br /> But the problem with this film is that it tries to be as cunning as Tarantino, and God is outdated. Tarantino is sometimes overestimated, this film is ten years late. At best, this is for teenagers, and I’m sure that many of them find Johann’s character as funny as he is in the first 30 minutes. Another problem I encountered is that the story disappears more and more at the end, you tried to find a recovery point. It may not have been restored, because the absence of passion comes in an attempt to be cunning. In addition, as in many films, of course, good actors who can afford it, do not require a better dialogue or simply refuse the script.
