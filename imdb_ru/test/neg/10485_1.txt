This cheap and trash movie tells of a NASA test rocket that is sent into space with a cargo of animals. He disappears for a while, and then suddenly returns, making an emergency landing in the forest, releasing the evil mutant creature. <br /> <br /> As in many other films of this type, “Night Fear”, stupid teenagers participate in it, starting to surf until the 60s. to be killed None of the killings, however, is even remotely memorable, as we really do not see anything. However, we see that one of the teenagers is about 40 years old, and he looks pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> For a creature to work, it really must present the monster correctly to the viewer. In this film, however, we get only brief glimpses of the monster. It seems that something resembles an alien from a monster robot. But I'm not sure; since the photo was so dark, I just could not understand what the hell was going on in most cases. Although, my inner feeling was that I probably did not really miss.
