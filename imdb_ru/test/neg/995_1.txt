I think Downey may have been inspired by the French New Wave. <br /> <br /> Who was not? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, what he eventually created here was more like a crazy wave. <br /> <br /> Synapse is obviously a terrible thing to lose, and Downey seems to have lost a lot. <br /> <br /> Just say no, really. In more ways than one. Including to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I could not take it out after a while and began to move quickly through it. It would be wiser to just skip it altogether.
