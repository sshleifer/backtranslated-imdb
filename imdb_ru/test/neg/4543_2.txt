“Cooling” by director Delanda Nusa and Jack A. Sunseri is one of the worst zombie films I've ever seen. Why did Linda Blair ("The Exorcist", "The Witcher") appear in this bitchiness outside of me. The plot is really stupid: frozen bodies in a cryogenic laboratory are reborn after lightning strikes and turn into cannibalistic zombies. The characters are completely one-dimensional and stupid, the zombies look awful, and there is no blood in them. Avoid this cheap trash like a plague. My rating: 1 out of 10.
