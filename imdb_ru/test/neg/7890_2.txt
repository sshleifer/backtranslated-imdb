The Emperor's Dog (Richard Haydn) is engaged to Joanna's dog (Joan Fontaine). However, when Virgil (Bing Crosby) arrives in town to sell the player to the Emperor a gramophone player, his dog is attacked by the dog Johanna. After a revenge attack, when Virgil is driven out of town, the psychoanalyst insists that Joanna’s dog must confront Virgil’s dog so that she can overcome her doggy fears. It is arranged and the dogs fall in love. Like Virgil and Johanna. The rest of the film goes with romance, and at the end Joanna's dog gives birth. But who is the father .......? <br /> <br /> A canine story is a very weak machine that is used to try to create a story between people. This is a terrible story. There are 3 major pieces of music, all of which are rubbish - bad songs and terrible choreography. It's just a very boring movie - Bing has too many words in each sentence and says them in an almost shrill, annoying way. It's not funny ............ NEVER .......... but it should be. Bing and Joan did much better than that.
