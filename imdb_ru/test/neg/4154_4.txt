The epic story of hope is limited by budget and limited artistic ambitions. Seeing how Terrence Malik did it, I was expecting something ghostly and lyrical. Instead, we get the typical Norwegian co-production (“Revolution” with Al Pacino, anyone?), Where - quite possibly - good intentions are shackled by a terrible scenario, and many characters turn into stereotypes. The “i-Tarzan-you-Jane” English dialogue between non-English speaking characters is especially attractive ?? One would assume if Nick Nolte and Tim Roth advertised their own, as they almost sound like real people. This story is full of implausibility: we are expected to believe that Bin can speak English after having spent his whole life living as a peasant slave (his vocabulary, but unfortunately not grammatical, is impressively increasing in camp Malay refugees, without the benefit of night classes). The match is common; I wonder if the hour or two was edited from the first third: he tracks his mother in Ho Chi Minh City almost immediately - after a collision with his thirty-year-old stepbrother, who casually recognizes him! Mom gives him a gold medallion (or something similar very valuable) when they leave, but it is never mentioned again. His relationship with "Me Dead Inside" Ling should provide a mandatory "love interest", but he feels as artificial as Leonardo and Cameron in "Gangs Of New York." <br /> <br /> Traveling in a rusty bucket of a boat really conveys the terrible conditions that human trafficking entails. Indeed, the only case in which the film is distantly exciting and unpredictable is jerky, hand-shot shots taken from a bridge in turbulent weather. (By the way, a boat cruise from Malaysia to New York through the Cape of Good Hope and the African coast, without stopping for fuel or supplies, is definitely an epic journey). A beautiful shot of the New York skyline echoes Malik's magical use, but I want to know why the Coast Guard did not appear. Perhaps they were watching the Super Bowl or something. Of course, Bin manages to track down his blind old dad on a remote farm in Texas with the same navigational talent he showed in Ho Chi Minh City. I was impressed with how Nick Nolte could roam the fields and feed the horses on a large ranch without the help of a guide dog or a white stick. To show how the story of the accidents that refugees face could be structured and filmed with a small budget, see “In this world”, much better than Michael Winterbottom.
