What we know about Caravaggio speaks of a pompous fight with a healthy sense of law, who lived among whores, thieves and scammers and put them on canvas. The themes of his work were sex, death, redemption, above all, finding the sacred in the mundane. He lived at a time when homosexuality handed down a death sentence, and political intrigue usually led to the death of people in a society defined by the saying "strangle the boy for the purity of his cry." <br /> <br /> You cannot blame Derek German for his cinematography and his re-creation of Caravaggio’s paintings, and you certainly cannot blame a person for avoiding homosexuality. But to be honest, Jarman never deviates from the 80s caricature. Italian patronage becomes the London art scene of the 80s, complete with pretty waiters and calculators. Sean Bean is a sexy North American thug smearing his motorcycle. Tilda Swinton performs a transformation worthy of Mills and Buns (“Why, Miss Lena, without this gypsy shawl, you are beautiful ...”). Jarman gives Caravaggio a particularly banal motive for the murder, because of which he was expelled. <br /> <br /> This could be a visually stunning treatment of a person whose life was dangerous, exciting, cruel and decadent, but nevertheless elevated the lives of ordinary people to the status of Renaissance masterpieces that were watched by emperors and kings. Instead, what you get is Pierre and Gilles, Italy. The beautiful bodies of young boys are shown to perfection, but never to the men who inhabit them. Jarman seems to make fun of the London art scene, showing it superficial and pretentious. Use Caravaggio and Renaissance Italy to create meaning - use a silk wallet to make a pig's ear. In fairness, this film remains visually stunning, but ultimately as two-dimensional as the pictures he describes.
