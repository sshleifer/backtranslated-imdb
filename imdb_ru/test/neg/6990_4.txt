Why can virtual “x-rated video games” speak with their mouths, and a virtual fighting champion Dante is forced to use a combination of telepathy and dramatic facial expressions? I feel that either they needed to play someone who would look like a villain (Michael Bermardo’s big brown eyes do not quite inspire fear in the hearts of ... anyone, except, perhaps, directors who constantly cast him as a villain or heroic " bad boy. ”) OR they just had to let him use his real voice (and move his mouth), and perhaps give him a suit that wouldn’t make him stick up like a sore thumb when he walked down the street. (but, of course, this is the future, and we must assume that bad fashion taste is considered the norm.)
