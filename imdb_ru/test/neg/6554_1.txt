<br /> <br /> This film is incredibly unfunny, it makes any person want to cry, there is more fat on the clich√© than 5-year-old peanut butter, and in such a way that it actually sucks the humor from your heart, every joke was poorly calculated and would not be funny if it were calculated correctly. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this film, there is a real chance that you can never again enjoy comedies. ... ever.
