A perennial adaptation in IMDb Bottom 100, after watching this, it is easy to understand why it turns out to be completely hopeless in almost every bloody part! <br /> <br /> Start editing; calling it choppy would be excessively free! In fact, if the creators of it got drunk one night, cut and cut cubes on film with scissors and children's glue, then the resulting mess could hardly be worse than what we actually have. In addition to this, the meaningless story ruthlessly reaches for what seems like a painful infinity, until we finally reach a decidedly weak apogee. <br /> <br /> In addition to the eternal game of Michael Hopkiv, the poor performances of most other actors also do not really help, and the actual animal that causes all the problems is somewhat less convincing. if I've ever seen him. <br /> <br /> Dear, dear to me .... and think that Lamberto Bava sent it to .... yes, yes, indeed. <br /> <br /> Note: it was released in the UK under the alternate name Devouring Waves, although it lacks most of its bloody scenes, which ironically is the only reason it might have been worth seeing.
