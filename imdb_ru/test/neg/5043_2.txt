This movie is like a porn with all the good ones removed. It's like all the porn stars who do not want to fulfill their obligations united around this terrible, vulgar, useless piece of gargoyle abstinence. <br /> <br /> This is a useful movie if you are in the mood to torture a loved one (or not a loved one). It is important that if you decide to use this film as a method of torture, you wear earplugs and a blindfold to keep from insanity. <br /> <br /> If I had a choice between this movie and The 700 Club ... I would choose Girls Gone Wild. <br /> <br /> In general, it is better if you drank. But only because it becomes a drinking game of epic proportions.
