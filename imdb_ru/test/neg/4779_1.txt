I have to say that this film was not what I expected. Despite the fact that I did not read the book, the fact that the plants can lure, and then wait for the murder to happen, only so that it drags the body for lunch, is the worst scenario that has ever occurred to me. With the title ruins, you might think that from 3000 years, the culprit would be some kind of deity, an ancient animal or god. It looks like another primitive film in which you can think that the strangest of all are the villagers who fear most, and not the crocodile. Anyway, this film would be like that, it makes you think about the ruins of Mayan or Inca folklore, leading to awakening and the old god, or people had another program of sacrifices or something like that. But plants? .... oh well, surely the producers can not come up with a crowd? As for this film, it will fall into the “b” list as soon as possible. I have to say that some of the blood was excellent to see, but that did not make up for the rest of the film. And a plant that mimics the sound of a mobile phone or people's voices is too much to believe. I'm a horror movie fan, but I'm not a stereo fan who relies only on blood or mechanical effects. I rely on a great deal of expectation, and that the next scene will bring more expectation. This thing had a better storyline than this one. Even the ring made me jump more, but the ruins were simply ... destroyed for using the plant to persuade the victims to kill or be killed by villagers. For the villagers, it was perfectly acceptable to keep it away from salt and the like, but a simple torch and plenty of napalm can easily cope with this disgusting plant with eating disorder from the flesh.
