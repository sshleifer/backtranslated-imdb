Nightkill stars Robert Mitchum as a private eye tired of the world, investigating the case of a missing industrialist (Mike Connors). He is hired by Jacqueline Smith, the agitated wife of the missing person. What Jacklin Mitchum cannot say is that she knows her husband's whereabouts well. In the end, it was she who helped her beloved James Francis to get rid of her rich husband. <br /> <br /> What else can you expect from a rotten slasher with Robert Mitchum? Mannix goes to the west, insults the monkeys, models lean toward classic cars, and Sybil Danning constantly pushes to the background until the end of the Giallo style brings the whole sad mess to a bitter end. This is a bad movie. And this film is sooooo poor. It makes it look like Halloween, mixed with Trick Or Treats. Avoid this. <br /> <br /> Rated R for graphic abuse, nudity and sexual situations.
