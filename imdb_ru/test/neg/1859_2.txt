In a group of teenagers, the car broke down in the middle of nowhere. They seek refuge on the farm. But three murderous criminals kill the owner of this house and his family. One of them accidentally brings a zombie, tipping a scarecrow. Cue blood, blood, slaughter, bad game. Better than the first, but only by default. I still would not want this to my sworn enemy, Bob. In the end, the director wants it to be a parable about how we, the Americans, kill ourselves and our forests (yes? Well, friend). Dude, I would prefer to cut woods so that my brain cells shrink, and my gray matter seeps through my ears. In other words, become an idiot liberal idiot. <br /> <br /> My rating: D-
