Last week on Friday I went with my friends to “Snakes on an airplane.” It was amazing compared to this horrible movie (however, many scenes were ridiculously funny). In fact, some woman has a Maya curse when she picks up harmless harmless snakes with garters, who instead of attacking, crawl inside their victims. The girl with the bag of cola is pretty hot. The title screen reads "100 passengers ... 3,000 Venetian vipers!" Scary, I know. There were not even 100 passengers on the train. Only a couple of stoners and a few other washed losers. It costs five bucks to see how a woman turns into a huge computer snake and devours the entire train, and then drags herself into a huge whirlwind. It's just sad that someone would do anything to make a crappy movie, only to earn a few dollars due to the passion for "Snakes on an airplane."
