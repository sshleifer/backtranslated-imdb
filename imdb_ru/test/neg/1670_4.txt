This film seems a little awkward around the edges, as if it hadn't been thrown enough when it should have been. But most of all I liked. <br /> <br /> The storyline is more than absurd, so you should not expect “something real” in your viewing experience. Check your brain at the door. This is not necessary, and otherwise it may become an obstacle. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed Clennon’s performance as a real Dr. Baird. His role played the role of Aykroyd's character in the role of the protagonist. What is the real doctor baird? <br /> <br /> And Mattau was a good assistant to the protagonist. First annoying, but ultimately attractive. It seems, as it were, something like. View. Or at least something that using soap and plenty of water would be more than useful. <br /> <br /> Really worth seeing? If you are determined to fake the psychiatric profession, of course, why not.
