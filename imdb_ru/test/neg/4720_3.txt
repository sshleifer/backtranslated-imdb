Besides the shootout scene, I felt that the film was a waste of celluloid. Robert Duval, Kevin Costner and Annette Bening could play these roles in a dream. The dialogue was marginally tolerant (and there was a lot of it - no one was sitting calmly in this film), the plot was all over the map, as if they could not decide how much to fit into the story, there was no subtlety at all - the omen struck you between your eyes and they led you by the nose for most of the story (I think they added all the dialogue to make sure you didn't miss anything), and the editing really needed to be enhanced (every screen time of the actor had more quantity than quality - again well, too much dialogue ). <br /> <br /> The whole story took place over several days, but everything that happened took on epic proportions, very much like everyday events seemed HUGE to you in high school, but in general this was not the case important. Yes, the bad guys beat and killed Moses, they beat Button, they killed the dog - all that could cause the blood of the Boss and Charlie. But the importance was weakened by all the "deep, meaningful" conversations that dominated most of the film. These guys have worked together for 10 years, and they are only now talking about this? The only time that there was not a lot of dialogue was on the skirmish scene - probably that's why I liked it. <br /> <br /> Finally, someone gave Annette Bening a comb! The thin strands of hair around her face, which (I suppose) made her look more romantic, actually made her look a little crazy. If she worked outside the home, it would make more sense. Plus, why was she not already married? It seemed that the city had several “kind and tender” (her words) single men, except for the marshal and his minions. In fact, none of the bad guys seemed to want her (the usual plot in other films). Most of the time, she was locked up in a house and did not seem to have much connection with people in the city. Makes you think ... <br /> <br /> In general, the film was too long, too talkative and too contrived for me. It was like a stellar vehicle with plenty of screen time for large stars, but not enough depth of character to interest me, despite all the dialogue.
