This film could have a lot of potential. Of course, with modern technology, you can expect real special effects. But films are shot not only with special effects, but, of course, you need to play. This film lacked both! <br /> <br /> First, let me tell those who are upset about not following the Bible: why can't a film get an artistic license? If you want to know about the story of Moses, read the Bible. I have seen very few films that show a true story. Look at the film with its artistic qualities. <br /> <br /> When watching this movie, you will inevitably compare it with the 1956 version. It fails miserably at this. Heston and Brenner had PRESENCE. They became their roles. You do not see it here. <br /> <br /> Even if you donâ€™t compare, standing alone, this film is in too much of a hurry. The part where the scene needs to be designed is not the case. It gets boring. <br /> <br /> My advice: skip this and watch the others. No matter how obscene others are, this is the best movie.
