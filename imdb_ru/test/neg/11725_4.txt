One would have thought that with all the generous care and expenses that were invested in this film, created for television, he would reflect something of the taste and manners of a couple of the highest class - Wallis Simpson and Prince of Wales - instead of dark, unappetizing historical novel. <br /> <br /> The fact that JANE SEIMOUR and ANTHONY ANDREW give tough, rather uncomfortable to watch performances in which events move too slowly to hold attention does not help either. /> <br /> It is difficult to understand why a star of the caliber of OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND would like to play the minor role of Aunt Bessi, since this role is so colorless that it almost disappears from view. At this stage of her career, Olivia starred in many "noble" roles that require a royal presence, but no more. <br /> <br /> A trivial film that is best forgotten among all the films created for television of this era.
