This film caused some interest or praise only because it was part of a lesbian interest. The performances are mostly unemotional compared to the best films in the genre of interest GLBT. The entire watchable value of the film is determined by the modest uncertainty of whether and when family members of the partners will say something discouraging about their lesbian relationships. The best element of the film is probably the beautiful scenery of New England, although most of the film is inside. It’s hard to imagine how any viewer watching this movie and not seeking to confirm their LGBT lifestyle or wanting to see other people's lifestyle, even with the help of a poorly realized drama, can to some extent appreciate the “incoming water”. This is a terrible movie.
