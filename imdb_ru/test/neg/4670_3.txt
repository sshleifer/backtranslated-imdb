I remember thinking that I would really like this film because of the cast, the plot and the director. <br /> <br /> When I entered the theater and took my place, I was like a frivolous schoolgirl, as my anticipation for the opening scene was built. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the discovery and felt that I really would like this film. <br /> <br /> If you havenâ€™t seen the movie yet and feel that everything that produces scenes can be considered as a spoiler, please stop reading. I'm not going to give something really important, but it can be considered as such, so this is a warning. <br /> <br /> Spoiler can be included below, be careful. <br /> <br /> I think that the first scene, which really struck me as simply ridiculous, was the scene of the Russian space station. I mean, honestly, refueling a shuttle without a real advance warning, and then just showing the station so fragile that a simple little mistake could lead to an explosion of all of this. <br /> <br /> Although all of this Perhaps, it seemed to me that this was too much. I'm not sure if it was just a situation, or it was a stupid game, a stupid look at Russian technologies, or just an obscene attitude of the scene itself. <br /> <br /> It only worsened for me after that, because then we experience what seemed like 2 hours of constant super loud explosions in space ... you know, this is a place where there is no sound, because it is a vacuum . <br /> <br /> But the coup of grace for me, frankly, was a gun scene. (spoiler option) - Earlier in the film, we see Bruce Willis tearing up his ground vehicle (the car they will use to move when they get there and to help them drill) when he is told that this is what He will use the splinters and complain about it, because a lot of what is on it is hard and not needed for what they do. <br /> <br /> So, when we wander around the asteroids, we see that they have decided to add a massive, machine gun-like gun to the cars ... you know, the standard NASA fare - to have heavy weapons all space missions in case you know aliens or something like that. <br /> <br /> I could have taken an explosive 2 hours, stupid refueling scene on the Russian space station, a stupid love scene at the end, the character of Bruce Willis is nothing more than most of his other past characters, but Steve Buscemi is coming off crazy and fires a spacecraft weapon. everywhere and causing damage / harm, well, that threw it all for me. <br /> <br /> Save your money and time and avoid this movie. If you need a good meteor film, watch Deep Strike, if you want a funny space film with amazing special effects, see Space Cowboys, but in spite of everything, avoid this movie.
