Glory did something strange. It was not only the musical originally created for the screen (most based on Broadway musicals), but it spawned the series and the Broadway musical. Let me correct this sentence. Glory is not a musical. Musicals have song numbers to advance the plot or show the feelings of the characters. Singing in this music is also not used; in fact, it is generally useless. People just randomly sing to fit the plot. And this is not the type of musical that I know. <br /> <br /> The so-called Story of Glory is attacked by characters (which are all presented immediately when I saw this last time in [Gosford Park]). it had disastrous results - who auditioned and entered the New York School of Performing Arts. All of them are for various reasons, i.e. acting skills, singing, etc. A drama unfolds with quotations and quotations when these middle-aged people who pretend to be teenagers pass four years later. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that high school has to be selective. In the end, this is a free college, and they can't let everyone in. So why do bad people really go to college? Obviously, drama may arise between all these different people. And why is a man not billed at the very end of the film, for no reason other than to make us feel uncomfortable? There are many disturbing situations that these mediocre people fall into, but you cannot feel bad about them because you don’t know who they are! These relationships occur between people whose names you do not know. And these characters are aware of something about themselves throughout the entire film, but you don’t understand it, because first of all you don’t know what they were. <br /> <br /> As for singing, he appears randomly (and should he be playful?) and does nothing. When the title song is played, it sounds in the middle of the street, and before you can say that Ferris Bueller, everyone in the center of the street is dancing wildly and uniquely. The song itself is fine, but the whole scene, like the entire movie, is not needed. Glory - an unpleasant film, if not more. I would say more, but most of the film, fortunately, is gone from my head. Just do not see it. You will do yourself a favor. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/10 <br /> <br /> R for language.
