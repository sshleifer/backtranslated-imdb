You have to start worrying when you see Michael Madsen playing a major role in any movie. I will not go through the list of shame, which is his film career. <br /> <br /> I watched for 45 minutes and was still not sure what was really going on. The film consisted of a love-hate relationship between Madsen and Argento, which, in fact, forced Madsen to insult her, threaten with violence and generally treat her like dirt. She, on the other hand, loves him, then she does not love, then she does, she wants him, then she loves him again ...... what is wrong with you, woman !!!! <br /> <br /> “Script” is a terrible, lousy soundtrack and senseless aggressive and brutal sexuality, which I think was added to seduce some viewers, because the film has nothing more to offer. I’d give film 1, but he coped with 2 with little excitement in the last 20 minutes. It really answered one question in the last few minutes, but I'm not going to talk about it, I will make you suffer for the whole movie, like me.
