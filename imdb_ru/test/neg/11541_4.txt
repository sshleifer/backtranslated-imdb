I appeared as an extra and was on the spot as a journalist covering the “Curse of Dane”. I took part in the filming of this film in Jim Thorpe, Pa. (Jim Thorpe was also one of the sites of the 1969 film Molly Maguires). I reported on the “action” in the newspaper “Emmaus Free Press”, where I was an editor in 1978–80 (publication stopped in the 1990s). I recall the excellent attention to detail of historic costumes, cars, etc. The modern asphalt streets of Jim Thorpe were covered with gravel, imitating a rural town of the 1920s in the south. At that time, I interviewed the producer and briefly talked to the director during the break to change the shooting; I could not interview James Coburn, which has always been a great disappointment to me. In addition, I briefly appear on one of the street scenes in a hat with a latch and a tweed jacket. The producer asked me to jump, and it was a real thrill. I still have a collection of black and white photographs that I took to work on a newspaper. Someday they may be interested in film / television historians. - Lou Varricchio
