I usually like to find old (and some not very old) westerns that I haven’t seen for entertainment in the evening. This is a great way to relax, rest and avoid politics and world problems for a few hours. But this should not have been the case with this version of the Magnificent Seven. The cast and storyline of this series closely follows the Hollywood formula for politically correct entertainment; good old revisionist history, where all the “bad guys” should be white, men, confederates (in this case) and preferably Christian (if this can somehow be included in the script). It's sad, really. The best films are now and have always been about the simple story of a good story on the big screen, and not about promoting someone’s political ideology.
