I consider myself a fan of Jess Franco and his junk movies, but almost every time I see one of them, I just see missed opportunities and stories that are not very successful. This film, unfortunately, is no different. The film, of course, had great potential, since Franco combined the intriguing theme of the classic film “The Most Dangerous Game” with his usual brand of crappy meanness, but the plot is lost too often, and for Franco it takes an eternity to get to the main point of the film. Considering that this is a later film by Franco, you can be forgiven for thinking that the director would get better, but in fact I found out that the opposite is true; both this and the terrible Barbie Slayer are his two worst films. The plot focuses on the stripper and her horny guy. The couple is invited to a private island by a rich woman and her lover. However, they soon discover that they were not invited there for social reasons, since they were “released” to the island so that a rich woman and her friends could track them down in sports! <br /> <br /> What attracted me to this film was the front cover and the fact that it was shot by the king of short films. Then you would think that I would be glad that there are a lot of sex scenes and general meanness in the film; but I am not. The reason for this is mainly because sex and sloppiness in a film are really boring and most of the time only serve to give me a condition known as an “itchy finger forward.” However, my tendency to see everything to the end guaranteed that I had to mix it up. There was a time when I did not think that a girl on a girl might be boring, but since then I have been mistaken. The only positive thing I can get out of the film is that the soundtrack is quite memorable, and despite the silly foreign pop music; actually blends well with sex scenes. I enjoyed the last ten minutes; just when the plot finally began to evolve, but it was too late, and, unfortunately, this is a very dim film. In general, I recommend this film only to those who think that they should see all 180-odd Franco films ... everyone else should watch Vampyros Lesbos, Faceless or She Killed in Ecstasy instead.
