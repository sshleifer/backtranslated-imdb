This is definitely the worst and most stupid show I've ever seen on TV. It is almost physically painful to observe how an adult (he is about twenty years old) does only torture and mocks his parents, who always seem to have no idea about the tricks they have to endure from their stupid son and his equally stupid friends. Of course, I know that his parents are involved in this, but I really hate how they always behave as if they were taken by surprise. It seems fake right through. And I really hate the introduction of the show, in which the voice-over asks: “Bam Margera, what will he think next?!?!” (In any case, I think this is the way it is), and Bam himself answers: “What I wouldn't want a damn thing! " - BLIMEY! Bam is really an adreyter - he lives at home with his mom and dad! - Of course, the word "F ^ * K" is replaced with a delicious sound signal, but we receive a message. Bam is a true rebel deal - at least in his own eyes. Of course, Bam and his squad of numbed skulls are aimed at teenage boys, and, of course, this is an MTV show, but please raise the bar a little. It is painfully predictable and stupid, and therefore nothing but boring.
