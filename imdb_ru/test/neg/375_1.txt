This time, the Beastmaster (Mark Singer) returns only to meet the new enemy Arklon (Wings Hauser), but because of the annoying teenager (Kari Uher) they are transferred to the future, where they then beat him. A lot of (lame) fish out of the water are joking. You honestly do not get the continuation of this rotten to the depths of the soul. Beastmaster 2 is a painful movie. Links and "fashion" badly date the film (this was done in 1991), and really, who wants to see the Beastmaster at the moment? Mention should also be made of Wings Hauser, whose embarrassing performance is easily the best advantage of the film. The singer looks awkward, Uher annoying, and the whole 1991 slang makes the film completely invisible. This is easily one of the worst films ever. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of 4- (Awful)
