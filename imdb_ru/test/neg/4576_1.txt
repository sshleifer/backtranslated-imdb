I went to see “Passion of Mind”, because I usually enjoy the genre of alternative reality novels, that is, “Sliding Doors”, “I, I, I”, etc. <br /> <br /> But this was the worst I've ever seen! I had to force myself to sit through it. I did not even stand aside from loans that are unheard of for me. <br /> <br /> Magical realism was completely absent because Demi Moore was grim and the lovers she loved were guys who usually play villains, although each of them was kind of sexy and attractive. <br /> <br /> In fact, a psychological explanation was given for the double life, with an unpleasant disgust for the Electra complex; maybe magic should not be explained for this genre to work. <br /> <br /> (originally written 05/28/2000)
