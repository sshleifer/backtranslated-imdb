Many consider Stu Ungar the greatest poker / gin player of all time - an extraordinary self-destructive force of nature - tiny in stature but a huge heart for playing. <br /> <br /> What we have Here is something like Hallmark Film about the dangers of gambling. Of course, he wins, he loses, he blows it all up for sex, drugs and other games of chance, we get it, but where the real game is - where that made him the greatest card player of all time. <br /> <br /> Too flat and frankly boring in some places, we get four, because we learn something about Stu, a man, but Stu, a card player, nada. <br /> <br /> Perfectly shot and presented Recall that this is an excellent example of how not to make a film about cards. Honestly, the World Series coverage in ESPN is more watchable than that. <br /> <br /> Wasting a huge chance.
