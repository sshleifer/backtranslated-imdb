I just saw it at TCM tonight and was shocked by the excessive playing of Gene Arthur. She looked up in surprise and just overdid it, it was not the same style as Dietrich and Art Lund. Dietrich was delightful in his restraint and playfulness. She is the best thing in this movie. Wilder's jokes were flat and, frankly, more like what a newcomer would have written in college, trying to “leave,” being evil, witty and dirty, but it sounded just boring and not at all funny. Humor seemed to be pushed too hard to be funny. The ending was completely invented. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD: Never anywhere did I believe that Art Lund suddenly fell out of love with Dietrich, and then suddenly fell in love with Arthur. Oh, Billy Become a real one! 3 out of 10
