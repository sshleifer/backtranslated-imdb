Revenge Pinocchio is not a good movie. And not scary. <br /> <br /> The game was wooden, at least from the side of Pinocchio. The puppet had all 2 expressions. Like most of the actors, except for some rather strange ... minor characters ... most of them were pleasant at the top. <br /> <br /> The special effects in this pretty "B", and, as I said, the doll really exploded. <br /> <br /> The 2 best scenes in the movie are the knife through the hand ... it looked pretty good, I think they spent about 1/3 of the budget on it ... and the scene in the soul ... WOW .. I think they spent the other 2/3 of the budget talking to an actress who was in this scene to do it. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is a little below the average "b" puppet horror movie ... rent a chucky if you have a desire to see the puppets being killed. <br /> <br /> This story had several interesting ideas that were enough for me to continue to follow it to the end.
