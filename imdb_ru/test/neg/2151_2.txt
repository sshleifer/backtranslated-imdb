Not sure if this is just a lousy movie or it was intended to ridicule the letter "B". The storyline was so-so, but the shooting, editing and acting were just bad. Plus, the music in the background was annoying, too loud and just nonstop. Many times you could not see the dialogue over the background music. Iâ€™m in the SASS (Single Action Society) and starring with them in the Old West, and many of the actors are members of this group, so I bought it. If you have no interest in this group of people or in this sport, you probably will not even have this small interest to help with the film. The game even experienced actors (especially Stella Stevens) left much to be desired.
