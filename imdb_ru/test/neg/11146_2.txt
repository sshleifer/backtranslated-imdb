this movie sucks. so many holes in the plot. if the devil is invincible, why does he demand the protection of his bodyguards? I could not understand why Arnie did not come to work for several days, and then suddenly appears, takes away their entire arsenal and disappears again !! Good work if you can get it. It is sad that the last half hour should have ended in the standard final arnie 'uzi 9mm'. √Årni interprets the depressive policeman, bowing his head and sniffing. I thought he had a bad cold for most of the movie. Awfully written script, Arnie is called "buddy", "dude", etc. For 95% of the film, and then suddenly we hear his real name is Jericho Kane (where do they get these names from ??) The ending is such that you better prepare your bag. Shame that the Gladiator had the same finale, 100% more class. <br /> <br />
