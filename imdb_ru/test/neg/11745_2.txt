* Some possible spoilers * <br /> <br /> Of course, one cannot expect this film to be as good as the original, remakes are rare. But this remake of one of Hitchcock’s greatest films, Psycho, could be much better. <br /> <br /> First, the one who made the film was supposed to be crazy. I mean Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates! What, where do they think ?! Unlike the “harmless”, almost childish, Bates, whom Anthony Perkins was able to portray, Vaughn looks like he could be a murderer. In an attempt to make him Bates seem innocent, Vaughn eventually becomes gay. Many other actors also did not fit their roles, including Julianne Moore, who was simply not suitable for the film. <br /> <br /> At the top of the brutal casting, cinematography is noticeably worn, despite the fact that they remade the scene of the film behind the scenes. The only thing they added was random shots of objects such as clouds or a naked woman, between shots of the characters being killed. These shots did not seem to be related to the plot in any way, and, in turn, made no sense. <br /> <br /> In general, this remake of “Psycho”, which could be a decent picture, instead was a waste of time,
