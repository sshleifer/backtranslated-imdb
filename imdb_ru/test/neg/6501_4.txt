Avida is a play on words that mix life and zeal, but I personally think that this film was inflated with its ambitions and does not justify its name. He collects a lot of clunky characters, united by incredible links. In addition, the way everything is ultimately connected, in my opinion, is a little pompous. What was left of him was a collection of images ... interesting, but not enough to make this movie a good one. <br /> <br /> I think this film should be a comedy, but I definitely didnâ€™t notice! The nonsense and cartoon character of the film is actually the only good thing about it, but when it drags on, it stops being tolerant. I have to say that I fought hard to keep seeing him until the end, and I'm still not sure what it costs ...
