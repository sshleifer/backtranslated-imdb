I can't understand how someone might be interested in watching this movie. A woman meets a man, he also wants to play games, but only until she understands what she is missing. She leaves, and this is true. It took 9 and a half weeks before Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) left John (Mickey Rourke). She had to leave him after 30 minutes and put an end to our suffering.
