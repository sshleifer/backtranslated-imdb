Um ... I think I'll be the only one to say this, but yes, I was bored during the movie. This is not to say that this is a bad film, in fact it is a very good attempt to portray the most intimate emotions - dilemma, sadness, love ... especially, this is the director's debut (read from somewhere, right?). I felt that something was not quite right, maybe it was just me, I was not interested enough in the characters to immerse me in their world. This is a simple story about ordinary people, for ordinary lives. With simple and short dialogues, the director tries to talk about the life of a simple guy and how he handles the news about his illness, laughing at her every time. Oh, yes, his laughter at first was quite sweet, but gradually he reaches me, such a deep, heartfelt roar for a gentle man! I have to say that I didn’t feel the impact that most readers felt, in fact, I was more drawn to trivial scenarios, such as spitting watermelon seeds with his sister, which clearly shows that they feel comfortable with each other, grandmother, who came back for another shot - this is a kind of melancholic, thoughtful gesture recording procedures for his father - hmm, but this is predictable .. Do not get me wrong, that I am an action lover, independent films are my cup of tea! Perhaps I’m just looking forward to seeing many deep films that have stronger images. Some Asian films are worth seeing: <br /> <br /> Tony Takitani (depicts loneliness) Wayward Cloud (only 1 dialogue) My cheeky girl (I like it!) 4.30 (loneliness too) 15 (gangsters live in local conditions Until sunrise and before sunset (I just have to mention it, although it is not Asian movies. Fans will understand!)
