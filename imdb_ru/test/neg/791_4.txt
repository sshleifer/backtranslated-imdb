A couple in financial difficulties gets a box delivered to their door. If they press a button, they will receive a million dollars, but someone whom they do not know will die. Do they press the button? <br /> <br /> This is a strange film based on the story of Richard Matson, in which there are several unpleasant moments, but mostly it is a dirty novel. The problem is that so many things happen that director Richard Kelly does not know which film he is shooting. Is this a direct horror movie with supernatural overtones? At times it seems that this is a moral choice, a curse and an afterlife. Is this a science fiction movie? Perhaps there are many questions about this Mars project. And what are the strange looks that people seem to have, as if in some kind of grand conspiracy? Is it "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" or the demonic film? I do not know. Maybe. And this is a problem, there are many questions, most of them are intriguing, but there are too many of them. It seems that little has been explained, and when we come to the end of the film, it seems that more and more stops than ends (even in an open way). I'm all for making a movie rich in themes and stories, but author Kelly fills her script with too much that director Kelly can't handle, or makes each topic or storyline get its ten minutes of screen time and in those minutes he holds court before he is thrown into the next bit. It drove me crazy. (I will not go into the two main characters, Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, who are not very good or most likely do not know what to do with the material that is constantly changing) <br /> <br /> This is an ill-advised mix, which does not work (ultimately too many holes). I reached the end and suddenly realized that I had no idea what I had just seen. I really did not like it, but its no longer good at it, because it rather skips a kind of way. I would take a pass or wait for a cable where it will cost you nothing
