A man is building a hotel with a partner. He learns that the hotel is overly insured. Everything just gets worse. This film has a huge number of scenes. They must have been collected in the dream of someone. He jumps from place to place. It does not stay focused on something for very long. The finale begins on Christmas morning with a fire in the hotel. Then there is a transition to the night scene of this fire, and then there is a transition to the daytime. The DVD track is terrible. It takes an honest plot and turns into the worst movie, I have a scene in a long time.
