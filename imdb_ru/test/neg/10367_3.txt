This and the previous Toulon's Revenge, as well as the next, seem to be completely different from the first two films where the puppets were not so good. Basically, you choose your series, the first two go together and draw dolls as killers, and the next three are a series of good guys. This is like an episode, like some kind of stupid television series that will be as good as the third part, and I have never had the desire to try to watch the fifth part of the series. In fact, a child gets puppets, while some strange dark lord or something else sends his evil puppets to kill, this dark lord looks like a kind of enemy from one of those live action films in Japan, like Ultraman. The film ended before you knew him, so you need to give him credit for not causing you very painful results when watching a movie. Just to a lot of holes in the plot and the like, so that it can be considered a good movie. You really see the guy who played Toulon in the last movie, although then you have a very anti-climatic battle, and the movie is over before it really starts.
