Looking at these reviews and all these high marks, I can believe that a large amount of red corn syrup will delight any idiot who died of reason. This film is useless. All cliches from slasher films without any substance. I'm sure I could tell you more about the film, but why bother when you can summarize? Obviously, everyone wants Mandy Lane, and she obviously doesn't want any of the guys. Throughout the movie you will see it. <br /> <br /> When she ceases to be friends with a typical boy trapped in a friends zone, he becomes ballistic, and when she sets off on a journey to the center, where there is no (of course) he begins to hunt them one by one. Sounds good, right? But what made this film suck up is incredible, what you find out is that not only is her killer loser girlfriend, but she also .. The plan was out of the laugh. Let's kill all our friends together and then kill each other. They give no reason why they wanted to do this, and, given Mandy Laneâ€™s Goody Too Shoes style, it makes you scratch your head even more about what actually encourages these characters to do everything they do. It's sad ... this film had a lot of potential, but the director or screenwriter obviously cannot relate to the audience.
