SILVER CITY (2+ of 5 stars) Being a big fan of John Sales for many years, I can say with confidence that this is the worst film he has ever done. However, the film is not quite * awful * ... just very boring. Sales adds familiar elements from his previous films (corrupt politics, illegal immigration, sale of youthful ideals), but cannot combine them in any new or meaningful way. Even the dialogue (usually the strong side of Sales) is disappointing this time ... sounds cliché and forced in almost every scene. The film looks and sounds like episodes from the series, which did not pass the third episode. There are a lot of big stars at hand ... and they try hard to liven up their bit parts ... but there is simply no material this time. During the filming of the commercial, the governor (the poor and obvious assistant of George W. Bush) catches the dead body from the lake. The researcher is hired to try to warn people who may have deliberately set it up to discredit the candidate ... but he soon discovers that there are deeper and darker (and more clichéd) secrets that need to be discovered. In the past, Sales has made films with a similar theme much better (Lone Star, Matevan, Return of Seven Seconds, People with Arms). It's a shame that he went to the well once too much and invented spoiled water. One nice line, pronounced by Richard Dreyfuss: “Danny, you are a loser. This is already established beyond any doubt. So just try to be good, ok? ”
