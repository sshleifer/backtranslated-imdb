So much for JUDGE AND JURY, which corresponds to its meaningless name. What good is there? The lighting is terribly foggy! Are you asking for another horror movie? Well, this is understandable. David Keith really well disguises clowns, chefs and other machinations, being a murderer who escaped the death penalty. But overall, despite some new twists and turns, this is pretty silly. Recently, Unapix has released some ridiculous productions, and this only means a lot. We, the jury, believe this film is guilty of the fact that many of us are idle, believing that it is a waste of time!
