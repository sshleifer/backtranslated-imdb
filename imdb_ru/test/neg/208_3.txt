There were moments in the film, but I still disappointed. It was an alteration of Trespass (Walter Hill) and, thus, The Treasure Of Sierra Madre, with less stress, a bite and human emotions. It was a bit of a good game, but the story was lethargic and she lacked real depth. I watched a movie for Mr. Reno and Mr. Fishburn, neither of them was inspired, and both had little to say or to act out of their way. This film was made to death in the past and should not have been made by eating money that could be used in the best films. For the action movie it was scanty, but the thriller did not tremble. Better than watching the snow fall, but not for me.
