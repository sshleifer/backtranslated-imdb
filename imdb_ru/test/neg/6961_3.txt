To describe what is seriously wrong with this film, it must contain several * spoilers *, so if you are going to see it and expect to be surprised, do not read it! <br /> <br /> I liked everything about this movie except the plot; and in such a thriller as this believable plot is necessary. This works well if a little slow motion, and the work of the camera and the scene in Portland are exquisite for a low-budget, unpretentious picture. The dialogue is very good. <br /> <br /> Mason is a serious retired young man who works for an insurance telemarketing company. His school friend, Berkeley, is his employer and cares for him as a brother, despite the fact that Mason is obviously mentally ill. Mason has nightmares that make him gasp and mess around with the inhaler. His visions and nightmares suggest that he had serious problems with beautiful women in the past, and the film seems to suggest that he could be a serial killer of women. He meets a funny, pretty girl named Amber and draws her in his notebook. She sympathizes with him and poses for him so that he can draw her portrait. He sees more of her and begins to wake up from his detached state, almost becoming halfway human. Then something goes wrong. Amber finds albums with pictures of other girls, and she begins to wonder. She is frightened and suspended. We wonder if its sudden coldness is going to push it over the edge. His behavior becomes more erratic. <br /> <br /> This is a revelation setup. To explain how this movie goes horribly wrong, I have to explain what is happening. * Another warning from the spoiler! * To make this conspiracy work, we believe that Amber, a truly sociable, nice young girl, will go to a serious emotionally excited young man who, at least at the beginning of their friendship, has an empty look and can only speak in simple words or not speaks at all. He is far beyond the know-all, he appears on the verge of complete catatonia. Yes, I know, girls can be attracted by all kinds of cranks, but usually they are punk rockers or punk rockers, guys with some kind of evil maniacal energy. Mason is practically a zombie, he almost does not exist. Any funny young thing would cross the street to avoid it. It is just incredible that this girl attracts him. Moreover, Berkeley has no compelling reason to indulge a crazy Mason, it is simply implausible. <br /> <br /> But wait, there is a revelation. Amber does not appear at Berkeley's house at the Christmas dinner, where Mason is waiting for her, and Berkeley, his old friend, should tell him that Amber and all his former girlfriends, whom he painted in his many albums, do not exist in everything! She and all the others are just the fruit of his perverted imagination: he invented them. <br /> <br /> Well, this explains why the normal dear Amber will go for Mason, she is just a figment of his imagination. This could be the final opening of the film with proper preparation and tuning, but alas, it is not. At this moment Mason runs back to his apartment and finds Amber there ... he is furious, he kills her. But now we are given to understand that Amber was actually a real, and not an imaginary girl Mason. <br /> <br /> In the end, after evidence was obtained that Amber really exists and Mason killed her, Berkeley must admit that he was wrong, that he mistakenly appreciated Mason. It would have worked if Mason had been halfway in his right mind from the very beginning, but since we, the public, always suspected him that he was completely insane and, perhaps, a killer of women, this does not surprise us. We suspected who he was all the time, and we cannot understand why Berkeley could not see it. But then it remains for us to think again: if it was real, why did Amber enthrall the catatonic Mason? <br /> <br /> What's worse - the ending, we are never given to understand whether all the other Mason's friends, those in the albums, were real, or was Amber the first real one? And if the others were real, did he kill them too? What did he do with the bodies? <br /> <br /> The problem is that the filmmakers simply did not know what to do with the material. Perhaps there might be a way to correct this and tell a plausible unknown story, but this film is not the one.
