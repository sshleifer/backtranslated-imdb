Extremely boring ... I don’t care how much avant-garde bones you have in your body, this kid sucks ... and don’t go look at him, because I mentioned this, except for Warhol’s Empire more interesting !! I have seen other Duras films that were much better, so I am stunned why this is considered “Masterpiece”. As an art historian, I had to consider the radical works of Marcel Duchamp, Chris Berden and Damien Hirst, and in this artist I still see the artistic intent, even quality, and an interesting aspect in presenting their art. As for “India Song” - it’s not even soft porn. Anias Nin was almost here - G-rating is a slide show gender and voice-over, which does not apply to a slide show / movie ...... pure crap and not even politeness ... unfortunately just a bore and a waste of 2 hours. To add insult to injury, the imprint I saw was faded and scratched to hell !!! (Harvard Film Archive) If I want to see “boring entertainment,” I watch Bunuel !! Yes, "Indian Song" - keep your head high until late modernism and be really boring !! Watch a 70-year-old porn movie with all the good details cut out and turn the sound down, you will get the “India Song”, but with the best cinematography and none of the annoying music or the screaming vice consul !!!
