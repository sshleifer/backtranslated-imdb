This film is nothing original, humane or insightful. Acting is average, amateur shots, writing is not enough subtlety, and the scenes are very simple ... something like soap. <br /> <br /> At 2:37, suicide is used to turn a film into a drama of suspense. In part, we look because we want to know who is dying. Each of the characters has problems, and the film shows how harmful each problem is to them, but only as a way to get each of them to where you think they can kill themselves. Despite the different points of view offered by the camera on key events, there is NEVER any other way to see the events themselves. So at 2:37, arseholes are arseholes, angels are angels. These are simple things. <br /> <br /> Without this complexity, the film turns into a voyeuristic story about sex and violence against young people. You are unlikely to recognize children as much as the breasts, bodies, and lameness that the cinematographer gives out as characterization. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you know ANYTHING about the film over the past 5 years, 2: 37 is just an immature separation of an elephant — not meditation, not progression. Yet, while the filmmaker and the distributor use a friend’s supposed suicide at every opportunity to give the film legitimacy, they never talk about Gus Van Sant or The Elephant. Positive posts on IMDb curiously avoid mentioning this or simply do not appreciate originality. If you want something with a heart and a voice, avoid this part of youth exploitation. I was surprised by the age of filmmakers when I found out about this film - I assumed that it was made by a 13-year-old teenager. The twenty things I have always known are too busy trying to express something real in them to raise the work of the old man.
