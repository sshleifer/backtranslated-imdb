You don't need a spoiler to avoid this ... well, a strange movie. Canada becomes part of the United States. OK. So, I think I'm unusual, but I expected something from the consequences of Canada becoming part of the United States. I was a fool. Carry on with this movie and you will go to cloudy cuckoo land. The initial premise has nothing to do with the rest of the film, in which you (believe me) do not take care of the squat for any of the characters. Slings and Arrows and Due South should be among the most creative series ever. But in this case, Paul Gross, I am very sorry, did not have a clue about creating a coherent film and spent many talented actors in the process. A real disappointment.
