After watching Caddyshack 1, I heard a sequel and decided to watch it. The film seemed pretty bad, and I told myself to stay away, but stupid I gave up and actually bought the damn thing! All the reviews and all the bad things you heard about Caddyshack II are true. The film is full of ideas, the most disgusting plot and jokes I've ever heard, gopher, acting - the whole movie is really bad (although Randy Quaid was funny). <br /> <br /> Just stay away from this film, as far as you can, that's all I can say. I deeply regret watching and buying a DVD, but I'm not sure which solution was worse. Just stay away as much as possible.
