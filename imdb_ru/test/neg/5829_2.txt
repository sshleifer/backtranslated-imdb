Very stupid high school students / teenagers bustle about geeks trying to show themselves better than rich kids. Sounds familiar? In this television film from director Rod Amato (“Unusual Valor” and some episodes of “The Dukes of Danger” believe or not) says nothing, does nothing, and most likely entertains very little. <br /> <br /> Notable for her “who is who of the television cast, including Michael J. Fox, Bob Denver (“ Gilligan ”) and Todd Bridges (“ Miscellaneous brush strokes ”). This weak force is hardly limping over the line. Also stars are Anthony Edwards ("E.R."). <br /> <br /> Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video
