“The Hep Cat” by Bob Clampett is clearly an average cartoon, remarkable only by the fact that it was the first Looney Tune color (Looney’s previous melodies were black and white, while Merrie’s melodies were colored). In the story of singing, dancing cats, trying to care for a cat and a dog trying to catch a cat, the “Cat Cap” lacks the energy and tempo typical of most Clampett shorts. Honestly, Clampett doesn't have much work. Warren Foster's script is embarrassed by subtlety, and, despite the fact that Clampett did not use it with the “Cat Cartoon,” he turned straw into gold along with other cartoons. It is often said about Clampetta that you cannot take his caricature for someone else, and this is usually true, but “Cat of Hepatitis” is an exception. There are flashes of Clampett's genius, such as a chase scene in which the cat stops to ask the dog "Hey, you follow me." When the dog confirms that this is the case, the cat simply says “O” and the chase immediately resumes. Unfortunately, there is very little such brilliance. Knowing who sent him, “Heps Cat” is a bitter disappointment. We all have weekends, and this was clearly one of the days of Clampetta!
