But I still loved to look at her, so I gave her 3 instead of 1. Her expressions are priceless. Some of the other actors (for example, Michael McKean) are also really slums. The cat itself is somewhat amusing. In addition, the entire film is a clich√©, the culmination of which is too long a car chase. (It is also at this point that the film becomes overly raw, still being very "family".)
