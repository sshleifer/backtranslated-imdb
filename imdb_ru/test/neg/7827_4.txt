Asia Argento is a sexy beautiful woman who likes to run naked, which is not bad in itself, but when her character tells about all the guys she served and see her with Michael Madsen and an Asian guy in the current time of the movie, I felt that I you need a condom in front of you to watch this movie, as if the disease will rub off with me or something like that. <br /> <br /> The film was as if he were going to a love triangle / drama / action / ??? the plot, it just seemed to go everywhere and nowhere at the same time. The acting was great, the plot is not so great. The director should at least choose a genre and practice, practice, practice, before trying to do something as difficult as this again, because they are obviously not very good at it.
