I did not expect much from the film, so I am not so disappointed. Kerry looked terrible, Mr. Big painted his eyebrows with pencils, and Samantha did not say f ***. <br /> <br /> Charlotte's child was unpleasant to watch as she was in too many scenes - the name could easily be “SATC: Parent 'Night Out”. The camera angles were not so good, especially with respect to the face of Carrie. <br /> <br /> There was an abandoned black woman whose character did not have a proper exit, and too few appearances from gay friends who still seemed abandoned without a goal. Samantha, returning from Los Angeles, was suffocated by the plot, especially when she comes to Fashion Week and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The film seems to have been shot in a hurry, because it could be good, but the scenes were simply added to show different outfits or to give viewers the opportunity to return to the show without adding much to the film’s story.
