Let's do one thing right: I like most of the work of Snipes. Unlike other contemporaries with high hits (Seagal and Van Damme), he really can act. This film, however, does little to improve its reputation; it is not at all unsightly - but I am in no hurry to watch it again. In fact, if I had never seen it again, it would not bother me - there are just a lot of the best films to waste on my own! It is a pity, because with a little imagination and some subtle changes this film could become worthy. Instead, the director chose to almost try to get his audience to submit to too much violence and little characterization. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I encountered was one of the main roles of Snipes, Sylvia. Colloca. I’m confused by the fact that the producers of this film spent all their efforts on hiring amazingly beautiful (in any case, for my money) and talented actress, such as Miss Collock, and then giving her such a pathetic one-dimensional character, with which can play. If she was hired to just add a bit of “glamor” to the film, she doesn't even do it very well; There is no nude in the film, and there is no sex scene worthy of mention. Strange really. Given the amount of violence in this film, it confuses me why producers are so conservative about sex and nudity. Do we live in 2007 or in 1957? The fact that the producers of this garbage (and, possibly, the actors as well) have forgotten, is that films must be fantasies. Like most of the inhabitants of this planet, my real life is very boring. I would like to pursue terrorists, be able to cope with myself, like Mr. Snipes, and communicate with such a beautiful young girl like Miss Collock. This film does not satisfy any of these fantasies very well. That is why I give such a bad review!
