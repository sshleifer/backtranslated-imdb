It's funny how instinct warns you about something. For example, as soon as the company's credits read “Nu Image”, I instinctively knew that I had seen a really crappy movie somewhere before, but could not remember where. However, I just knew that JUDGE AND THE JURY were going to be crap, and that was it. Maybe I'm a psychic? <br /> <br /> !!!! SMART SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The discovery is quite cruel: several people are blown away for no greater reason than in the wrong place at the wrong time. I don’t know about you, but at the moment I’m a bit fed up with exploitative violence on the screen, along with bad language, especially if the actors release it as badly as in this film. In any case, the plot revolves around the execution of the bad guy and his return to take revenge on the man who shot his wife. Oh, did I mention that the bad dude and his wife killed a couple of people on their wedding night? Yes, he is a serious evil mofo. In fact, he is so bad (and I don’t mean acting, I’ll come back to this soon) that he cannot be taken seriously, and that before he is executed, only to return as Elton John, Elvis, French chef cook, etc. Interestingly, did Keith David pay for this? because he looks like he is having so much fun on the screen that this is the only reason he plays this role. What a pity that this reviewer did not get any pleasure from watching JUDGE AND JURY. Hey, maybe the producers could send me a whale fee? Gold knows only that I deserve it. <br /> <br /> I really didn’t like this film, as if you didn’t guess, and my main problem is not in a stupid conspiracy or cheap production values, but in its relation to violence, If, like me, you have a bottle of wine broke in the head or several times hit the ribs hard, you know that violence is an obscene and painful thing, but JUDGE AND JURY will make you believe that if you are thrown through a window, smash through a few rails and fall over twenty feet on the table, you not only will not suffer, but also be able to get ahead of a couple of draws devil's dogs. Of course, it can be argued that any film in which Sly, Arnie or Bruce were shot also suffers from the same dishonest show of violence, but with the JUDGE and JURY he pulled out my chain
