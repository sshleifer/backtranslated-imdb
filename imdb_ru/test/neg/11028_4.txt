When I bought 4 DVDs for £ 5 at a local store, this should have been a warning enough that this film did not conform to the usual standard of David Selznick Productions. With actors containing names like James Stewart and Carol Lombard, I was looking forward to real pleasure. As many other commentators have said, this is a strange mixture of plot and scenes, which is not entirely convincing. HOWEVER, I am so glad that I watched this film, as I now have a memorable saying: "Never let the seeds prevent you from enjoying the watermelon." live. This should sum up everyone’s life. Take out these seeds or spit them out or swallow them - and then enjoy the watermelon - life itself.
