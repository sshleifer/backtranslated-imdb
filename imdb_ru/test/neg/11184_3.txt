The price of a dream - and some dreams may be “too” expensive. <br /> <br /> Perhaps only viewing the English-translated version is the reason for the low rating of this viewer. <br /> <br /> This made the film as a whole worse than the story material that was hinted at ... <br /> <br /> ... and other comments seem to suggest that the captioned version will be better . <br /> <br /> But some elements of the plot remained unexplained, leaving an unfinished feeling. <br /> <br /> This also leaves the thought: “Is there a series to follow?”. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that there was no more (at least at this stage).
