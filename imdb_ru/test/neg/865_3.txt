I just saw Caribe a couple of nights ago at the annual Vistas Film Festival held here in Dallas, and I have to express my dissatisfaction. In the intro, an attempt is made to tell us that the film represents the current invasion of South American countries (in this case, Costa Rica) by North American oil companies, as well as the negative effects, both economic and environmental, of this invasion. The main characters are a couple who live a simple, pleasant life, supporting a banana farm. Immediately a woman comes in and announces that she is the wife’s half sister. I’m not going to go into details about this (and, to be honest, I don’t feel that something is spoiling this review), but another key point is that the company to which they distribute their bananas, discards them for budget requirements in a poor economy. Thus, the main conflict that should be addressed in the film is the husband between the stone and the anvil, trying to preserve their livelihood. On the one hand, the oil company Reynolds offered him a job and financial compensation (mainly a bribe) to use his social influence to induce the city to allow the company to start drilling in their city (threatening its position in society and society). myself). On the other hand, he faced the fact that he was bankrupt, but on the side of his community, protesting against drilling. Given the length of this film, there would be enough time to study the problems just described, but this simply does not happen, and I will tell you why. You will notice that this film has already received a couple of awards, one for the director and the audience award. I am not going to disassemble Esteban’s direction; it was not bad or good enough for me to be so keen on writing anything. The audience award was at a film festival in Spain, and in order to get a audience award, I had to imagine that the Spaniards were just digging soap operas. In fact, Central and South America are also digging soap operas, I know that very much. I assume that Esteban either sought to take advantage of this, or that he himself was digging soap operas, because this is what unfolds during this film, so much so that he throws the whole plot of the oil company aside, almost as if they were halfway through the making of this film, it was presented that it became tedious because it seems that at least three of the supporting characters had their background and character development seriously compromised in order to make room for more scenes sex and crying. The only real villain in the film is one of these three characters, and you never know who he is. It’s as if they cut his screen time because they completely got him out of the movie. From time to time they play with oil against the public conspiracy, but at best this is a retreat. Most often we see scenes of passion, jealousy, betrayal, adultery, and so on. These themes are so saturated with history that the “plot” of an oil company becomes unnecessary. It is almost as if it was a trick to legitimize the romantic drama (soap opera), adding a bit of political significance. However, the film is so immersed in romance that it ultimately does not know what to do with itself, with the result that the final is so connected that you can only wonder what you were waiting for, or if there was something to start with. . Here are two things that, I think, could save this film: either cut the half-sister, or cut the oil company. It is clear which of the two they were more interested in. Or perhaps, if Caribe was an hour longer, they could all solve it. Despite this, I would deal with direct soap opera, and I think that the topic of oil companies exploiting foreign countries is in urgent need of consideration by the cinematographic community. Caribe is both. These two corners could work together if they were properly balanced, but with a romantic plot running in circles and taking almost twice as long as necessary, due to the oil plot that was barely installed from the very beginning, both sides suffer Best of all, the romantic plot is never resolved. I would like to say that I will watch this movie again to see what I missed, but I have a strong feeling that I already know what it is. As far as I understand, it doesn’t matter if I saw the Caribe ten more times. I missed it because it's just not there.
