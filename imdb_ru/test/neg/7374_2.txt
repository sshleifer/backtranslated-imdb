This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Historical accuracy is completely absent. For example, James Wolfe, whom he portrayed as an anti-French Canadian, is shown in London in the summer of 1759. Locals look like Indians from a bad 1960s Hollywood movie: they wear buckskin clothes and ride horses (in Montaigne, never ride horses). The film takes place in Quebec, but shots are taken in Louisbourg, showing the Atlantic Ocean. <br /> <br /> The original script was supposed to include the “Battle of the Plains of Abraham”, but the producers reject the idea. Saying that the cost of uniforms and participants will be more than 4 million dollars! I think they have never heard of reconstruction. <br /> <br /> The entire film is scheduled as a new Titanic: impossible love during a historical tragedy (the fall of New France). There is even a song performed by Celine Dion at the end of the film (yes, I stayed until the end of the film, but I deeply regret). But the worst thing is that this film was worth 30 million dollars. I just do not know how they spend all that money. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my anger, but I'm too annoyed.
