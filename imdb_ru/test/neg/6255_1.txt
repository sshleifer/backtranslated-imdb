This movie was just bad. I can forgive low-budget movies for being low-budget, but it wasn’t funny, it wasn’t smart, it had no redemptive qualities if you really don’t like to look at fake tits. I don’t know what genre this genre belongs to, perhaps erotic horror, but if so ... well, it’s not sexy and not scary. It was useless to associate it with the movies "Slaughter of a party without sleep"; I have never seen previous films myself, and with the exception of one scene that tried to tie him together, I had no way of knowing who the psycho-killer in the Cheerleader was, or why they tried to turn it on, especially because (and I don’t think I’ll reveal anything here) it was really obvious that he wasn’t the killer of the cheerleaders in this movie. As for the killer himself? All I can say is lame. Really lame. When you find out why the killer goes to the support team (and the team coach, and the two stoners who were on the bus ride they take, and the bus driver just like that, obviously), will you go there and go ... WTF? The worst excuse is murder. "Actors" (two guesses why I added a quote) usually looked like low-budget porn rejects what they most likely were. These poor people are trying to break into the "legitimate" film. One of my friends said about the actor who played Buzzy, the bus driver: "He looks like a guy who, you know, really falls in love with him, and his face turns red and the rest." We had a good partner in this. Half of the other actors had all the skills and subtlety of the actors in the sixth grade performance of Annie, which I just saw. The other half seemed to be very bored (especially in the remote scene, this redhead ...), and ten minutes after this film I, too. <br /> <br /> Note: The DVD contains one deleted scene that would put a movie with an R rating on the NC-17 if it were left. He was completely free, and adult entertainment has no quality. The only reason to worry about this is to laugh a lot at evil.
