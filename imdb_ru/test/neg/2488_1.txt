I was expecting a documentary about the science fiction era of 1950–1965. And he got a big old commercial with leftist political undertones by James Cameron and the baby boomer promoting his own work. In the past, under the title “Watch the Sky”, the films “Giant Error” and “Space Exploration” of the 1950s were mentioned, including such favorites as “Earth Against UFOs”, “Things from Another World” and “Forbidden Planet”. like “Them”, “Death mantis” and “Tarantula”. There are examples with a smaller budget, which are rarely referred to as "Space Monster", "12 to the Moon" and "Space Man." <br /> <br /> It would be much better than a documentary if a few remaining actors, directors, stuntmen and collectors, as well as non-Hollywood boomers from that era, were polled. I would only like to have a rating of “0”, since “1” is a lot of generous.
