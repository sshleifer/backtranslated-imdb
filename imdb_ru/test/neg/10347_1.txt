Hard to believe - but true! I should not be surprised. Commercials are trying to show how unique and “fun” a show can be. However, commercials announcing this new show did not have the slightest humor for me, I did not communicate with anyone who found these videos funny. <br /> <br /> I don’t remember to ever see a pilot without intelligence, attraction or humor. The characters were unbearable for the most part. Especially Selma Blair (surprisingly, she would agree to take part in the fecal image of such a show). A few moments when the characters were easily bought out were considerably beaten and banal. <br /> <br /> A rare show with no redeemable qualities. And this is not one of them. Kat and Kim have ONE redemptive quality - and this is Selma Blair. Despite the fact that she wears disgusting outfits and behaves like a miserable, nagging, stupid excuse for a young woman who looks like a cross between Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, it is still nice to watch Selma. <br /> <br /> But if you want to look at Selma, go rent Hellboy. At the very least, you will maintain a little bit of respect for her, instead of bringing this hideous character into your brain to communicate with her. <br /> <br /> In general, Kat and Kim are a waste of time and truly embody the worst TV ever has been or has ever been. This sets a new minimum.
