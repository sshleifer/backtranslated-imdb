I found Code 46 very disappointing. I thought that the concept is good and therefore has great potential as a film, but I found that it does not. Code 46 lacked thought and structure, and the storyline did not flow well. I thought Tim Robbins' character was not well developed, for example. I thought that there should have been more information and thoughts invested in his family life, and not to completely ignore them, as it seemed to me. When they first violated code 46, it was suggested that they should not know that they could be genetically related, but all the technology was available to them, he took her fingerprint and, therefore, genetic details when he investigated fraud. I constantly expected that something would happen and the storyline would evolve, and yet this did not happen. I felt that the film had great potential for intellectual stimulation, but it turned out the opposite. Code 46 was trying to be too smart, and in the end he just did not have enough imagination. I would not recommend this film to anyone, the only thing that was good about the film was that it was relatively short.
