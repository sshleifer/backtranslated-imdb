I think that the best way for me to revise this title is to divide it into its pros and cons. Pros: ~ they turn into wolves, not plastic / cartoon monsters. ~ chasing the wolves through the woods ~ "ATM", played by Hard-Fi <br /> <br /> CONS: ~ some parts of the script make you cringe (for example, the terrible part, when a woman runs away from the "game" boys "Successful five, and about half an hour "Dear cousin" and a circular robin "Yes, you see, we know the law of Gabriel") ~ The transformation of immersion is funny ~ obvious and ridiculous ending ~ Aiden is told thousands of times to leave, and then he says: if you took care of me, you would leave me ", - obvious characters, - an unnecessary conversation, - It was an unnecessary cut of the hand, Aiden's speeches, Gabriel's cricket speech. /> <br /> You understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> I love werewolf movies, and I tried it several times to see if I liked it better, but it only made it worse. I think I'll just read the book and see how I can do it. <br /> <br /> Do not worry if you do not have a 12-year-old brother or sister in creepy things. Anyone older than this age can suffer and want an hour and a half ago.
