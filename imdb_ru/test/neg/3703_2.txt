If it were not for editing obscene words and blurred when one character points to another, it would be easy to take this low-budget snooper as a pilot for the Sci-Fi channel. The story of the governmentâ€™s attempts to destroy the telekinetic group that he originally trained in military weapons ends rather ambiguously when the hero, himself gifted, pursues the goal of surviving a telekinetics prone to revenge. Alas, the film is talkative, boring, predictable and even devoid of interesting special effects. Louis Gossett Jr. with the highest score plays a minor role as an evil government official who created the program and now wants to eliminate all traces. He goes through the part, and it's hard to understand why he was worried. Other cast members do decent work with a script that requires little.
