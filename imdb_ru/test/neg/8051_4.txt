Kindred opens shots Porsche, racing on the highway, he catches up with an old pickup and lingers. When he drives past a pickup truck, the driver (Benjamin J. Perry as Ben Perry) shouts obscenities and buzzes with his horn. Distracted, he does not notice the obstacle in front and breaks his Porsche. He is quickly freed from debris and taken to hospital. On the way, the Paramedic (Randy Harrington), trying to save him, suggests that he probably won't. Then the ambulance is attacked by a van. The van driver, Jackson (Jim Boke as James F. Bouke) beats up the paramedic and steals the patient. The ambulance driver Harry (Charles Gruber) is not trying to stop him. After the wounded man was put in a van, Jackson turns his attention to Harry, who seems to know each other. Harry asks Jackson not to beat him, because he broke his jaw "for the last time." Jackson hits Harry on the floor and throws a wad of money at him. The film then clearly shows that we are in San Francisco, showing a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge. Sharon Raymond awoke to call her boyfriend Dr. John Hollins (David Allen Brooks) to tell him that his mother Amanda (Kim Hunter), who recently had a heart attack, came to her senses. Hollins works for a company called Geneticell Corporation, rejoices at the news and goes to her. Once there, she asks him to return to her old childhood home in a small town called Shelter Cove and destroy all her notes and experiments, especially Anthony Magazines, which Hollins had never heard of. She also claims that he has a brother. named anthony. Returning to Dzheneticell, Hollins speaks with Dr. Philip Lloyd (Rod Steiger) about his Mother, as they both worked together before they quarreled, and asked him about her research and whether he knew someone named Anthony. He claims that he knows nothing. When Amanda dies after the visit of the sinister Dr. Lloyd, Hollins decides to fulfill his Mother's request and try to find out who Anthony is. During her last funeral respect, a woman named Melissa Left Bridge (Amanda Pace) introduces herself to Hollins and says that after helping her, she was a big fan of his work and Mother’s studies. Since Melissa seems to know so much about her work with mothers, he invites her into the house, as she may be able to help find answers to his various questions. Hollins, Sharon, Melissa and the three technicians, Brad Baxter (Peter Fréchette), Hart Phillips (Timothy Gibbs) and Cindy Russell (Julia Montgomery), as well as a girl with a watermelon (!) Named Nell Valentine (Bunky W, an excellent name that were her parents thinking!?). They immediately get down to business, but they are of little interest. For some reason, no one at this moment thinks to look into the basement, which is as good as something down there, something big, slippery and has many tentacles. First it kills the duke, the dog. Then he moves on to bigger prey. When Hart is attacked by something in the barn, Hollins decides that he must destroy all traces of his Mother’s work and all that Anthony is. Co-sponsored and directed by Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow, Carpenter also acted as a filmmaker and Obrou as a producer. This is a pretty bad movie in my opinion. The script is attributed to five (!) Writers, Carpenter, Obrow, Erl Ghaffari, John Penny and Joseph Stefano, and the five people working on it, I would like to think that they could come up with something a little better and more coherent than this . Nothing is explained so well, why did Amanda create these monstrous hybrids of sea creatures / people? What interests Dr. Lloyd and his motives? Why does he steal the body from the back of the ambulance? Why is he in the basement full of mutants? Why none of these so-called geneticists think to check the basement? Could Melissa act more suspiciously, even if she tried? Why none of the characters have a background? Why do people keep mentioning a substance found in sea creatures, called hemocinin, when 99.9% of the audience has no idea what they are about? There is also a serious shortage of blood and gore; only one person dies on the screen, only one! And all scientists survive in a soft-gagged "happy ending." Guys, this is a horror movie, all we want to see is that slimy monsters kill and eat people in various bloody ways. The one on the death screen is actually quite steep, someone has slippery tentacles inserted under their skin, in their ear and up the nose in the movies - just a decent horror sequence. To try to raise a bitter quote, there is a scene where Dr. Lloyd is experimenting on a leather animal, but it only lasts a few seconds, and in the context of the rest of the film means nothing. Melissa also turns into a fish, do not ask. There is also no nudity, which is not surprising. The film looks quite professional with decent performance, but it is so boring and having fun at the rate of snails that we don’t even see a giant monster in the basement 15 minutes before the end, which is too small lately when it appears, the effects are fine and it is even more embarrassing that it was no longer used. Overall, I was very disappointed and expected much better. A horror film, in which only one film about death and only three films. What happens to the world?
