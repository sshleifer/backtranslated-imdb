Pretentious appetite, renewing Herman Melville (!), About the vaguely incestuous relations of a young man with his aristocratic mother, transferred to his long-lost sister, who was brought up by the Gypsies. Or something like that ?? not that someone really cares to unravel his multi-layered plot of adorned pornographic sex scenes, pseudo-symbolic imagery (brothers and sisters bathing in the river of blood) and other strange touches death - deafening music of a rock group, used in the demolition of old buildings). Given the source material and the presence of Catherine Deneuve (who, at least, bathes in the nude), I expected much more from this; Apparently, is there an even longer TV version of POLA X?
