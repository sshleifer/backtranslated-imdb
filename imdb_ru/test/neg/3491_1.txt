Crash should be a movie about racism in Los Angeles. But in reality, this is just a set of coincidences between several characters that bind each other for one day in one of the largest cities in the world. Who the hell will believe in it? There are unrealistic situations, one after another. On the other hand, this film claims to show racism between Asians, Iranians, Hispanics, blacks and whites. But a big mistake is based on the pre-established racism coming from the author. Mainly because the white characters in this film are usually portrayed as people with better socio-economic status than other races. Iranians are poor, as are Asians. And Latinos, as always, are portrait-like, like housekeepers, policemen, or with very modest work, like a mechanic. Jesus!!! Don't you think it's time to change these stereotypes? Same with black, portrait as gang members, except for the black television director, who was the only new character for me. This film sucks so much that I am very disappointed with the kind of movie theater that comes out of Hollywood these days. Always with stereotypical characters. No realism at all. There is nothing to identify with. Itâ€™s just a big waste, because it would be a great opportunity to show Latin Americans, Koreans, Iranians and Blacks from a different perspective.
