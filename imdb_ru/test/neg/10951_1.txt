First of all, I'm a big fan of shit movies. Grade B is always good for laughs. Unfortunately, this film is just bad. I dressed like a zombie for a party, and my makeup looked better than in this movie. Especially the big guy at the beginning, it looked as if the child had painted it on the face with crayons. <br /> <br /> The game is so bad that I do not need to comment on why. The effect is also extremely amateur, with obvious blood tubes firing a direct stream of blood from the back of a zombie's head when they are shot. <br /> <br /> It seems that many people commenting on this film are trying to increase the rating. No one without their finger in the pie would appreciate this movie above 5/10. Frankly, it is shameful that the people who worked on this film raise their own ratings. <br /> <br /> I suggest everyone to avoid this film, do not spend 90 minutes of their lives. <br /> <Absolutely awful.
