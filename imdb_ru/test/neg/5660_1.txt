First, the acting is so terrible, except for the actor who plays Spencer. Mirinda Cosgrove does not deserve her own show, she must have a stick with Drake and Josh. The only person I like besides Spencer is Nevel Hes Super Bad @ $$ He kicked Carly Crews @ $$ And I liked it <br /> <br /> The episode I hate a lot is Imyourbigesstfan, I hate this young Ikali fan who made me almost kill myself. Fake is a good word to describe it, please do not watch it on TV. Let's all go back to Dag Nick Only the version Please do not look, I hate Ikarly Oh, also Nathan Kress - copycat Fredy Highmore
