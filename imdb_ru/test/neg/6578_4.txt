I love losers. So, 12 years after I first saw Star Trek V and thought it was strangely bad, I gave him the second watch, hoping to find some redeeming quality that I missed the first time. <br /> <br /> I do not. <br /> <br /> The letter is half baked, and although at first the quality of the game is stable enough to keep the film on its feet (albeit shakily), the further we delve into the plot it becomes more stupid. The last quarter of the movie is ridiculous. What was even worse from the original cast was that this was the first ST film released AFTER the franchise returned to TV with Next Generation, and the average episode of Next Generation would have disgraced it * - including special effects! What an embarrassment. <br /> <br /> The last frontier is not quite miserable - I gave it 4 out of 10 - but itâ€™s so much lower than the standard of its predecessors (yes, including the first) that I can only think about seeing it because rate other movies more. <br /> <br /> * unless it is an episode with Troy's mother.
