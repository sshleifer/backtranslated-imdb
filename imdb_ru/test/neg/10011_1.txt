A big disappointment for being advertised as an incredible film. Incredibly bad. Very pretentious. It would be nice if at least once someone created a loud role for a young woman who was not a prostitute. <br /> <br /> We donâ€™t know anything about this character, except that he seems hopelessly an alcoholic. We do not know why. Nicolas Cage turns into a great performance, as usual, but I feel that this role and this script have let him down. And how, after he was unable to perform during the entire film, can he get an erection on his deathbed? Really awful, and I felt like I needed a bath.
