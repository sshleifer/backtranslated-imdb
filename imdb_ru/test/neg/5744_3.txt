These are some vampires (who can run in the sun) that cause some problems in South America. Casper Van Dien heads off with his commando team to investigate. The film begins with the fact that Van Ding and Co. go through the jungle, and there is this huge black guy who simply cannot act absolutely positively. He says all his lines as if he was reading them for the first time from a cue card. His voice is also so low that, well, it's really fun. Great way to start a movie! Somehow, they run into some of our vampires, shoot them (it makes them seem dying for about 20 seconds), and then, of course, they come back to life. Wang Ding notices that one of them pierced a tree branch, and shouts to his friends to kill them with firewood. You need to see that in tricks you have to believe - vampires on wires that pull them up through the trees, which should make them look like they can climb very easily, but it just makes them look like they are jumping on a bungee shoe or something like that. <br /> <br /> Yes ... anyway, later, a huge black dude lives in South America with some guys (not including Van Ding), and more vampires attack them. It’s too bad that these guys have never heard of a crossbow, because it’s the seemingly perfect weapon to kill small bloodsuckers, but instead they use big old wooden stakes with which they try to pierce vampires by hand. The big black dude eventually gets captured, and eventually he becomes some big influential vampire leader. Wang Ding eventually fights him later. It does not help, that throughout the film, everybody forgets that if you shoot a vampire, they will be knocked out for 20 seconds or so, which will make it quite easy for a person to bet on them. They are simply trying to stick stakes in the middle of hand-to-hand combat. Yes, not quite a brilliant tactic. <br /> <br /> There is a hot beauty (remember Veronica from the Lost World TV show? Yes, this is her!), who also strolls through the center of the Vampire district on some research mission, and she is also a former wife of Van Dien. Hey, what are the chances? It is a pity that she is not in the film much more than it is. Can she and Casper get back together at the end? Can Van Ding defeat a huge black guy who can't act? Will circus artist vampires make you laugh in all the many scenes? Do we hear the music of three puppets, when someone does something funny? Even Linda Carter forgot how to behave in her little cameo (she is more convincing in her Sleep Number Bed commercials)? Answers to these and other questions will be given if you get to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> I don’t know, maybe he will score a few points, so this is a bad scale, but that's about it. Oh, a bunch of fools in the jungle, probably, this is funny.
