What can you expect from a direct DVD movie? You know what you're getting into when you rent it. The quality of cinematography reminds me of a reality show. <br /> <br /> Why are they always so close to the actors!? And why are they always in the center? There is nothing to look at. (And the actors look so great, so it's awesome.) The letter and the dialogue is just awful. This opening scene with a British guy is funny. Just try to listen to these words, they hardly have any meaning, they just walk in circles. The lines in the rest of the film sound as if they were drawn from novels and science fiction novels, as if the authors had no idea what they were doing. The characters definitely sound like they donâ€™t understand what they are talking about. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie. I feel bad for the actors attached to this project. Shame on you
