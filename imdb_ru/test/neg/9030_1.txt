Well, I've watched over 100 Trome movies, and some of them are pretty bad. "Sizzle Beach U.S.A." it was terrible, and “I was a teen television terrorist” was not available to watch, but this is the worst movie in the Tromy library! <br /> <br /> A group of women are jailed and tortured in an attempt to escape. <br /> <br /> This is really awful. Even when maintenance films are on. Doris Wishman and Hershall Gordon Lewis would probably kill the director if they saw this bad excuse for a cult film. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br />
