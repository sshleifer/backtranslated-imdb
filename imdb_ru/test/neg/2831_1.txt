First of all, this is one of the worst soft-core "erotic thrillers" I've ever seen in my life. Of course, like all erotic thrillers that they want to do, this is a brothel, madam, and is in a brothel. This, of course, makes erotic sex, which appears every 10 minutes, seem “in context”. Howbeit. <br /> <br /> For a moment, forget that it never meant winning awards. The actors are terrible, and their reading of the lines made me cringe. A woman who plays a female police officer is so bad that she cannot be described. She must be a really very good friend of the guys who put on the film for this terrible adventure, if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> The cost of production is only slightly higher than porn. Besides? I suppose if you are really drunk and you need to laugh at something, it would be a perfect movie. And if so, I recommend rewinding all the scenes with a female police officer. What is this accent Brooklyn? Fun!
