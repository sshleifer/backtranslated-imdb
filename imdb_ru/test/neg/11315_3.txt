Give the director Stanley Tonga from Super Cop of Jackie Chan and Rumble in the Bronx, and what do you get? You get a series of kung fu battles and no craziness like the Magician. <br /> <br /> On a limited storyline, Magu (Leslie Nielsen) is placed in an international storyline, where he steals a world famous stone. Of course, he has no idea what he is doing. In fact, he has no idea that he has a gem. <br /> <br /> In thirty minutes you will be very bored watching this. Although there are some very funny moments, for example, when he cooks a chicken. You wish you were as shortsighted as Magu. This is a funny movie, but it's a disaster! You have to love Leslie Nilsson because he made some very funny movies. It is not in his power, but he plays well in Magu. I thought it was a funny movie and should be recommended to young children, because they are likely to think that it is very funny.
