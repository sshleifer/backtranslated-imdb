This should be considered one of the greatest failures of Cinema. At that time I was wandering around Europe, and I was fortunate enough to stumble upon a film crew making this film in a place that even then was one of the most idyllic, unspoilt places in the world. I was enrolled as an extra, and what followed was an exhibition of modern promiscuity of the day. Forget all the accusations you have ever heard of Peter Mayallaâ€™s invasions of this rare piece of French life - Jeff Reeve and his associates indignantly took on the restaurant in Les Beaux, which left the master sluggish with distrust. They were just awful, uncultured and did not deserve French hospitality.
