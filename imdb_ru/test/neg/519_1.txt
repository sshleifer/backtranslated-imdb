This film should be there with Ed Wood films. Awful script and bad bad game. <br /> <br /> Machine-gun battle in front of flat glass windows; Minutes pass before someone is hit, and no one hides - no window has ever broken. One might think that after a shootout such a big U-Haul truck could be pierced, not a scratch. <br /> <br /> CIA agents and government contractors = shout = Secret information at a party with hundreds of people around. <br /> <br /> There is no such actor you care about; all small and mostly unattractive. <br /> <br /> A Hawaiian flight 747 takes off from Los Angeles and falls twenty minutes later in the Pacific "... 100 feet of water ...". It takes a short time when the flight attendant announces to five other passengers that they have only two hours left of the flight; at 747? <br /> <br /> Rescue teams appear the next day, and surprisingly, six passengers are still alive. <br /> <br /> A movie that starts off mediocre and gets worse and worse. <br /> <br />
