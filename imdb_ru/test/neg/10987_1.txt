I hated it. I hate self-conscious pretentious insanity that disguises itself as art. This film is either stupid stupid or stupid stupid. After the first half hour, I quickly looked through the DVD version and again and again saw the same minor Shennangangans. I got angry because I spent my hard-earned money on a sofomorian trap. Tinting in sepia or blue does not make the film something, not to mention art.
