It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. The letter and acting is just pathetic. With Uncle Sam, he was on the list of the worst films of all time. However, when I see how this shit can do this on video, it really inspires me to pursue my wild dreams of making films, because I know I can do a better job than what the Killers did.
