I donâ€™t know how expensive this film was, but the effects were terrible. Half of the film was shot on the stage before the film (I am sure that the blue box will not look so artificial). When they traveled by boat, the background canvas moved, imitating the movement of the waves, but the characters did not move. CGI effects: awful (I'm not sure, but I think the effect was created using Paint and created a GIF sequence of them - the next time the creators should hire a professional CGI team). It seems that the creator of CGI would draw on the strip of the image with shaking hands. Awful, that's for sure. When I first saw the trailer, I thought that it was created in 1983. One of my friends told me the correct date: 2005. My jaw dropped, I was so shocked that I thought he was joking. People, I recommend you skip this movie, the story is also distorted, you will not like it.
