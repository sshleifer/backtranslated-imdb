This is such a complete failure that I got angry. <br /> <br /> All the subtleties and structure of Reggio’s early films have disappeared, leaving nothing but a hash of digitally spread images, the sole purpose of which seems to be “whining”. The bad things that people do. How can you see wormhole graphics, similar to Star Trek, colored seascapes in slow motion, a plurality of obviously fake computer icons and sports events, which, by the way, show that no one has ever been able to surpass (or even compare) Leni Riefenstahl Shooting bodies in motion, edited with video overlay, which the producer of Doctor Who would reject in the 1980s as "too stupid", complementing the controversy against "civilized violence"? There is no intellectual, emotional or visceral connection between these images, collected and modified by Reggio, and too many digital effects masters, as well as the warning story I suppose he wanted to create. With all the “dramaturgic consultants” involved, it seems no one has pulled out of his head his own sense of “saying something important” and thought that they all might not say something new. <br /> <br /> Only people who watch TV too much can make such a film and believe that it makes sense; This is the kindergarten of Stana Brackheig, and ultimately he is ruthless in his ruthless evidence. The only irony and tension evident here (unlike Koyaanisqatsi, where the uncompromising beauty and the strangeness of time-altered ordinary images made you think about their meaning) was when the DVD that I watched was jammed and missed. This is MTV for the Noam Chomsky crowd, based on a reflex, not on reflection and meaningless. Two stars for music that is in the best style of pomo-Cesar Franck Glass and has some passionate cello from Yo-Yo Ma. (For his sake, I hope he didn’t need to record his parts to play the movie; there are some things you don’t need to do even for salary.)
