I am also a fan of the House Party ... House Party I am my favorite movie of all time. House Party 4 is a shame for all HP and for Kid n Play ... It was supposed to be part of a series actually ... in this film or in a film with other veterans, nothing was said about the child. the child was probably too old to show the movie “Home Party”, because he seemed to be focused on teenagers ... but the child can play at least a cameo ... you can tell how good he is, he didn’t even get to the cinema. Immature was in House Party 3, so it made sense to continue the legacy ... but they should have been right ... they should have left it at House Party 3. I am 27 years old, and I have watched House Party I since 11, when she came out in 1990 (16 years ago), and since then I have been a fan of her. When I first saw House Party 4, I was like what they really think ... There was nothing familiar about this film that could compare with the previous 3 films ... I thought it was black Ferris Bueller weekend.
