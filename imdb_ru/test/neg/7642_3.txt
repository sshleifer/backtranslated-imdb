I’m surprised at the number of people who rated this record as their favorite "Chan" (didn’t they ever see "... in Opera" or "... on Treasure Island?" - the latter ironically wrote John Larkin, who threw the ball here). This plot is a train wreck overloaded with meaningless characters. First, viewers should recall the grim details of the murder of Stephen McBirney (played by the venerable gangster and HUAC writer Mark Lawrence) in 1929. Let's not forget that he escaped the rap deaths in the courthouse with a lone cop on his tail. There is also a victim that was caught from the river 11 years ago, about which no one ever worried. Then there is the disbelief suspension required when all the characters seem trapped in the wax museum (although Inspector O'Matheus manages to pull his fat wet rear end in through the window). Why is Joan Valerie (as Creme's assistant) in this film? She can't even handle pliers correctly - I understand that Chan suffers from the same boo-boo, yes, he is 66 years old here - (and he has less than 10 lines), and her character’s motivation is too weak to ever be - I apologized (sorry, when I speak, I write like Ricky Ricardo). The character Mary Bolton (Margarita Chapman) is written as a passionate, idiotic moron, apparently existing only for Hordog's useless romantic interest, lawyer Tom Agnew (played by Ted Osborne with a ferret face). Why is Willie Fern a character? Why can't Minion McBirney press the switch at 8:20? (not a spoiler, ok?!). IQ lint, which he manages to dress, or why he did not set foot in front of the bus many years ago. Tolera himself is given a little more acting rope than usual (plus), and real glory goes to set designer Thomas Little. until it is amazed at how a toothpick can be used as a pistol.
