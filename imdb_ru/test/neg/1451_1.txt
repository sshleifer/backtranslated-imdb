I first watched this film a few weeks ago, and it was probably one of the most boring, unfunny films I've ever seen. First, Matthew Modin is a terrible actor, and he destroyed most of the film, and the plot is too stupid. The only reason he starred in the film was because of Alec Baldwin, and his character was quickly eliminated. If you are not a Michel Fieffer fan, you should avoid this movie like the plague. Many people cannot praise this film enough, but I just cannot understand what people think is so awesome. If this is supposed to be the black humor that makes this film so awesome, then I think everything can be a comedy these days.
