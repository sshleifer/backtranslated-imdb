Maybe here, in Sydney, we all sway, and as a result we get the opportunity to go with the flow, as it is in hell, in class theaters. Released here in 1980, this fun drama, consisting of all pitches, was greeted with screams of delight at the session I attended. In fact, the audience was so passionate about the funny tricks on the screen that they played like a Rocky Horror session. Within 5 minutes, we all knew that this was a real disaster: the scene of a tugboat, where you can see buckets of water dropped from the offset. after that, it was every patron for himself, and the movie called with the council, welcoming the bad game and reaction of oo-waah. The skirmish in the hold among the boxes is particularly idiotic and allows drunken viewers with friends in altered states to also watch the relevant contribution. I call these films with Michael Kane his films for a holiday home, because I always think that he agrees to shoot them, because he saw the house he likes and does not want to spend his savings. Like Jaws 3 or 4 or whatever it was called.
