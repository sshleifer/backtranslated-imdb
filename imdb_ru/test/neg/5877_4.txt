You can see that if the film is not directed by his brother, this is the best thing he can do. And, unfortunately, his best simply do not cut it. “Ice Cream” is a very strange horror film, and it’s a real blast if you're in the right mood. In the wrong mood, as you know, it makes people violently lash out at their loved ones, so please watch carefully. <br /> <br /> Clint Howard plays a pivotal role (although does Clint Howard really play something?) “evil”, “psychotic” “weird” (yes, all in quotes, he is not exactly one of them, but it is approaching), an ice cream man who tortures local children with the help of bomb blasts that really melt, and ice cream that people and dogs cut into them. Ick <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot is actually just an excuse to show ... well, ... well, this is the plot. Oh wait, I know! This is a reason to boast all the cameos of the unlucky actor! There are Ian Michael Vincent and Lee Major's II (continued?), In which the policemen track down the elusive ice cream. And even Dag Lleiveln appears as a supermarket seller. <br /> <br /> Even better than some weird nonsense in a movie. I really like the fact that for some reason, instead of hiring a fat actor to play the unfortunate fat guy from the band, they just make this one child wear a lining under his clothes. And the whole premise that someone will get ice cream balls from ice cream. Who buys ice cream from ice cream? Then there is the whole scene of the psychiatric ward in which the acting skills of Ian Michael Vincent range from moderately interested to bored beyond the state of consciousness. These are the policemen who also search the Ice Cream site for evidence, but they manage to completely mask the ice cream cart (where, of course, various bodies and the like are stored). Well, good luck next time, troops. <br /> <br /> Howard himself replays, as if trying so that people in two cities can see and hear him. This is all just stupid. And it's pretty fun to laugh in the good tradition of The Pumaman or Gymkata. You'll laugh GOOD with the right sense of HUMOR. I like it. <br /> <br />
