This is probably the most unattractive film I've ever seen. I watched this because I have a weak spot for Leon (everything else that Besson did was just awful, in my opinion, except for the script for Wasabi) and Jean Reno. This is testimony to how bad this film is, that Reno, one of the most charismatic and unconstrained actors (admittedly, he is just starting here), cannot make this film or the moments in which it is on the screen available for viewing. br /> <br /> Everything is very cinematic: black and white, without dialogue, people do things for no apparent reason, people chase each other while they are haunted by a shaky camera. And, as expected, none of them is interesting. <br /> <br /> This is not “French Mad Max”, as some people claim (actually, I think they mean “Mad Max 2”) - this is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that Both films have a post-apocalyptic setting, and this is just the comment that you expect from someone who does not know what this is about. Mad Max 2 pulsed, Mad Max 2 was exciting, Mad Max 2 was worth your time - Le Dernier Combat came to nothing. <br /> <br /> I know it's cool to love artistic black and white. White French films and not less cool to say that you saw in them something that other people did not see (or did you manage to live through it without feeling drowsiness), so I would not trust anyone who claims that he likes Le Dernier Combat, because I do not see anything of value in this; he asks so much and returns nothing. After about five minutes I left him, and he was never able to get my full attention back. Anyone who can get through this without distraction is not a person or, at best, a psychotic. (Actually, they are probably just trying to look cool.)
