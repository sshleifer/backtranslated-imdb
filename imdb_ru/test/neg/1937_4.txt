Reading the comments of other users, the A666333 review voiced most of what I felt in this predictable storyline of the movie, the cliche of lesbian / heterosexual versions (that is, a straight woman becomes a lesbian when she concludes that her husband is cruel and aggressive). <br /> <br /> Also, the score was deeply disappointing. It was soft, soft, sentimental elevator music - another common cliche in lesbian films. There would be some interesting dramatic moments in the film if they were not destroyed by music. <br /> <br /> Several scenes related to sex and eroticism also struck me as attempts to play and raise the shock value, including parts of the final scene of the performance. The usual “hot and steamy” moments were as boring as the overly sentimental ones. For example, during a scene in the pool, women kiss, and then the camera shows along the abandoned glass, flowing water, the sound of their heavy breathing over the soft roar of the waves. <br /> <br /> The only elements I liked were the costume and the fragrances. They are well-placed, and the development of attraction between the two characters was felt very naturally during the training scenes. I sincerely smiled during those and during the last scene with the policeman. But they were not enough to balance the negatives or make me enjoy this movie.
