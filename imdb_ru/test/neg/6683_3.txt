I missed it in the movie, but was always a bit forced. Found it in a trash can in my local video store for a measly two dollars! Will I now give it to anyone who wants? Probably! No focused plot, one-dimensional characters, the plastic world, ripped off from many much better films, about any worthy dialogue about which one could speak. Do you know this empty feeling when you leave ecstasy? This feeling is right here. Sadly, Australia, which I know is moving in this direction, with the exception of melodrama and simple answers. It's only interesting to see old Australian actors (who had to ACT back to their day to get by) against newer Australian actors (who should look GOOD to get through). Like some terrible narrative introduction to a video clip that never began ... Poor Kylie also began her acting career ...
