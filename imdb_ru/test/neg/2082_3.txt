The Greek language for some parts of the film was very beautiful, and the photo received all of my voices, and this is about the same as my roar for this film. I found that all the characters were narcissistic archetypes that are so common in American culture and were superficial and uninteresting. Susan Sarandon and Gena Rowlands are easy to watch, but I find their characters very narcissistic and incredible for many other reasons. When Gene Rowlands sings at a party, it surprises me how this woman can think of herself as a competent star of the scene. I felt like pressing the MUTE button until she finished singing. Molly Ringwald was herself, and the character of Raul Julia was so depraved that he was completely creepy. The film was too long in my opinion, and I could not watch it again, even at gunpoint.
