I don’t think I’ve ever given a 1/10 rating, but this one easily gets a denomination. It's hard for me to just listen to one of his jokes. It's not just that the jokes are so bad, but also in combination with the fact that Carson Daily has zero charisma, can't set up or finish the highlight, and you have a late-night comedy recipe that really turns your stomach. <br /> <br /> I watched the show, but not completely, but still many times. It only sneaks up on me after Conan. I usually watch one or two minutes to find out if Carson daily is the worst talk show host ever. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you have ever seen him interview the guest, it’s just an interview. I'm so sorry every time he has a guest, and their embarrassed smiles try to disguise their body language, which shouts: “Get me out of this freak!” I recommend watching the show not to laugh, but to think how he got aired and what else is he doing there? Watch as much as you can, I think you will find his complete awkwardness ... interesting.
