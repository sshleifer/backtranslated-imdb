That this movie has such a low IMDb rating is not surprising. In our era after Enron, do we really need more reminders of America’s obsession with greed? The topic has become so politically charged that many viewers will not only not be entertained by films of this kind, but they will also respond with barely veiled anger. That was all I could do to calmly sit in this cinematic memorandum of corporate corruption, without removing the DVD and not breaking it into thousands of pieces. <br /> <br /> What is really tiring in such films, including “Goal,” is their pretense that there is some meaningful message behind the brilliance that makes the film worthwhile. In "Target" I did not find such a meaningful message. What I did find was a story that idolized the materialistic attributes of capitalist power and wealth. The two main characters, nauseous in their manner, do very little real work. Instead, they organize parties, play golf, demonstrate their composure, they sound "fashionable" in a dialogue directly from the MTV culture: "swing my world" and "Now go back to the parties; this is order." John is smug, self-assured, shallow and grins a lot. Robert, who wears funny little glasses, is even worse. <br /> <br /> Two young garage fans are participating in the film, who look and sound like they are directly from the film Antitrust Law (2001). Stereotypes are played out for all those who stand, and this film also presents smart computer equipment, as well as Barbie puppet chicks when our future billionaires who demand success need to relax a bit after all these hard parties. And with the help of images and dialogues indicating the time that is needed for such a story, can you imagine how dated this film will be in fifteen years? <br /> <br /> What can I do for this cinematic celluloid waste? let's say that it has some nice aerial views of San Francisco. The film would be much more enjoyable, much more exciting, if they had thrown away these disgusting characters and this disgusting story and just took us to the audience on this small plane for the duration of the movie.
