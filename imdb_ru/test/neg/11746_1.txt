Well, firstly, who in his right mind would remake Hitchcock, and secondly, who would do it shot after shot? I admit that I was not going to watch this film for precisely this reason. The original film “Psycho” is one of my favorite movies in history, and it looked like a humiliating photocopy of it. I watched it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it with the original, and we both agreed that this shit was not even five minutes away, as it was terrible. At first, as already mentioned, they made it shot after shot. Where is originality? Why remake a film that is almost perfect, just the way it was done the first time? Why redo such a movie to start? If you're going to redo something, redo something that doesn't work, and make it BETTER! <br /> <br /> Secondly, they used the exact same scenario from the 1960 version. The dialogue no longer works. It works great and sounds perfect for the 1960 version, but it seems strange and unnatural from contemporary actors. Why not refresh the dialogue? Hitch did not write the script, you could rewrite. <br /> <br /> This film had a very good talent, and they were wasted imitating the original actors. The actor who played the car salesman seemed like he was just playing the role of John Anderson as the car salesman in the original. It seemed that all the actors, the only direction they were given, were the heroes from the original film. Vince Vaughn may have seemed a bit more creepy than Anthony Perkins, but at the same time you lose the sympathy you must have for Norman. Norman was masturbating, watching Marion undress, go too far and lose the innocence of a character I think Tony Perkins captured so well in his performance. Viggo Mortensen’s accent was annoying, and Rita Wilson was too old to play Caroline. Her lines sounded desperate, not just young and funny, like Patricia Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I saw in the film is that Gus Van Sant was able to open the film with a shot that Hitch had in mind. Hitch wanted to open one long shot over Phoenix, but could not at that time, so he had to agree to a series of shots crossed together. This film embodies this vision with a shot of a helicopter walking through a hotel window. After this, the film became a waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> If you are wondering how to destroy a wonderful movie, watch it, but NOT under what circumstances watch it, BEFORE you watch the original. This is a faded photocopy of the original, which should never have shone with a green light. Stick to the movie master, not an imitation.
