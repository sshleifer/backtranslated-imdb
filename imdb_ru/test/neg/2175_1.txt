This painfully boring and unfunny film made me think that Chaplin was a real Hitler, since only such an evil person as he could torment people with this prank. I saw this film remastered, which only increased the suffering caused by this atrocity. This film is nothing more than a pathetic, repetitive film that, instead of a two-hour laugh, evokes two hours of suicidal urges. After the first 10 minutes, I began to want gas to leak from the speakers of the theater. <br /> <br /> If I could give him zero out of ten, I would gladly do it. Avoid at all costs!
