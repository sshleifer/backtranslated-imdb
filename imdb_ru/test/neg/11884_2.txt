My wife and I could not even finish the film. Truth be told, it was pretty painful. <br /> <br /> First, historical authenticity is threatened not so much by the events themselves, as by the ridiculous one-dimensionality of the characters. For example, Augustus takes the "burden" of power only with great reluctance. In fact, he is portrayed as if he was some great humanist and supporter of democracy. <br /> <br /> Secondly, camp! My lord, the dialogue is terribly bad. I remember the show that my mom watched when I was a kid, and he had a better dialogue than this one. Permanent exposure and grating on the ears, like nails on the board. Ugh. (Well, I'm exaggerating a little, but the dialogue is really bad.) The HBO series “Rome” is superior for some other reason, except that its characters were at least plausible, regardless of their historicity. <br /> <br /> Rome is also wise enough to know that they cannot put on epic battle scenes. The creators of this film did not. When Caesar attacks Mound, the scene of the battle is almost farsi. <br /> <br /> I admit that the costumes are very good. The sets are nice, although their CGI backgrounds can sometimes be a bit unpleasant. The sound is bad, albeit from the point of view of music, and recklessness, and the sounding of so many minor characters. <br /> <br /> In any case, renting is not worth it. As a major in history, I was hoping for an alternative approach to Augustus rather than Rome HBO, which, I think, could not reflect his general “feeling” as well as Caesar or Antony. Instead, I had to just stick to my reading.
