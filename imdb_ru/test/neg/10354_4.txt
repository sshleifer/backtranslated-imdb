I'm from Australia and I love the show, I didn't expect much from the American version of Kat and Kim, but I thought I would watch the first episode to see if that was really so bad. <br /> <br /> Well what can I say. This is nothing special. Selma Blair is fine, like Kim, and she had a few good features, although Molly Shannon is not a very good Kat. The good thing about Kate Jane Turner is that when she speaks with all her funny accents (for example, when she speaks Humor or Hum), it sounds like it's just the natural way she talks, but when Shannon does emphasis, It is clear that she is acting and trying to be the same as Turner. And the show really lacks Sharon or someone else to give us something to laugh at, because the characters of Cal and Craig in this version are really not funny. <br /> <br /> So far, only the first episode has been aired, and this is clearly not in line with the standards of the Australian version, although if it were a separate television show with a different name, without comparing it with the Australian version, it might be a little it is better. But if there’s nothing else to do on Sunday evening (or on Thursday evening in America), then you won’t be able to hurt watching, or it’s better to wear some Australian version if you have one.
