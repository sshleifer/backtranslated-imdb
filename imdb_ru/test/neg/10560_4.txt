As a professional poker dealer for over 25 years, it was very difficult for me to watch this movie. Too unreal. It seems that the producers of this film either did little research or were not interested at all. Tricks with cards are something that you will never see in a real poker game. Common sense right? Plus it was full of movie cuts and such during tricks. Who could not do this? Cheating was an amateur affair. Palming, tagged cards, etc. Will you sit in a high-limit game where they use open decks? Will you sit in a game where players insert their chips into the middle of the pot (constantly), mixing them up, and then just voicing how much they bet? C'MON ! I gave him 4 because the turns might be interesting for some people, but for those who know how to play the game, it will be quite painful. Next time they have to use real players and get an idea of ​​how to do it right. Oh !!!
