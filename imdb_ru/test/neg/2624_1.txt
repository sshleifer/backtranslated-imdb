Lazy film shot by a lazy director. The characters are grotesque. Despite the tragedy of this war, there is no emotion in the film. Symbolism is artificial and ineffective (and the old Bosnian woman, giving Arbor a photo of her son, "specifies" her readiness, wakes the super mother sleeping in her, the corpse eaten by worms to show the horror of genocide ... too much worse than not enough ). <br /> <br /> This film is just an advertisement, an empty elegy for a woman who is not a hero. She worked for the UN. Remember that the UN has failed to protect civilians in Srebrenica. Who are the real heroes of this war? Canadian judge conducting a post-mortem trial of atrocities, which occurred mainly because her organization could not prevent them? Where is the criticism in this film?
