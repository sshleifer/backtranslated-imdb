That's all I can say about this movie. This is DBZ ... like the Tree of Might and The Strongest in the world, in fact ... it doesn't fit into the timeline for the show at all, although it is supposedly placed just before the beginning of the series. The action is pretty good overall. The plot has a reasonably good base, with a good background setting out why these guys hate each other and all that. In general, not bad ... The problem is that there are a lot of really strange things. I mean, really weird stuff. Like The Strongest in the world, this song is really a very strange song that could only be created in a haze caused by drugs ... it is disturbing that Gohan while himself singing is pretty much intoxicated. Terribly. The villains are strange and quite comical ... more than the usual type of DBZ - it looks more like it was made like a Dragon Ball movie, and not like Dragon Ball Z. In general, quite entertaining, but ... simple. .. strange.
