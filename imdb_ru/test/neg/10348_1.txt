Do I need to say more? The reason that the GOOD Australian version of Kat and Kim was, as already mentioned, good, was that it was funny original. The reason why this new version released in America is so terrible is that a lot of it is taken directly from the original. Not to mention the infidelity of the characters. Kat is meant to be a dag. Kim must be fat. Cel (or Phil, as he was christened) must be pitiful. Brett (or Craig) is a loser, not a person who behaves as if he were taking heroin and completing every “dude” sentence. Thank God that Shubansky did not sell her rights to Sharon, she will probably end up becoming the tall, thin blonde Kim loves. <br /> <br /> Kat and Kim - MOTHER AND DAUGHTER. They are not meant to look 2 years apart. And they are not meant to giggle like schoolgirls. This show is a shame even under the same name of the Australian version. America: Get your own TV shows.
