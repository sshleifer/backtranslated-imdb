New Year 2006, and I watch Glimmer Man again. Tell me what you like, I thought the movies were funny Stephen Seagal. Like many comments, good combat sequences - I especially liked his answer to a phone call in a restaurant, telling how long it would be closed for recovery. A bit like Schwarzenegger's humor in earlier action films - although this is usually self-deprecating. <br /> <br /> But I like Brian Cox here. One of the most versatile actors around. Regret for his arm and leg, but so much that he endured a long interrogation - he must have flunked this class on the “farm”. <br /> <br /> As the films continued, I wondered how Seagal's constantly thickened grip reflected on his movement. It doesn't matter, it's fun!
