I had to write a review of this film, based on those who say horror, nonstop action, a great film. <br /> <br /> These people obviously watched another movie. Killpoint, frankly, sucks from the word "go" !! I kept waiting and waiting for this film to get better, and it was to no avail. Some said that the film was cruel, while others said it was terrible, but I can't find any of those adjectives that actually appear in it, I mean, damn it, there are so many scenes with people who are shot, and in general without blood it is not even funny! ! I think that the best way to summarize is probably to evaluate PG by 1984 standards, and now, in 2010, there is no doubt that it will be PG! Bad, BAD NOT in a funny, funny, "B", diverse film !!
