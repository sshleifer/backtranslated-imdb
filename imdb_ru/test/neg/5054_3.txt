This absurd film told about the teenage girl "Goodie-two-shoes", who really wanted to be a farewell, but finds her own obstacle in the name of the teacher, Mrs. Tingle. Katie Holmes, who plays this “dog with two shoes,” is faced with “the biggest dilemma in her teenage life,” when her classmate comes in with the final sample of the exams, which should help them pass the test of Mrs. Tingle. Mrs. Tingle arrives, catches Holmes, a classmate and her best friend, for a sample of her final exam. Convinced that all three were planning to deceive the exam here, Mrs. Tingle is encouraged by her ability to once and for all destroy Holmes with charges that can deprive Holmes of the chances of passing the lesson. And the classmate, who obviously was following Holmes, was always wondering why she never gave him the time of day (he is an idiot)? Feeling despair, Holmes and her friends visit Mrs. Tingle in the middle of the night to try to dissuade her from believing that Holmes was going to deceive. All this for some reason lights a fire when a classmate directs a bow and arrow at Mrs. Tingle, threatening her to do everything right for Holmes. Mrs. Tingle resists, but ultimately turns out to be Holmes and her friend's prisoner. <br /> <br /> During Mrs. Tingle being held captive by Holmes, they do everything from tying her up and tying her mouth in her own bed, to blackmail her with false photos of an unconscious trainer that they took in bed with Mrs Tingle. I felt myself cringing when the children feel at home in Mrs. Tingle’s house, eat her food and do private work. At some point, Holmes found the book of assessments of Mrs. Tingle and intentionally changed the assessment in her favor, reducing the assessment of her call for goodbye. The end was played out as a childish attempt to bring back the comedy, which was modest at the beginning of the film, solving pure irony, farce and absurdity. <br /> <br /> This must be the most unpleasant and evil evil character of Holmes will play all his life. I wanted to help Mrs. Tingle break free to really dig a grave for Holmes. She was manipulative, selfish and cunning. She even slept with a classmate, despite the great interest of her best friend ... and she did not like him. From trying to spoil her rivals' grades by grabbing Mrs. Tingle's gradebook, to taking the man’s best friend, you think that Holmes will get what she deserves in the end, right? Unfortunately, she gets everything your heart desires, showing that evil, manipulative, selfish, and whining can give you what you want. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Tingle was supposed to be the character you didn't like. They never brought me to the point of believing that she was the woman who needed to be “taught in this lesson.” She was, like any other strict teacher, who even gave good reasons for her indignation towards the next generation. Personally, I felt that her opinion about young people each time was confirmed by the actions of Holmes and her friend. I continued to hope that she would be able to call the police and score Holmes. They kept her in bed, ate her like a bunch of pigs, drank the woman's wine, mixed with her personal belongings, and we believe that she did not deserve to take a bat to each of them. head? And a classmate must be one of the most disliked characters in the history of the film. Forget the idiot, we need a new word for it, which is not in the Webster dictionary. He brought great trouble into the life of Hill, and then aggravated the situation when Mrs. Tingle, uninvited behind Holmes, entered the house and drove Mrs. Tingle with a bow and arrow. I was delighted every time Mrs. Tingle got a chance to hit him or strangle the best friend of the actress. <br /> <br /> If you are a teenager and want to see when a teenager is being manipulated and wrong actions can force his or her world, see this unfunny, caricature-filled, unintentional noir film.
