This is one of those strange, self-indulgent, indulgent films that is trying too hard to be deep. This is not true. Instead, he spews cliches that try to pass for Profundity. Typical is the scene in which Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to the protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwyer Brown) how a man begins to breastfeed, then sucks the breast of his girlfriend and, finally, his wife, resulting in the conclusion that life sucks, So deep. We are considered by various characters who offer their views on life, the universe, etc. During Adam's journeys through the Mojave Desert on foot. (He suddenly leaves LA on his wedding day, and his family, friends and fianc√© assume that he is dead when his car was found in a military training ground broken by a rocket.) Some characters are more interesting than others. The best today is a fugitive from a psychiatric hospital who speaks only the voices of others. The actor, James Kevin Ward, makes great impressions, including Nicholson, Popeye and several characters from the original Star Trek. But as soon as the interesting characters leave the screen, we are again stuck with Adam and his deep aspiration. This is a long journey that stretches in many places. In fact, this is the longest movie and a half hours I've ever seen. And the final hardly makes you think about it at all. <br /> <br /> I discovered that this movie once played on HBO, waking up too early and clicking on TV. It will teach me. Next time I will try to sleep.
