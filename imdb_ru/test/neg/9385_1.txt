THANK YOU GOD, YOU HERE hurts, positive hurts. The name is appropriate, in a sense, if it is intended for a large studio audience that is paid for laughing, as if they are watching the second coming of the Marx brothers. And trust me, they get paid. <br /> <br /> Despite my creativity, as in the entertainment industry, I refuse to believe that the leadership of NBC truly believes in this turkey. Rather, I think THANKS GOD THAT HERE HERE - this is what you all get who have not watched or appreciated the STUDIO 60, who previously decorated the peacock network at night. You want to raise your nose on the calf, alright. Here are some wonderful Alpo straight from Menu Foods for you to stroll.
