A girl named Isobel becomes obsessed with a demon. The local priest (who had previously met with his sister Isobel) must try to save her, but the big problems are related to the family’s suspicions of each other, and not the demon in their daughter. <br /> <br /> This film was made by Ethan. Wiley, House Writer and House II Writer / Director. I liked the first movie, and the second one I liked even more, so you would think that this would be a winner. Alas, this one looks like it was gathered by freshmen. Dawson Lehry could do better. I was thinking of blaming the new writer Ellary Eddie, especially because the idea was hardly original (are they trying to make money on Emily Rose Exiles?), But Wiley should have been able to work miracles. <br /> In addition, you would like to think that horror veterans Jeffrey Combs and James Russo will help in this film. Rousseau (the playing bishop) barely appears, and Combs plays the great role of the sheriff ... for the five minutes he is on the screen (but I love the mustache). So there is no help. <br /> <br /> After watching The Exorcist, all other exorcist films should be compared with classic ones by default, shouldn’t they? And the demonic obsession in this film was not scary to say the least. No dizzying or paranormal activity at all. Just a girl with a deep voice and liquid makeup. All the "demonic" things were centered around the father, blaming everyone for sleeping with his wife. As another reviewer wrote, “You have a lot of Isobel jumping on her bed, like it's a trampoline, hiding in her closet and jumping from the shed. Yes, this is Chuck E. Cheese is crazy. " This, unfortunately, sums up the scale of the “evil” in this film. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie about family members who are making accusations and shouting at each other while your obsessed daughter is sitting in another room, the camera is a movie for you. But, if you don't mind my saying, you have terrible taste in the film, if that's what you are looking for. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to be focused on the father blaming the cowboy for sleeping with his wife (who didn’t sleep but sleeping with her daughter) and the vet was sleeping with his wife (who could but denies this). And then you have a gardener who attacks a possessed girl with a crucifix and tells the family to call the exorcist, but as soon as the priest comes, the gardener declares that he does not believe in God. What was a Bible quote you did five minutes ago? <br /> <br /> A horrible film about exorcism. Terrible examples of what Combs and Rousseau are capable of. And such a sad show of direction after the film series “The House” has become a classic. I would like to pretend that Wiley was not involved in the creation of this shameful derivative and non-original, not inspired film. The power of Christ makes you avoid this film, as if watching it was a mortal sin.
