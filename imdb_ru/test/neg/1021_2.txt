The Southern Cross, written and directed by James Beckett, is a waste of celluloid and acting effort. A formula film is not necessarily bad if it lives up to its promise that this film does not make. This is a tedious mixture of film fragments that can be traced to thousands of different films from the past. It is full of random and empty plot twists that add nothing but aimless action, such as a trip of the main characters to a ghost town, where the villains (inexplicably) follow them. This was obviously thought of as an excuse for a shootout and escape, bordering on the ridiculous, when people entered the doorways and left them and ran past the windows, while simultaneously firing pistols. It makes you believe that someone told Becket that there is a ghost town in the Chilean foothills, and he said: “Oh, great, let's make a scene for a shootout there.” <br /> <br /> Don't even spend your rent money on this. This is a collection of random pieces from hundreds of different films put together to trigger a battle drama.
