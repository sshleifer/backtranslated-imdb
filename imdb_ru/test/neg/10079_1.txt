It would probably be a good movie to watch ... if you have already seen all the other films and carefully studied the navels of yourself and others. God, this film was incredibly tasteless, with some of the worst (or nonexistent) pieces ever filmed. There is no saving grace in this film; even the animatronics are kind of lame, and this is just a waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Run. Quickly. It's horrible. <br /> <br />
