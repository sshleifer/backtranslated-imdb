Oh yes, I plead guilty to seeing this piece of garbage. I cannot say that I was forced by aliens, who put a gun on my head, tied me to a chair and made it impossible to close my eyes, and then turned on this horrible film occasion. No, I did it voluntarily. I deliberately tortured myself. Let's go over the fact here guys. - This is an insult to humanity. - The plot (if it exists) is ridiculous. - Character development is terrible. - Characters appearing in the film are so clichéed that you will recognize them in a regular comic strip. - Editing casually and unimaginably. - Camera work restrained. - The dialogue is simply the worst in cinema history. - Director: well, let's say, I bet that it was not Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> Then, to add to these facts, there was absolutely no talent that was ever used. The director must now smoke crack to forgive himself for causing this poison to the world. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: “Passport to Paris” is one of the worst films in history. CONSTANTLY!
