Every time I think about this film, I feel physically ill. Reading such a wonderful book, and then discovering that there is a film, was a great feeling. Years later, imagine how glad I am that I turned on the sci-fi channel and found that it starts in just 5 minutes !!! Go up the names, and then uggs. If only a couple of things had changed, well. Everything has changed. Numerous characters have been removed, new trash has been added. The main character has shrunk and grown old by about 30 years, and now his girlfriend / wife has become his mother wittily! Even the dog is reduced to weak abilities. This is really a terrible movie at its absolute worst. I would gladly take off my own nails with pliers, instead of looking through another terrible sight, and I urge anyone who thinks to look at it â€” please, don't. If you have a copy, squeeze it now, right now and think how much better your life would be if this celluloid insult never occurred.
