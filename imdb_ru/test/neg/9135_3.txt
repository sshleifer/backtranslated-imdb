The first two films of this series were distinguished by their shots about the world of nature and ordinary people stuck in the midst of society. In this film there are no such natural frames that, as I understand it, are part of the essence, but in fact the entire video component of the film looks like random images, stuck together - flying around in circles, computer models of a person. skeletons, etc. From time to time, the footage is subject to a good effect (nationalism / finance segment around 35:00), but usually this results in the video lacking any meaningful content and requires that you accept the context of the photographers, no context director. This is no better than the video displayed on the karaoke machine. Three stars added to Philip Glass soundtrack.
