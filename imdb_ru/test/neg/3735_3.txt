The feeling of Minnesota is not really a road movie, but it’s still the best classification I can create. The road film does not primarily depend on the big storyline, and since the plot of this film is really pitiful, it fits this description. To be interesting, such a film must fully rely on moving and intriguing characters, as well as on the chemistry between them. Unfortunately, the Feeling Minnesota staff is completely unable to create this hype. <br /> <br /> The initial character presentation is unsatisfactory and confusing; For example, I cannot understand whether Jax (Keanu Reeves) grew up in his mother’s and his brother’s house or not. His mother (Weld Tuesday) says he has to live with his father, but nothing in the film suggests that this will ever happen. The same goes for the rest of the characters - I never recognize them. They seem to be irrational, and no real explanation of why they do it is given. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I leave the film without any feelings for the characters, other than stupidity and perhaps a tiny attraction for cute Cameron Diaz.
