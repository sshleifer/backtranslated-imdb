Probably not the same version as most other reviewers, because there is no real hard sex here. What do people mean by hard core sex? What is frank hard sex in movies with Tracy Lords and the "Big" John Holmes? Well, in any case, this is a really bad film, I doubt that I've ever seen so many famous actors lost in the film. The script is really bad and plotless, the direction and cinematography are terrible, editing does not exist. This is really a horrible movie. You might watch it ten times and still not understand what the hell it is about. The only memorable scene is the one where people are buried in the neck, and a giant lawn mower comes and decapitates them. Yes, you read that right, on the set in Roman times there is a scene with a giant lawnmower cutting your head! <br /> <br /> Point trivia. Many years ago, a pirated copy of THE THING (1982 version) made rolling tours on my island, and it was copied onto CALIGULA's rolling tape, meaning that the THE THE THEIR begins with the first few seconds of the CALIGULA man and the woman goes through the forest, the titular sequence. This led to the fact that people who saw the pirate tape believed that the forest scene was the discovery of the 1982 John Carpenter film, and were very confused by what it meant. Well, that's what you get for renting pirated videos. But, having seen all KALIGULA, I also do not know what it means
