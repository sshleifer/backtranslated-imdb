Although Humphrey Bogart received a stellar score at King Of The Underworld, I bet that he did not thank Jack Warner for that. In fact, this film was one hollow crown. <br /> <br /> “The King of the Underworld” allegedly was a remake of the Paul Muni film “Doctor Socrates”, but, considering that Humphrey Bogart was filmed in the film, the character was written more than Herzog Manti in the Petrified Forest. He even has an English writer in the person of James Stevenson. <br /> <br /> Kay Francis and John Eldredge are a couple of married doctors, and Eldredge performs a small operation on one of Bogart's minions. Bogey is a person who appreciates the good work done on his behalf and gives Eldredge $ 500.00, and this is not all where he came from if he played his cards correctly. Eldridge, who has a problem with gambling, sees a good way to get undeclared income. <br /> <br /> But when he is killed during a raid on a gang shelter, Francis is also considered involved in the law and the American Medical Association, no matter how much she protests against her innocence. This is not good, and she and her aunt, Jesse Busley, move to a small town to get away from notoriety. <br /> <br /> Of course, notoriety, Bogart and the wandering writer Leslie Howard from Stevenson meet her. again. But Kay is brave and resourceful, if not more. <br /> <br /> The character of Bogart was ridiculous, no wonder that the poor fellow shouted about the best roles. He is a gangster who ruthlessly shoots people and gives his henchmen legs for the sake of laughter. He is worried about his image and therefore kidnaps the writer Stevenson so that he would write his autobiography and, of course, admits that it is enough to burn him in all 48 states. And then let Kay Francis completely outwit him, it's hard to believe that he was the king of anything. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the smaller pieces for any of the stars.
