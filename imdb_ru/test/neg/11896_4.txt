In this continuation of the “Naked Civil Servant” we see Quentin Crisp’s last years in New York. John Hurt Crisp again (come on, who else could play this role?) And his role that he inhabits before disappearing. For me, Hurt is Crisp, and it has always been very difficult for me to take this person, because Hurt was more of him than he was. His masterful performance. His equal is Denis O'Hare as Philip Steele, Crisp's longtime friend and confidant. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film has little to recommend outside of the performances. To be sure, the movie gets the right details. Filmed in New York and its environs, the film looks and feels like New York and its environs, but is largely inert. His Crisp says that people are witty, trying to come to terms with the world as it is (he ultimately regrets some poorly chosen words about AIDS), and deal with the frailties that old elderly people impose on him. Quentin, this man is always interesting, but his life is not really depicted. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed with the film. I have always admired the man and his unique point of view. I wish this film about his life was better served.
