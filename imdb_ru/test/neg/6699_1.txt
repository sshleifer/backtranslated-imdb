As an American soldier, please believe me when I say that this film in no way accurately reflects the emotional state of our soldiers / sailors / pilots / marines returning from deployments. <br /> <br /> At the same time .... <br /> <br /> This film is one big pile of cliches. The performance of the terrible (with the exception of the little girl) character background is weak and ridiculous, and the plot is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This film is so bad that I made an entry in IMDb to warn anyone about half a step from it. <br /> <br /> Canadian writer / director Francesco Lucente must be very, very, very ashamed of this film. If he does not agree with US foreign policy, he should write a letter to the US government, and not punish the entire English-speaking world with a monumental shitty film.
