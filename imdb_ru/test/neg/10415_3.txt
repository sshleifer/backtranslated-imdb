It seems that the only time I look at IMDb comments is when I watched the Duff movie. I think I want to find an assurance that it’s not just me. Then for me, “Lonely Jim” was an empty film filled with incredible characters in unbelievable situations, who was limping and boringly toward a beaten-up conclusion. So I check what other people say, and I feel a bit like Jim in despair, because page after page of multiple star ratings and accolades make me doubt my critical abilities. However, perhaps I should check the settings for submitting comments, because after a while the flow subsides, and I am relieved to see ratings that reflect my own. I feel justified. This is a trash film, it does not hang together, and it represents a lost evening passing through it. Praise related spirits.
