I think if you like to watch guys “pumping up” to unbelievable sizes, it’s right in your alley. Otherwise, this is an exercise in the ego. I also do not need to do this. Of course, historical interest, I think, is to see how these muscular and brain chocks turned out to be like this (before / after / and between steroids), but otherwise is going to affect many guys, and as for women , I'm not alone, so I can not say ....
