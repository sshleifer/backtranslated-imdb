Being a fan of Harrison Ford, I was probably kind. It was predictable, juicy ... my husband made many gag sounds while we watched it. What a disappointing movie. Our local newspaper (San Jose Mercury News) actually gave it 4 stars out of 4 stars !!! It's hard to believe that the reviewer saw the same movie as us.
