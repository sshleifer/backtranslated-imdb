Why on earth can you have such fantastic actors in such a wretched creation? This is one of the most stylized pieces of garbage that I have seen in a long time. Not only is it poorly written, it is a product of crappy direction and editing. The cinematography is so badly manipulative and unoriginal, and the editing is confused to the limit. The actual ideas behind the plot (cloning, toxic waste, climate change) are good for a start, but where the production / production team takes them is a big cesspool, the likes of which can be seen in one episode. Is this a science series? I am a doctor, and all I can say is that science in this film is complete nonsense, which is almost a shame to look at. I really felt bad about the actors involved, since they were all unusual.
