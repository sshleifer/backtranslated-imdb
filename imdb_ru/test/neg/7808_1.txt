This film so pissed me off because of its stupidity that I felt the need to create an account on IMDb to share my opinion with you. I liked Ashton Kutcher in “Very Like Love,” and that is why I still wanted to watch this movie, despite his current rating of 4.2. This is greatly overrated. I believed that the actor (any of them) would judge the script and would not agree to participate in such low / now high-quality production. This is very disappointing. The theme of home recreation was much better used in the "Two of the Bigalow: Male Gigolo". Things that did not make sense here: first of all, the owner of the house leaves his precious pet to someone who knows nothing about how to take care of him. Secondly, the rule is not to let anyone into the house, but the nanny does not follow this simple rule. The door is not locked ?! And so on..
