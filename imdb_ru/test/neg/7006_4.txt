Midnight hour AKA: “Tell me there are no lies” (as can be found in some video stores) can be assessed in two different ways. One of them is “Merritt” as a film, full of plot (no holes), a good story and a plausible conclusion, and the other is a skin film that he is trying to be. This, of course, is nothing more than a snapshot from the B-Movie movie, the sole purpose of which is to show every girl in the movie in an overly long sex scene at least once. <br /> <br /> If you try to evaluate it as a regular movie, this is the bottom line of fuss. HUGE holes in the plot destroy any storyline that he has. For example, if an employee is killed, would you call the police or go home and hit the jacuzzi? Judging by the content of this film, it is watchable ... barely. The girls, for the most part, are all beautiful, but obviously improved. However, all the sex scenes were too long and exaggerated, and this made the dull quality a bit dull. <br /> <br /> Amber Smith could be a decent actress if she wanted. She was not as terrible as you could have imagined, or maybe alongside the other actors, she looked much better than she was. <br /> <br /> Zoe Anderson, who played Detective Array, should not even have watched a movie that was much less effective in one. Although she looked good, we know why she was there. <br /> <br /> In general, I would not recommend this to anyone. Even if you are looking for a good snapshot of the skin, there is much better. I rate it 4 out of 10
