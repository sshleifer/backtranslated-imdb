Despite the fact that I found an excellent game and excellent cinematography, I was extremely disappointed with the adaptation. <br /> <br /> One of the important parts of the story is the fact that Ethan and Mattie decided to kill themselves, rather than continue. This is never shown in the film, they show it as if it were an accident. <br /> <br /> There are almost no character changes in Mattie and Zenna. While in the story they almost change places, at the end of this adaptation it seems that they are both disabled. <br /> <br /> Finally, Matty and Ethan end their relationship, almost completely destroying the strength and sharpness of the final. <br /> <br /> The change of the narrator in the role of the preacher was one of the effective changes. <br /> <br /> Neeson and Arquette are excellent in their images. Joan Allen was also wonderful, but her character was greatly softened by the Whartons short story. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t expect the films to truly depict novels, but this film has gone too far and in the process almost destroyed the story. <br /> <br /> In general, I would not recommend watching this movie if you have not read the book, because you will be confused and disappointed.
