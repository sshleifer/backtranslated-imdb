Barney is just awful. As they say many other reviews about this show. I am not one of those who disagree with them (I will not). Because I hate this show as much as they do. They use children who look like they are in sixth grade, stupid stories, terrible dialogue and really stupid special effects. Not to mention that big purple dinosaur. He makes every other children's show look like winners (Sesame Street has received awards of which I know). <br /> <br /> Please just watch Sesame Street, Thomas the Tank Engine or even the teletubbies. Avoid both this and his film (which I also reviewed). They are both very crappy and do not fit anyone (even small children).
