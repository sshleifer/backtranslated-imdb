I thought that this film had an interesting title and perhaps it could have caused thoughts, but I was wrong. This film was boring, especially at the beginning and in the middle section. I can not comment on the end, because I just could not watch the whole movie. The premise of signing a student researcher just because he enters your lab does not make sense. This student had an interesting type of moving robot in his apartment, and, unfortunately, this non-living thing is more interesting than the characters in this film. So if you have trouble sleeping, then I recommend you make this movie.
