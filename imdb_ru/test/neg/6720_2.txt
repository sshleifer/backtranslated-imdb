Three words: What a bunch ..... Two words: Do not worry! One word: sucks! No reason to watch this movie. Even those Seagal fans should shy away from this movie. Martial arts, typical aikido, are terrible. Martial arts are good in themselves, but cinematic. The film is actually in slow motion when Seagal gives his “killer course” to his victims. Worst of all, it shows the same movement three times in quick succession from three slightly different angles. So silly. Seagal's acting was pretty silly, but I still give this film “6” for the cast because of the supporting cast, whose roles of “villains” were actually quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> The plot is just stupid. Seagal plays a Federal Express agent with license to kill. His character has a special work ethic, which means that all his packages are delivered to the right people on time - at no extra charge - and nothing prevents him. Not killers, political leaders, explosions or even death. <br /> <br /> I expect a certain level of violence in a martial arts film, but in this film there are several episodes of random and horrible acts of violence that provide in itself does not contribute to the promotion of the film or its history. There is a reason why this film went directly to the video, and there are plenty of reasons to avoid it. No one should worry about this prank. <br /> <br />
