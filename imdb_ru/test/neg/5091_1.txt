For several weeks I was looking forward to seeing this film, but I felt very disappointed after the wards. In my opinion, the only good thing “River Queen” is amazing landscapes, used as a background. The storyline was everywhere, Samantha's character, Sarah, it was very difficult to understand, and why all these close-ups of her face? It brought nothing to history - if it were at all! The best actor for Boy could also be chosen, for me it sounded like he was reading his lines right in the script while filming his scenes. a real shame, how could this be such a good movie.
