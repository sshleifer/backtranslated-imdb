One of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Three immature young people have sex and say little about other than their “love” for each other. It seems that they are not very interested in each other, and only passively. I stayed feel closed. Most outdoor scenes take place at night, so you can't even see the well-lit attractions of Paris! I gave up after an hour and ten minutes.
