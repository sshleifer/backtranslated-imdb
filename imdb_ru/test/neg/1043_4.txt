Karen and her boyfriend Jerry are moving to their new apartment in Los Angeles. They discover an old copper bed that Karen likes, unfortunately, she has a really sinister story involving perverse sex murders. fail miserably. The action is slow, acting is nothing special and there are no expectations. Even sex scenes are not convincing. The climax is pretty awful and cruel, so spray fans should be pleased. However, the first hour of “Death Lodge” is “deadly boring and offers some tired horror films and cheap fears. Definitely what to avoid. My rating is 4 out of 10, and this is generous. See“ Re-Animator ”or“ Castle Freak ” .
