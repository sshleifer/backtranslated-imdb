*** A spoiler is possible, but probably not *** <br /> <br /> The game is called Donkey Kong, but Donkey Kong is not even in it <br /> <br />! Diddy is gone! <br /> <br /> The 1st Country of Donkey Kong was one of my two favorite games <br /> <br /> Super Nintendo. (The other is Super Mario World) <br /> <br /> The 2nd Donkey Kong, at least, had Diddi Kong and good levels, <br /> <br /> although sometimes it was like a game, based on pirates. <br /> <br /> However, this one is the worst of all! He doesn’t have the feeling of the original or second <br /> <br />, the enemy looks stupid, and the levels <br /> <br /> are even worse. It no longer looks realistic! I didn’t like his game, unlike the last two, the first one had excellent background music <br /> <br />, while the second one had good music, but the music in this <br /> <br /> game is terrible! <Br /> <br /> Nowadays it often happens that movies, shows, and sometimes <br /> <br /> video games that start fantastically end up destroying them <br /> <br /> stupidity continued! I am sad to say that I feel that the donkey Kong is not as good as the saga <br /> <br /> now that he has Donkey Kong 3! <br /> <br /> They had to leave it in the original or CAN BE the 2nd.
