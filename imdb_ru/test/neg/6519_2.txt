This film tries to cash in on the success of Richard Curtis films, in particular, “I really love” (which I loved) - a series of scattered scenes accompanying the love life of various couples. <br /> <br /> Great idea, poorly executed. The script tries to be too smart and just does not resonate. Most acting skills are stilted, which is more a reflection for the director than for actors. <br /> <br /> The version I saw (on the plane) was called “Scenes from the Park”, which is a more appropriate title, not all the scenes were “sexual”. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to this film, but in the end it was disappointing. Do not worry
