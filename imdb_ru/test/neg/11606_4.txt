“Mr. and Mrs. Smith” is one of Hitchcock’s not-so-famous early American films. But if the “Lifeboat” (which, unfortunately, also belongs to this category) is an undervalued masterpiece, not all films signed by the master of the unknown at that time (early 40s) are really worth watching. And frankly, the discovery of this film is not really lost. <br /> <br /> “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” is a common and ordinary comedy with delirium, in which it is quite difficult to find Hitchcock’s touch. You may be able to see his shadow (which is not so great) in the cruelty that Carol Lombard was capable of (which is well hidden in an impersonal package), in a vertigo scene where two characters are trapped on top about attractiveness exhibitions, and perhaps in the nature of the mother. And it's all! Even for a Hitchcock fan, there is little to be bound. <br /> <br /> And for fans of comedy bolts, not so much: none of the situations are not so exaggerated as to be truly funny, and for example, we are far from the hawks masterpieces. And if one or two scenes are quite funny, in the Hitchcock filmography there is not even the most ridiculous, which created comical situations in almost all of its films (even Psycho could be called complete with a very gloomy humor). Thus, in this film, little can be saved, since it can not annoy anyone (or, perhaps, only as Hitchcore and Hitchcock fans, and the talker who are in love with Carol Lombard), remaining one of the not-too-famous early Hitchcock. movie.
