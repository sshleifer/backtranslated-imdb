Mandingo and Drum's Italian stall is a poorly named Italian life on a plantation thread. Many people who do not look as though they belong in the American South wear poorly tailored suits and roam places that do not look like the American south. There is something in the story about a romance between a rich man and a certain young woman, about the envy that follows and about the tragedy that follows. The film promises hot hot sex and a lot of perverse violence, but in fact nothing comes of it, it all teases. All this is probably racially insensitive, I could not notice, as it artistically went bankrupt. The last turn is ridiculous at best. Large turkey.
