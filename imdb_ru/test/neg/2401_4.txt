When the American film industry tries to take a critical look at their government, they are pretty damn sure that it looks good, even when it’s bad. <br /> <br /> The film does one thing right, it perfectly demonstrates what is wrong with American politics. It seems that the motto is what you need to succeed !!! Mix American congressmen, a CIA agent, a Jew and an Arab ... just to kill the Russians. Thanks to the USA for giving us Osama bin Laden. <br /> <br /> The film’s frustration is due to the confusion of problems: the use of images of Afghan children without weapons and stories of Soviet atrocities, and then a blatant attempt to suggest a link between that and the justification of American aid. Every sensible person knows why $ 1,000,000,000 was collected, and certainly not the dying Afghan children. <br /> <br /> As usual, serious questions lurk behind the facade of the hush dialogue. “There you are, M *** r F ***** s,” Hoffma repeats at the end, all that is missing is the American flag in the background and the silly military soldiers. Movies can not leave the aftertaste of a sense of American pride and joy of how we (the Americans) saved the world ... again. Even the last 5 minutes of the film cannot save him when an attempt is made to stop praising himself and realizing the fact that this is just another American rebel. <br /> <br /> The acting and editing was good though.
