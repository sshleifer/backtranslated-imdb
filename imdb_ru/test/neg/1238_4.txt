I'm not sure that this review contains spoilers, but I cautiously say, indicating that they may be. Despite this, it is unlikely that this film will be seen by someone who is not familiar with the book. <br /> <br /> There is an old wisdom associated with powerful work and mouse breeding. "Comanche Moon" is such a mouse. <br /> <br /> The novel focuses more on Indians than on Americans. By adapting it for television, McMurtry and Hosanna rightly reasoned that the public would be more interested in whites than in red. Unfortunately, in the novel there is little that we do not know about Gus, Woodrow and their friends. Thus, the film gives us mainly the foreshadowing of what will happen in The Lonely Pigeon. The Indians - who have their own history - are largely overshadowed - so much so that one who has not read the novel will rightly wonder why it is called “Luna Comanche”. <br /> <br /> The novel does not have a common storyline or most of the "point". This could be corrected in the film if it were more clearly illustrated the contrast between the Indians who have lost their lands and way of life, the invading Americans, who bear "civilization." This opportunity has been missed. <br /> <br /> Unlike Lonely Pigeon, there are several extended scenes in Comanche Moon that develop character or relationships — at least among Americans. Extended scenes with the Indians were largely removed or shortened. And for a (pure) four-hour movie, this is surprisingly episodic and changeable. It seems that the script was initially longer and shortened to reduce production costs. <br /> <br /> The script consists mainly of clichéd dialogue, aphorisms and platitudes. Based on the author of The Last Picture Show, this is a strikingly bad scenario. McMurtry and Osanna had the opportunity to correct problems with history and characteristics, but did not. <br /> <br /> Some of the best dialogues from the novel are missing or changed for no apparent reason. For example, Clara (Cassie) demonstrates his strong hatred of Woodrow (Jack), condemning Gus (Ennis) for always running away to be with his "parda". This little revelation of Clara’s sexual jealousy has disappeared. Then there is a scene where your tight Woodrow warns Maggie not to let Jake Spun "compromise" her. The exchange in the novel is shorter and tougher; the film softens it, and does not portray Woodrow as the rather socially stupid, emotionally frozen stone that he is. (When I read this scene in the novel, I wanted to hit Woodrow in the stomach — or worse.) There are other changes, some of which are understandable. The eyelids of Inish Scull are not cut off; For this, I would like to require expensive CGI. But Buffalo Hump no hump! (It might have been pointless to ask Wes Studi to get around such a huge prosthesis.) And the Buffalo Hamp character is “kinder and softer.” He is nowhere more grotesquely cruel than in novels. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is good in this almost turkey is the wonderful performance of Steve Zahn - not so much as Gus McCray, as much as Robert Duval, who plays Gus McCray. This is strange. He perfectly duplicates Duval's manner and manner of speech, without looking "intentional" or shy. Like Duval, he is completely "in" character. And he actually shows that Gus becomes “even more Gus” in the third part. <br /> <br /> The best thing about Comanche Moon is that it will not spoil our affection for Lonely Pigeon, and not just a great Western, but a great American film. <br /> <br /> PS: For those who think that Rachel Griffiths was excellent - that’s how she was in the book.
