Last night I saw the show at 12:45, and I would go out after 20 minutes. But there was no place to go! Indecent product placement, juvenile scenario, so much talent was wasted, beatings of gays ... what they did not do? The film is also insanely long (we went out at 3). As someone who rarely pays the full price in a movie, imagine that my disappointment plays out $ 22 for this smug, mean-spirited nightmare (plus parking for $ 2). I woke up today, still feeling depressed, and could not shake it all day. I love Vince Vaughn, and he seems to be completely lost in this thing, like me. When Cedric the Entertainer is the highest mark (the person is so uninteresting that he has to call himself "Entertainer", so you understand what he thinks he does), you have serious problems. In addition, the appearance of Robert Pastorelli terribly terribly down, because he died almost a year ago (March 10). This should give you an idea of ​​how long they polish this piece of poo. This film is sneaky to the bitter end. We stayed only to make sure that they did not give Robert "In memory" that they did not. Save yourself! Save your money! Save your soul!
