This is a candidate for the worst films I've ever seen. He wanted to be as shocking as Silence of the Lambs, but he didnâ€™t have the style or wit of the above. The make-up is great, the acting is pretty good, but the story seems to drag on for years, and the killings are so terrible that they bother more than entertain
