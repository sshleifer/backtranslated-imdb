The main word that comes to mind when considering this film - "smart". This is a poor-quality biography of one of the most iconic performers of all time. Glove deserves better. <br /> <br /> Before delving into my thoughts on this biopic, I have to say that I found two effective things. First, in some moments of the film, real shots from fans and interviews were used, especially in scenes depicting the first set of accusations of molesting children. I feel that it introduced a certain authenticity, which * was * strictly * lacking throughout the entire film. The second was a sequence depicting the courtship of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. I will not comment on whether I consider the marriage to be fictitious, but for many reasons it was a relationship in which there was concern and affection between the two parties involved. It really came across in this film; Flex Anderson and Krista Rae had enough decent chemistry to handle this. These successful points are enough to keep the "Man in the mirror" from the status of 1 star. <br /> <br /> However, there were very few others who worked. Very few actors looked like the people they were supposed to portray, especially blatantly those who played Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Jackson and Diane Ross. In addition, the lack of music Jackson was a huge loss. How can you effectively tell a story about him without his music? I understand that they could not secure the rights to it, because it was a low-budget unauthorized proceeding; it seems, however, that if there is no music of this person in the film about him, you can pack it and go home, because you are missing an extremely important part of his life story. /> <br /> Jackson's feature in this film also worried me a bit. I will not argue that he was worried, and perhaps he had few chips, but here he was portrayed as something close to mentally retarded. I do not believe that Jackson, who, as we know, was an astute businessman, would be just as naive about the structure of the adult world as he was nicknamed in this film. <br /> <br /> Finally, the way this film was written was just a shame. Many lines or exchanges of dialogue were either extremely banal, like the exchange of the “Tinkerbell” by Michael and Janet, or meaningless, like the comments “The Blanket of Love” made by Michael. In addition, the writers do not quite understand the subtleties. There was a lot of telegraphy about upcoming events (the “What could have gone wrong?” Lines) and an extremely frank knock on the themes and motives in the film (if I had heard the word “believe” again). .). This is what ultimately prevented the film from becoming something that can be considered terribly bad. <br /> <br /> It is possible that after a few years, or even a decade or three, we will leave Jackson's death, someone will be able to bring his story about life in a more worthy film. By that time, we could have a better look at his life, and someone will be able to present a really thoughtful analysis of who Michael Jackson really was and what he meant for the world of entertainment. This very tricky biopic was not that film.
