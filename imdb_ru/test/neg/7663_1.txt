I just watched this movie on TNT, and let me tell you, this movie was just banal and satisfying. But after a certain moment, I started laughing at my socks and telling you the truth, they should classify this film as a comedy, not as an action / adventure. Absolutely the most fun scene happens when Delon and Kennedy loop the 360th loop to avoid the French missiles that Wagner ordered to destroy Concorde. Our fearless leader, Kennedy, decides to shoot out the window flashes to stop the pursuit of missiles. Dumb, but ridiculous - the kicker, nevertheless, comes here - after one shot the flare gun crashes, and Kennedy tries to fix it in the cabin and well ... if you want to know what is happening, get this movie. The stupid parts of this film include a complete lack of plot - yes, let's play for 25 minutes than land in Paris, and ONE HOUR with love scenes with prostitutes and flight attendants. Now let's switch to a saboteur for ten minutes, then the wasted remainder of the film and the plane, which is visually falling apart, and PASSENGERS DON'T GIVE THAT TO SEE YOUR RIGHTS BEFORE THEIR EYES - --- the final rating for this turn --- (1 10) of 4 stars, if it was an action 2 of 4 stars, if it is a comedy
