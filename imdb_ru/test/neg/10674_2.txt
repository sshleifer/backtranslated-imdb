Well, some people can go look at it to look at dirty rubber and PVC-clad bisexual vampire killer who kicks some ass. If this is what you want and you wear a raincoat, put teeth on points and think that the name Lilith Silver is cool, you will see a good movie. <br /> <br /> If, like most people, an Assassin dressed in shiny, squeaky rubber with HUGE splitting, thick makeup and bad fangs makes you laugh, then this is one of the best comedies you will see. I laughed so hard that I almost cried. Funny actions, dialogues and conspiracies help to do it better than Dracula, Dead and loving. It could be ... <br /> <br /> He tries to be cool and gothic, and all he can do is make every Scene funny. Even a captured lesbian scene is funny (how * did she take off those shoes so quickly? They were laced up to * here * ...) <br /> <br /> Don't watch if you want good movies. Look, if you like horrible movies and want to laugh until you fall ... This is not good, this is just bad.
