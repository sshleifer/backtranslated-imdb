I ordered this film on the Internet, because there it is very difficult to find Turkish films where we live. I heard so much about the series from my friends and almost everyone in Turkey, I expected to see a breakthrough in Turkish cinema. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Me and my husband (who is a fan of any film with a bit of Turkish landscape and Turkish dialogues in it) only watched it all the time because we paid $ 20 for the DVD. Well, it was a boring way to waste it. <br /> <br /> It was confusing, sometimes overdone, while in other cases it was not distracting. The storyline was not only confusing, but also added a gay man who walked with his dog along the beach and used toilet humor in the script to make him "Hollywood", also did not work for me. American characters were almost too stereotypical, so that they were neither funny nor realistic, and, as another user mentioned, Turkish customs and lifestyle did not matter. <br /> <br /> Camera movement did not matter. Adding a few dervishes (by the way, they were never seen in Kapadokya) and broken plates - in the Greek style - only made the film even more confusing. <br /> <br /> I am ashamed of this film and all the noise that the press made. There are certainly worthy films made by Turkish directors who deserve more attention and respect. <br /> <br /> I give this film 1 out of 10.
