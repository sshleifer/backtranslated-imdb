I have never seen such a film "B" ... on the side that babysitter Sophia is being killed ... on the tape appears the hand of a woman who holds a stick ... how bad is that ??? LOL, I seriously laughed and wanted to stop watching the movie, but I kept watching it to see if this movie could get worse ... LOL ... this is bad for myself ... poor Buratino ... the only good thing for the first time when you see some special effects of Pinocchio's face movement ... besides, the whole movie is terrible ... it's not worth your time if you have little to save! But if you have nothing to do ... continue ... treat yourself to some movie "Z" because the B-movie is still too good for that ... LOL
