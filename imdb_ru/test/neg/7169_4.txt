George Burns returns as a playful Almighty after the great success of 1977, “Oh, God!”, An optimistic fantasy that became successful due to the sudden need in the 1970s to switch from devilish thrillers to a comedy ransom (although he brought the original money more comedies "Topper" 30s, than returning to religious cinema with a good state of health). Here, God appears before a young girl (Luanna, who previously starred in the stage play “Annie”) and asks her to spread her Divine Word, with the result that she only has problems with adults. The peculiar, family-oriented film seems hearty enough, and Burns engages with a pleasant stream of ridicule curves, but the script is half rude and half serious, while adults from this part are considering putting little Luann away, it all makes God seem rather troubled than older friend. Luann has another problem: a cheerful child with dry eyes, she is not prepared for shooting on the screen and sometimes seems awkward. The mid-budget production has a dismal, television-like film, with a few graceful touches. The final scene mimics the culmination of the first “Oh, God!” That brings a brooding feeling to the mix, which is welcomed. This is the most subtle point in the film. ** from ****
