As an indie director, I try to at least make a decent movie. This part of ____ was out of budget. It was videotaped, not 24P mini-DV at least. The appearance of this was just baaaad. I met the director several years ago at ShowBiz Expo in Los Angeles, and he talked about this book, Making Movies for Dummies, which he collected. I thought this little video would be something, but I think I was wrong. He could add some value by shooting a 16 mm film instead of this horrible video. The plot was as stupid as the action, and the whole fake green screen and sound, and as much as nine yards. I had the choice to shoot any film tonight, and I made the wrong choice. Heck!!!!! I bought JoyRide, which was a hell of a movie. Maybe the director should read these books with films about cinema and not try to cut corners, trying to make a low-budget film. Maybe he should learn from the masters who created the Night of the Living Dead and the Evil Dead and Chains, who saw the slaughter. just to name a few of all the low budget great hits. This is one video that should have been left dead. I can't call it a film because he did not use the film.
