The King Is Alive is a spoiled and contrived mess in the film that sounds like an excuse for a condescending author to transport a group of actors to Namibia’s forgotten God’s Desert, where he can play Major Dogme-domo and film his selfishly conceived, stupid, exhausted drama with a complete disregard for the real forces of human nature, market attractiveness, common sense, and even good art. In other words, it’s one dazed click, and if you don’t believe it, your repentance is watching it. Only for filmmakers, critics, amateurs, and the like. (D)
