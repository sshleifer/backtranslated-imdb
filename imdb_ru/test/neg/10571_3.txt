This film is funny if you are a gentleman who sat about three rows behind me (repeating each zest, laughing when there were no gags on the screen, and making a rude "haaaa" on every scene involving a computer or mobile device). <br /> <br /> For everyone else, this is a mean, tangled "comedy." The film strictly follows the formula for the later films “Terrible Cinema”, as well as “Epic Cinema” and “Meet the Spartans”, albeit without a flood of heartless references in pop culture that made the last two so annoying. Nevertheless, the praise of intellectual and peacemakers around the world makes it clear that the film knows its audience: people who are jealous of intellectual abilities. Superhero Movie is particularly and consistently disgusted with Stephen Hawking, presenting him as a sexually hungry drug addict and using his disability as a means for farce. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on “Spiderman” with “Batman Begins” and “X-Men”, added just to play some kind of physical comedy. Much of the film is a farce, but not in an invigorating or interesting way. The longest joke is a farting joke, and early screenwriters seem to believe that if you throw the main character into noticeable piles of fake animals, this automatically enlivens the boring scene of the spider-bite from Spiderman her, especially absent in other recent parodies. The filmmakers behave as if they are doing something new, and the audience can feel the influence of how the actors are jumping on the screen. The extremely short duration (about an hour and fifteen minutes) and the highlight of the presentation make the film “Superhero” tolerable, and not terrifying.
