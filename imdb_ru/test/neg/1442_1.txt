Everyone I spoke with said that this film would be good and really strange, so I decided that I would rent it. Halfway through the movie, I thought to myself what the hell was going on and what was the point in this movie. From beginning to end this film is so bad that even the sick parts of the film did not even bother me. I mean, what are they going to come up with in the next Vulcan 2 Return of Lava. I mean, give this film so stupid that the characters are so poorly developed, and on the eve of Robert Englund makes the movie even worse, I mean, he could just as well turn into Freddy Krugur and Spook. In fact, I rooted for the bad guy to win, how bad it is. I mean that her father is a policeman, he seems to have not really cared that his daughter is going through one of the most important moments in her life. I mean, if my daughter were treated like this, I would do everything in my power to keep the guy behind prison. It also seems obvious that Di Snydersâ€™s character will again become bad. This is one of the worst films in the history of Vulcan and 8mm. Do not waste your time, you will not like it ....! <br /> <br /> Evaluation If there were no evaluation on this site, I would choose it, that's how bad this film is!
