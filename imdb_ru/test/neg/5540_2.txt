I loved the original P.H. and was somewhat pleased with Bloodwings (II) and Ashes to Ashes (III), then I saw part IV. Oh, boy ..... As a Pumpkinghead enthusiast, I did my best to give the fourth part as much as I can, but this is pretty bad. The fight at the wedding reception at the very beginning of the film - a terrible mess on the one hand. The storyline of Hatfield and McCoy is incomprehensibly stupid and clich√©. How did the producers manage to use this weary family enmity storyline? Wow, incredible. The game, except for Henrikson, is below average. The plot and the script is staggering. Actual editing and cinematography are average, as is directing. I mean, the film is not a complete loss. As always: I love to watch pumpkinhead, I love to see Haggis the Witch and I love to watch the ghost of Harley in action. But all three characters had too much screen time. I thought that Haggis and Harley would go to the club for an evening meal, where they could have a snack and a drink, as there were such friends in her cabin. The bottom line is ... I wanted all the characters in this gag plot line to be dead for 20 minutes after the beginning of the picture. Where does Sci-Fi get these so-called "filmmakers"? I could have done a better job writing a cold drunk script. I'm sure there was a limited budget and everything, but come on! See if you are a fan of the other three, but only once. And then go back and stick to the original two. Shame on you, fantastic !!!!
