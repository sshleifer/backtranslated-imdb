It's not terrible, but what a waste of time ... Lousy jokes, bad music, bad drawings and animation ... <br /> <br /> As for the impressive number of animators and intervalallists in this picture (from ... wilderness. .. a hundred different studios around the world? Come on, how can you expect something connected when you make an animated film this way!) Interestingly, one guy in the credits = one drawing! The lines are rough, the 3D work is inadequate (I don’t mind, but not in this film) But the backgrounds have been fixed. The storyline is rather dull, far from the exact trick of BD, and clearly aimed at an international audience. Spreading a movie around the world does not mean taking everyone in the world as a simple guy ... A cultural object is much more interesting when it challenges, even if it is a foreign film (in this case, French). it's even worse!). <br /> <br /> Some new things are going well (Olaf’s character, sometimes like a stone’s explanation, but that’s not great), but modern links are annoying (music, SMS isn’t even a verbal joke, just a dull bird called Service short messages: does anyone know the imagination?). But, hey, this is M6 / TPS, in which Celine Dion is ... sorry. <br /> <br /> Asterix is ​​not fully occupied, and Obelix talks too much. Goodurix could have been great (as in the book), but he is too obviously a “tough guy” with a love affair (with an uninteresting, made-up female character). Actually, only the Vikings (with the exception of the wizard) are funny. Too much action, not much laughter. The best part of the movie is the end credits. Not music, but a few frames that it contains. BD style. Well, definitely, Asterix is ​​not forced to move!
