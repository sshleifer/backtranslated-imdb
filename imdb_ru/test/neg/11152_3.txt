I was waiting to welcome the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger to action after the grim films that he made after Eraser. “The End of Days”, however, can be added to the dismal films in which he had the misfortune to appear. <br /> <br /> “End of Days” starts well with an exciting sequence of actions, but quickly becomes boring, distracting from action and waiting, and instead focus on investigating demonic events and the rapidly approaching millennium (read “Doomsday”). <br /> <br /> Stale performances, average special effects and an abundance of blood. Considering myself a loyal fan of Schwarzenegger, I could not believe that I did not like this film, but with such a terrible, lame script that I could make Arnie, except that I passed this turkey? <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 <br /> <br />
