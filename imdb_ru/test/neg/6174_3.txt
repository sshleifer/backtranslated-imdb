Ugh. Even the ever-popular Diane Lane could not save this film, and the most exciting thing about the film saw whether Rourkeâ€™s face was moving. Someone heard so much "gossip" about his unsuccessful facelift, etc., so that, as an accident on the side of the road, we just had to slow down and see the crash. The plot was thin. Here we have a very professional bounty hunter who somehow clings to wild and uncontrollable punk / rogue, and throughout this film we wonder why this guy stays with this idiot, not to mention meet with him. Then a crime that was not even committed could harass the witnesses. He would have sprung them right then and there. But then we wouldn't have a movie then, would we? And why did the realtor even agree to extortion? There were more holes in this click than in my colander. The acting was terrible, the whole movie was predictable up to the minute, and even the final. And so much could have been done to make this film much better. But if you have about 90 minutes to kill and not to use brain cells, then this film is exactly what the doctor ordered.
