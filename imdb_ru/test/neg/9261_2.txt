I bought this film for 99 cents on K-mart a few years ago (along with Breed of Hawken), coming up with something with Gabriel Byrne and Amanda Donahue, undoubtedly cost that much. There was no “Dark Obsession” (the name under which I bought it) was slightly lower than the “Hawkins Breed” (IMBD with a rating of 2.4), but not enough to allow me to even keep her in the house. I threw both films in the trash. <br /> <br /> This thing doesn’t work on many levels, it’s hard to narrow down, but let's just say it’s tasteless, incredibly boring, hedonistic, confusing, and even 100 minutes, too long. <br /> <br /> I love Byrne as an actor, but this devil looks really bad in his resume.
