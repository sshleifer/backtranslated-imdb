I grew up on weekends, watching “Bowery Boys” on weekends, and even at a young age I could say that it was a low-rent thing, as the name suggests. However, it was fun to watch Setch (Hall) defeat Maggs (Gorsy) after Maggs knocked him out of himself. The East Side Kids children's material never showed, even though it was in the public domain and probably cheap to manage, it was just a low standard for which children could tune in, although we only had 5 channels to watch. Enter 2005, and I am talking about my childhood. I can't find the Bowery Boys on DVD, but I found The East Side Kids on a disc, as well as on a publicly accessible website. Fortunately, I saved my dough and saw Bowery Blitz online for free, and it's really great. Now I see that there are a few Bowery Boys and maybe lovers of bad Monogram films who gave this melodrama shit 7 out of 10, but come on, guys, this is not even trying to be funny. This is an East Side Kids drama, not a comedy, so nothing good. The most pleasant thing was to see how the Mugs fought at the end, he reminded me that my days in elementary school were stretching like a girl, when I entered into a fight, it was something bad. Leonard Maltin said in his mini bio that this film is one of the best, so you can just imagine everything else. If you want to see something half decent action on the east side, maybe watch “The Ghosts on The Loose”, but the point is that usually the comedy team starts a strong career and narrows down, these circles sooner or later exploded, and then slowly raised them until Hall’s antics began to dominate. than they were at best. However, second-level things are far below the three puppets they emulate, but funny for those who grew up with them. This feature will not bring pleasant memories of "Bowery Boys", and it is better to leave it to Monogram fans.
