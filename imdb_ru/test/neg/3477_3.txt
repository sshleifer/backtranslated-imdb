This documentary tries to comedic, but never reaches me. Camp? Oh, maybe. A better word that everyone will agree with - and which will be difficult to avoid in any review - is kitsch. It dripped kitsch. The filmmakers were afraid that their viewers would take the film too seriously, and so they leaned back to insert kitsch and say: “We are joking here! See ??? "<br /> <br /> In short, I felt that I was trying too hard. For example, the sock dolls that represented each scene were (for me) annoying when I'm sure they had to be funny — or at least (hm) kitsch-hey. <br /> <br /> Don't, however, avoid this film based on my complaints. Just be ready to revel in kitsch, and not impose it on you unprepared. If you are interested in a frivolous fare, you can do much, much worse. At the very least, the facts related to the rise and fall of bakers, make it interesting and worthy of attention. At best, a pack of like-minded people who love kitsch will scream and scream over the bits of choice throughout the film.
