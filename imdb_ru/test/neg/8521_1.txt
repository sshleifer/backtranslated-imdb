"You're Dead" is an indescribable terrible attempt at a British gangster movie. He does not have a single original idea, as he is a brutal copy of the various elements of Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, Ordinary Suspects and Fiction. Action and dialogue are absolutely painful, the plot is ridiculous and completely predictable, despite the constant attempts to plot the plot, and contains only one-dimensional symbols and cliches. There are some good actors in it, but they are out of shape and can't do anything with the terrible stuff they work with. Sitting through this nonsense is an absolute torture.
