RATING STARS: ***** Saturday evening **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning morning <br /> <br /> Unorthodox journalist Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) pulls in time local police and trying to have an affair with a police officer. But everything changes when the mistress of the Thames side pub, which he frequently visits, is found murdered, and a transcript of an unpublished novel is found, the recognition of which is recognized by the legendary writer Charles Dickens. As he delves into both riddles, he is more and more immersed in the riddle and danger that he counted on. <br /> <br /> In 1998, former footballer Vinnie Jones broke out of nowhere and surprised everyone with his classic gangster cult. Cards, money, two trunks. Well, no one was struck by his acting skills, but his presence in the role of a tough man looked ready to provide a decent career as a tough guy from the movie. But it all turned out to be a miracle of one hit, and all he really achieved after that was maintaining role-playing status among much better-known actors in films like Spirited Away for Sixty Seconds and Swordfish, before go down to the realm of a direct DVD-hell, the latter being this tangled and time-consuming thriller, which would be good if he did not take with him other recognized and promising new talented stars such as Derek Jacobi, Julie Cox, Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Fleming and Mel Smith. What made him fall so quickly from the dizzying height of success (besides the fact that he can be a pony with one trick) is someone's guess (dodgy personal life is a possible guess), but here he is. <br /> <br /> A The scenario is as implausible and incomprehensible as it would be a task for anyone, but with an erroneous view of Jones at the head, this is an even more difficult task to understand. Comparison of the roles of Jacobi as a former vagabond with himself and Dickens himself, speaking directly to the camera, obviously hints at the creation of something, and the scenario is predictable in other areas. Add to this the cheap production cost and make your debut with the director (also a writer) Brendan Fowley. Bad first impression. <br /> <br /> What exactly did I expect from what appeared for free in The Daily Mail? *
