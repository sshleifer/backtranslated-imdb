The original Airport (1970) was a classic of its kind, and the first two sequels of the B-film (Airport 1975; Airport '77) were watchable entertainment at best, fun camp at worst; but this rough and inept last record has no entertaining value and demonstrates a shocking contempt for its audience. It is unbearable and not even good for laughter. <br /> <br /> All three sequels of the “Airport” were theatrical releases created by Universal’s television wing, but this film does not even meet the modest standards of a television film of the time: cheap production, grotesque casting, visual deformity. and tasteless, unfunny "comedy." The project was clearly doomed to the "creative" efforts of the head of Universal Jennings Lang, who personally produced and received a "historic" loan. <br /> <br /> Everyone starts somewhere, and writer Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) could have provided an element of smug burlesque, as in previous films (especially in the notorious “Airport of 1975”), but there is nothing to be deceived about Rota’s obscene screenplay and even in the comedy “Airplane”! left this rough intact. <br /> <br /> What makes The Concorde: Airport '79 particularly offensive is the abusive abuse of professionals. The worst victim is the extremely gifted Sisily Tyson (Sonder; Miss Jane Pittman's autobiography), mercilessly turned into a gag story in which she accompanies a frozen heart transplant during an unsuccessful flight. <br /> <br /> A special groin kick is reserved for the remarkable George Kennedy, who is the true leader, despite being buried on the cast list. The official mascot of the Airport series and the only actor appearing in all four films, Kennedy more than earned a major role, and his turn in the captain’s chair would be the only possible reason for this recording, except squeezing one last dollar. Kennedy provides the only warmth and real humor in this mechanical outfit, briefly setting aside bravura masculinity and revealing the really sweet and tender side of himself and his sweet and heroic character “Joe Patroni”. Unfortunately, we are never allowed to forget how fat and old and ordinary Kennedy, and the awesome handsome Alain Delon mercilessly calls him a “pig of pork” as part of friendships that fall completely flat. Even the Kennedy novel of Paris, the only humane part of this plane crash, turns out to be just a base for a hateful joke for Patron, Kennedy, and at the expense of the viewer.
