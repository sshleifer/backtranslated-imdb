This is a family film, filmed in rural America in America in the 1950s, about a boy whose uncle accuses of killing sheep against his dog Barabanna, starting not only family legal enmity, but also discord in society as their city begins to side with . <br /> <br /> This is a formula film that tries to be very touching and sweet. His biggest weakness is that the only people who could really act were Scott Bakula (defense attorney), Ron Perlman (father / drum owner) and the dog. (John Shaq and Katie Garver, Sissy from the original Family Romance, because the uncle and his wife were fine.) The children were not so good (they mostly looked like they were playing), and this is a problem when the film really revolves around them (Aaron Force, who plays the bully Donnie, makes me think that the actor Russell Crowe must have looked like a child, only without talent, but with a lot of ham). <br /> <br /> Favorite line (uttered by the Prosecutor’s Office after Scott Bakula’s final speech in defense): “We’re lucky if they don’t lynch us.” <br /> <br /> Favorite phrase that Ron Perlman utters (after his son hit the bully): "Now, having made him a friend, it will be a difficult task." <br /> <br /> Cute enough to rent / buy used.
