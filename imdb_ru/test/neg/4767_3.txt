Although this is not one of Miss Davis' worst movies, it’s pretty bad. And it’s sad that in a revisionist way, recent IMDb estimators deliberately overestimate the ratings of some of her films to make up for her neglect in the past — or so it seems. For many years, the conventional wisdom was that Davis was a terrible actress and got the roles she got because her beauty, William Randolph Hearst, bought her way to Hollywood. This is, of course, the image created in the Orson Welles CIVILIAN CAN. It is true that Hurst really used his considerable wealth and influence to build Davis's career. Despite all this money, it is not surprising that she made some great films, and it is not surprising that people became fussy because of her extra attention. Sleeping with the person who finances your films is sure to be noticed. However, despite this advantage, she also made a lot of bad films, and I think we really need a balance when it comes to dozens of her films. After all, no sensible person could believe that today (1/5/08), PEG O 'MY HEART and Davis’s other two films recently shown in Turner's classic films (THE FLORODORA GIRL and MARIANNE) deserve exceptionally high results - their ranking is higher than that of films such as “NOON”, “BEN GUR”, “BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE” and “ALL QUIET AT THE WESTERN FRONT FRONT !!” according to IMDb version with a score of 8.8 !!! Considering that most people there don't even know who Marion Davis was, and most of her films were financial disasters, this is a serious problem !! Nevertheless, she was a much better actress than CITIZEN KANE implied, and she initially starred in films before she began to sleep with Hurst. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes PEG O 'MY HEART from these two other films is that Marianne and FLORODORA GIRL were nice little movies, while PEG O' MY HEART is terrible in some respects. In many ways, the reason was the terrible mistake of Marion. While her French accent in MARIANNE was pretty, in PEG her Irish accent only sounded weird - not especially Irish. Plus, and maybe I’m wrong, but her constant use of the word “you” makes her sound like she was supposed to play Shakespeare, and not a film made in 1933 in Ireland! In addition, there was a strange statement that Marion should be an unsurpassed multi-talented star - so they made her not just play, but dance and sing. Singing did indeed fit into the scenarios of some of her films, but here it seemed out of place and seriously distracted from the film. It seemed that you could almost hear Hearst shout: "See, she is a great actress, look at her singing and dancing." Unfortunately, Marion just looked uncomfortable and inappropriate in many of these scenes. But for me the biggest problem was the idea that Marion, 36, plays such a youthful role. It was obvious that the character she played at the beginning of the film was to be similar to the one Mary Pickford played in her teens and twenties - complete with pig tails and a brave attitude. Miss Pickford CAN play these roles, although she was no longer a girl either. But here Marion gained some weight and looked at least 30. No offense - she looked great for her age - but she was NOT like a teenager! <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, with the millions that Hearts spent on Marion’s career, he didn’t understand that the most important thing he needed to spend money on was a good script and a script that matched talents Marion. Believe me, I rated several of her films very highly (I especially adore SHOW PEOPLE), but here she just could not help but be broken - this film was a turkey.
