For a country that has created some of the best dramatists in the world and has such a rich musical heritage, it always puzzled me why so much of the national cinema in Ireland was so terrible. Perhaps because, by their very nature, talented people in the field of Irish cinema quickly abandoned their native shores for a career in Britain or America (Colin Farrell is a recent example), and that the really successful Irish directors continued to work in Ireland and made Irish films with Irish nationals. on international money and look at the international market. I mean, in particular, Jim Sheridan and Neil Jordan, who alternate between films with the Irish setting and projects shot abroad. <br /> <br /> Middletown, however, is very similar to the Irish film, even if its two main actors are the British. This, of course, is well done of its kind and may have broken the tendency that Irish films are really not very good. ; (Fallen Breath, written by the brilliant young playwright Conor MacPherson, is the crucial exception.) Unfortunately, this story of fundamentalism originated in a fictional Irish city, presumably in the north of Ireland, judging by the emphasis (Middle Ulster's Bible belt, if you ask me), and probably in the recent past (fifties and sixties). ?), so excessive, that it is really quite ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the film sounds believable, and you can't help but feel that his writer, Dara Carvill, was heavily influenced by Flannery O'Connor and that all this might make more sense if if it were in the American biblical belt, not in Ireland, where even the most extreme Protestant fundamentalist has never been as mad as this one. All of this meant being sullen in the spirit of the great gignol, and this is certainly true, although I was more inclined to giggle than Frisson, on the mischief of the right-seeker Matthew Macfeiden. He has an outdated emphasis on Ulster, and there is nothing wrong with his acting or even that Daniel Mace as his brother, Gerard McSorley as his father, or Eva Raimistl as Mace's wife, but the script is so terribly made that good acting can not do anything to save the film. So, instead of going upstairs to the Irish cinema "Middletown", I'm afraid this is just another nail in the coffin.
