I signed up for IMDb solely for the purpose of warning others about this film. Does anyone ever get funding for such projects? This is a mystery. Farewell to Harry can be the worst movie ever, except for the fact that I tried to erase others who are competing with this disgusting idiocy. A bad plot, untrustworthy logic runs everywhere. I can't spoil this movie for you by showing something that will make your experience less enjoyable. This movie is nothing pleasant. I have a CD and I will send it to you for free, it's so bad. Come first, just serve. If I know you, this offer is invalid, because I would not impose this film on anyone, not on purpose. YOU WERE WARNED.
