really terrible movie about the 30-meter shark. bad story bad discussions bad characters bad storyline even tangled finale. I thought it was a television movie, but then I realized that it’s not something I can’t imagine paying for watching this crap, please avoid this movie at all costs. even if you like the jaws that I usually did, I don’t see it, even if you have interests in paleontology, don’t watch it, even if you like banal films with banal actors, banal scenes during stupid television, do mankind a favor I repeat, DO NOT pollute your mind with this ridiculous excuse for a fantastic action movie, yet some people gave him a dozen ranting ... I do not know whether they are serious or not (but sincerely expect that they were not)
