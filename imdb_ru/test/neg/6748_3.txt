Well, here's the thing - in order for this film to work, you will have to accept the following - the dead woman is alive again at the end of the film, the detective stops interrogating the bride of the dead woman, because the newspaper reporter asked him the wrong one and the same reporter struck by a beautiful blonde who was summoned to the night court for suspicious behavior, he eventually married her in exchange for the judge letting her off the hook. Do you follow me on this? I can't tell you how many times I stopped and rewound the picture to repeat scenes that simply had no meaning. In the end, the blonde (Claudia Dell) and the reporter (Richard Hemingway) remained married, but I have no idea how they came to that decision. In fact, I can't understand how the director came to the decision to make this film. Oh, I suppose there is some entertaining value here only for nonsense nonsense, but it would be nice if at least a couple of pieces fit. However, I am not ready to add this list to my top ten. I think a nightclub scene with feathered ladies could have saved her. But why was this in the movie? I just do not know.
