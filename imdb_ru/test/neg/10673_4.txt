Frank Tashlin's “Censorship” is a so-called short-length short-length series “Snaf”, the purpose of which is to teach the Censor to prevent the leakage of military secrets. Snafu is trying to convey to his girlfriend a message that he will be in the South Pacific, but Censor prevents each attempt to send a letter. These early scenes are the best, because the invisible Censor tears the letter from the sky with the help of long mechanical arms, nets and even a specially hired eagle! The second half of the cartoon, in which Snaf manages to send a letter using the First Class Technical Fairy (which actually teaches him a lesson), is less funny and ends with the disappointing “only a dream” ending. The main attraction of this part of the cartoon is the appearance of extremely poorly dressed girlfriend Snaf, which is even visible with bare breasts, although with strategically placed limbs all the time! Aimed at the military, Snafu shorts were often characterized by heightened resilience, but these scenes, no matter how brittle, are by far the most erotic in any of these shorts I've encountered. Despite all this, I prefer Snafu shorts, which are more suited to the jugular, usually leading to the death of the protagonist. Excellent examples of this can be found in the “Golden Brick” of Turkey or Chuck Jones's “Spies”. "Censorship" is rather weak in comparison.
