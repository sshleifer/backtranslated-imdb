Unfortunately, between this film "In the Valley of Elah", "Lions for Lambs" and "House of the Brave", everything seems to be based on common stereotypes about war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan. Drunkenness, fights, short circuits, broken marriages, guys go crazy and dig a trench in their yard when they are drunk, etc. And so on. D. And so on. <br /> <br /> This happens - yes, but not as often as you might think after watching any of these films. I think it’s a pity that these directors / producers / writers prefer to grind their ax against the political establishment, portraying the soldiers in such an atypical way. In this particular film, Kimberly Pierce did not even throw bones at us, like a show of new children who were born when a family member was deployed, or a child who grew up in some kind of ghetto who now can afford to college, thanks to the bill G. or a couple who can afford a house, or start a new business, earn their citizenship, etc., etc., etc. Instead, we treat stereotypes, because the people who made this film want to show you just have a bad side. /> <br /> A few problems with the film itself: 1) someone screwed up, putting Philip on the Bronze Star with V after he led his squad along a narrow alley after it was disguised by a militant in a taxi. Pretty silly, but yes, it happens. 2) the Hamvees did not have a turret armor, so we must assume that it is close to the beginning of the war, but does every soldier and their brother have ACOG and all possible investments for their M4? sorry, I don’t think so 3) Timothy Olyphant with the rank of lieutenant colonel? It's hard to believe, but I just checked that he turned 40 in May, so the time is not too bad. 4) He hit two soldiers to avoid him landing in prison, saying that he would not return to Iraq (upon finding out that he had been lost). So he is a fugitive. Then, when he finally surrenders, and they take him back, will he retain his rank and turn around with the same squad? Sorry, I don't think so. <br /> <br /> I can only describe it as one giant stereotype of the army and infantry. Do some of the events in this film happen to some soldiers, yes. However, in this film you get almost every stereotype for about 100 minutes, and in fact, everything is just not the case for most returning soldiers. I would like the director to explore a little better, rather than start on her agenda, and then make a film. <br /> <br /> Of the films I mentioned at the beginning of this post, the best is probably Lions for Lambs, which is more a commentary on the sad state of the Y + generation than on the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan or the administration Bush If you really want to see this movie in anticipation of cable television or Netflix, do not pay directly for rent.
