It was a typical female prison film. I thought the women were very sexy and the clothes were gorgeous. Everything that the camera did was focused on women, and women were always in provocative postures for the camera, and they were always poorly dressed (which I loved). This is your main film about the prison of the 70s. All I can say about this film is that it is very stupid, but women are gorgeous, and their asses are gorgeous!
