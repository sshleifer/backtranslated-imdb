After seeing this horrible 82-minute excuse for the film and earlier trying to knock me out after watching the next James Toback mess called “When they love me,” I came to the conclusion that he has the best agent in the world. How else are these badly written, painfully directed pieces of garbage can be made in the first place. <br /> <br /> I like Robert Downey Jr., but maybe his participation in this film led him to substance abuse. <Br /> <br /> Heather Graham must be embarrassed by his zombie performance. Half the time when the camera is on it, it just looks in a daze. <br /> <br /> Such a shitty scenario. Get ready for Hollywood's abundance of falling names (example: five-minute twisty discussions about Denzel Washington's actions ... and so on. He spends most of his time in the novel of skeet, which he hates. When asked why he keeps shooting at the skete, if he hates him so much, he replies that it makes you do time SOON, and he will have a longer life. Well ... if you really want to feel how time flows, watch this movie! I swear ... 82 minutes will be sound longer than 4 hour David Lin's village. It goes on and on and on and on and on ... <br /> <br /> I hope I’ll never watch another James Toback movie again.If I could give it without stars, I would.
