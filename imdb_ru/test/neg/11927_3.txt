The science fiction animated series MTV "Fluon Flux" came to life when Charlize Theron plays the main character, a freedom fighter who struggles with oppression in the city-fortress of Bregna 400 years later. During her last mission, she was sent to kill the city’s leader, Trevor Goodchild (Marton Chokas), but along the way she reveals secrets. <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux falls into the category of a good premise, a mediocre performance. An interesting story so far, the film was a bit boring. Many people say that this is one of the worst films of the year, and it’s not at all. This may be a disappointing movie, but at best it is an average movie. I have never seen the animated version of the film, so I can not compare them. Probably better because they have a chance to explain the story more. The film is not so confused, but it is easy to get lost if you are not familiar with the material. The game was fine, nothing special. Charlize Theron gives a good presentation and seems to be dedicated to the film. The rest of the cast also gives decent performances, including Johnny Lee Miller, Francis McDormand and Marton Chokas. The film also has several interesting characters, including Sithhandra, a friend of Eon. <br /> <br /> The problem with Aeon Flux is that he takes himself too seriously. He carries the same serious tone throughout the entire film, and it is a bit tiring. There is no humor, and the film gets a little boring at times. This is the same problem as Electra. Because the film is so serious, the dialogue sounds silly, and the serious scenes seem forced. The scenes are pretty good, but this is not what the film really is about, so don't just wait for the action movie. The turn at the end isn't stunning, but it's still a good ending and better than other thrillers that came out last year (Hide and Seek). The costumes are a bit strange, but they look beautiful and interesting. Visual effects were also made well, so the film at least looks beautiful. Thus, a film can be an example of style, not content. It is interesting to see, but it may not delay your attention for a very long time. In the end, this is not the best movie, but it can be a decent rental. Rating 4/10
