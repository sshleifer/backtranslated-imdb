^^ contains spoilers ^^ <br /> <br /> This film is complete nonsense. Do not look. <br /> <br /> In this film, there is no one who could get sick or even love other than his wife, and she wins by default. All egoists, and many things have no meaning. <br /> <br /> At best, a mediocre game, and everyone breathes too much about everything. No one can even cry plausibly. <br /> <br /> If you leave the room at least for a second, something completely different from the position of the left margin will occur, and it DOES NOT FEEL ALL. <br /> <br /> For example, I left the room for a second while the character Jenny Garth slept with his manager. I returned seriously after 4 minutes (I'm also pretty sure that there was an advertisement somewhere), and she sleeps with this guy from Berko. <br /> <br /> I gave up this movie around the time when Berko was an ass for his fiance in the car, because she didnâ€™t want to cancel the wedding. <br /> <br /> I wasted 2 hours of my life. You should not.
