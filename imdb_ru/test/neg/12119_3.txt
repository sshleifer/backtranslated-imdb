I liked so much the last film of Bellocchio, the masterpiece "L'Ora di Religione". He had a great script, great actors (well, I must say, Castellitto is much better than others), great use of light for great cinematography. <br /> <br /> Well, Buongiorno Notte is another story. A ridiculous scenario, spewing tons of morality (and we could talk about politics for weeks, you know, we are Italians ...). Bad cinematography (it's too easy to imagine the dark years of the 70s with dark colors and dark light, make some effort for more people !!!!). Misuse of music: what's the point of using psychedelia to represent the tragic rationality of Brigate Rosse? <br /> <br /> And to everyone who claimed the main prize in Venice, I answer: “Have you lost your mind? ?? ”Maybe the Russian film was bad, but not as bad as this one. <br /> <br /> I got sick of P.E. Do not believe deception !!!!
