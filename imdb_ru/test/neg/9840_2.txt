"Nicodemus" is almost a copy of "Red" in a strange sense of behavior, but this episode focuses on other people in the unpredictable life of Clark Kent. When a poisonous flower finds its way to Smallville, Jonathan Kent first begins to amaze him. the flower makes people change their behavior, and when he acts on Jonathan, he becomes hot-tempered and violent, but Clark manages to stop him from doing something rash, until his father finally collapses. Good. So far, so good. Next is Lana. The episode was good up to this point, because the flower makes her try to seduce Clark. at the last moment he refuses her, but the damage has already been done. This episode causes the wrong impression and is not suitable for people under the age of twenty because of the content for adults. the first part was good, the last part (focusing on the influence that the flower has on Pete) was good, but the middle, which was connected with Lana's alternative personality, was defiantly not, and it destroyed what could be a brilliant Episode. I give this Episode two.
