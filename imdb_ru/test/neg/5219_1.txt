Well, Chuck Norris has appeared in many entertaining films over the years. This is not one of them. I will not even try to understand the plot that sending the Bible went wrong. The “game” of the main characters is so wooden that Pinocchio would have done better! The synth-based soundtrack is even worse than the Deathstalker. Taking into account that traditionally low-budget creepy movies often try to attract their audience by adding a lot of graphic violence, this one tries to attract an audience by throwing a religious mambo giant into the audience. The plot comes down to different versions of the Bible.
