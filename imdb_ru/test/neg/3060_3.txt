It's too kind to call this the “fictional” tale of the Barker gang. They have the right names, but that's all. <br /> <br /> Russell is still hot, I'll give it to you, but this is not the real Ma Barker, who mainly took care of the boys, preparing and helping when they move around the country, not by planning or participating in crimes . I think it would be much more interesting to present the real story of a middle-aged woman who turned out to be in the criminal activities of her children and their associates. <br /> <br /> I also have to agree with those reviewers who found the scenes of gunfire absolutely unbelievable. The Barker / Karpis victims were a combination of innocent and law enforcement agents chasing them, but they definitely didn’t mow down half a dozen FBI agents every time they were cornered. (On the other hand, as reported in several recent books, the FBI of that era emphasized that agents only come from legal or accounting records to the extent that many agents have very little experience of law enforcement or weapons. Trained agents we are removing today . <br /> <br /> But the worst of all sins is that the film is mostly boring. Nobody changes, no one grows. We know that the end of the road lies ahead, we just don’t know what kind of a shootout it will be. br /> <br /> Only for loyal fans of Russell.
