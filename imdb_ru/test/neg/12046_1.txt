I went to see this movie in the theater and paid the money, thinking that it would be at least a little funny. The only thing I liked about it was when Robin Williams crashed into a car at the foot of a hill, and the end, when he seemed killed. Glenn Close was nasty, and she clearly did not look old enough to be Garp's mother. A mother like Garp would have taken the children from the Children's and Family Affairs Department. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams and his good-looking glazed donut are too sweet and smart for me. He has two roles that he can play: a funny person or a sad, tragic, kindhearted victim. See Fisher King, Good Morning, Vietnam, and all his so-called “dramatic” roles. It is always the same performance. Connect them all in one long mini-series. Glenn Close is always a cold fish. Remember the fatal attraction? Would you have an affair with her even on your worst day and if you were single? Did you feel any spark between her and Michael Douglas? Have you ever seen Glenn Close warm up your screen? John Lithgow played the only interesting role. That was the day he played the serial killers and the bad guys, so seeing him as a transsexual was at least funny. Garp was created for all those people who like to watch films about sick, abnormal, incapable people, and then claim that it is beautiful and deep.
