My mom made me watch this movie with her. She will obviously watch anything with vampire advice. I was bored everywhere. <br /> <br /> At different points, “Underworld”: “Rise of the Lycans” reminds Spartak, “Battle for the Planet of the Apes”, “Passion of the Christ” and “Mandingo”! Most of all I am reminded of those Italian images of swords and sandals from the sixties (not the nicest) that spend an inordinate amount of time, showing Greek or Roman despots in clothes, talking and drawing continuously, while you look forward to a muscular man, a hero and his lover, daughter of despots doing something. <br /> <br /> This film desperately needed some color and tension. The characters were pretty two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The sets looked like they were built entirely from pewter! I wonder how many chess sets from the time of the Civil War melted to make this film? <br /> <br /> All those who wear fishnet stockings and black lipstick, do not hesitate to press NO.
