Tyra and the rest of the modeling world need to know that real women, like me and my daughter, don't want to see all these ridiculous models to sell something. Strange places, too much makeup and too much skin is not needed. Sex is not always for sale when you sell to women. The same goes for a walk along the runway that looks unnatural. People come in different shapes and sizes, and they must have this on the show. My daughter has a 36-inch inner seam, she is tall and slender and has a size of 5, I am over medium size 12. We would like to see both. I can not imagine how something will look on me, when it will be size 2, it will not fit me. I no longer buy magazines, because they are one-sided in this matter. We would very much like women of all sizes to participate in the show. Thank.
