Worst movie I've ever seen. Like other honest reviewers, this is just a reason to pull out the naked birds with their jars. Do not get me wrong, naked women - this is not bad, but for this there is another film genre. <br /> <br /> Guys, be careful. I sold it to my friend as a classic bike gangster festival (because of the reviews) to meet him with every other scene full of naked women who bustle around this place. A slap for me. <br /> <br /> What makes me laugh the most is that all the bike dives they made in the film were full of models with cosmetic work - what are their biker bars? They are usually slightly exhausted with tattoos and much more slack jugs! Absolutely unreal. The action is terrible, a lot of meaningless curses and a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> Has anyone tested Winnie Jonesâ€™s attempt to focus on the American accent? It's as embarrassing as his football skills. <br /> <br /> Avoid the plague. The only reason you will watch this film is if you are a young guy who cannot access p @ rn and chose him from the collection of his parents' films for several perverted blows!
