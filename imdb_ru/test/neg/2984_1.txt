I saw this movie last night, and I almost cried. No, it's not because it is completely petrified, no. It was absolutely horrible! Sometimes you see films that make you think about what will happen to the human race in the near future - this film is one of those. As if the writer, actors, director and others just got together, copied and pasted scenes of their favorite horror films, sealed everything together and said: “Hey, Satan’s whip !!!” Having watched this movie, I could not help but suffer from the sight of people who call themselves "actors"; waltz as if they were some talented literary translators ... do not be fooled, they suck! Do not waste your time and money !!!
