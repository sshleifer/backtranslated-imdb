This TV show is an idiotic waste of time if you want to find out <br /> <br /> about animals and watch the discovery channel. If you want to watch <br /> <br /> on nincompoops TV, just watch MTV. MTV is a music television. <br /> <br /> Hateful D-lists, performing backward parodies, or stupid children, crying with their hearts for not getting BMW for their 16th birthday. I bet <br /> <br /> that if you like this show, I bet you love Viva-la-Bam and the donkey, right? I think my IQ dropped ten points while watching this show. <br /> <br /> This is a combination of the two shows of the donkey and the planet of animals. <br /> <br /> Some people think that this is a good combination. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I think this is a moderator. <br /> <br /> And if you notice that he looks very much like a donkey <br /> <br /> and vivu-la-bam <br /> <br /> just a note, this show is awful
