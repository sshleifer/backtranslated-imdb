I watched this movie with my friend, who ran a marathon with me, and we both had the same feeling for him: he was not terribly motivating and did not even touch on the idea of ​​what the training schedule would look like, so not marathoners could have an idea of ​​what they would need to train and run it. In fact, there was almost no technical information. I did not expect this to be a technically challenging instructional video, but when this information was close to zero, the film simply was not balanced and was not particularly useful for non-marathoners who were considering their first launch. <br /> <br /> There were other problems. Some of the very first shots are people who are crashed in death trying to start a race. Yes, it really inspires. The timing was also difficult because it was semi-chronological, but the filmmakers rarely gave you good clues as to what point in time you were watching. And they hid the information. You see that Kantor has an injury, and you just assume that this is from all her workouts, but then, after a few scenes, they finally tell you that it is because she stumbled over a pine cone in the yard. <br /> <br /> the parts were very good, like, for example, a little about a woman challenging racing officials who wanted to run only for men, and coverage of the race in Chicago, where two of the runners depicted earlier, fought for first place. <br /> <br /> On top of that, I think of other chronological documentaries, such as Supersize Me and Grass, where you always know where you are and feel that they told you everything you wanted to know. /> <br /> In short, it would not be difficult to make a better film about the marathon, and in its current form I cannot recommend it to marathoners to train and motivate them to try, because I don’t I think it will have such Effect.
