There is a lot of money behind this piece, so its appearance is very good. It includes several interesting speeches by Gilbert Roland, Eddie Burns and a short cameo at the beginning of Christopher Lee. There are some exciting shootouts and some humorous ones - a satire on Django, a Man without a name and Sabat are funny, especially when they are given the names of unsuccessful presidents of the Mexican revolution. <br /> <The trouble is that there is no point in saturating a spaghetti western as it is done here. The key element in Spaghettis is IRONY, which fits easily into comedy; In fact, the source of all spaghetti is Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which is universally recognized as one of the greatest black comedies of all time, and most spaghetti easily jumped over the edge into a real comedy of a very complex variety. Perhaps the best proof of this can be found in the films “Trinity”, in which there is both “Spaghetti” and comedy. So why saturate the genre, which by its very nature saturates itself? Consequently, I found the whole enterprise essentially unconvincing. None of these characters were people I had ever cared about, the story was a common cliche, and production values ​​reflected only the money involved, not the director's passion. In general, a banal and useless attempt to cash in on this phenomenon.
