Viewers of independent films know that once or twice a year they will watch stories about dysfunctional families, and they expect them, and it becomes harder to keep them fresh, but here, despite the good cast, it seems that more is the same. The story of the Travis family, which is trying to recover from Matt's suicide (Kip Pardou), who was a very promising swimmer in high school. Ben (Jeff Daniels) is a father who leaves everyone and has never treated his second son Tim (Emile Hirsch) in the same way as Matt, but he communicates (kind of) with his mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver), who finds his own hiding place pot and starts to smoke it. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER WARNING ***** Sandy also starts flirting with much younger men, such as a cashier at a grocery store, but when she tries to buy more marijuana, she is arrested and sent to prison. She doesn’t tell anyone about what happened, but discovers bruises on Tim’s body, as well as the fact that Ben quit his job. After all this, Sandy falls ill and goes to the hospital where her life is in danger, forcing Ben to realize that he may have to accept the loss of another part of his family. <br /> <br /> This film was written and directed by Dan Harris, who worked with Brian Singer on X2, as well as on the upcoming Superman movie, and while his script allows these characters to experience authentic moments of their pain and confusion, in the story (for me) too many things added. The scenario involves so many different areas that you need a scorecard to track them all, including drugs, sex, love, infidelity, abuse, neglect, experiments with homosexuality and life-threatening illnesses. If you lacked all of these scenarios, Harris, then at the end, resort to turning the plot, which should summarize and explain most of everyone’s feelings for Tim. Although I still rolled my eyes at least 2 or 3 times due to the way the script spun one thing after another, I must admit that I did not hate this film, and I have to thank the actors for it. Everyone has at least one good scene somewhere in the film, but I would like the story to focus more on Weaver and its character than on Hirsch. Weaver is exceptional, and with a sharper scenario she could play a role that could possibly lead to an Oscar nomination, but instead we get Hirsch's endless scenes at parties or his machinations with a neighbor next door. Harris shows that he can be a good writer / director, but with this effort he just throws so many different things into the audience that the material just becomes laborious and contrived.
