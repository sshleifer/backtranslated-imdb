Pistol is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The direction of the comedians is very bad, the dialogues sound as if they were written by a 13-year-old teenager, the plot (what plot?) Is another “indecision” that is very difficult to get into. Finally, nothing in this film is any good. Many thanks to all who participated in this, and especially the Montreal Film Festival, which presented this film in competition!
