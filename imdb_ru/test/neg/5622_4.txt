Another film that will punish us for the crime of enjoying "Pulp Fiction." <br /> <br /> If you like to watch people kill with a machine gun for an hour and a half, it will probably meet all the requirements. Fans of the debut episode "Aeon Flux", in which the title character kills literally thousands of seemingly faceless soldiers alone, will really go for it. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is not a very smart movie. In fact, all this is the reason for a handful of young people to act rudely and shoot people. Sometimes the whole scene passes, and the only thing that happens is you guessed it! someone will be shot. Or, to revive the situation, they will shoot twenty people. First, they just sit there, the next minute they sit there dead. Yahoo! <br /> <br /> Rough plot: a young American goes to Paris (American in Paris, you know?), Hires a prostitute (unearthly Julie Delpy), associated with some old French friends, one who has AIDS, they plan and try rob a bank. Of course, the cinema agreement says that not a single bank robbery on film takes place without a hitch, and this hitch takes about three-quarters of the time it takes to work (it's like “A dog's day after dinner” without Syd Lumet's wit, patience or humanity). ). Being in a bank, things are not going well (surprise!), And a Parisian with AIDS went crazy several times with his Uzi. There are no spoilers here, but suffice it to say that you are at such an emotional distance from these characters that you hardly care who lives and who dies by the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Some have called it stylish. Perhaps this is true, but this is someone else's style, this is already a film made, and “The Murder of Zoe” fell into the trap of the convention. Nowhere during the film, the director (Roger Avari, co-winner of the Oscar's Pulp Fiction) does not do anything really original, stylish, cool or outrageous. If you do not take into account the fact that there was not such a large number of bodies in any film made in a bank, nothing else to distinguish this film from the set.
