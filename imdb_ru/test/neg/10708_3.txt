This film is terrible to the incredible. This is a low-budget, poorly written, meaningless trash. But on Saturday afternoon, when I stumbled upon it on TV, it still remains in my memory as one of the most interesting that I have ever seen on TV. The badness of this movie is epic - maybe not epic Ed Wood, but close. Making hysterical (men are forbidden for being too dangerous and imprisoned in football stadiums), pseudo-diy culture is ridiculously bizarre (there is an underground sex trade with women who dress like men to serve "deviants" the names are a miserable reincarnation of Rocky from Rocky Horror. I never saw the end, which I suppose was so full of syrup "what did we all learn from this?" it was so memorable bad sales if the last third was a pale imitation of the others, it's still worth it for anyone who gets a kick out of stupid, stupid, brainless science fiction.
