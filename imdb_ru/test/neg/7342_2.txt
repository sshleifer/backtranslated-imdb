I'm shocked by all the good reviews on the cover of this film and on IMDb. It belongs in a $ 2 basket at your local video store. To say that this is film B is extremely generous. <br /> <br /> In addition to the lack of a single character that can be traded, only a little better than the average acting skills, and the quality of the image of the terrible style of the 80s, the script of this film is boring and lifeless. This film is not only boring, but pathetic. (It must be admitted that sometimes a little interesting chemistry appears between the two main characters.) Even the final plot twist - rather, the only plot twist - does not save this film. <br /> <br /> Diamond People Rental â€œIf you must, but do not hesitate to turn it off as soon as you appreciate its uselessness. 2 out of 10.
