But even caricatures need a believable storyline. I believe that in 1934 part of this audience would have enjoyed this cool farce long ago. It does not age well. This gives experienced and experienced Nat Pendelton and Zasu Pitts players the opportunity to play major roles. Pendelton, who occupies a prominent place in the TV series Thin Man, tries his best, but he lacks a stupid conspiracy. With the background, which is a stage game with gangsters, this is not really original material. The grace of the film is always the excellent Edward Everett Horton in a wasted performance. But don't waste your time watching Everett in this movie. I would advise anyone to watch his efforts on vacation with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. The same era of 1936, but a much better script and plot. Better plugs and, of course, star power.
