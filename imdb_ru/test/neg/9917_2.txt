I was sitting at home and switching channels when I came across what potentially sounded like an interesting movie. I like movies like “Destruction” and I decided to watch them. I don't know why, but in the end I watched it for 2 hours. We have seen this type of film, I do not know how many times. <br /> <br /> Back in 1998 and 2000, there were several dozen films that featured some sort of global destruction. At the moment, the best on my list is Deep Impact, which was more believable than this one. Here are my problems with this movie: 1) cheap special effects, like something from an old computer. 2) there is no background information or explanation of weather conditions. If you're going to make a movie about the weather, at least it's decent to entertain the viewer with technical details. 3) Why do only 2 or 3 people find out that the storm is approaching Chicago ... there are no more experts in this area? 4) Where are some interesting characters? I really do not care about anyone except maybe a pregnant woman. I felt that there was no character development. 5) without thinking about the moment that so forever and in fact is the wrong topic. And this is only the first part of the film. I can bet that the conclusion will show us several scenes of destruction and a search and rescue operation, as it was done many times before. And judging by the special effects in the first part of the film, I can only imagine what to expect. Of course, in the end, the main characters will survive and life will continue ... as originally
