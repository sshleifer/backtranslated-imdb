I would argue that the “Magnificent Seven Returns” (MSR) monthly salary was made for television. Other reviewers confirm that MSR was a theatrical film, and I take my word for it. The logical answer is to assume that it was originally shot for television, and after a change of studio heart, it was released theatrically. Every actor is primarily a television actor: Mariette Hartley, Michael Cullen, Ralph Waite, Stephanie Powers ... all television performers. Lee Van Cleef divided his time between television and theater screens. Stephanie Powers has made only 3 or 4 “real” movie appearances in the past thirty years of a very fruitful television career - proof that this was filmed for television. Minor players - veteran actors on a small screen, which can be seen on the old replays “Gunsmoke”, “Wild Wild West”, “Streets of San Francisco” and so on. <br /> <br /> Ho-Hum suites are identical to the Universal Studios Tour, which can often be seen on old episodic TV shows. And editing produces a “rush TV-1-two-three times” with limited camera movement, positioning, cutting and lighting. Soundtrack, excluding the original themes of Berstein, directly from the television of the seventies. Yes, I would argue that the money was withdrawn for television. <br /> <br /> This is an important point in evaluating the MSR. At first I watched MSR on cable, suggesting that it was an old theatrical release. Compared to the original “The Magnificent Seven,” this is a joke, a cartoon, an amateur attempt to make a film. Acting, lighting, writing, settings, action, cinematography, music (excluding Berstein's themes), editing, stimulation, ... back and forth .... everything is pale compared to the classic "Magnificent Seven", which is close to a perfect western and one of the best action movies of all time. <br /> <br /> However, as I suspect, the film made for television in the early 70s is actually better than average. Those who are not lucky enough to survive the 70s as adults know what I am talking about. MSR would compete with Alias ​​Smith and Jones and similar online shows. During the seventies, “Gunsmoke” was a quality show, which focused on the development of characters, rather than actions, which minimized the shootout to two shootings per week. The first shooting, usually killing, triggers the plot of the hour - the second firefight ends with an episode, killing the guest star, his sworn enemy, or otherwise resolving the conflict with Marshal Matt Dillon. MSR has more action than the whole "Gunsmoke" season. In this light - in this frame of reference - MSR is a passable entertainment, far surpassing the television rates of that decade.
