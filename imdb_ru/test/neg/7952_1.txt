... or is it another way below the masterpiece of the bottom? It is desirable both! Somewhere between 1969 and 1972, there were several horrible horror films that were almost lost again. There is no need to explain anything, ask or shout loudly. If you closely follow my writings on the Blood Carnival or GURU THE MAD MONK, then you know what awaits you with SCREAM BABY SCREAM. The name sounds cool; it's just a weak script that should have gone somewhere else! However, this is hands down, the most awfully written piece of cinematic prowess ever worked on a movie! <br /> <br /> If you think that this is an early slasher (which helps the average IMDb user to write another comment), you will be lucky next time! The real truth behind the script, NOTHING has anything to do with the film, which allegedly tells about a blue-faced psychopath who “kills” and makes ugly facial sculptures on his victims. It feels like you're watching another early episode of "SCOOBY-DOO". My favorite scene is a monkey cage in which four young hippie teens play. And hurray to the actress under the name "Eugene Wingate" because she gave us the worst face makeup! 1969 has never been so bad, but it is! <br /> <br /> Try to find this 30-year-old rarity in a cheap five dollar basement; This is the perfect innovation to return to those psychedelic days of floral power, bad fashion and crappy music! An interesting note: SCREAM BABY SCREAM is also listed in the Troma film archive on the company's website. Only time will tell when it reaches the top of the Bottom 100 list, along with a few more cheap ones from the early 70s; Gosh, they MUST !!! PLAN 9 is history !!!
