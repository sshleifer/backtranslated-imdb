Thomas Winterbergs "De St√∏rste Helte" is another road film without the most important element of the film: a good story. Characters are not very original and not particularly interesting. Especially Thomas Bo Larsen is a pain in the neck, playing the same role that he has played in the past few years and which he repeated in Festen - he seems to think he is acting - he is angry and shouts at others! The film does not make much sense and is not very funny - although it struggles to be "weird" and "weird." If you are going to make a road movie, why not add something original to this genre ?!
