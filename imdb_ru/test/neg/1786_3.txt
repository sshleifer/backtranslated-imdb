This movie starts the way every movie should start, with a bunch of hot kids in a dorm who walk in their underpants and / or topless. A few of them take a shower. I like it so far! Unfortunately, then we meet or the main characters. They are simply not particularly pleasant. Usually in these films, the actresses do not actually play, they give very “natural” performances, and they are rather sympathetic, funny and pleasant. Not here. They have no particular individuality, and I didn’t really care about them. <br /> <br /> Some girls go to school. On the way, they stop at a gas station and meet a biker gang. The biker gang really should have been excluded from the film - it used to be stupid, but now it's just stupid. The top biker looks like a middle-aged guy dressed like Jon Bon Jovi on Halloween. The girls go into the forest, and then followed by a gang of bikers. <br /> <br /> I don't know what the hell happens after that. There are many things about the end of the world, because this is the end of the millennium, and then some bikers are killed by a mysterious Indian dude who continues to disappear. Someone eats loaths Loksa Ness Monster when he swims across the lake. Some guy in a stupid makeup is obviously a druid, and he needs to sacrifice some girls to warn the end of the world. Or maybe the end of the world, I'm afraid I did not pay much attention. First, he puts the girls in lingerie from the skin of the animal. <br /> <br /> It could have been a really funny cheese movie, but the biker gang spoiled the atmosphere and the plot was so scattered that it didn’t even justify the expectations of my Z schlock class. They really had to eliminate half the plot elements and just focus on one or two things. Instead, it's all over the place. In general, if you are looking for a late nuts '80, I think you could make it worse. If you tried very hard. In the beginning there are a lot of naked people, but the characters are a little obscene, and the plot is too pointless to satisfy at least a little.
