Danny Lee’s performance as a magician cop is the only attraction in this film, even though it has a great cast, including Chow Yun-Fat, Carina Lau, Andy Lau, Shing Fuy-On and Alex Man. CYF plays the triad boss, who wants to live in a peaceful and abundant life, but Alex Man, a complete psycho who is very unhappy with the CYF, will not allow him. CYF is trying to escape to Malacca, but to no avail. After his family was scattered into pieces, his close friends were killed or deserters, injured and beaten, CYF returns to Hong Kong to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Sounds much better than it actually is. CYF is well dressed and handsome, looks hurt, grimaces and screams on the cue, but anyway, you just don't care. Andy Lau looks great, but that's all. Karina Lau has a tiny, tiny part that was good, but she gets a bullet in the head early to finish it. Alex Man is an animated villain, he is so frantic that sometimes he can be intriguing, but the text here is so flat that he just looks like a garden variety. <br /> <br /> Danny Lee is great though - it’s a pity that on the screen of this dark (literally) boring movie it’s just a small splash. <br /> <br /> Rent, do not buy. Or just skip it completely. <br /> <br /> This is a sequel to “The Rich and Famous,” although it appears that it was filmed simultaneously; This was released first due to the power of the CYF box.
