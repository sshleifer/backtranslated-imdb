My brother and I are very big fans of Asian cinema, so when I found this film hidden in the store, I bought it on DVD, because it sounded very promising, and I could not wait to watch it. So I watched this movie with my brother, and I must say that in the beginning it was very promising. We both really liked this brutal ballroom scene in the first scene. But I think that was all. There are some interesting fights, but this is not an action movie, as he claims. Instead, it's a film about love ... with such a cliche of love that is so incredibly played out that even Shakespeare will wrest this title. Sorry for my language. By the way: do the characters act as if they were picked up from the street and given 100 ?? for playing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, me and my brother watched it to the end, because we thought it could only get better. But damn it, it never happened. This film took the first place in the list of the “worst films that have ever seen” for me and my brothers, followed by “Fantasy mission Force” - do not watch it either.
