I laughed at the movie! Scenario, acting, please, don't we deserve the best? But now on the set some camera angles turned out to be interesting. I liked the movie, but you can't take it seriously. I like it. If he had a new roster and screenwriter, it would be better than everything is in order. It is worth a look!
