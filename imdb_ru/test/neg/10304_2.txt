Fox is pretty lame. They cancel the wrong shows. It is strange that they canceled a well-written program, such as "Arrested Development", and yet they keep this show and "War at Home". I feel that Fox liked that they overcame barriers with the then sharp “Married with Children”, but now it's just ridiculous. “The Loop” is a meaningless and boring watch, and their sharp jokes just fall apart. In order for a sharp comedy to work, you have to keep joking. "Family Guy" and "The Simpsons" work because they are constantly joking. Fox needs to pull the heads out of the cavities of the rectum and stop letting their relatives write this mediocre deception. I mean, if you are going to invest in doing something interesting, make it interesting. Also, stop using “nameless” actors. It's great that there are newbies, but you need to put on a show with a famous celebrity. Spirit Fox.
