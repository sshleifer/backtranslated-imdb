JP3 is missing Spielberg's touch. This is a full-scale attack on the senses involving the dinosaurs "on your face." Watching this movie was a bit like a rollercoaster ride from hell. <br /> <br /> The screenplay is lame; he asks at the same time, and then leaves too many unanswered questions. In addition, we really do not appreciate the people in the film for everything they stand for. For example, William Macy is too talented to compete with dinosaurs for our attention. And Laura Dern was especially sympathetic at JP1; in this film, it is barely noticeable on the radar screen. <br /> <br /> The whole experience of JP3 was very big. Too much noise, too many surprises, too many dying characters, too much predictable, unreasonable violence. <br /> <br /> Word wise: vote for this island. <br /> <br /> (I received 3 points for special effects; I took the remaining 7 points for the lack of originality.)
