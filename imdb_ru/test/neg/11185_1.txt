How do I describe the horrors? !!! First, a few points: first, this review should be taken with a crumb of salt - I saw it more than 20 years ago when I was a boy, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I distribute some scenes and plot points. However, he does not have a big plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, I donâ€™t like these movies. <br /> <br /> This film was shot by the proto-author Louis. Bunuel. He was a surrealist and a dadaist. These were modern themes or movements that were critically popular in the 1920s and early 1930s. Surealism was a school of art that made things hyperreal, but often had Freudian symbolism. Dadaism is based on the fact that presumably the first word uttered by an infant is Dada or Father. <br /> <br /> Made in black and white, it was also made by a group of communists (or, as they preferred the term, socialists). Bunuel and his group of film makers and artists worked on a series of symbolic ideas and problems in Spain and France during the inter-war period. <br /> <br /> Dadaism and surrealism have influenced many artists. The police (Doo Doo Doo Da), the poet Arthur Rambo, Edward Munch (Creek), Rene Magritte (floating hats in space), Salvador Dali (melting clock) and even Hitchcock (Psycho). No Norman Rockwell. <br /> <br /> This is what I remember most about this film: a girl meets a cow; her eye is cut with a razor; clown men jump in the meadow. There is not like I said before, much of the plot, but again, this should be in this. <br /> <br /> It was attacked like porn then, and will be again today. One of the trademarks of surrealism is significant antifeminism.
