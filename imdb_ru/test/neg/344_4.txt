This film is proof that you canâ€™t just go to the Redbox and read the movie descriptions, pick one and try it. <br /> <br /> Although I will give them a high rating for making a film with Halfway decent special effects with such a low budget and at least halfway up decent scripts and storylines ... unfortunately it was just : halfway decent. <br /> <br /> If you like movies where nothing is happening, not everyone is neatly wrapped up and do not mind low-budget effects, you might like this movie. Honestly, it was not my cup of tea. I should just go to bed and not spend time watching. <br /> <br /> For a better science fiction film made with a lower budget (!), see the Primer.
