Today I had a real craving for a science fiction film, and so I decided to check out Battlespace. Unfortunately, this was one of my biggest mistakes this year. <br /> <br /> I see that director Neil Johnson made more than 500 music videos, and I believe that he is returning to this. Music videos are a great form of entertainment, and not everyone can shoot them while making movies. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this film is probably voice overs. And it says a lot, since special effects are sometimes terrible. Voice-over did not work in Blade Runner, and here it does not work. The first hour or so goes to see the main character walk through the desert, and her daughter tells a story. I think the story could have made a great movie, but not like that. <br /> <br /> The second worst part is the effects. They are just bad and do not fit into the rest of the picture, so you just do not believe in them. And absolutely all the frames in the film are filtered, and not in a good way. Filtration like effect is good. 90 minutes is bad. <br /> <br /> And what about all the gadgets that talk all the time and not fall silent!?!? If I used this technology, I would go crazy. I just waited for the weapon to collapse: “I'm sorry, but I seem to have run out of ammunition.” No, stay away. This film is simply not worth the time.
