Get Smart should be called Get Stupid. There is no funny line or gag in the whole movie. This film is so bad it makes Austin Powers films Shakespearean. A few more such films, and Steve Carell can kiss his career goodbye. As for Anne Hathaway, what does she do in this film? She is a good actress, but just terrible. <br /> <br /> The writing is pathetic. There is no funny, clever or witty line. There is no good spectacle. <br /> <br /> Directing is terrible. Comedy depends on time. Someone should say this to the director. Each line, which should be funny (and not funny), contains absolutely the worst sense of comic time I've ever seen.
