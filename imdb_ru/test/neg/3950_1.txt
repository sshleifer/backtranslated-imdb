Talk about false advertising! I wasted an hour and twenty-five minutes, watching this piece of shit, and there was not a single leisure suit, not a single platform shoe, not a sharp finger dance, or a disco ball. I watched it on Saturday night and ended up with a terrible fever, but it had nothing to do with music. <br /> <br /> Seriously, with or without John Travolta, this film sucks. <br /> <br /> At the opening you will ask yourself the question: “Where did this rope come from, and will it hang me too?” From his shameless inclination to driving in Dutch Pennsylvania to shameless advancement of seemingly perpetual battery for Alienware laptops, to cheap horror effects, shot directly in Japanese cinema, this movie was the worst in cinemas since The Grudge.
