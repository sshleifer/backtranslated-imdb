Funny movie, terrible editing work, worst scenario, funny game, a story that is completely incomprehensible ... <br /> <br /> If God would decide whether films should continue, judging by this, the entire world film industry would now be dead ... <br /> <br /> A wonderful film that shows that movies should not be made by people who “think” that they can make films. <br /> <br /> I still wonder who these two gypsy women who appear in the film for more than half an hour and never appear to us ... <br /> <br />
