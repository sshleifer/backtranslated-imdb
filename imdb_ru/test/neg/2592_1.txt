“New Hope of the Romanian Cinema” ... if this is a new hope, then I would not like to see the saving hero of such a fruitful movie (that is, the Romanian movie). Now seriously, where do I start? 1. Shitty scenario: you scoff at me, it is even implausible, not to mention a high degree of stupidity 2. Direction: in what direction? This film should have had psychological tension, at least because they decided to make it as disgusting as possible. Well, I admit that Radu Muntean is not Polanski, Hitchcock, Fincher or Lynch (the list can be continued), but at least a minimum of effort would be appreciated. 3. Language: Okie, I don’t understand why (almost) every Romanian director thinks that if you make a film as horrible and obscene as possible, you will have art. I am not against explicit language or poor image quality, as long as the end result makes it worthwhile. In this case, it is not. There is nothing to comment on, since everything that this film wants to say has already been said a thousand times, the characters are too thinly depicted to become memorable, the “shocking events” that take place are also poorly illustrated and become unimportant. This film is based only on emotions caused by itself, on the deception of "we must." Someone was found killed, so "WE MUST" feel sad, scared or panic, someone went through this and that "WE MUST" feel in a certain way. This is nonsense. Since film is fiction, nothing is real here. Thus, the only real emotions are those that you discover when you are deeply immersed in his world (that is, cinema), <br /> <br /> * / * * * * *
