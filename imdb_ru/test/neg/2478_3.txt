1) If you want to make a film that deals with social realism, it is very important that viewers identify themselves with the characters they portray. 2) The audience cannot identify with characters that are highly stereotyped or with situations that are obvious. 3) If you have a bad actor, you cannot create any character. In any case, even if you have good actors, their work will become ridiculous if you force them to speak with a fictional Andalusian accent. <br /> <br /> Jesús Ponce ignores these 3 points, and also makes some cheap jokes that don’t completely fit the place. His scenario is so predictable: a woman gets out of prison, she meets with her old boyfriend, a drug addict, cruel in life, etc. Anyway, the fact that history is everything, but original, would not be such bad, if Ponce was not a complete incompetent recording and shooting. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long they will pay money from our taxes to make films like this. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 3/10
