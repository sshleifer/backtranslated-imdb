Well, this film seems to be pretty well covered in previous comments, but I want to add a couple of things. A mad scientist produces a serum from the blood of an animal in a cage to turn a person into a werewolf. If we suspend our disbelief enough to buy it, well. But the animal in the cage is a coyote. That would make a werewolf. Didn't the viewers in 1942 know the difference between a wolf and a coyote? They are easy to distinguish from each other. This is weak. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this film was covered in the third episode of MST3k (on the channel Comedy). It took Joel and the bots a few episodes to get to their fullest, and they were not there this time. They added enough to this snooker to keep you awake, but this was not one of their best episodes. They did not even mention the blatant omission of the real wolf, and this joke just hung in the air, waiting for her to be hit.
