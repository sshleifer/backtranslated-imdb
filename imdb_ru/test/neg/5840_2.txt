This film has a premise that is good enough to get someone to talk, and an unmistakable conversation starter. “Would you sleep with someone you don’t like or don’t know for a million dollars?” While the film had great potential, poor performance transforms it into a b-grade soap opera. The film has a great start, and after the offer is made, we do enter the film, but then it drops sharply. The last 3 quarters of the film are spent so that the characters ache, complaining and regretting what they have done! The ending was so stamped that it wept! This is very similar to Vegas honeymoon, which is much better. Take a look instead.
