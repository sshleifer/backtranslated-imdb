This film is very cruel, but exciting, with original dialogue and cool characters. He has one of the most touching stories and she is very faithful to life. The film begins with the militant Leo Fong as a cop, who is nearing the end of his career when he encounters a major case involving corruption, black mail and murder. This is where the killings begin. From the start of the finish, Fong delivers this must-see action of the caper. This film also features Richard Roundtree. <br /> <br /> I really liked this film when I was a kid, but when I got older, I realized that this film was rather stupid and not very good. I would not recommend this film, and the action is very, very bad.
