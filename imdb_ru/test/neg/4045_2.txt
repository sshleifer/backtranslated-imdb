If you want to see how to spoil the film, carefully study it. In fact, it is so bad that people should buy it only for this reason. Pay particular attention to how most of the scenes look, as if they were broken in about 5 minutes. Realism avoids this film at every level. The general impression is that someone got a script below average, imitators, average director and absolutely no budget. With this formula, it is simply doomed. <br /> <br /> I once rented this place and swear I got a stupid thing watching it. If you are a humanist, buy this terrible, terrible film and burn it - NOT OBSERVED - as a service to the world. He has no conspiracy, bad behavior, and then rushes into something about evil ugly women, just to really beat everything. I would advise to see how the paint dries before this stupid waste of tape! Seriously. Paint would be better. I would like to give this negative 10 stars.
