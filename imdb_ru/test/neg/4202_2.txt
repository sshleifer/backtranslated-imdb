This is a very, very boring and uninteresting fighter, and without Chuck Norris it would be unbearable! Plus, low-budget shows are great! Some fights were good, but the story is ridiculous, and there were no terrible villains at all. The dialogue was ridiculous, I had some problems with the completion of this film, but Chuck Norris made him somewhat tolerant. I really have nothing more to say, since I paid only half the attention, because it was incredibly boring, but in the end he scored a little. The direction is terrible. Don Hewlett, does a terrible job here with a lousy photo, a terrible pace, and the whole movie looked boring! There is no blood here. It was terrible to act. Chuck Norris is very good here, he kicks that ass, and he made the film almost tolerable (Chuck rules!). George Murdoch is terrible as the main villain and very unconvincing. Terry O'Connor is decent here, and he had good chemistry with Chuck. Michael Owenstein, Chuck's decent brother. Overall, it's pretty easy to avoid! * Of 5 (Chuck saves him from the BOMB rating).
