This film, called Life in a Fast Lane, is one of the least interesting films I've seen in a long time. I think this was done with reference to the sick, perverted, and exhausted women of LA, who represent about 0.00000001 people in the States. Characters are all one-dimensional, even leading ones. After she stabs her boyfriend in the head with scissors, an attempt is made to cheaply laugh (and fail) by sticking a cork into the boy's skull to stop the bleeding. Oh, smart! Patrick Dempsey (whose films are almost always a class act — sarcasm) plays this “devil” that changes her life — but from what we have seen, her life was a series of vignettes to begin with. No emotions, no laughter, no story. The only reason I give it 2 is because Jeffrey Jones is fine as a priest, and there is a bit of style in the camera work (albeto-zero substance). Otherwise, one of the 5 worst films I've ever seen. 2 class of 10 F! I think that even the addict himself, who would have laughed at the fall of the toilet, would not have liked this film. I can not stress how much you should stay away. <br /> <br />
