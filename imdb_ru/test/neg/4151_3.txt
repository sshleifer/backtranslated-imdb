My wife and I did not get into the movie. We thought it was the path to sloooowwww and to many subtitles. I understood that they needed them for Vietnam, but it took a long time to leave Asia. it is better. Yes, they never had any problems trying to get to America, but I wanted to see how he searches and finds his father. Not at the end, but establishing relationships. I mentioned that it was slllloooowwwwww. I love to watch. In the end, I feel that films are good, not sad. I know that now they do not make a lot of good films. I think only militants are watching. I shoot a lot from netflix and now in a blockbuster, maybe 20% Worth seeing. I do not put on my knees realism or facts, just a film that entertains and makes you feel good. Gary
