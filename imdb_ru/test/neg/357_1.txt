I just watched this movie on Bravo! and it was absolutely terrible. He has the plot of the film Shannon Tweed without nude. The room was quite interesting, a winning lottery ticket in a secluded place and people who have reasons for wanting to get money. The characters were commonplace, as were the observations of human nature and greed. <br /> <br /> For the film entitled “Class War,” he had little to do with class differences, except for the first 20 minutes and a predictable end. This film could be much better if there were more characters with motivation to get a ticket, and it would be "who did it?" <br /> <br /> The game was not fantastic, but it is hard to seem believable with such a terrible scenario. Lindsay McKeon is very sweet, and I would like to see what she could do in a better production with a better script. She is probably the only reason I sat through the entire film. <br /> <br />
