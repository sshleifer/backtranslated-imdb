Terrible, terrible, terrible times, a hundred still does not begin to describe what a crappy "Biggest Loser". Imagine: take two fat couples who will not say anything interesting, humiliate them and let them work to lose weight, and all this in prime-time television. I am the only one who thinks that this is not what people with IQ in the three-digit field WANT TO LOOK? Everything goes on forever, lumps of fat complained that losing weight means so much to them and their life. Does anyone care? Do they think we care? They care, do we care? Probably no. I think I will make a video of how I do crunches and sell it to some large television corporation. If this goes for television, then my training also!
