Oh, the horror, the unspeakable horror of this film. If you can even call it a movie. It looks like some kind of first-class art school project, hastily put together. <br /> <br /> Here the “talents” will expose you to a painful mixture of mistrust and replay, and almost all the scenes were terribly contrived and pretentious. <br /> <br /> The film does not in any way reflect Malaysian culture or social conventions - no one even talks about it here. By the way, I live in Malaysia. <br /> <br /> Spinning Gasing, it seems, was created specifically to receive an award in the category of foreign films at some Western film festival. And, unfortunately, this trick seemed to work. Some reviewers would no doubt call it “exotic,” but a more accurate word would be “cruel.” <br /> <br />
