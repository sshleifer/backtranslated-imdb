I not only read the book and watched the movie, but I also acted in USS John F Kennedy when they were shooting it. Needless to say, film crews and actors may try people who are trying to do their job. Now about the film. As a professional sailor, I was very upset by the way they showed life aboard an aircraft carrier. I could highlight inaccuracies throughout the film (anyone who lived on the media could), but it would take pages. One scene stands out in particular when they were in the CIC (Combat Information Center) and watched the RADAR contact move around the screen. Each time the contact moved, he would emit a beep. Unfortunately, this equipment does not make such sounds (I was a technician on this equipment). The book is based on facts, but the film is not. The sequence in the series was just as bad, and the Navy finally realized that supporting this series would simply make them bad. If you are a naval man, watch this to see how the film about carrierâ€™s life is seen through the eyes of Hollywood. If you're not a naval man, watch Midway or Top Gun, at least these films are interesting and factual.
