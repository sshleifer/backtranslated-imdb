The film itself is just a collection of scenes that have no meaning for those who live outside of Russia. I will not deny that some of the images and methods were quite revolutionary at the time (shot in 1928), but the problem with the film is that it does not interest either intellectuals or ordinary people. We simply observe orderly images, ranging from a man who beats a horse to a toothless soldier in a war. Everything between them is clumsy, random and completely unnecessary. It would be possible to invent a forum that would interest the viewer, but this would not be the case, although the directorâ€™s method is quite ingenious. <br /> <br /> In general, you need to look at this if this art is a student who has taken hallucinogenic drugs, or a student of predtarkovskogo cinema.
