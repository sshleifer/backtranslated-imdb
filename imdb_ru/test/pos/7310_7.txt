The obedient wife Norma Shearer (like Katherine "Kitty" Brown) waits for her husband Rod La Rocca (like Bob Brown) to stretch her arms and legs. Brewing him breakfast in bed and helping him get dressed for Sunday golf, Ms. Shearer suggests joining Mr. La Roque for the whole day, noting how rarely they occur. But La Roque pushes her away, saying that her presence adversely affects his playing. Then, unexpectedly, Shearer meets the real reason for her husband's frequent passes? his cute blond lover! <br /> <br /> Three years later, Shearer is a charming, flirty divorced woman. Summer in Paris, she struck up a friendship with the rich, middle-aged lady Marie Dressler (like Mrs. "Bucci" Buchko). Miss Dressler invites Shearer to her home on Long Island to chat with friends and ask for a favor. Dressler is worried about her granddaughter's relationship with a courteous, worldly person. She wants young Sally Eilers (like Dionne) to marry Raymond Hackett (like Bruce). Realizing the flirtatious conquests of Shearer, Dressler asks her to distract an unwanted man from Miss Eilers. Shearer is stunned to discover that this man is La Rock, her ex-husband. <br /> <br /> Shearer and Dressler make this fun, entertaining game. They are in great shape, with guaranteed popular performances, with enthusiasm and professionalism. The story is stupid and predictable; nonetheless, in a way that helps a humorous situation. And the end is pretty clever. In fact, the comic "Let Us Be Gay" may have aged better than the larger and more serious Divorce film released by Shearer, which came out around the same time. Cast evenly well. La Rock is better than his film with Lilian Gish; but his role is not at all attractive. Gilbert Emery (as Tawny) and Tyrell Davis (as Wallace) are fun assistants. <br /> <br /> Those who are not familiar with Norma Shearer may not realize that it is she who acts as the debut wife in the first scenes. This is Shearer in the role of "Kitty" in front of her makeup. Take a close-up look at the Shearer with a light, natural make-up to take a good look at an intriguingly beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> ******* Let us be gay (1930) Robert Z.
