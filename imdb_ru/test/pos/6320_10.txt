I have this movie. I am actually from the same city as the fraternal directors. But that doesn't make the film any better. But, if one night you want to see something frivolous and not have high expectations, I highly recommend Demon Summer. Yes, the lines are cheese, and the plot is banal. But it contains key elements of horror / comedy. I just want to see children from a small town make a film full of effects. And I say "bravo" to the Campell brothers. Now they make more films and continue their old dream. “Demon Summer” was one of the films that will help them start a great career with a great future.
