Delightful! He never claims to be a masterpiece, but this is the mini-pearl of the British comedy of the late seventies. Considering that the producers wanted to sell it abroad, the Americans were shot in it (the late character - actor Richard Jordan), but at least he is no ordinary boring Hollywood character. Around him - the cream of British acting talent, which is headed by a wonderful husky and excellent David Niven. <br /> <br /> Ivan the Terrible Niven naturally gets the best liners and all the best reactions. He also manages to be surprisingly threatening and frighteningly dangerous. The moment in the snooker club, when he throws a charming facade and threatens Richard Jordan, will be a shock to those viewers who consider Niven to be only a bright comedy star in the living room. He is full of genuine strength and mercilessness, because we immediately see how Ivan got his nickname. All the more surprising, considering how sick Niven was at the time. Shortly after filming this film, he lost the power of speech due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (known as Lou Gehrig's disease). This is the last picture made by Niven, where you can hear his own voice, which was later duplicated by comic impressionist Sid Caesar. <br /> <br /> Next to him you can see a lot of familiar faces from the seventies film and television. Elke Sommer (shows his bosom in the politically incorrect bimbo mode of the seventies), Oliver Tobias, Michael Angelis, Brian Croucher, Davy Kaye, etc., etc. T. D. Davy Kaye laughs at one when he holds a guard caught phone call. "Who's calling you ?! Bloody Dial-A-Disc! You're a bum!" <br /> <br /> Great shots of London streets; Turning the film into a vintage time capsule from a red telephone booth with short hand-held handsets with a round dial and black cabs, driven by "Cor blimey, gov!" Cockney, and ladies and gentlemen, modeling all sorts of deeply dodgy retro-fashionable clothes and hairstyles of the late seventies. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the earlier-era Ealing’s classic comedies, the “hero” is allowed to commit crimes and escape in the sun. How times have changed! The code of morality, according to which scammers in films should always have seemed punished, long passed the seventies, when antiheroes, such as Pinky Green, deserved their status for their daring anti-authoritarianism and their determination to “cheer up” on the stifling capitalist. the creation of suitable fat businessmen cats. We are encouraged to greet when Pinky runs away, with impunity and freedom, like a bird, with her poorly gained achievements. Compare this with the finale of The Lavender Hill Mob! <br /> <br /> Very fascinating, strangely outdated in fashion and moods, as well as material for viewing cults late at night. Ideal for viewing at midnight after closing pubs; if you have reached a certain age, you feel nostalgic for touching and always wanted to see David Niven at McDonalds affiliate, who silently intimidates an American with a retractable telescope!
