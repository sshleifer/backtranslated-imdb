I absolutely hate that this film is not for sale. Anyone who loves this movie should send an email to Disney and increase the demand for it. Ultimately they will have to sell it. I would buy copies for everyone I know. Everyone and everyone in this film did a good job, and I did not understand why Disney did not put this film on DVD or VHS in rental stores. At least I have not seen copies. This is an evil good film, and everyone should see it. Children in the new generation do not see this, and I think they should. At the very least, it should be returned to the channel. This film does not deserve cheap download. It deserves the present. I am writing them by email now. This movie will be on DVD.
