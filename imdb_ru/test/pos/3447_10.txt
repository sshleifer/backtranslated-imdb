I have seen several films by Mr. Boorman and I didn’t like it very much. Not that these were bad films, on the contrary, good films, but not content that I personally found interesting. Nevertheless, I think that “Where the heart is,” although it was created to serve the American audience who are not too savvy in the art, skillfully plays the role of satire and social commentary on the times when it was made. I had to replace my film in my collection at least half a dozen times, because every time I lend it to someone I know, I can appreciate his skills at all levels, my copy does not return to my home, laughs The last time it took 7 years to replace it, since it was printed for VHS sales, was never recorded as a DVD, which I know about, and had to wait until one of the premium cable channels launched it before than i could write it again. . <br /> <br /> My favorite aspect after social commentary is Timna Woollard’s paintings. I have been looking for 15 years to find someone or anywhere that could lead me to where her work is available for sale. Or, even better, a copy of the pictures in the film without inscriptions. I have a room in my house in which I put copies of her paintings, and no one seems to know if she was released as a coffee table book, video aquarium, or documentary about her work. If someone knows where I can get any copy of Timna’s work or where her studio is in England, please feel free to contact me by email.
