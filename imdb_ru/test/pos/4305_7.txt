Double Hit is one of many good episodes of Colombo that reaches the level of a good movie. <br /> <br /> It has all the elements that we like in the episodes of Colombo. We laugh when Colombo does something awkward, and this happens more than once in Double Shock. I almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode. <br /> <br /> We also get the usual puzzle with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murder is bothering Colombo. End of the ordinary, we get a story about how Colombo revealed the secret. <br /> <br /> This is another good episode with Colombo, and I rate it 7/10. This is close to 8/10. <br /> <br /> “One more question” - Acting skills? Peter Falk is very good, as usual.
