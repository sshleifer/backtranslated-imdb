I'm afraid I disagree with Mr. Radcliffe, because, although he is right in saying that this is not a comedy, she has many other virtues. The plot is a little obsessed with the details, but I believe that all this fits together perfectly, creating a pleasant, enjoyable film. The last scene was rather deplorable compared to the rest of the film, but the actual ending of the plot several scenes earlier is very interesting, showing what someone will do in stressful circumstances. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to thriller and action movie fans, but if you're a fan of gangster movies, then if you don't expect something as deep as Goodfellas, you will still like it.
