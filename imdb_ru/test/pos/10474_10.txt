A gentle story hinting at rage, with an expiatory message and a glorious holiday. The photo is surprisingly well executed. Cinematographers watch this film in order to hone their skills not only for what the eye can do to improve the plot, but also to choose the correct vocabulary of the camera to enhance emotions. Feeding the soul is, by definition, what this film is referring to, but with the grace and grace of delivery that simply does not happen anymore, at least with such a degree of taste, restraint and grace. If you care about the story and character development, this is also a great movie, which you can see as an example of how simple lines and proper delivery can completely fill the impression of the character. Match all this with a film that is almost minimalist in nature and well thought out, and you “get” this film.
