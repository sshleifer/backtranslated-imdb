This movie was really funny. People who expected to see a comedy worthy of Oscar should commit suicide. It was a funny movie with interesting and funny characters, story lines, conversational quotes and catchy phrases. I rate the movie at 10 if I bought a DVD, or, in this case, a videotape, and watched it many times, and in this case I still laugh out loud. I have about 12 films in my collection with a rating of 10, and about half have nothing to do with the Oscars. Again, it was just a fun, carefree movie. I hope this goes on DVD. I highly recommend checking out this movie if you are in the mood for a stupid comedy.
