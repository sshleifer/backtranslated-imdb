I can't help but notice the negative reviews this film received. Honestly, I saw a preview of this film, and the package looked intrigued by me. Yes, I rented it after reading the comments of others. They are right that some acting games leave much to be desired. They are also right that one of the best performances of this film was the film of Dr. Graves. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, a child in a wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, perhaps because I'm in a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely worth watching.
