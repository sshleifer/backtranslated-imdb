I can understand how Barney can annoy some, but the hatred he gets is very ridiculous. Barney was made simple from the start, and the simplicity is not bad, especially for the young, whom he entertains. I personally think that this show is very undervalued. Barney & Friends is a very informative show, in my opinion, and even 17 years after his debut (and almost 21 years after the character’s debut on the home video), he again and again proves that he is still turning to young children. Perhaps less than in the early 1990s, when Barney was Hannah Montana of the time, but he is still a classic. As a Barney fan myself, I feel that I have to protect him so that it does not look like spam. The way the purple guy teaches things can be very simplistic and unrealistic, but would you prefer them to hear about the war? Be thankful that someone (costume dinosaur, but still) is here to calm the children and let them just be children. Nowadays, I feel that we are in a hurry to grow up, and Barney says that you can still be a child in the shower. In addition, Barney’s many lessons on current episodes about plagiarism, honesty and, yes, even death, can please everyone, not just his target audience. In addition, our children need to learn to be kind and respect others for who they are, and he helps them in this. In short, Barney can annoy some people, and I fully understand why, but weakened him. All that he and his friends (together with HIT Entertainment, his production company) are trying to do is to help children not only to get the necessary skills, but also to have fun, as well as to look at the positive aspects of life. If more people listened to their children’s favorite character and looked at it with their own eyes, perhaps we would not be so negative towards him and, perhaps, towards life itself.
