This is an exceptional movie. This is partly comedy, partly drama, partly unknown. The dialogue is elegant. Most of the actors and actresses were very famous in their time and for good reason. You will probably recognize someone, even if you donâ€™t usually watch old movies. Each of them also plays a role that is particularly suited for their talents. <br /> <br /> One of the corrections made in the comments of other users is that it was announced in an accident that two people died, not one. Perhaps the two unfortunates are a reflection of what the writer considers important in life. The film is too exciting to worry about who it is until it happens. <br /> <br /> History is ahead of its time, but does not lose the quality of an older film. Time and effort was spent to improve camera vision and soundtrack that modern filmmakers often forget.
