It kept me on the edge of my seat. True, in the plot there are several holes in the plot, but the apparent tension, the way the director just continues to challenge the premise, simply fascinates. <br /> <br /> Jose Coronado and Adriana Ozores are the two best actors in Spain (see La vida mancha and Héctor), and here they look like a happy middle-aged couple. Under all of this, the truth is that Coronado’s whole life is a lie. He is not an economist, never attended college or does not work in the reserve of the central bank of Spain, as everyone else believes. We will talk a little about how he supported the appearance or coped with it, and although it is not very plausible, it is still somehow plausible. <br /> <br /> The internal work of the fraudsters is shown intermittently, but this is trustworthy because Coronado is a source of self-confidence and self-confidence. He not only believes in fraud, he also believes in the premise of the film, and therefore he carries it. <br /> <br /> Of course, this checks the belief that the wife will not know the inner workings of the marriage finances for almost 10 years, but again, since he is supposedly a brilliant economist. <br /> <br /> It is said in a nationalistic manner that the film is not “clearly Spanish,” as if it were a litmus test for a good test. film. True, there is no castanets or strange taxi drivers, only a tight thriller. You will want to know how this story ends when you start watching.
