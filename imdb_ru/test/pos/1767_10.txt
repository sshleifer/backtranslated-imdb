This is a kind of unknown and forgotten film, which can be seen while watching old videos. This is an excellent comic gem with brilliantly funny letter, embedded in an amazing array of characters, amazingly inventive and amusing musical accompaniment and a witty, easy guide from Montgomery himself. This is one to look again and again. Montgomery is a slightly participial actor who turns out to be appointed by his military reserve unit to infiltrate the house of a young debutant in order to discover the identity of her former cavalier, a suspected gemstone thief. While the premise is rather ridiculous, the results are funny. Montgomery is a bewildered plant, Ann Blyth is a miracle because a romantically obsessed, terribly serious debutant and a parade of comic features from veteran actress, mother attorney Jane Cole to exchangeable maid Lillian Randolph are all fabulous. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, he won an Oscar for only Sound when he earned high marks for Direction, Scenario and Musical Accompaniment. <br /> <br /> DON'T MISS THIS - this is one of the best Hollywood films.
