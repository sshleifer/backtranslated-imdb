I really liked this film, but the feeling that I left the most was a memory of how I enjoyed the novel. The film presents the two best actresses working today: Jessica Lange, who is gorgeous here, and divine Jennifer Jason Lee, who does everything possible, with a finely traced character that she is given, as well as the amazingly excellent Michelle Pfeiffer and permanent Jason Robards. Adaptation is mostly true to the book, at least as true as it can be in an hour and forty minutes. The film is not really blinding, with the exception of some scenes between Lange and Pfeiffer, but it does a perfectly competent job of visualizing this amazingly tragic story. As for the films, adapted from the novels, it was definitely one of the best. If not to say anything else, he sent me back to my bookshelves to rediscover my favorite excerpts from Jane Smiley's excellent novel, and back to King Lear to refresh the minor characters to see how deep the parallels are. Definitely worth your time as a film, and hopefully enough for you to remember that reading great literature is also a joy.
