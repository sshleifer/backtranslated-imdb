I must admit, when I first started watching this film, I had no idea what was going on. So the beginning was a little confusing for me. However, this does not detract from my pleasure from the film. Characters show themselves to be more complex than they might seem at first glance, and this makes this film unforgettable. At first I heard that it was a real Hollywood movie. Although he clearly lacks the stereotypical element “weapons and fists,” convincing performances by talented actors such as Martin Sheen and Sam Neal more than compensate for this. I would prefer to watch a movie with more content than to shoot on any given day.
