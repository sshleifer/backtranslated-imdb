Just a well-made, well-written and well-played film. Eastwood is classic because secret service agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Rousseau keep themselves as a partner (and very much in love) of Lilly Raines. But the greatness of the film lies on the shoulders of John Malkovich in the role of "Booth." He captures <br /> <br /> the rage and hatred of this character, as well as, oddly enough, his humanity. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think it was his best performance, and I should have gotten an Oscar for that <br /> <br /> (but that same year I also loved Tommy Lee Jones in "The Runaway "). In general, a great movie in which you want to look into the head of the killer and be on the edge of his place throughout the journey. Enjoy!!
