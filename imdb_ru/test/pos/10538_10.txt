Previous user comments are really sharp. I wonder if they saw this beautiful sweet movie? As for being so nasty about it in front of the author / director .. well, that's just rude! For those who grew up in the eighties, this is a sly nostalgia and a sweet story, well played and thought out. In the Irish cinema, many evil and bitter people are certainly involved, and the comment made on this occasion about the removal of the spleen testifies to this. As humans, we have a choice; give out and moan about people who actually go there and do things or do something themselves ... I know it's easier ... Do yourself a favor, watch this movie and see how a short movie is made ... you I will not be disappointed
