God ... How it ended up in our DVD player, I will never know ... my wife thought it was a new release that she somehow missed ... It doesn't matter that it’s a couple of years in Danish (I I think) ... She continued to look for the soundtrack in English ... <br /> <br /> In general ... the film was not bad ... Good production performance, the best performances and a smart story that don't go too far from yourself, make for a tidy, dark humor a fare across the sea! The end will make you laugh ... in fact, the whole movie will be. Incredibly strange characters that we genuinely interested in creating a movie that could be worth your time ... Without spoiling the plot, the movie title and the DVD cover give you a good idea of ​​where this thing is going!
