This film was never thought of as a budget with a large budget, but it was a cute little picture that everyone could like. It probably will not change your life, but it is certainly charming and attractive. <br /> <br /> Clifton Webb plays the jerk (this is certainly not new), who has a TV. However, his ratings were not justified, and he is concerned about the cancellation. Therefore, he decides, maybe he is too out of touch with the children, because he and his wife do not have their own. Thus, he voluntarily works as a scoutmaster and regrets that he did it almost immediately! Remember, he is a deceiver and does not particularly love children. Worse, one of the children really loves him and follows him like a lost puppy. No matter how indifferent he is to the child, the child just wants to spend time with him! The guy is cute and almost steals the show himself! <br /> <br /> What's next, and the twists and turns of the movie are just what you need to find out for yourself. Understand that this is an easy, cute, but not funny movie that you will surely enjoy.
