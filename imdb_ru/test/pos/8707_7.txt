The Subview, like many other horror films, gets a raw deal with IMDb. Most viewers have a terrible contempt for horror, and when they sometimes make horror films, they either want to laugh at them or shrink from excessively bloody scenes. Unfortunately, "Subspecies" is not particularly ridiculous and not so bloody, so they get a low rating. This is very bad. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is something to criticize. Non-actors are flat, subspecies are a poor special effect, and night scenes are too brightly lit. But what do you expect? For a horror movie, filmed directly on the video, Subspecies boasts decent production value and more honesty than you might expect. The Romanian atmosphere of the film is almost unique (I believe that it was the first American film shot in this country, post-communism), and the places, both internal and external, are beautiful. The script has moments of intelligence, especially when it delves into local folklore (I'm sure everything is fake). Somehow, shooting locations and a chic scenario are well combined with each other - “Sub-type” has its own special world. To risk a curse with weak praise ... it could be much more stupid. <br /> <br /> Fans of the more horrendous aspects of horror, no doubt, will enjoy the bloodthirsty vampire villain Rada. He is quite effective in this film - powerful, with a memorable squeaky voice - but I like him more in the sequels, when actor Anders Hove gives a more self-parodying, polite performance. Absolutely sincere Radu somewhat stupid. Other stupid aspects include unwarranted nudity and the subspecies themselves, which are clearly present only in the film, because producer Charles Band has a fetish for evil little creatures (see also Puppetmaster and Demonic Toys). <br /> <br /> But I also linger a lot about the shortcomings of the film. For what it is - a direct horror to the video of a vampire - "Subspecies" is great. Sequels boast better production value, more violence and more thoughtful plot lines, so I recommend them even more. However, this is not a bad start for the series.
