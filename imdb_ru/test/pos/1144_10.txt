I saw this film at school and loved it very much. Based on a true story, this is an absolutely magnificent film masterpiece. Seriously, I couldn't find anything wrong with that. One definite plus is how it was filmed. Installed in Morocco in 1904, Wind and Lion are filled with exciting images, such as the Great Raisuli, especially on horseback. The cinematography was flawless, the editing was crisp, the costumes were gorgeous, and the scenery was breathtaking. And I have to mention the music from Jerry Goldsmith, it was phenomenal. I have often used this phrase lately, but Goldsmith is not my favorite film composer for anything. His score here is so inspiring and exciting that it shows the true musical genius of the person, and this gem of the score should be next to Goldsmith's best scores with Legend, Rambo: First Blood, Patton and The Secret of NIMH. <br /> <br /> The action is exciting, and the scenario is intelligent and complex. The direction is also sensitively processed. The performances were astounding, with Sean Connery ever depicting charisma and courtesy, magnificent as the Great Raisuli, he almost dominates the whole picture by itself. He is joined by the wicked Candace Bergen, the treacherous John Houston and the charming Brian Keith in one of his more restrained views. The story is quite accurate, perhaps in some areas it is fragile, but with acting, music, and visual effects, I am doing so well. 10/10 Bethany Cox
