This film was perfectly filmed, perfectly filmed, and overall there was a great story. I had a real life experience with a boy like Radio. On the football program in my town we had a mentally retarded boy who every year trains, travels and has fun with a football team. This film is truly true, and I can identify with it 100%. A boy like Radio simply needs to feel like they belong to something; they must feel that their life is worth living. This is how Radio feels, and that is why this type of program is installed in my high school. This is a very touching film, which I am glad that was displayed on the big screen. My father and I liked it, and I will always remember it as a film telling a fascinating story about the kindness and kindness of a person!
