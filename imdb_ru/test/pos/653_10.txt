In the early 80s I recorded “Honky Tonk” on the highway. Since then I have waited, hoping that it will be on DVD. Yesterday I found it. This is one of the best humorous character studies I have ever seen. An old-fashioned episode is priceless. At this time (04/28/02) only two have considered this. One hated it, the other loved it. If you have a DVD player, either rent it or buy one like me.
