Spheeris debut should be one of the best musical documentaries of all time. And as far as I know, this is also the only one that focuses on the punk LA blast. in the early eighties. All this is: not only great, great bands like Black Flag, Fear, X, The Germs, whose names may not mean much to you today, but whose influence on today's alternative rock music cannot be overstated, but also promoters The media and, above all, the audience — the punks — are all depicted in such a way that makes you laugh, tremble and gasp in surprise at the energy, anger and rage that these young men put into their music. Where is it today? The eighties, perhaps, sucks are great when it comes to mainstream music, but the underground swayed. If you need evidence for this, see the Fear results in Decline. Unmatched. Great movie! Why is it not available on vid, ld or dvd? Postscript Subsequent decrease in Pt. I'm fun too
