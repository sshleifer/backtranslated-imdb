Michael (who is played by Stephen Robertson) has cerebral palsy, and he lives a quiet and boring life in the Carrigmore apartment building. When the newcomer in the house, Rory (Makawa), became friends with him, he begins to show Michael how to live after a disability. Despite or perhaps due to Rory’s disability (unable to move everything except the head and a few numbers on his arm), Rory is violently independent and extremely rebellious. His influence on the quiet and restrained Michael is impressive, and soon they leave the nursing home to arrange life in the outside world, where they seek the help of Siobhan (Romola Garay) as a caregiver. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the pearls of the year! Like last year's film "In America", the film turns from an incredibly funny to anxious, touching, frustrating and really exciting, not seemingly sweet saccharin. Knowing exactly where to pull the heart strings, and where to just let stories and characters do their work, O'Donnell created a wonderful film in which we all need to look behind the surface and see what's inside. /> <br /> The real strengths of the film are shown in the main actors. Their characters are so convincing that you really believe that they are disabled. The further ability to convey humor and sadness on top of the already magnificent performances is simply amazing. The couple really seems to be close friends, and as their story unfolds, you take full care of them. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best examples of this year’s film, telling a very relevant story in a simple way. If this film does not touch your heart, then you must keep clear ice inside.
