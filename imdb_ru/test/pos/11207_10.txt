For those who are like me and used to watching and enjoying high-budget Hollywood movies on huge screens with surround sound, this movie seems very far away. However, I was surprised how close it can be to anyone while I watch it. It is so natural that you feel that no one has written the script or no one guided it. You are the director, and you write the script while watching it. For me, the time I spend watching a film is the only time I leave for another world. This film is the first sample for me, which shows that it is not always necessary to watch films with a budget of millions of dollars, the possibility of surround sound in order to go to another world. This film sends you to another world (or perhaps makes you go back to yourself) without a million dollars of budget or technical capabilities. It seemed to me that I was reading L'etranger with Camus.
