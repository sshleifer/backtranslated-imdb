I gave it 10 because it is the best movie of its kind ... a good old-fashioned T & A film in the shadow and spirit of "Animal House". I saw it in a similar movie called “Swap Meet,” and both were good in their own way ... a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Let's be honest ... there are more breasts in this movie than you could imagine for an R-rated movie. From start to finish, they seem to continue to appear on the screen (scenes for tanning, scenes in the bedroom and, of course, climate football game). In addition, a catchy kissing booth (kiss me, Clutz!) It seems that everyone is having a good time in their roles (several playboy comrades, Danny Bonadius, several familiar TV and movie actors, etc.) The only complaint I have to register is that Lisa's London character is called by her last name O'Hara, and not by the good name of the 1970s, like Olivia (or even Ora, She or O ...? ? !!) I saw it again in the late 1980s with my now ex-wife (fairly well endowed with myself), and she could not believe that I really enjoyed the movie !! She was probably jealous !! Again, this movie is a great way to spend a Sabbath day ... just don't think too hard!
