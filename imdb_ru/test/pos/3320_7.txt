"Women" Claire Booth Luce shows the relationship with men through the perspective of the woman in the play (and in the 1939 film in which Joan Crawford plays the bitch: a character who could be Amanda Farrow 20 years ago) who has no male characters. Here we see the male characters and what they are for the heap. They use women as toys and throw them away, leaving women to suffer. Ironically, women in "Women", perhaps because they are all that we see, are shown in a less than favorable light, alternately stupid and intrigue, with the only "sweet" (Norma Shearer) growing "claws" the end. In The Best of All, we see men for their role, while women are mostly innocent and vulnerable. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about women jumping from things. Diane Baker jumps out of the car (perhaps in the most absurd scene in cinema history, which is not in the book). Suzy Parker falls off the fire escape. Women in the film jump to work, looking for success and love at the same time. Women will leap into the future and leave this type of soap opera in the next decade. But they will come back to this in the 80s and 90s thanks to the novels of people like Sidney Sheldon and Judith Krantz (although their dirty work is not as good as this one). <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie looks like this. I love glossy cinematic films of the 50s and 60s. They look much better than home movies with a pixel resolution that we shot since then, especially in the box version that we see on TV and on DVD, with such a clear image that you can enter it. The look of a seductive young beauty is also remembered in him. In this film, probably more beautiful women than in any other. He has a supermodel (Susie Parker), beauty queen (Myrna Hansen, who was not Miss America in 1954, as Ron Jaffe says in the DVD commentary, but rather Miss USA in 1953, according to IMDb: but so far), and Playboy Playmate, (June Blair, from January 1957). My voice belongs to Susie, one of the amazing beauties of all time. Her game here is not as terrible as people pretend: they just react, as people then, seemingly supermodels (first, really), try to act. No one seemed to care about how well she handled. Her role, apparently, of a worldly woman who turns out to be the most vulnerable, is the most difficult in the group, and she copes beautifully. <br /> <br /> The most touching thing in the film now is the age of the woman leading at that time. Hope Lange was 27 years old when they shot it in the spring of 1959. Diane Baker was 20. Susie Parker was 26. Hope, who looked like Grace Kelly's heiress, never made it really big and eventually turned out to be Mrs. Mure on television, and, according to IMDb, she began to live in a house with tables, because she spent her money on the reasons she believed in before dying at the age of 72 in 2003. This film should have seemed to her very far and inappropriate by that time. Baker, who has always been a welcome face on television in the 60s (especially for Richard Kimble), and still active as an actress and acting coach, has just turned 67 years old. Parker found the “best of all” with Bradford Dillman 40 years before he died at the age of 70 that same year Lange did. But here they are, young, beautiful and ambitious for success and love, like their heroes.
