What the hell are people expecting in horror movies these days anyway. Should there be something awful, like “SAW”, or is it just crap ... ??? Now I do not pretend to be the all-knowing expert, but I am about 47 years old, I have seen and own literally thousands of films, and I sincerely believe that this director really put this film to good, sincere efforts. Believe me, I was going to cringe as soon as the dialogue started, assuming it would be awful, and I was pleasantly surprised. This is not a Mamet script, that's for sure; but come on !!! with all the HORRIBLE litter, ESPECIALLY in “Horror,” I thought this one was LARGER closer to the top of the heap than most. <br /> <br /> The director used a lot of neat, clever camera angles; the soundtrack was superb and capricious, perfect for the atmosphere needed for such a film. Editing and timing were very good. And it did not resort to a tired, worn out cliché of excessive violence with a slasher; for example ***** MULTIPLE SPOILERS ***** During an absolutely amazing and completely free (but tasty ... well, I mean with taste) naked soul scene, I FULLY expect it to be cut and diced ; but, AMAZING, we just enjoy its heavenly beauty, that's all ***** THE END OF THE LITTLE SPOILER ***** Besides, the tension was adjusted very well, which led to a pleasant ambiguous ending when you are not quite sure that what kind. ***** SPOILER ***** Especially where in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and Pinnokkio alone in the office; We see the doll actually talking to her, but we don’t do that in the videotape. In addition, Mom sees Pinocchio move and behave rather nasty; So, BOTH mom and daughter are mentally ill ... ??? There is also the original "killer" and the fact that mother suggested the possible influence of Evil. But even so, we are STILL not sure that WHO committed the murder ***** END SPOILER ***** So, in general, I think it was a good, strong, sincere attempt to create some Good early full moon style and a lot of restraint in violence. And without the typical SLEAZE added for no reason (only a beautiful, innocent, beautiful soul scene, which I will remember until the end of my days ... :) Compared to absolute MAD delirium, DEFINED, strong 8/10 !!!
