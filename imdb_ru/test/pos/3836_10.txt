"Balance of Terror" is still one of the best Star Trek episodes ever made. It was inspired by the film “The Enemy Below” (starring Robert Mitchum), a film that tells about the cat-and-mouse game between two captains during World War II. In this episode, Captain Kirk and his team play a similar game with the Romulan ship. This program introduces the war-hungry Romulans, who are distant relatives of the Vulcans. This is an incredibly intense episode created for maximum effect. It is also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of plots that add additional meaning to the story. Mark Lenard makes his Star Trek debut as the captain of Romulan (later he will play Spock's father, Ambassador Sarek). Be sure to watch the episode!
