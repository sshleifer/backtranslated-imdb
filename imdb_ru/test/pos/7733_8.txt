I saw this film in much the same way as Skywalker02, but when I managed to see it again and with formal training in the film, psychology and life had time to really take my hand and start beating me ... I really click with the film . I remember how the cable service charge played this thing almost to death, like a poltergeist when it first appeared, and many other popular films. I felt that then it was not worth the fuss and constant “airtime” (I know that cable TV is not actually broadcast), but I was very young, and the adult drama would not have and should not have worked. However, recent viewing of the film enlightened me in this film. I think that Susan Surandon and Molly Ringwald probably studied the script together, and I would be a little surprised if Surandon would train Ringvald during this project. Ringingwald's other projects, while good, do not allow her to display potential depth as a role. Surandon nailed her, as did Raul Julia. Cassawett and his wife performed well, but I admit that first-class acting becomes mediocre. The steady ebb and flow of action takes place in many scenes, but in general I understand why the story might encourage the dynamics to be more subtle. <br /> <br /> In general, I don’t find this film, which will be a kind of boredom festival “pull me out and drown me”, as Skywalker02 would like you to believe. I think that, perhaps, with the right psychological preparation and a little more difficulty in strategically located home conditions, in combination with some film courses, this film may look different. I would say that if you feel a little sad and thirst for a simple life, and you have a share of family differences among dysfunctional family units, then perhaps this film can give more insight and entertainment than you think. I feel that this is a classic, and I find it much more interesting than mainstream films, which are supposed to contain many of the same elements, such as “Tenderness Terms”, which, in my opinion, can be devoid of several unusual speeches by jack nicholson. Then solemnly burned, until nothing was left. (How such a film can attract more attention than this. Talk about boredom.) Best of all, don’t believe me or anyone else, watch the movie and support our industry.
