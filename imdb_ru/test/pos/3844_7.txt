The Duchess and her three kittens enjoy the high life with their loyal human lover, until the evil butler Edgar, looking at a large inheritance, decides to finish them and pull them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures cope in unfamiliar countryside and the more vile streets of Paris? Only having met the unstoppable cat-alley O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in the heart. After they taste the big dangerous world, he takes them home, and Edgar gets his desserts just made on the wrong end of the horse. As always, it is the voices, not the animation, that are the heart of Disney's magic: Phil Harris is great in the role of O'Malley, Eva Gabor in the role of Duchess ... well ... Eva Gabor; but perhaps the most memorable twists and turns are Pat Buttram and George Lindsay, who turn the old hounds of Napoleon and Lafayette into a pair of clumsy, red-brained goons in the south. Their scenes with Edgar, as well as musical numbers with Scat Cat and his cool dude band are classic. The most striking thing about seeing the “Aristocrats” now is how deeply the Disney animation style has changed since it was at the forefront in 1970. Perhaps a nostalgic, outdated feeling is just the result of being dropped into Belle Epoque Paris, but the illustrations are more fussy (sorry), and the animation and overall pace are much less violent (sometimes relief) than in later attempts, such as Aladdin.
