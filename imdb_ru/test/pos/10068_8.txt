"What's his name?" "Loudon." "Loudon what?" "Clear". <br /> <br /> This joke still turns me on, TWENTY-ONE YEAR after the release of the film. <br /> <br /> I liked the film then, and I love it today. I must have watched it a hundred times that day, and when I recently bought a DVD, I still remembered some of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a young woman imprisoned for a crime she did not commit. When she goes out, she decides to get revenge. <br /> <br /> Griffin Dunn (what happened to him?) Playing the lawyer of his bride's father (John McMartin). The future father-in-law asks Loudon to take Nikki from prison to the bus station and make sure she gets on the bus as part of a proposed public relations program. It would seem an easy task, but there are many complications, some amusing dialogues and some, admittedly, silly, but amusing scenes. <br /> <br /> Madonna has a stupid voice in this film, which, until I could watch it with subtitles, made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible to me (therefore, only 8/10), but on the other hand, I donâ€™t I can imagine that she would do it in her usual voice. <br /> <br /> This film shows the comic side of Madonna (perhaps too missing in our day), and she is genuinely funny in this role. Dunn does an excellent job, while Haviland Morris is perfect as a bridesmaid. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is predictable, yes, the jokes can be better, but I think this is a great movie and he will sit down with pleasure and watch it 100 times more.
