First of all, this film has no story. Obviously, there were many rewrites in the production process â€” sometimes the characters refer to a timeline that is impossible, and this is probably because the timeline of the whole story was never known to anyone on the set. <br /> <br /> This is said that the film is quite brilliant. Pfeiffer is awesome - and I mean amazing, like Catwoman; she nails the character's characteristic sexual darkness and good / bad trends. Walken is Walken - but even more nasty than usual. The devito is not true to comics when it comes to Penguin, but it is good and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keaton is underestimated as Batman. <br /> <br /> And music and style is a real cinematic thrill. True act 3 does not work. But the last 2 scenes are knockouts, and it is clear that Pfeiffer and Keaton were supposed to be in a trilogy that was ripped off by the strange darkness of this film. This is very bad, because Pfiffer and Keaton had classical chemistry, and if they played the third installment, you know Joel, who might not have gotten a chance to destroy Batman for a whole generation of movie fans.
