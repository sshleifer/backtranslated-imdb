I just bought this film yesterday, and I love it. Everyone played great in this, especially Ryan Dunn and Bam Margera. The whole story was great, and as Dunn said in the statistics on the DVD, it seemed like he was reliving everything. This film won first place in my favorite movies! I can't stop playing scenes over and over again just to see it again. I have never done this with any other film. I definitely recommend this to other people to see, because this is such a wonderful film, and if you like Bam Margera, this is the perfect movie for you! The small montages that they show between each scene are simply amazing. I think it should be my favorite parts of the film. They are very sad, mostly the music of the group “HIM”, which, of course, is my favorite band.
