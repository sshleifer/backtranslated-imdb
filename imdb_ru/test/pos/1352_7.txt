Bert Kennedy and wrote and sent this Western, taken from the novel. Kennedy was a well-known writer and director, mostly westerns. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum was a star for over 20 years when he did this. This role was similar to many that he had already done. One can understand why he was a big star over the years. <br /> <br /> He filled out this role easily, like a well-used glove. <br /> <br /> The main character is played by Robert Walker Jr. (his father is a wonderful actor Robert Walker - he died tragically at the age of 32 - his mother is famous actress Jennifer Jones). <br /> <br /> Robert was short. build and, although he had talent, made only a few films. (he was in the last movie of Rita Hayworth. <br /> <br /> The road to Salinas - that very year was very good). <br /> <br /> He was very much like his father, but he seemed to lack his fatherly charm. He made only a few films. He is still alive, and I wish him all the best. <br /> <br /> Most of his scenes are with another son from Hollywood. John Carradine's son David, who is still in the movie. they created a great team. <br /> <br /> There is always a female character in westerns, and she usually dances in the dance hall. (today they call them prostitutes), Angie Dickinson appreciates this role well. Western fans are also featured, John Anderson and Jack Kelly. <br /> <br /> This was a film in Old Tucson, outside of downtown Tucaon Az. and the scenery is magnificent. <br /> <br /> Typical for older westerns, there’s not too much action, there’s good humor and a regular ending. <br /> <br /> This is a quick, pleasant 89 minutes. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (out of 10) 84 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
