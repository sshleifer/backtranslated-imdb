The main plot of this film has already been described in detail in several other comments, so I will not worry. First of all, I would like to thank the producer, actors, directors and film crew for creating an amazingly attractive film for a meager budget of $ 1 million, a small fraction of the standard Hollywood fare that does not look cheap. These people strive to make something new and interesting, without spending a fortune on it. In essence, this is art for the sake of art. I know, I know, some of you will decide that this is not art, but something less, and this is normal. For example, I am glad that such people will continue to spend time and efforts on our benefit, without expecting huge multi-million payments. <br /> <br /> Now about the criticism. I feel that the presented scenario is trustworthy to a certain extent. It's great when everything works, and the hero / heroine saves the day, and all is well that ends well. What attracts me is the blatant manipulation of events, so that blind luck is not only responsible for courage and strength. <br /> <br /> When Li was attacked but not seriously injured, she somehow washed up on a muddy shore next to a dead guide. Then, oddly enough, his charged revolver is still in the holster, and it really works (after some cleaning and messing around). Finally, when Lee is attacked on a mud bank and jumps into the water, the crocodile cannot kill her again. She finishes with her hand in his (her?) Mouth and manages to repeatedly pull the trigger, ultimately to blow the brains of the crocodile (literally). <br /> <br /> I came to the conclusion that Lee goes hand in hand "Mouth with a crocodile" is just a way to end the film with the triumph of a man. Based on what he saw, the crocodile attacks and continues to hold on until the prey stops fighting. Crox will spin around and around to dismember and drown prey. This happened with the first 3 victims, but not with Lee. She had teeth marks, but they were not deep. <br /> <br /> I think that the ending would be better if the Crocodile won, to be honest, thereby proving its dominance over the mangroves, its territory for millions of years. But then, how many of us would be upset or disappointed that a pretty girl did not come out alive?
