I did not know what to expect from this. I have always believed that Bam Marghera and the CKY team are a team of crazy vertigoes dedicated to nonsense for fun. I did not know that they could act. But everyone who starred in this film shot good performances. Fun "aaaaaaaa!" The scene goes well with the depression of Ryan Dunn and his revenge against the former girlfriend. Sometimes in a movie, some scenes seem meaningless, but at the same time they are funny. I recommend this to anyone who likes to laugh, but this film may not appeal to those who prefer detailed storylines and a series of turns.
