An agonizing series about life in Oz, an experimental prison where prisoners are trying to rehabilitate. There is gay, rape, torture, mutilation, murder, humiliation, tons of male nudity ... everything is in your eyes and is in full swing. <br /> <br /> This is also easily one of the best written dramas ever put on television and almost all the actors are great. Since it was on cable, there were no restrictions on what they could say or show. There are many racist comments here, but this is for all races. In fact, white characters break off pretty badly (especially the Aryans), and black characters break better (peace-loving Muslims). Latin Americans do not play a strong role, and there are no Asian prisoners at all. It seems that all prisoners are smugglers and are ready to kill someone at any time - but you still sympathize with some of them. Even the guards, consultants and doctors in prison have serious problems. <br /> <br /> I heartily recommend it, BUT rent it - do not buy it. I have an entire collection, and, honestly, I don't think I ever want to see it again. This is an incredible TV, but so dark, gloomy and depressing. I think I should sell it all online. <br /> <br /> I give 10.
