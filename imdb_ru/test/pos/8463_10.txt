Have you ever wondered where this episode of "Tuttle" appeared in the middle of the first season of M * A * S * H? Well, now the cat is out of the bag: they took it from this Soviet film, the satire about how stupid the king is because of the slip of the handle (translating the phrase “lieutenants, though ...” in “Lieutenant Kizhe”, “which does not make sense) and no one was so honest or brave to contradict him and just tell him the truth - Kizhe does not exist and never existed. Thus, they constitute for him an imaginary life and eventually kill him. And 40 years later, David Ketchum and Bruce Shelley borrowed this extravagant plot and told us, in fact, the same story, only on the other side of what became a cold war, proving that people in high positions can be equally stupid, regardless of their loyalty may be!
