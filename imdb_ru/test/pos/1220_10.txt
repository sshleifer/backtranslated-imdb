Cute Movie is a good movie. I have never heard of this film, but I stumbled upon it when I was looking for something to rent. I had high hopes for this film, based solely on the fact that Flex is in this film. I have never seen him standing in anything. True to form this film, delivered for me. I liked the story. The film is full of great actors and actresses. Merry Tasha Smith, Essence Atkins and, of course, Tangi Miller. I really liked this movie. I did not give him five stars, because it did not discuss some issues that I thought should be described in detail in the film. The question seems to have been resolved, but I would be grateful for the discussion of the problem solving. I liked the film so much that I buy it now after I have already shot and watched it.
