I really don't know what it is in “Dirty Dancing” ... there is some absolute magic in this film ... I can't tell you about hundreds (yes, hundreds) of times that I watched, starting from the end and ending ... ... but every time I come across this on TV, I am fascinated and puzzled and sit down, and now for two hours I love the film, as if I’ve been watching it for the first time. Although Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray absolutely hated each other during the making of this film, they have excellent chemistry on the set ... it makes the viewer enjoy it much more, see this passion and dedication ... and I can't help breaking a little - a bit at the end, when Patrick approaches the Dommen family and says to his father: “Nobody corners the child”. (classic moment) For all those people who consider this film to be banal and well-fed, maybe, in a sense, but it was a piece of 80s films, and he put Patrick Swayze right on the map; his performance was impeccable. <br /> <br /> Three Cheers for Dirty Dancing !! <br /> <br /> PS Soundtrack is a fantastic, absolute masterpiece
