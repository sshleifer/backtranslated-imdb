Without knowing anything about the truth and reconciliation commission, I can only consider it as part of the entertainment. I started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from BBC2 earlier this year), but as soon as I started, I had to watch until the end. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is actually a drama in the courtroom - Never my favorite genre - but it was amazingly photographed (mostly in oversized ocher) and acted well. Like a good novel, I could not write it down. Throughout the journey, I wanted me to watch it in a movie to pay homage to music and photography. What happened to his release in cinemas? I am a fan of Chiwetel Ejiofor, as I saw him in Dirty Nice Things, and Hilary Swank looks amazing in this - very feminine and sexy for a change (perhaps inappropriate, but she adds to the filmâ€™s visual appeal). <br /> <br /> This picture deserves a wider audience than it seems.
