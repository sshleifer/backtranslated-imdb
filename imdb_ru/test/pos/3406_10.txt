It was the only film about the war with Zivi. My aunt actually played in this film as an extra on the wedding scene of Justin and Madeline, and my uncle was extra on horseback. The script was authentic and accurate. The costumes were tasteful, the consistency was in order, and even the accents were good. I really love Patrick Swayze and James Reed. They were the best 2 options, and they even had a great cast. Civil war is my favorite thing in American history, and I love movies about it. I saw a lot, and this film and its sequel, North and South Books 2, took the cake. If you have not seen it, rent it. As soon as possible. This is pretty education.
