If you love jaded cheese from the early 70s, you'll just like this one. How can you make a mistake with a low-budget movie about bloodshed in an insane asylum? You can not! Crazy people and sharp objects are always an interesting combination. <br /> <br /> The film looks like it was shot in someone's house for $ 320.65. For me, it's just advertising the pleasure of watching this kind of thing. The blood is a bit softer compared to others of this kind, but this is enough to make us bloodthirsty patients (like me) happy. Some horror movies are pulled piece by piece and leave you waiting for something to happen. This is not the case. The characters are interesting enough to make each frame quite enjoyable. There is never a boring moment from start to finish. The climax of warming up the mind at the end is just incredible. I liked it so much that right after the final credits I watched it a second time. It is absolutely necessary for any self-respecting terrible nut at the entrance. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 on Drive-in- Freak-O-Meter ... viewing required <br /> <br /> Yes, I love you ... I really love you ... now take torazin and put on your clothes ... please .... 8)
