"L'auberge espagnole", one of the greatest French successes of 2002, was also very well received abroad, which is quite unusual for a French film. It is not difficult to determine the reasons for this success. In this film, filmed by one of the most interesting French directors of recent years, Cedric Klapisch, there are students from all over Europe gathered under one roof in Barcelona. These students are described as those whom you see or see in everyday life: untidy, serious or with a sense of humor. I think that if the film worked so well, it was because many students had to recognize themselves in the portraits of the main characters, and especially in the portraits of Xavier. <br /> <br /> We follow the film and its experience abroad as an Erasmus student through our eyes. Xavier is really an ordinary student with his qualities, his shortcomings. A clever creature with lots of brilliant ideas expresses perfectly his lost mind and his concern for the world and being a student of Erasmus. On this topic, the best examples can be found in two sequences. The first is when Xavier asks a woman at the university what documents he needs to send in order to prepare his DEA. When the same woman informs him about various necessary procedures, all the papers appear on the screen when she calls them! In the following sequence, Xavier’s voice tells the viewer about his view of the modern world. Now where to find the second example? Well, the scene where Xavier undergoes a thorough medical examination, during which Klapisch removes his visions, is widely enough to talk about himself. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the director was not very interested in the research of his main character. He left this point restrained. Most likely, he put a lot of effort into Xavier’s private life, in his love affair with Ann Sophie, but also especially in his relations with his tenant colleagues. This is a true friendship story that Klapisch shows us with his moments of happiness, as well as with his arguments and tensions. Thanks to the adventures of Xavier and at the end of his stay, he will be initiated into life, which will make him more mature. The message that the author wanted to convey is not difficult to guess. You naively believe that you live in an untidy and complex world. You do not have to give up, but search intensively to get what you want, even if it is difficult. <br /> <br /> In addition, we might also fear that with this topic Cedric Klapish will not avoid a trap: a cliche. Let's be frank: they are included in the script, but the director tries his best not to distribute them too much in his film. Then the script contains comfortable and predictable moments: at the airport and before landing, we see Xavier shed a tear after leaving the family. But, fortunately, the flaws of the script stop here. Quite amusing dialogues and cool young actors, acting quite naturally in their roles, make up the whole. <br /> <br /> Despite its weaknesses, l'auberge espagnole should be considered successful in the film by young people. In addition, the whole atmosphere he creates allows us to think that this film is focused primarily on a young audience. In the end, the end of the film and its great success will allow us to assume that Klapisch gave way to a fashion suitable for American cinema: the development of sequels. Indeed, the director is currently working on a sequel called "Les Poupées Russes". Let's hope it will be as good as "l'auberge espagnole".
