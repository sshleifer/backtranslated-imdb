Indeed safer. Hitchcock is a pervert movie all the time; however, we all know that his perversions are also ours, so we forgive him. And we not only forgive him, but also welcome his smart way to invite us on an unforgettable train ride. <br /> <br /> A week before that, I saw the 1953 Hitchhiker's Hitchhiker, and I put both in the same thing. category as part of its trademarks. These trademarks consisted in the fact that he ingeniously asked questions and pulsed in his artistic veins, spilling psychological drops of blood on the viewer, leaving no stains of guilt, instead a very subtle feeling of shame. <br /> <br /> The pen is always stronger than the Sword and Hitch firmly wrote the most controversial issues with his wrist, and then holding tightly with his hands, he held cameras that always reflected the bloodlust of people (most people), otherwise comedy would be basically a tragic thing, and people laugh would not be so difficult. <br /> <br /> Mixing all the dark elements of the “high society” with the rich psychopath Bruno and the ambitious tennis player who wants to become a politician Guy, this story is one of the most well-built and hitchhiked, inspiring many filmmakers not only with its plot , but also cunning images, causing dark smiles and happy nightmares. <br /> <br /> Barely perfect!
