This is a little-known anti-war film that has been ignored for too long. Thanksgiving time 1972. This is a typical country house somewhere in Texas. The eldest son has just returned from Vietnam, and he has a hell of a lot of time to adapt to the life he left behind. And the family does not know how to deal with the problem. I honestly do not think that I am exaggerating when I say that this is one of the most heartbreaking war films I've seen. The funny thing is that in the whole film there are only a few fighting episodes. Most of the story takes place in the house within a few days. But the war that takes place in this house is as intense as any real fighting. The film does what is difficult to do; Estevez and his team somehow created a film that embodies the whole experience of Vietnam. And given the similarities between Vietnam and the current invasion of Iraq, the film is surprisingly relevant. Estevez does a great job with the material. He gets a lot of help from the chosen cast. Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates in particular are great in the role of parents. A truly touching movie. Highly recommended
