The director, Ramin Niami, delivers goods from Somewhere in the city. I believe that this cheerful farce is a tradition of Mel Brooks’s comedy. Niami ridicules New York society, creating believable, eccentric, and tragic characters from a single apartment building, bringing it to life from the very first picture that represents them. The performance of Peter Stormare as a Shakespearean gay actor is absolutely worthy of an award, and the film as a whole clearly shows the hopelessness and ability to laugh at self-centered ambitions. Sandra Bernhard played well as a straightforward, obsessive psychotherapist. I really enjoyed Sandra's performance, especially since I haven’t been a big fan so far. Bai Ling, Ornella Muti and Bulle Ogier complete the international ensemble mainly. I liked the scene with Robert John Burke and his gang of criminals, idiots who could not plan the robbery, if their lives depended on it. With the episodic role of Mayor Ed Koch and the solid performance of Paul Anthony Stewart, the boy of the revolutionary mother, “Somewhere in the City” having fun, not missing a second.
