I think some of the American baseball films are some of the best films ever made. When this film was in production and heard it was described as a rugby film. I read about the Highland team in the newspapers, but I didn’t have high expectations from this movie about sports that didn’t interest me. <br /> <br /> Last night I watched it “on demand”. and loved him almost as much as my favorite baseball movies. Ryan Little, the cast and crew did an amazing job. Neil McDonough was particularly persuasive. As a “bad dad,” he demonstrated a beautiful range and a thin, but moving arc of a character. <br /> <br /> I also liked the members of the Pacific Islanders. I am lucky that I know many of these wonderful people, and this film reflects their wonderful spirit and culture. A memory of how the islanders' culture became such a key element of the Highland team would be a great addition to the film. <br /> <br /> Some pretty tasteless movies were recently made in Utah. It's nice to see such a high-quality film from “The Hive State”.
