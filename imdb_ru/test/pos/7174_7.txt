On June 22, 1941, the city of Przemysl, Poland, was divided between German and Russian. When the Germans invade the city, the Nazis send Jews to the ghetto. Young Catholic Fusia Podgorsk (Kelly Martin) alone with her younger sister hides and hides many Jews in the attic of his house for two and a half years until the end of the war. “Hidden in Silence” is another good story of human sympathy in World War II. This film looks like Rescuers: Stories of Courage, and is also based on a true story. Unfortunately, actress Kelly Martin plays a strong and powerful main role, but she is very weak for such a role. In many dramatic situations, her expression is not convincing. I noted that many IMDb users liked her performance, but I’m not sure if they like her wonderful character or her performance. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Ocultos no Medo” (“Hidden in Fear”)
