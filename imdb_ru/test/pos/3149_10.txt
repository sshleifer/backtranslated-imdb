The reader is an exceptionally well-made and very sweet short. Each element of the piece helps to evoke a pure emotional response to the script. He acted well, directed, shot and wrote. I was surprised to learn that there was no rehearsal before the shooting, it was not even read. The performances are evidence of some beautiful instinctive play in response to a well-written script. The work of the actresses was excellent, and there was never any indication that their work was slipping into purely sentimental. The smaller the better in this case. This film is a prime example of how these low-cost contracts benefit both actors and directors.
