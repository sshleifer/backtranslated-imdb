I only saw it in the preview, I did not read the book, but I heard a lot of good things about it. <br /> <br /> The film was absolutely fantastic, very exciting. With the rollercoaster of emotions, you fully connect with the characters. Sean Toub was great, it was a complete departure from his usual roles, and his acting for those who understand Persian / Dari was incredible. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that Khaled Hosseini really loved the film, unusual for adapting a book of films. Even after watching the movie "he sobbed" several times. <br /> <br /> Animation of the entry was elegant, and the names were displayed as if it were Persian calligraphy, very unique! From time to time the translation was not clearly conveyed, but overall it was a great movie.
