Now I like Victor Herbert. And I like Mary Martin and Allan Jones. But it would be nice to see the real biography of Victor Herbert. Walter Connolly, like Herbert, is very similar to him in the last years of his life. <br /> <br /> Jones and Martin sing beautifully. Herbert's music is just there to decorate the storyline of these two musical performers. John Ramsay from Jones is a frail character, very similar to Gaylord Ravenal in Showbot, in which Jones also played. <br /> <br /> As for Mary Martin, itâ€™s a mystery to her why she never had a good Hollywood career. She starred in films with Bing Crosby and Dick Powell, as well as with this. She performed well, but the cinema audience did not accept her. The best musical moment in the film - Jones and Martin in a duet of Thine Alone. I have individual recordings of the song, and it was written as a duet. There is also a pleasant scene with Jones and Martin, who ride bikes and exchange songs by Herbert during the ride. <br /> <br /> The real Victor Herbert with his female education, Irish patriotic past and musical education in Germany, where he developed a love for all things German, would be an exciting learning experience. He was also a virtuoso violonist before he began composing. I have to make a serious exception to the reviewer, who said that Cuddles Sakall would be a good Victor Herbert. Sakall as Irish, HELLO. <br /> <br /> Good movie, but a real Vic would be much better.
