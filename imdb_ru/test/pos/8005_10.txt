Many of us find art enjoyable only when the masterpiece itself touches something deep inside us. That is, a completed creation can be accepted and evaluated only if we can somehow personally relate to it. It was in the winter, here in Australia, in 1992, when I saw The Return of Batman in theaters, and it struck me. Both are me. I had to belong to the ideal, the standard, but at the same time I lived a different life. Tim Burton was the first director to say that it’s all right that the comic film is dark and recognizes that darkness can happen to all of us. After the interpretations of Batman Tim Burton, many other dark comic book heroes and anti-heroes flooded cinemas. For decades, the comic book folklore talked about friendly, cute heroes with incredibly beautiful smiles and magical super powers that fly in the sky, hid powerful cobwebs from their wrists, wore red boots and had the power of a locomotive. But what happens when you are only ten years old, and you see how your parents were coldly executed before your eyes? You click. Somewhere in your psyche, your young gentle psychological makeup falls into pieces. The only way to cope with such pain and resentment is to create an alternative personality. You make a promise. Your second person will become stronger, curb all the anger and rage to use any available means to avenge the innocence of your parents in this criminal, these criminals, any criminal. This is life seen through the eyes of Bruce Wayne. Both pairs. The world he sees is dark, gloomy and cold. Although he patrols the streets and people hear his cruise, they don’t rush for his autograph. He is their Savior, not the winner of the personality contest. Return of Batman about losers. Batman, for another Christmas, remains "the only lonely beast in the city." Bruce Wayne has never been able to legally arrest the vile Max Shrek. A penguin never manages to unleash his pain from the fact that his parents are throwing at the inhabitants of Gotham, and Selina Kyle is lost forever in order to be mentally fragmented and injured. And the hero does not get either a girl or a cat. This film permeates the desire of all of us so desperately to want to belong, to have a home, as Bruce Wayne and Oswald Cobbloot expressed it. The film reveals the need for Selina Kyle, Oswald and, of course, Bruce Wayne, we must all be heard, respected and not ignored. But sometimes we are all somehow depressed, we are told that we are ideals to behave according to a certain standard. Until we finally break down. At the end of the film, only hope remains, when we see Catwoman rise to the night sky. But whatever we want, we must all wish goodwill to all men and women. As for me, I cannot say that I will reach the moment when I believe that my duality problem will be solved. But it normal. We all have a dark side. The Return of Batman is not only the best movie about Batman, it is truly an outstanding masterpiece of the story.
