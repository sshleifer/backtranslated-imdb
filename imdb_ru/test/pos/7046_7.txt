I rarely even watch comedy movies or television these days. They are tasteless, vulgar and, most importantly, not funny. This can be seen as a refreshing blast from the past. It’s worth a look, and I don’t believe it will be outdated. Classic humor is classic humor, and a good essay is a good essay, no matter what era it was created in. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this movie again; it came to mind after a recent television viewing of a similar “Summer School”. Like this slightly newer movie, "Meatballs" are fun, not being violent, overly sexy, and not indulging in the humor in the bathroom. The key point, of course, is how an adult character makes such changes in the life of a teenage character — perhaps even practically saving changes — and how they both grow in the summer.
