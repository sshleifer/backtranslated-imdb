I suspect that a revisionist story is taking place here, but the feeling definitely goes away that Patrice Lumumba was a troublemaker who had incited his people to violence since the declaration of Congo independence. His inability to control his people and his decision to bring Soviet assistance to bring his armed forces in order, obviously, was what attracted the United States and led to its killing. However, replacing it with Mobutu, the United States did not decide anything. They made the situation just as bad. Well acting with excellent cinematography and inspiring score. Definitely worth a look.
