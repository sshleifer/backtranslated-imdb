The film "Jennifer" with Ida Lupino and Howard Duff is the magnificence of the film. This is an almost unknown film that all film fans should see. For Jennifer, the most unusual angles for that time were taken, which gave the film a surreal quality in time. I like black and white movies about noir. Film noir in color is not so good. The cast and script are excellent. Pretty creepy music is fun to listen to. Ida Lupino is one of the best and most talented actresses who have ever been graceful. I have never seen a play in which I would not like it. She was not only stunningly beautiful, she was a wonderful actress. The first film in which I remember how Ida Lupino was in the film “Roadhouse” with Richard Widmark and Cornel Wilde. I never forgot a film or hers. I saw her recent films, such as Food of the Gods and Women in Chains, and although these films were not her usual pay, she was still amazing as an actress in them. Howard Duff always looks amazing. I highly recommend this masterpiece to all. I have this movie on a VHS tape.
