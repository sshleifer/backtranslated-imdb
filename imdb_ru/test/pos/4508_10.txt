I read both books and watched a movie today. The storyline is so strong that almost any script or scenario could justify it. So there is nothing special there. However, this is still a beautiful film, because it makes you think and feel like a book. Watching is not the same as watching a documentary about a failed state and feeling sympathy for people suffering from the repressive regime, but it's like watching the story of any other ordinary person, unfolding from generation to generation and across continents. Amir’s cowardice, his guilt, his dilemmas and, finally, his choice of means of atonement could be the story of any of us. There is not a single unmistakable character, which you can watch and idolize, but they are all gray, like all of us. <br /> <br /> Another important note: the film copes with the chronicle of life. Afghans in more than twenty years of turbulent political scenarios. A vibrant, carefree childhood represents Kabul before the Russian invasion, and the desert, ruined remains of the city reflect what the Taliban have done to it. <br /> <br /> Child actors deserve the thumbs-up to the end, They can disgrace any mature actor. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen the movie yet or have not read the book, just enter the theater, remembering that you will witness a multi-layered story on the multi-colored fabric of human emotions and feelings. This film is not intended to incite anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban sentiments, but in order to experience the trials of human existence. <br /> <br /> I read some external reviews related to the site, and I must admit that there is no point in writing reviews that summarize the storyline as a distant viewer, and provide technical details about amazing cinematography or something something like that. At least for this film, you need to try to connect to it, and not to judge it objectively.
