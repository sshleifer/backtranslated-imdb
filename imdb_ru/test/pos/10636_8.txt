Isabel Huppert should be one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation. La Pianiste truly confirms this. As if that wasn't enough, Annie Girardot plays her mother, and Annie Girardot is one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation. So, as you can imagine, these castings are worth the horror that we have experienced. Isabelle and Annie play characters that we have never seen on the screen. Mother and daughter - yes, but with such violent fearlessness that sometimes I could not even blink or breathe. Personally, I don’t believe in the director’s intentions, I don’t believe that they (intentions) go beyond the shocking anecdote, and the ending made me cry out of disappointment, but I was riveted by a story written before the sensational Huppert and the cruelty of the Girardot force. I highly recommend it to movie lovers anywhere and to great collectors like me, you can't afford to miss “La Pianiste”
