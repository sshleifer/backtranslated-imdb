The definition of a vampire is an inhuman corpse that must leave the grave at night to drink the blood of the living. Bakdzhvi almost nailed this idea to the head, except for the cliché of sharp canines and neck bites. Being an R-rated film, I knew that this really applies to vampires who are actually vampires. This means that the characters in the film will do what the vampires actually do, without any limitations and rightly lack any charming moments compared to Twilight. After seeing the previous “Oldboy” of the Chan-Vuk Park, I very much expected Bakdzhvi. <br /> <br /> I was expecting some awkward plots with our anti-hero, known as the priest Sang-Hyun, and I was very impressed with his performance as a holy man who is forced in this predicament to be humane and obey his vampire thirst. (SPOILER) After the initial premise that he will survive a defective blood transfusion, he begins to thirst for blood and discovers his superpower and his flight abilities. Screenshots make it a transitional phase without power on the exposure. He begins to drink the blood of dying people and those who want to be killed for moral reasons. Often the tragic and dysfunctional love affair of a priest with a manipulative thee-jo is very fascinating, since the Master's song and OK-Vin Kim play in them. Special effects are properly placed in the background, and although he does not offer anything new in the way of tricks and computer graphics, he does not impose himself on the plot and character. The history and key storylines are very perverted and grotesque, but at the same time very original in their own Korean style. <br /> <br /> I can not say a lot of negativity about the Baji. Sometimes I ask myself whether the transitional stage of the priests could show that the priest had an emotional crisis with his transformation, but on the other hand it would give the film 3 hours. The film was long to begin with. On the other hand, vampires really do not have the ability to express emotions from the very beginning. As mentioned earlier, this movie is very tragic, so do not expect anything encouraging while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> In general, Bakjwi is delightfully dark, painful and original. I highly recommend this film for serious viewers who have passed through Twilight’s teenage years. This is definitely the Korean answer to Swedish “Let the Right One In”, which is also a good movie.
