For me, the North and the South (Books I and II) are the best TV series of the 80s. Just watching all these episodes was very interesting. Gene Kelly, James Stewart, Elizabeth Taylor, Olivia De Havilland, Robert Mitchum, even Johnny Cash ... No TV series has come close to this achievement. Dick Smith's prosthetics made Hal Holbrock's powerful performance even stronger. Manufactured costumes, jaw removal sites, everything. It is clear that at present there are excellent and bright television series (Desperate Housewives, Lost, 24), but the North and the South has been and remains one of those. Do not miss it. Only the image of David Carradine of the final villain (you can call him just a cruel husband) is worth watching. Perhaps some characters and situations are too stereotypical, I admit it, but the positives clearly cast a shadow over them. I'm so glad I finally came out on DVD in Spain.
