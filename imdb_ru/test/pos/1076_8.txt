A very interesting documentary - of course, a lot more than Sideways, a pseudo-wine drama - where the capitalist conspiracy is revealed in all its greed. According to the documentary - and confirmed by the recent publication of the biography of Parker - only two men dictate the nature of wines in the world: Robert Parker from Massachusetts and Michel Rolland, a French wine industry expert based in Bordeaux and also known as the Flying Winemaker. The director is smart enough to insert interviews with local wine producers from different regions of France, from Sicily to Argentina, and interviews with major industry players, such as the Mondavi family, to uncover the secrets of winemaking and marketing globalization. Be sure to look for anyone interested in the dark side of the industry. Drinking a glass of wine will not be the same political and commercial action after seeing this well-made documentary set.
