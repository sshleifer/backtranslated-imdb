"Beyond the Clouds" is an unusually skillful group of four vignettes, each of which offers a glimpse of a relationship between a man and a woman, from minor to stormy. Although the film offers excellent cinematography, some graceful visual beauty and a set of excellent performers, there is little meat on the bones of this fragmented work. The taste of relationships cannot convey their fullness, and synergism suggests that using one story in 2 hours can do much more than with four. However, “Beyond the Clouds” will be food for amateurs and a visual feast for all, albeit superficial, ferocious and without substance.
