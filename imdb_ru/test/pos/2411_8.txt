Okay, so this is a complete breakdown of the first child of Karate. However, I think that there can never be too many films, such as the first child of karate. There is something in this type of story that is especially suited for people like me. You get the general feeling that you can overcome adversity by learning something new about yourself. In this film, Hillary Swank is a special gem in the role of the next karate. You can really say that she has a bright future ahead. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that this film is not without problems. Unlike the first, Mr. Miyagi does not seem to want Julie to study martial arts and involve her in the fight. Looks like he forgot what his values ​​were from the first movie. In addition, one must be suspicious when inspected by the monks. Because of this film, monks have a too simplistic view of life, and in fact it does not explain why they do what they do in the storyline. The villains are also a bit uncertain, although they really hate the bad guys. I also have suspicions about martial arts films that end on prom night. <br /> <br /> So maybe this is not a perfect movie. So maybe this is not the best movie that can be made on Friday night. However, in many ways this is a guilty pleasure. Hillary Swank is just amazing, and the story, albeit non-original, works. In the film genre, which seems to be based on something other than action and violence, this is a breath of fresh air. Unlike all these Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van Damme, this is a film about spirit and heart. Some people need such films, and we’ll take everything we can. My rating: 8/10
