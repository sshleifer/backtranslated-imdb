This is truly an amazing story, and the most amazing part of all of this is that it really happened! If you have not noticed: it is based on a true story. <br /> <br /> (Possible spoiler) <br /> <br /> Imagine the shock and horror of discovering that your own father was once an SS officer officer in World War II. <br /> <br /> This is a very intriguing story, and I'm very surprised that a movie with a lousy rating of 5.3 is here at imdb.com. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7
