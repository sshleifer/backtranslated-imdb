I always liked the music of Frank Sinatra, and most recently I wrote a term paper on his life. I was fascinated by the life and the legend of Blue Eyes. However, I have never seen any of his films. So I wanted to see if his performance was as great as his singing. Well ... it was! I was amazed by his playing in this film! He really does a great job as a recovering heroin addict, Frankie Mashin, who is trying to rebuild his life and listen as a drummer in a local band. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger's direction is also great. I have not seen any of his other films. I read his biography on IMDB. He seems to be one of those directors who was very misunderstood, and people had conflicting thoughts about him. It looks like the person who loves cult enthusiasts the most. I have not seen enough of his films to know for sure if he is really brilliant, but now I'm curious. I want to see more of his films, because, judging from his attempt with “The Man with the Golden Hand,” this guy has talent. I also loved the music for this film. The score definitely contains the music that I will remember if I ever hear it again. It is then that you learn that you have a great result. <br /> <br /> Supporting characters also perform well with them, including Darren McGavin as a local drug dealer, Eleanor Parker as Frankie’s wife in a wheelchair and Kim Novak as his lover. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how the filmmakers coped with the problem of drug abuse, in contrast to modern attempts in films such as Trainspotting and Requiem for a Dream. As far back as 1955, the mention of the word “drugs” caused controversy, and if you watch the film, they kept the subject at a very low level. There is only one scene where Frankie actually injects heroin into his hand, and they demonstrate the reaction of his face, rather than showing how the needle graphically pierces his veins. But it delivered his message without making it feel weak. In such a powerful drama, with such powerful performances and directing, you do not need the graphic images of drug abuse to interest the audience. <br /> <br /> “The Man with the Golden Hand” is a dramatic gem that all movie lovers should check out. This is really an awesome job! <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 (out of 10)
