This film is masterfully produced by Clive Barker, he really knows how to establish a connection between the audience and the characters. I think that for this sequel is not enough, Barker had to devote a sequel to this film instead of making the boring Lord of Illusions, which I think was real rubbish. But I also think that because of this and because of the lack of a sequel, NBreed has become a dark cult classic of horror films.
