At the beginning of “Little Dieter, we see that we need to fly,” Dieter Dengler, the subject of the film, is obsessive and intrusive. Or, at least, this is what he seems to be constantly opening / closing doors and with a large supply of food in the basement. In a sense, the director Werner Herzog asks the central question why Dieter is. Well, in fact, he is not necessarily obsessive-obsessive, as he is simply well prepared. And why shouldn't he be after the life he lived in? In addition to the most juicy, the most gloomy and exciting, frightening and just frankly pursuing the story of survival, which is the core of the picture, the story of Dieter is also exciting. For example, from the very beginning, Dieter’s childhood was already hard, he was in the post-war Gernay, poor in a family that did not have much food or prospects, and ate wallpaper for the “blue walls”. But enter passion, unshakable desire (which, of course, is part of the Duke’s bread and butter and love for the man in his films), which flies, and for Dieter there was nothing else but to fulfill it. What it does when he becomes an American citizen is more than he could count. <br /> <br /> Dieter is one of the most convincing, bizarre, and compassionately observed figures in his entire career, a man whose memory is frightened by fierce memories of being a prisoner of war in Vietnam, although at least he provides some of the most compelling narratives in any documentary film in the last 20 years. Ironically, storytelling takes place - unlike the “Wild Blue Won” - mainly in many and many of Dieter’s many expositions of some of the smallest details of his time in various prison camps fairytale engagement ring), and leading into the most interesting and sad parts with his best friend Dwayne. They escaped from prisons together, but found that their way to Cambodia would not be so easy. Now, thanks to most of this, the conversation does something exciting, that is, when Dieter looks through his stories and occasionally does repeated productions (in fashion, the Duke could only do with Dieter, already middle-aged, in handcuffs, etc. ). through the jungle), all this can be represented in the mind. Everything becomes even brighter to try to combine these small details and the intensity of all this into the form of reality. The fact that Herzog makes these parts simple and knows when to restrain Dieter in his answers makes him an even more interesting figure. He is never completely “normal”, but unlike Timothy Tredwell, you won’t even think about laughing at him. <br /> <br /> So, together with his hero (it is difficult to say about war or not, as Dieter disputes, claiming that those who died were real heroes, typical, but perhaps quite true), Herzog styling his film with a mixture of old video materials when he details Dieter's youth (historical footage of the scenes of the Second World War and the post-German fragment). always a spectacular sight, and with Herzog rises a step in his time and an assembly with music), and in capturing footage of Vietnam from a bird's eye view of the jungle and fields. Herzog is also very wise not to introduce politics into the process at all; there is no “I was used by the Americans” or something else that was added. There is even a feeling that Dieter is not too offended at everything that happened to him, that this is exactly what happens during the war (and, of course, he WAS to drop bombs on people from his plane). Now, despite most of this painful - and even into small pieces, related to what happened in prisons, bathrooms and scraps of food, it is always painful - fortunately, Herzog also controls the level of humor. One of my favorite scenes in the film, where Herzog breaks away from Dieter for a moment, is when he shows a trainee film used for American soldiers, designed to show what should happen if left in the jungle alone .. ... with all the equipment they could have, including a knife, a flare gun and a very fast helicopter to bypass it (and this turns into a fun voice acting). <br /> <br /> However, even the moments when a person laughs only remind of absurd moments in times of absolute crisis, and as no one can imagine what it is like to be alone in someone else’s territory surrounded by people who will do everything to save the mentioned person as a form of security in wartime. Dieter, besides the knowledge that flying and airplanes are the only way of life that he would ever like to have (and the Duke finishes the film on a surprisingly gloomy, elegiac note, where he flies over a large field of airplanes), he knows what it is survive by any means. But, nevertheless, as in many of the Duke’s films, driven by heroes, there is an almost unchanging spirit that will continue to exist if it is strong enough, even in terrible moments (the fate of the Danube) and problems, up to the salvation of the helicopter (it is American or they ask by helicopter). Dieter is such a person with a spirit, and through the Duke he gave a fantastic, tragic, creative, conscientious, although perhaps too short, tribute to his life. And, of course, it pumps me even more for the upcoming dramatization of Rescue Dawn.
