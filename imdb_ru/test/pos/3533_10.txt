“Just Before Dawn,” Jeff Lieberman, of course, is one of the most underrated horror films ever made. The film, although under the slight influence of Liberation and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, is extremely creepy and memorable. relaxes, and the atmosphere is really creepy. The cast is superb, Deborah Benson and Jamie Rose are great female roles. Inbred twins are really frightening and merciless killers. The film is beautifully shot - it was actually filmed on the spot at Silver Falls State Park in Oregon. Very little blood, but one murder, when Verchel is stabbed to the groin, is rather unpleasant and unpleasant. Be sure to watch the fans slasher. 10 out of 10 - what else?
