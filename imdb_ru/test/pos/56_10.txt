“Lackawanna Blues are so emotionally influential in portraying urban blacks in the 50s and early 60s. A culture of joy and sadness characteristic of the black working class that existed outside the mainstream culture. The characters in the play by Santiago-Hudson portrayed blacks who lived an imperfect life, but maintained strong positive values ​​of love, loyalty and honor. Although the characters from time to time moved away from these values, they did not deny the importance of values. Instead, they recognized and accepted their own imperfections and shortcomings of other characters. without a judgment that went through the life of a “nanny”.

I will watch her again and again.
