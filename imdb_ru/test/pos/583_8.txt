I first saw this film as a teenager when it was released in theaters, even then. Seeing this again, almost 30 years later, I was surprised at how well he stood. The jokes are still funny, the interaction between the characters works fine, and cameos are better off than ever. (Steve Martin should be the best.) My kids (9, 11, and 14) liked it, and the music is so good that they still hum the melodies many days later. <br /> <br /> I would advise you to watch at least half a dozen episodes of Muppets before watching a movie in order to understand the background of the characters, otherwise the film won. ‚Äù It makes no sense.
