It was a modern classic television! The story is this: Bob has a girl named Alicia. Bob and Alicia are in love and want to get married. Bob has a buddy named Owen, with whom he works. Owen is jealous of Alicia. He likes hanging out with Bob. Now Owen hangs out with Bob and Alicia. Bob and Owen have a secretary named Heather. Heather is very susceptible to accidents. She also, if you have not guessed it, is a bit lonely. She also hangs out with Bob, Alicia and Owen. Sometimes Alicia wants Bob to have no friends. <br /> <br /> By the end of the first season, it seemed that Owen had finally found himself a real old friend. Bob and Alicia rode the night before the wedding, sorted out a tiny car and got stuck. Out of the wilderness! What happened next? What about poor Heather? Has anyone married ?? Sorry, the series is over. <br /> <br /> Even a telegid request did not make FOX think twice about releasing it on the air. It was a great show with a great cast. I loved Heather too. In these glasses, she looked cool and was fun. I really miss this show. It is like reading a good book with an absent ending ... sad.
