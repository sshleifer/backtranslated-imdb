I had been looking for this film for so long before I found it, I saw it when I was younger and loved it, after the second viewing I still loved it and still. <br /> <br /> this is a love / hate film, if you like the bottom, young, comic, then you will find it funny. If you do not like this humor, do not worry. I love this film and grew up with these comedy programs, for me this film simply shows their comic genius on the big screen. He is not a laureate, but if you just want a good wholesome farce, then he is! <br /> <br /> The film lacks the quality of the series, and it usually happens with movies, but there is still enough material in it to make you laugh, even if many jokes are very similar to their previous work. <br /> <br /> Yes, humor is a little childish and not to everyoneâ€™s taste, but sometimes it is simply necessary in the film.
