It's just funny how underestimated this movie is. This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It never lags behind, it never slows down, it is a film that has a wonderful stream to the plot. That, along with the brilliant script, makes this movie awesome. Amir and Salman are outrageous, even Ravina and Karisma are ridiculous in this film. Paresh Raval and Shakti set a great comedy about a bad guy, but Vidzhu Hoth and Ajit-imitator are the best with the stunned intentions of a bad guy. If you want to laugh and enjoy the movie, watch this movie, do it with your family or friends, you will not regret it. Most Indian films tire me to the end because they are 3 hours. This film is just as long, but I would like to see more after it, because itâ€™s a terrific movie.
