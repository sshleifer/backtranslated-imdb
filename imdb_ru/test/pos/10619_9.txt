Get ready for a trip to Haneke's “La pianiste” ... The psychological illness of the main character, played well by Huppert, goes beyond any limits you can expect. The most striking thing about this is that you begin to feel compassion for the character of Eric. Garbage-sexuality (without nude scenes), perversion, masochism, incestuous relations ... Haneke gives us raw food that is hard to digest; sometimes the only way to avoid extremism in some scenes is to start laughing at it. “Mise en scène” is perhaps not the most attractive part of the film, it has obvious Austro-German, sometimes Scandinavian notes: static, long scenes, but never boring. The vein settings used by the French language make it all look like a European blend. The permanent Germanic music background (Schubert) is perfectly matched. First of all, both the Cannes awards for the best actors are well deserved: one of the greatest performances of the year by one of the greatest French actresses in history.
