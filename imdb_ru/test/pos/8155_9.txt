Hey man, these are films about choice. All the time in your life you have to choose something, or it will simply come to naught ... And this film will prove it! Of course, life doesn’t really look like a beautiful picture, as this film shows ... in fact, it doesn’t show, but some can understand it. I try to say that it is full of pain, love and deep lessons of life. Aaron, a Mormon missionary, a real shepherd, digging out the beautiful Chisthian in the depths, a skin-feeling guy ... <br /> <br /> This is a great ending, and you always believe in destiny, because it will surprise you or your other life as the last days ... <br /> <br /> A great thing to watch it !!!
