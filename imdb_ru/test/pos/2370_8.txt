This is a film that needs to be taken in context. It can not be seen if you have not watched the first two films, but people who see this film will probably be the owners of the box set or at least know someone who does it. And you should not expect "Blade Runner"; The budget of the films is not that big, and this is a much more exciting trip. <br /> <br /> In essence, the film is science fiction, filmed in the future Yokohama (filmed in Hong Kong, as is obvious), about society. where it is illegal to produce offspring. Sho Aikawa plays a similar role in Dead or Alive 2, and Riki Takeuchi is a detective for birth control officers. Takashi Miike is not one of those who tell you all their arguments on a dish, but it can be assumed that there is a law on childbirth (carried out by giving people pills) because of overpopulation, increasing life expectancy, and so on. Interestingly, the dialogues in the film are mostly Cantonese, while Shaw and Ricky (who play their roles, as always, brilliantly) speak Japanese, and some speak English. People criticized English for being wooden, but I did not find any problems with it. In addition, another person found the themes of homosexuality in the film offensive; said Takashi Miike was anti-homosexual. It may well be (and not all artists should be leftist), but I cannot see this film as an insult to homosexuals. He simply recalls the philosophy of ancient Greece, when homo or bisexuality was more common. The film contains similar proportions of fascinating and poignant moments with DoA 2, although in this film the action is based on martial arts and performed in a very good Hong Kong style. The cinematography in the film is very pleasing to the eye, with symmetrical frames, good color control to give the air a polluted look, and it's nice to see uncut, long frames that are so rare in Hollywood these days. Basically, this movie has something to please: a good sense of humor, exciting action and some very beautiful moments. This is the perfect ending to the series. You could criticize him for being a little stupid, but isn't that part of the charm?
