Another well-made part of moral ambiguity, in which the anti-hero is difficult to decide who to root for. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, “Desecrated” silenced anyone who said that there are no good roles for actresses in the cinema - at least in 1971. In this film there were four excellent roles for actresses, and they were all well played and well performed. <br /> <br /> Pamelaine Ferdin coped well with the role of Amy and played “Wanda of June”. It must have been the first time the box office star of an adult man shared a long kiss with a twelve-year-old girl on camera, and wondered if there was a lot of controversy at the time. It was probably Polanski’s favorite scene. Given the fate of the turtle Amy "Randolph", it is not surprising that Ferdin grew up to become an active animal rights activist. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page was also excellent, playing a complex character with the right amount of restraint. Interestingly, she died only three days after Elizabeth Hartman committed suicide (rushing through a window on the fifth floor), since they also worked together in "You're a big boy now." <br /> <br /> Hartman (who looks like she could be Blair Brown's sister) was beautiful like Edwin and should have received an Oscar (no other gigs were even close this year), but considering that we now know about her, you wonder how much her work has been studied and how much has just come from her. Edwina shows such a rough pain that is difficult to observe. Like Marilyn Monroe’s incredible performance in Inconsistencies, the viewer probably sees many of his own demons in the character she plays. <br /> <br /> Finally, Jo Ann Harris, who is amazingly perfect as the flirtatious Carol. For my money, Harris was the sexiest actress of the 1970s, combining sensuality with intelligence and humor. She was the best reason to watch the TV series "Most Wanted" and the only reason to watch the Wild Wild West in the past. It's hard to believe that someone who could put all this on the screen never became a big star.
