At 20, Francis Uymet (Shiite Lebuf), like his whole life ahead, is on the way. The son of an immigrant family living in the United States at the end of the 19th – beginning of the 20th century, the class was a very limiting fact of life. If a person is born poor, he remains poor; if someone is born in the bourgeoisie, he has a tiny opportunity; if someone was born in a wealthy class, he essentially did it in the shade. British gold champion Harry Vardon and Francis Golf idol (played by the underrated Steven Dillan) are the exception that proves the rule. Born and raised in a poor British family, his golfing experience allowed him to rise from the muddy mess of the poorest slums into the lush green of the English country clubs. He has not forgotten this life lesson. Francis wants to follow in the footsteps of Vardon and also uses his golf skills to get to the 1913 US Open at the age of 20. But the hard line and formidable opponents (including the idol of Francis Harry Vardon) are not all that Francis has to deal with, since the unaware father and the cruel social framework prevent him from living his dream. <br /> <br /> I know what you are thinking - I thought so too - Walt Disney’s 1913 USA film “Frank” with an irritable Shia LaBaf starring has the opportunity to be interesting, but it cannot be a good movie . Well, I'm here to make you think again. Despite the fact that it may seem to some on paper, "The best game ever played" is one of the best sports films in the works. <br /> <br /> As with any big sports movie, “The Best Game Ever Played” included many exciting sports scenes. but this is not a film * about * golf - this is a character-oriented film about how to use your talents, follow your dreams and overcome class barriers. Where the greatest game that has ever been played, works great as a thematic sports film, it also works like a historical film - the costumes and scenery shown in the film are the next best thing for real time travel. The film also simply * looks * like the great and almost unknown music composer Brian Tyler, putting the film into a wonderful musical composition. The cast is also gorgeous with the subtle but powerful Steven Dillan as British golf champion Harry Wardon, jolly Stephen Marcus as human golfer Ted Ray, Hammy Josh Flitter as teenager Caddy Francis Eddy and surprisingly good Shea LaBaff in the lead role as Frédé Frédé de Fred. . Actor Bill Paxton ("Apollo 13", "Titanic") for the second time turns the director (director of a feature film) into "The greatest game in history." It produces a wonderful product, with a lot of heart, ingenuity and attention to detail when making a film.
