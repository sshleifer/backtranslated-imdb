If you have a chance, watch this Russian language (as I call them: precious stones, masterpieces, hidden treasures?), War films like this, or Dawns are silent here, or Roadside tests ... And right after Look again American war films or international productions, films with allies, Germans, etc. Or, even worse, watch Italian war films. Everything from the west will seem superficial, contrived, ridiculous compared to Russian films. I am sooooo stunned by the quality of the above-mentioned Russian military films, that I cannot find words to praise their tremendous superiority over Anglo-Saxon war films.
