Everyone seems to compare this with the Matrix and the 13th floor, and when I first saw it, I would agree - I was expecting the Matrix and was a little disappointed. But when re-viewing my respect for this film is very increased. <br /> <br /> It should be borne in mind that “The Matrix” is an excellent action movie with the addition of the philosophical mumbo-jumbo. The 13th floor is a passable fighter with the addition of a slightly more interesting philosophical mumbo-jumbo. Existenz is not at all a fighter and not (as many seem to believe) about “reality” or any such “deep” concept. We are talking about the desire of a person to deliberately replace reality with an artificial (both in origin and in behavior) world of pretense. <br /> <br /> The most frightening moment in the film is when Allegra Geller repeats her “script” line. At this point, you realize that the people in the game voluntarily gave up their free will to participate in the story. This becomes even more frightening at the end, when D'Arcy Nader (or rather his player) comments on the opportunity to spend his life in the game. I fully sympathize with the “realistic” philosophy, according to which the creation of interesting worlds in which people simply find the right predetermined path to the ultimate goal, is ultimately a recipe for soulless existence. To live "in the game" is not to live at all, but a tempting way to spend time on earth. As Allegra comments on the real world, "nothing happens here." With the same success, you can look into someone else's imagination and pretend to be doing something interesting. (Although I have to ask whether Cronenberg considers this a self-incrimination, given that he himself proposes worlds that can be experienced in 90-minute passages.) <br /> <br /> After leaving the theater after the first viewing of this film, I thought that this is one of those films that you could see, just to see how it ended. But, having seen it a couple of times (thanks to the SciFi Channel), I realized how much deeper it goes. Seriously, if you saw it only once, it deserves another viewing.
