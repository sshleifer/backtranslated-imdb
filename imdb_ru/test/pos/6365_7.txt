Many people do not think that Dan Aykroyd is funny. This film proves the opposite. Aykroyd copes with his game in this comedy. The only serious problem with this is that he spends too much time at the end, jumping back and forth from Aykroydâ€™s character and the doctor who stalks him to prove that he is a fraud. The doctor is crazy, like Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfus) in "How about Bob?". The scenes where the doctor is desperate to return to Los Angeles are stupid, incredible, and unfamiliar. Another thing is that this aspect of the film is really funny, especially the first half.
