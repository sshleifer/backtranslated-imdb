While the Hayao Miyazaki films have always been a hit or a miss with me regarding the story, they are uniquely gorgeous, with simple animation characters on the background of artistic images. Ponio sticks to this formula, with a lead character so enchanting that I want her chic doll and scenery so beautiful that she will not look out of place in framing the picture on the wall. <br /> <br /> The story on the other hand, I didn’t really like the last two widely released releases, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. It was a very young child who liked children most of all and made adults just enjoy the animation. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed that the score was made by Joe Hisaishi, who also scored points for the aforementioned mentioned two films, this time was not so memorable. Although now I can’t remember how Howl’s account, I still remember how he was one of the most beautiful I have ever heard. Ditto Spirited's - although I only remember that it really complemented the film. Perhaps this is because Ponyo is a more minor fare, that the rating is not so illusory. In any case, this movie still needs to be watched by anime or Miyazaki fans.
