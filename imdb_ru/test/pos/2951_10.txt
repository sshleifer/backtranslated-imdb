This is a really great movie! It makes you think about your parents. As we all have a fragile relationship that we all have with them, if we really do not make an effort to find out who they are, as people. And, no less important, we must remember to open up and show them our true essence, and not just who, in our opinion, they want us to be. Be sure to watch this documentary! IMDb makes me write more text before they leave my comment, how strange. Usually online comments should be short, and here I am asked to write more! Well, I went to see a movie with my parents, I thought that later they would want to talk about their parents, but my dad continued to want to talk about himself and things in his life, he feels he screwed up, which was unusual, my dad is not restrained man, but I was surprised that he wanted to talk about the mistakes that he thought he made. Mike and Kitty came to the film to do questions and answers, and then there was a funny moment when my dad talked to Mike and my mom talked to Kitty! In fact, just ignore my last few sentences to supplement this comment, and just remember “51 Birch Street”, look!
