I have 2 sets of life time, these are my favorite movies of all time. I love all the actors and actresses .. Awesome picture .. I love Patrick Swazi .. This is a film that showed his real talent. But still, he does not receive credit for the show, which he formed! Much has been missed in these films. Love how they portrayed dry and dusty civil war monologues. Turning them into one of the greatest love stories of all time and showing through all the funny facts of life, which means true friendship .. As the two divided countries divided. Yet, all and all friendships remained strong, although the war separated kinship and friendships. But through all this, until the very end, they remained and taught us to the viewer how real friends can still remain to this day! Just the best .. Gone with the wind does not compare with this film. Patrick Swazi at his best. After watching this movie for a hundred thousand times. I became a big fan of Swazy .. And since then I have been following his career ... I have all his films after he starred in the North and South!
