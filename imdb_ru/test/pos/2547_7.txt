Some critics compare the Chop Shop with the theatrical releases of City of God and Pixote. I saw both of them, as well as Chop Shop and, as in many cases, I do not feel that the comparison is justified. The city of God and Pixot probably had a much higher budget. Chop Shop is a low-budget independent film about survival and hope, disappointment and continuation of life. One of the scenes was allegedly filmed during the US Open, and either the filmmakers had incredible connections, or the scene was filmed at another time, and the USA footage was added. I say this because I live in the area where this film was shot, and the security is insane while the tennis matches are on. It should also be noted that the real names of the actors were the names of their characters in the film. Back to the movie. This is a pleasant story about survival. However, in the end, he got 7, because ... sometimes the actors acted very well. In other cases, they seemed to be simply repeating their lines. If the actors were less competent (as, for example, in the low-budget “Big Dis”), I would be more forgiving. But in several scenes, each of these actors gave exemplary performances. At other times they seemed bored. The director may be at fault here. I also had problems with the final. This is one of those films that "just end." Maybe there will be part 2? Definitely worth getting on DVD. I will not summarize the story because this information is already available on IMDb.
