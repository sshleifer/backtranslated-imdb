As a sight, it is difficult to blame Nihon Chinbotsu. The Japanese have benefited from their close relationship with the sea, and the concept of the film implies that the whole world and way of life is under threat - thanks to its volcanic heritage. From the point of view of reality, it is rather silly to have a drama in which all of Japan disappears under the waves; why only japan? <br /> <br /> So, suppose we have a realistic film reality that is fed by the spectacle (and popcorn), and some may find it very impressive. Compared to adventures with Japanese radioactive monsters, it looks more mature and more dynamic. The emotional element is undervalued, and it really works. (However, with the climax of this song, she loses a little.) <br /> <br /> Is Nihon Chinbots trustworthy? Probably not, but exciting eruptions and relaxed stimulation make for more enjoyable fun that night once awaits.
