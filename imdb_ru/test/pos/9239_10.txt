After viewing “The Texas Story of Betrayal”, Cox could not afford any terrible correspondence, even if Stu didn't have a budget. He tells the story of dedication, sweat, talent, fire and punk rock. I like it! My favorite parts are the interview with Marcy (she is such a hot babe and she is digging me, but she just doesn't know yet). The Japanese clerk confused his lines, which enraged me. The sex scene was really cool. I'll see if Stu ever comes and takes a box of light waves when I do this with my woman. Entry and, of course, my 5 seconds at the time of closing credits. I know this will give me some chicks. I hope to see more from Antstuie, because I know that I can expect the unexpected.
