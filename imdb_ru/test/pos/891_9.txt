“S Division”, created by Dennis Spooner, was a glossy thriller show about the Interpol Geneva-based branch, created to solve mysterious puzzles that the police could not cope with. If the plane landed at Heathrow and there was no one on board, if a person was found who was wandering around London in a spacesuit, if the Rolls Royce passenger suddenly turned into a skeleton, if the train heading to the metro station turned out to dead passengers, you called Department S to sort it out. <br /> <br /> Peter Wingard played Jason King, a brightly dressed criminal novelist whose fertile imagination helped uncover many strange incidents. King caught the audience and was later awarded an extra show. He was ably assisted by the American "Stuart Sullivan" (Joel Fabiani) and the delightful "Annabel Hearst" (Rosemary Nichols). Unusually for the 60s show, the department was headed by a black man - “Sir Curtis Ceretse” (Dennis Alaba Peters). If the show looked and felt very much like The Avengers, it was hardly surprising. The same writers and directors participated in it! Colorful titles have been developed by Chambers & Partners and deserve special attention. As is the case with many I.T. series, the music was written by Edwin Astley. His theme for the Department S has become one of the best television themes of all time. <br /> <br /> As expected, the show looks a bit sexist and outdated, but don't let it discourage you. from setting. Imagine a hybrid of "Jonathan Creek" and the films of "Austin Powers", and you get the "Division S"! <br /> <br /> General Information: episode "A Small War of Nerves". young sir Anthony Hopkins starring!
