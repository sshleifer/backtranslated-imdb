For those of you who are looking for the crazy stunts of Harold Lloyd’s silent comedy, this film is not for you. What Cat's Paw gives us is an interesting and atypical character for Lloyd, who was trying to establish himself in the sound. <br /> <br /> For me, the closest comparison of a film with Lloyd’s character is Peter Sellers in the movie “To Be There”. Despite all the education that Lloyd received while dealing with the world, he could as well be brought up in isolation, as Sellers. <br /> <br /> But where he was raised, he was a child of a missionary in China and I do not know how much he and his family could teach Christianity to the Chinese, but young Harold learned the wisdom of the Chinese philosopher Lin Po, whom he constantly quotes as aphorism cookies with predictions. It turns out Ling Po turns out to be one wise dude. <br /> <br /> In any case, Lloyd’s father, Samuel S. Hinds, decided that his son needed some kind of education in the modern world of America of the 20th century, and sends him back to be a guest of the pastor of a home church who sponsors mission The pastor is a constant candidate for the “reform” movement of this city, Stockport. But as soon as Lloyd arrives, the pastor dies. <br /> <br /> Now the reformist fraud is a hoax, and the pastor is the boss of political bosses who need an opponent in all elections. They decide that Lloyd could be better than the guy who just died. <br /> <br /> Of course, in films of this type, Patsy is not so easy. In fact, Lloyd constantly quotes Lin Poe, the way Charlie Chan used wisdom, proves that he is an opponent of scammers running Stockport. In addition, Lloyd admires Una Merkel, the same cynical woman as Jean Arthur in the films “Mr. Deids” and “Mr. Smith”. <br /> <br /> Cat's Paw is still a good political satire, although Harold Lloyd did not become as big a comedy name as he was in silent films. A good roster of players was chosen by director Sam Taylor, who is led by George Barbier, who plays a political boss who discovers Lloyd and actually proves that he has a honesty trait.
