Well, when I first saw "Talk Radio" in a video store for only $ 2.00 on VHS, believe it or not, I looked at it and thought it might be about Howard Stern, because I looked at him at about thirty seconds, and then just did not see him again. About a month later I went to another store and found “Talk Radio” on DVD for only $ 5. So, I see that it was directed by Oliver Stone, and I picked it up. Therefore, after the end of the film, I was speechless. I have never seen a movie like this one. Here is the main story, then I will tell you what I think about it. <br /> <br /> This is Barry Champlain, the host radio program in Dallas, a Jewish radio host who talks about what other people are raising, and he intervenes and takes everything seriously. Now the network wants his show broadcast throughout the United States. So Barry's show gets a lot of interesting phone calls, such as Chet (neo-Nazi), Kent (the guy with the drugs in the style of rock and roll), John (the rapist) and others. Now, some of the callers sound like the same actor / actress. But, nevertheless, I think that everything is in order. <br /> <br /> What I like most about this movie is the dark corners and paranoid atmosphere of the radio station. Dark music in the background also fits very well. There is an episode in the film with memories of how he started with radio, and I think they succeeded. <br /> <br /> But the great thing about the movie ends. I was surprised by this, and it kind of makes you feel paranoid about phone calls on the air, and everything in it is wonderful. It also tells you how to talk to people in a big city like Dallas. One of Oliver Stone’s most under-rated / weak films is mentioned, but I think it’s the best in my opinion. <br /> <br /> But definitely get this movie if you like movies with paranoia - feel like movies with a dark atmosphere and ominous music in the background. I still watch this movie many times when I'm bored, and I watched it tonight. Yes, if you really want to feel the ominous mood of the film, watch it at night with the lights off. It may sound crazy, but it makes the movie better! <br /> <br /> Another thing I forgot to mention is that the reason I don’t think the film was so successful was, in my opinion, probably because of the title. "Talk radio". It doesn't sound very difficult or something like that. The best name, for example, “Talked To Death” or, maybe, “The Abusive Radio Host” or something catchy and incomprehensible “Talk Radio”. Or maybe because of Universal Pictures? I don’t think that Oliver Stone didn’t usually do Universal. Paramount may have been a good company. I don't know, something in this film is not very good, but I like it. <br /> <br /> "Sticks and stones can break your bones, but words can cause irreparable damage."
