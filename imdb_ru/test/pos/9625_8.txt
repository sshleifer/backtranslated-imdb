This is my favorite Kung Fu movie. It has a very authentic flavor, spiced up with creepy music (from traditional Chinese instruments, I think), and some surprisingly overloaded melodramatic moments, contrasted by the heavily touched comedy. Indeed, trying to create their own "western" (i.e. Film "Cowboy") genre, the Chinese came up with a completely new animal, marked by the battle of kung-fu and the associated sound effects. <br /> <br /> The story of Five Fingers Death is simple, the story of revenge (for killing a loved one) and the pursuit of the main character to master the “iron fist technique”, which will give him the opportunity to take revenge on his enemies. There is even a love interest, albeit an awkward, polite look (found in most Chinese films of that period). The end result, however, is great and far more reliable than any Bruce Lee film.
