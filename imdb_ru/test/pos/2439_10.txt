This is one of my favorite movies ever! Along with Casablanca and the Holocaust cannibals, this is almost an ideal cinema. Rex Allen tells this wonderful story about a cougar who just needs to love a little. contains action, adventure, suspense, comedy and chaos! WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU MUST KILL TO DO IT !!! You will not find a better image of a cat anywhere, with a "cat from space", which appears as a not so close second. Charlie's performance is great. even includes animal abuse and intensive logging! must love Disney, for all the moral failures!
