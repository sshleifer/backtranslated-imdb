This is probably one of the best French films that I have seen in a very long time! This “fake” or spy movies parody is very well done and will make you laugh from beginning to end. Some references to the modern world are very subtle. The entire Moroccan context of the film must be understood in the light of contemporary French culture / environment. However, all the jokes and seemingly shocking remarks that could be understood as such because of this context are allowed and accepted because this is a parody. <br /> <br /> My sisters, who had already seen this film, told me that I also had to go, and assured me that I would have a great time, and I really did it! If you liked old 007 movies with Sean Connery, as well as films such as “Airplane” or “Hot Shots”, you will be delighted. I just hope that this movie will be released on DVD in the USA ... Wait and see.
