Big Fat Liar is the best movie ever! This is funny and cool. Jason Shepard (Frankie Munise) proves that he did not lie, and goes to Los Angeles to pick up his article from Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Together with your friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes), ruin his life, since Marty will not call Jason's father and say that he wrote a newspaper! Yet everything turns out well and it's a good movie to watch!
