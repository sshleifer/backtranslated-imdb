Unlike http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098238/, this film does not contain reference information. We are shown a snapshot of Danton’s fall, its false process and execution, but if one does not study the revolution in sufficient detail, it’s hard to understand where the characters come from (Fouquier-Tinville, Filippo, Demoulin, Robespierre ...) and in such a way as to evaluate them that they are: Danton and Joe Blobb may be the same person for the viewer. For example, Robespierre & Desmoulins have been close friends since their youth, and this explains how Robespierre works. Nevertheless, those who know the facts will easily orient themselves and appreciate this good film with actors who demonstrate impeccable play, without unnecessary scenes and good time reconstruction. Desmoulins and Danton are the best characters, but they all do a good job, even the “crazy” Saint-Just is portrayed as a psychopath. “Terreur” was a period of massacres, the importance of which was not fully documented and which — for the most part — were caused by ambition, greed, and the resolution of personal disputes, were fed by ignorant sansculottes as the next epochal step against tyranny,
