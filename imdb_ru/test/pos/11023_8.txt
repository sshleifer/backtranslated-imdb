Blimey! I caught it at the IFC recently after seeing “But I'm a fan.” I have never heard of this movie, but the description sounded remotely interesting. I met the expectations and now I must say that this is one of the best love stories in the world. Robin Tanney perfectly copes with the image of a person with the help of a tourette. The relationship between these two and just the smallest detail in the film is so accurate and believable. I usually hate "romance" and I love movies, but this film really touched me. I recommend this film to anyone who has a vision.
