A recent survey of children in the UK reinforced the idea put forward by this film 27 years ago. Being more than anything, young people want to become famous. Previously, children and doctors were firefighters. Now everyone wants to be famous. Fame is the story of a group of children enrolled at the High School of Performing Arts in New York. We saw them first at the audition, then at the lessons and learned about life for the next four years. The film has many wonderful qualities, but ultimately makes you feel a little unsatisfied. <br /> <br /> Alan Parker's bold uncut style fits well into the story. The film was classified as musical, but most of all it is a drama. Music rooms and dance programs flare up here and there, and Parker makes them as realistic as possible. Acting is for the most part a top box with a few exceptions. The pace lags behind a bit, especially towards the end of the film, but by this point the story has already taken a few wrong turns. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the auditions at the beginning of the film were to weed out a couple of the main characters. It seems unlikely that someone would appear and listen in one section, and then come across a reception in another. Some of these people just do not look so talented or interested from the very beginning. As soon as the first year of classes begins, the film turns into a pleasant scene. The interaction between students and teachers is very well handled, and this leaves you wanting more. The film begins to lose itself later when we see more and more student lives outside of school. Some of these people just do not care. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake of the film is to make the character Ralph Garsey so outstanding. This guy is a chametz; selfish jerk. “Professional hole”, as he proudly declares on stage during his comedy programs. It is assumed that the audience will somehow feel this guy and his tragic personal situation, but I just hoped that they would throw his ass out of school. Irene Cara, Maureen Tiefy, Paul McCrane and the late Gene Anthony Ray are people you will care about by the time this movie ends. No matter how hard you try, I still can not develop a press, like Gene Anthony Ray in this film. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is good. These are unforgettable, interesting and full of bold scenes and performances. It works, maybe for too long, and perhaps some of the wrong characters are fully developed, while others seem to hover in the background. The musical numbers are great, and by the time the movie ends, a surprise awaits you. Although the film "Glory" and not perfect, it will remain a film that somehow will live for many years. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Dog.
