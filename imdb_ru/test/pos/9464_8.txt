At first I honestly thought it would be a trite film. But seeing this, I was quite surprised. Amanda Bynes was convincingly ridiculous with supporting actors (especially with the character played by “Bullet Tooth Tony” from the movie “Trick.” What a contrasting role between these two films!). Now I am not one of those who can say whether the actor is good or not, but her act, especially, was very pleasant. Even though the plot turned into a love triangle (albeit very funny) halfway through the film, I feel that this should not be discounted, as it seems to me, the film is really just entertaining. So, if you accidentally stumble upon it, whether on a DVD or in a theater, I'm sure you will like it.
