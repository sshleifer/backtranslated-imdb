Much better than is commonly believed, this version of The Lost Horizon had not only great music and beautiful landscapes, but also an amazing mountain photo. Several years ago, a special laser disc was released, to which more than 30 minutes of previously removed material, additional music and many bonus materials were added. So why is it not on DVD? It's hard to understand studios sometimes. Of course, the roles could be given to people who could sing better than Peter Finch, Liv Ullman, George Kennedy and Sally Kellerman, but what do you want in a film, a good acting game or melodious trumpets? The song and dancer Bobby Wang is very funny, Michael York is a tragic villain, respectively, and see how Sir John Gilgud played out because Chang might seem silly, but actually works very well on the screen. Believe me, you should check out this movie - if you can find it!
