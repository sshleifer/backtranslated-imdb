Being a newcomer to college, this film reminded me of my relationship with my mother. Of course, my situation is not parallel to the situation with Natalie Portman and Surandon; but my mother and I grew up on typical fights with mother and daughter. Mother always tells you what to do, or not to be the mother you want to be. I closed my eyes at the end of this movie. Surandonâ€™s reaction to the fact that her daughter went to the east coast for many miles, after all that they went through, reminded me of how I felt when I was from a small town on the west coast going to New York. <br /> <br /> The film is intended for women who have children who have already grown up. It is very touching, I was touched by the film. Every feeling from the characters in this movie was completely real, you didn't get any fake sentimentality. I sat alone during the screening of this film, wanting my mom to sit next to me so that I could hug her and thank her for everything. This film, of course, is a bit banal, but everything is very important. All that a mother can learn from her child; and that the child learns from his mother. 8/10
