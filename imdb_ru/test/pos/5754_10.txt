I have this movie on DVD, and I watched it about 10 times, and it's still fun. Jokes will never get boring, and I often laugh at inappropriate times, just thinking about them. It is assumed that Richard and Eddie from Bottom are famous for the cheapest hotel in the UK near the nuclear power plant. They desperately need money, and when a hiding movie star comes to stay, their luck just might be. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and not feel completely bored or nasty, you must first like the humor, Someone will say that only hardcore fans can watch it. But overall this is a great movie.
