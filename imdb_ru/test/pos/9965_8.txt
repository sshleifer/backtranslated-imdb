Michael Radford, director of the Venetian Merchant, does a great job of opening the play, as it makes it more accessible for everyone to have a great time in films watching this thorny story about a terrible historical time. Juicy staging of the play of Shakespeare is a feast for the eyes with its rich detail of Venice of the XVI century. <br /> <br /> This is a story of revenge, prejudice, and justice, as William Shakespeare represented. After seeing the play several times, we were not prepared for what to expect. Mr. Radford is concerned with setting out the story in such detail that everyone can easily understand it. In addition, he used the English version, which makes more sense than relying on the original text. In fact, the way Shylock says in the film is not shocking at all, since he is a member of a minority that was marginalized by the Venetian authorities and the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino is a stunning image of Shylock showing a man who is vulnerable, arrogant, vindictive, stingy and completely human, and at the same time. Mr. Pacino sheds light on the character of the person who was defeated in court for technical reasons. His own daughter left him, and his whole world seems to have fallen on him. At the end of the film we see a man whom everyone has become a target for hatred and ridicule. <br /> <br /> Lynn Collins, as Portia is a happy discovery. Seeing her in a lighter form, she not only surprises, but also does everything possible for her role and her time in front of the camera. She shows us that she is a woman of high intelligence who comes to the aid of her husband and his best friend, who risked her own health, trying to help Bassanio to get Portia's hand. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays Antonio, the man who is looking for Shylock for a bridge loan. In the end, he knows that his ships will soon return from abroad. Antonio gets much more than he expected, agreeing with Shylock on the terms of the loan. Antonio's best plans go astray when he suddenly cannot fulfill his obligations. Mr. Irons demonstrates a subtle view. <br /> <br /> Joseph Fiennes looks good like Bassanio. His good looks and charm make an impression on Portia, who clearly sees the soul mate in this young Venetian, as she knows that he is for her. In addition, in small roles, Chris Marshall, Zuleica Robinson and Charlie Cox contribute to making the film an enjoyable experience. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is Mr. Redfordâ€™s triumph because of his vision of Venice and the citizens at a terrible time in human history.
