This is the best television series for children (and adults). John Hurt is a great actor who has had many great performances over many years, but he was born to play the narrator. Scenarios for almost every episode are great examples of mastery, and the productions cover the whole range of emotions, alternately funny, sad, happy, exciting and always intrusively beautiful. It is difficult to choose the best episode from such a number of excellent rivals, but “Soldier and death” with its timeless pathos are invincible. This is a TV series to watch with your children, again and again.
