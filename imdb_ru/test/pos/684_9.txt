“Trembling Shakespeare” can be considered the first classic of the era of “Our gang”. To date, Hal Roach Studios have begun to strive to make talking pictures, and Shakespeare is a happy result. <br /> <br /> The Gang appears in the Quo Vadis version created by Kennedy's cop wife. Children do not find the play very funny, and they are distracted by people in the theater, and they cannot remember their plots. Among the funniest pieces is a Kennedy cop in the role of a giant who takes off his makeup to fight an overly zealous man in a bull costume; and a terrible dancing girl (played by the daughter of director Bob McGowan). <br /> <br /> In several films it is mentioned that Shakespeare had the first pie fight on the radio. This may be true, because they tried different speeds with the film during the fight. Harry Buster Keaton's brother Harry is at the receiving end of one of the pies. Very fun and early classic Gang Talkie. 9 out of 10
