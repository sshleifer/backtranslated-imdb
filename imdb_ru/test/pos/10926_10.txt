I watched a lot of short films on my day. Often I find them either too compressed (throwing too much information to the viewer in a short period of time during which they have to run), or too “fanciful”, or they lack clear vision. I can't say anything about Starcross. In this review I will do my best to avoid dramatic spoilers, but I also assume that the reader understands that the theme of this film is fraternal incest. <br /> <br /> As in any short film, the story is quite simple, straightforward, and easy to digest. It is clear that the film is trying to shed light on one of the deepest taboos of modern society. This film achieves success in all respects. For fifteen minutes of running, I felt a gamut of emotions. With just a little dialogue, the viewer is quickly drawn into the most personal moments and thoughts of these crossed stars. <br /> <br /> From the initial scene created in early childhood, you can see a very close relationship of the brothers there. When the film moves to today in the next scene, excellent acting and honest, sincere actions remind the viewer that love can come in the most unexpected and sharp way. As the relationship develops, any disgust that the viewer may first feel is quickly replaced by sympathy and emotional distress, as the viewer suddenly realizes that there can be only one possible solution. And the consequences of this resolution are heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Anyone with an open mind would do well to watch this movie and soak up its message. If nothing else, then boldly and honestly challenge the viewer to reconsider some of our deepest convictions about the filled with shame and secretive taboos of incest. Although the film lasts only fifteen minutes, it responds to the viewer long after the captions roll. This is perhaps my favorite short film I've ever seen. I can not recommend this highly enough.
