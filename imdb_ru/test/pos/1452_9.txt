“The Man with the Golden Hand” by Otto Preminger - a reference to heroin addiction, which must have been quite risky to shoot back in 1955, fifty years ago (today the censors still have problems with the content of drugs in the movies!). br /> <br /> The lead role was originally proposed to Marlon Brando, and then captured by Frank Sinatra before Brando could respond. Sinatra convincingly portrays a professional card dealer and a former heroin addict who returns home to the city just to fight the temptation demons. <br /> <br /> Preminger is one of my favorite directors (his “Murder Anatomy”). “James Stewart, starring, is a brilliant and revolutionary drama in the courtroom.” Preminger largely helped to change the face of the movie back in the 50s - “Murder Anatomy” was extremely controversial when it came out because of both its plot and content (references to rape, women's “panties” seduction, etc.) and "The man with the golden hand" deals with the same volatile topic. <br /> <br /> However, Preminger copes with it without becoming an exploiter. This is similar to the harbinger of “Panic in the Park of Needles” (1971) and has several similarities with the common themes of Billy Wilder’s classic film “Lost Weekends” with Ray Milland in the lead role. These three films, in particular, are probably the best films about alcoholism that existed before the 1980s, and are still relevant today.
