I rented this gem a few times! It is a small, but at the same time, an expanding masterpiece that transferred the viewer from the Manhattan brilliance to the beauty of the Greek islands. John Cassavetes on-screen marriage with his real wife, Gena Rowlands on the rocks. He finds meaning in the cast with the indecent Susan Sarandon, whom he finds in Greece, while their daughter, played in her earliest movie role by a young man, Molly Ringwald, falls in love with the son of a Greek magnate who cares for her mother on a sailing yacht neighboring waters. Meanwhile, the extremely talented Raul Julia plays with a shepherd living in a cave with her Sony Trinitron. He has "screams" for character Molly Ringwald, until he faces John Cassavetes. Everything ends in a classic final scene where everything is agreed. Raul Julia, a goat, dances with his goat. This film is full of mysticism, beauty, young and old love, humor, sexuality and more. See it!
