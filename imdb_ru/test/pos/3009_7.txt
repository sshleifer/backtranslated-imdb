I could not believe my eyes from beginning to end. Being a fan of movie directors of music video masterminds. I am pleased to announce that the photograph in this film is a magnificence that can be seen. There are so many rich, full images in front of me that every time I see this film, I find something new that I have not seen before. As in previous films I have seen, such as Blade and Secret People, also former music video directors, using color to attract attention is used extremely well. Although the characters could be designed better, the action and costumes were worth the price of admission. I recommend you buy this one for your DVD collection. Even if you have not seen it on the big screen, you will not be disappointed. I know I was not.
