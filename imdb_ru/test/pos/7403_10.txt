Well, I'll say it. This movie made me laugh so hard it hurt. This statement may offend some of you who might think that this film is nothing more than a waste of the film. But the fact that most people do not understand is that this film was conceived to be bad and depraved. I mean, did people think that a movie about a snowman killer was supposed to be a masterpiece? Just look at the “scary” hologram on the cover of the film and you will find your answer. Instead, like the original Jack Frost (which seemed to me just as funny), this film turned out to be an unreal journey into the depths of banal dialogue, bad liners and terrible special effects. And all this is done to bring laughter to the audience. It certainly worked for me. <br /> <br /> For example: Ann Tyler (to her troubled husband): Why are you frowning so much, dear? <br /> <br /> If this piece of dialogue does not help make you laugh, then you have serious problems. Who in their right mind will pronounce these words in real life? Of course, no one, because it must have sounded ridiculous! Just take one viewing of this movie with an open heart and low expectations, and hopefully you will see that damn funny in Jack Frost 2.
