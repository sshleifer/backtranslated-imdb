Having learned and loved this book from eleven years old, I was frightened to see it in the form of a film - what if they caused a terrible confusion? In case I do not have to worry at all. Everyone was very well chosen, and the acting was awesome, she followed the plot very well, with the exception of the strange addition of a scene in prison that I didn't add anything to. However, this is indeed the most beautiful love story, and I am so glad that I took it on video so that I could watch it again and again. My only complaint is why they didn't give Kester a green vest, “which made him such a personable person”? Such a simple thing when they went to so much trouble for everything else. If you have a chance, take a look at it, that's great.
