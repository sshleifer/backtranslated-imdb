If people really were so stupid, I could become the Supreme Ruler of the World. In this film, Notts plays a muffled bean stand for some small town with water shots, which is controlled by a group of crooked simpletons, only slightly brighter than it. When things seem a bit wobbly for scammers, they go to the figg base. A lot of laughter when Notts commits his usual clumsy act. I especially appreciated the extender scene; Affinity at the highest level.
