For those who expect documentaries to be objective creatures, let me give you a little lesson in American filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Documentary films rely heavily on casting. You choose and select characters that you think will enhance the dramatic and entertaining value of your film. <br /> <br /> After you've shot a ton of footage, you merge them together to make a film with ups and downs, turning points, climaxes, etc. If you have problems with the available frames, you either you shoot even more that makes sense, find some shots from the warehouse or are witty in your narration. <br /> <br /> The statement that the filmmakers used location frames that are not part of the film (favels near beautiful beaches) does not detract from the value of the film as a dramatic work, and the particular image resonates enough to justify its not entirely true inclusion . In any case, you can use the footage. So they didn’t have video footage of police violence in that particular area. Does this mean not to include it, but simply to talk about it or, perhaps, to insert some kind of animated animation so that the audience is not “deceived”? Hmm, no. <br /> <br /> With regard to the promising end, why not? Yes, the Americans did it. Yes, Americans are optimistic bastards. But why end on a note? Just because it happens in a foreign country, and foreign films generally end on a note? Let foreigners portray a gloomy world view. <br /> <br /> Let's Americans, we think that a happy ending may come in the future. There just might be one.
