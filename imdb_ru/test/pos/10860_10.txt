I have nothing but praise for this mini-series. He is only one and a half years old, but I have already seen him twice; with great pleasure the second time than the first. I seriously think about seeing him again soon, as I find him spiritually inspiring. <br /> <br /> This is a very tender romantic drama with such beautiful performances, decorations, costumes, music and scenes that it has a resonance that puts it almost in a separate league among mini-series. <br /> <br /> Some others comment on the difficulties associated with lesbian life in Britain in the 1890s. There is nothing particularly difficult about this; only male homosexuality was against the law, which poor Oscar Wilde endured for his great price and for a huge loss for the literary world. In any case, I was distracted. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is very important for television. This is perhaps one of the greatest tragic romantic dramas from the time of Romeo and Juliet, although not in the conventional sense. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 from me. <br /> <br /> JMV
