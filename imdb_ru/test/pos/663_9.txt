Loved this movie! Kicking the old school! I love the idea. I love the script. I love characters. I really loved geeks! I was thrilled to see the horrible horror clicks of farce still honored. It was right with my favorites, such as Saturday the 14th and Pandaemonium. If you are a big fan of scary and stupid, then this is your movie! Just shot one star because I would like to have the best sound. A good sound, but I would like to have more. Large splashes of blood. Great murder weapon. Gorgeous costumes! I really love tribute to the great teen stereotypical club of the 80s ala breakfast club. And I can appreciate not waiting for CGI. Really good camera action and easy waiting instead of downsizing to CGI I would prefer to have a good fake that is really fake. <br /> <br /> Kiss of actors and creators! Oh, I also loved the "creation"!
