Member of Parliament James Hacker did not expect him to become the next prime minister. Unlike America, the party is elected in the UK, and we Americans vote for candidates regardless of their party. Despite the controversy, Paul Eddingtonâ€™s speech as minister, who became prime minister almost overnight, is assisted by his senior adviser Sir Humphrey, played by another knight, Sir Nigel Hawthorne, and veteran actor Derek Fouldes also returns to the stage. Now, instead of pleasing some people, he should please the nation, not his elector. Now he has to work hard, even more difficult than before. Now he must approve the list of honors and work regularly with Her Majesty. Hacker is not a hacker type. Rather, he is not every person we love and do not want to dislike and turn into a kind of villain or an evil dictator. Now we see the point of view of the Prime Minister and all the pleasures that must continue, as well as cope with the strikes.
