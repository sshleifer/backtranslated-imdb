The nutty police detective suspects the French duke that he is the notorious thief ARSIN LYUPIN. <br /> <br /> John and Lionel Barrymore gathered together for the first time in a movie in this intriguing crime drama. As they are all different, they are the perfect counterpoint to each other. John plays his part with courteous sophistication (when he's not disguised), and Lionel is down-to-earth and common in his image, each obviously having a wonderful time trying to beat the other. Thanks to the generous scenario, the result is largely a draw, and the viewer is the clear winner. <br /> <br /> Despite being beaten by two male stars, Karen Morley is intrigued because the mysterious woman John finds naked in her bed. Tally Marshall plays the colorful role of a stupid nobleman who might lose the main culprit. Henry Armette and George Davis are very pleasant as two seriously inept guards. John Millan provides a strong presence in his small role as a police prefect. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers recognize the uncredited Misha Auera as a conductor in the Louvre during the climatic scene related to the attempted robbery of Mona Lisa. ,
