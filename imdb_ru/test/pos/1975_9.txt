It was a great film, I would compare it with the film "The Game." You get to the end of the click and you can't move ... your brain was removed and shocked (not agitated) and placed again in your head. Don't plan anything after this movie, you need time to think about what just happened. <br /> <br /> Do not come to this film, expecting that in the Matrix-style millions are spent on special effects, and the special effects of this film come from the actors, they involve you, no, they suck you and do not let go throughout the film. Great game, great story ... very nice movie, I can't say enough. It is also a very original story, a lot of turns and ideas that I would never have thought of. The end is unexpected and makes you wonder, was it real? Is this really the end? A good ending, not to mention the fact that it is bad ... just makes you think and a little exhausted. <br /> <br /> A great movie for those who love action, for example, a good storyline (do not get up on a break in the bathroom in this movie you will return lost) and you like intellectual games, because in a nutshell, what it is .
