Isabel Huppert portrays a talented female piano teacher who is polite, unfriendly and distant in public and bitter towards her students. In private, she is seething with violence and frustration, and her sex life is lonely and perverted. She lives with her domineering mother, who obsessively makes her become a visible (and thus advancing in life) talented pianist. The key to the character of the mother and daughter is “obsession.” These characters can not change their impulses more than a rabbit caught in the headlights can avoid death. <br /> <br /> The piano teacher meets a young, attractive, talented pianist who is attracted to her from the very beginning. They start the relationship in the most unconventional way, but from the very beginning she makes the perverted and cruel expressions that he has to do with her, which is painful enough for him to want to break off the relationship before they really begin. > The film binds itself to the female leader. Isabel Huppert impresses with a brutal, completely convincing performance of the role of a piano teacher. She deftly shows a woman who is drawn to beauty and perversion, but her violence is fueled by her perverse impulses. As a movie with such a character, you know that it would not have worked half if it acted badly. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful, intelligent actor, intelligently and sensitively adapted from the novel. The camera job is also suitable for the film. There is something that I can only call: shots where the director holds the stage and makes the eye catch the eye. This is done extremely effectively against the empty wall of the bathroom, and is another testament to the director's skill. <br /> <br /> Expect this movie to be disturbed and disgusting. But be brave - have the courage to go and see. This is a very private look at the life of one person, but one should not expect him to be entertained in the Hollywood sense ... there are no car chases in this film!
