Melodies are the best aspect of this television film, in which, admittedly, better than average production figures, but very superficial and slightly modified biography. Dramatizes the discovery by Richard of "We Only Only Begun" and the problems of Karen's marriage (montage "Superstar" was a pleasant touch), but, nevertheless, does not take into account disagreements with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of guitar solos Tony Peluso, and so on. D. Gibb is sweet in her Karen's personality, but she does not include the mean and bold side of the personality of the real Carpenter. Anderson is in great shape, like the creative and exciting Richard, and Fletcher makes her noticeable as a loving but overbearing Agnes. The most memorable moment in the original broadcast is the use of “Goodbye to love” on the background of advertising showing the anorexia hotline.
