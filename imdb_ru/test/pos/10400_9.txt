Like many horror fans who were looking for the next great horror movie, we sacked the Asian horror market for what we could get without leaving a single dark-haired, ghostly lady. We had good reasons for this: terrible wonders appeared on the Asian market, like Ringu, Dark Waters, Juon-Spite and Tale of Two Sisters. By the time Takashi Miike started picking up the mi from the One Missed Call genre in 2003, the market seemed to have dried up, leaving it open to ridicule and ridicule, despite the fact that Hollywood Remake Machine was working to its fullest. Now, don't get me wrong, there were still a lot of good Asian horrors like Marebito and Shutter, to mention only two, someday become the classics of a small genre. But the long-haired ghostly lady definitely ate at a party, and it was time to take this drunk tramp home! Then the film “Norah” - “The Curse”. A film that is smart enough to pay homage to its roots, but throws the rule book out the window. What I am going to describe from the point of view of the plot will probably make you think that there is nothing new here. The film is a documentary about one of the main paranormal investigators in Japan, who receives stories and talks about ghostly events. He begins to investigate the woman’s allegations that she regularly hears a child crying in the next house, but there is no child there, other than a middle-aged woman and her son. The two disappear abruptly when a reporter pokes his nose, but strange other coincidences begin to appear. A psychic young girl, a mentally ill clairvoyant, rather young actress who had a strange vision, many dead pigeons and a very ominous demon named Kagutaba, which led to a truly horrific confrontation in a small historical city ... <br /> <br /> Saying something else about the plot can spoil the fun a bit. The film is shot in an “artificially documentary” style and includes footage from television shows and news reports, and labels through subtitles let you know where you are in terms of the timeline. The film attracted more than a few comparisons to the Blair Witch Project, but apart from the shooting format and the eerie journey through the forest late at night, the comparison really ends there. <br /> <br /> Nora is something that does not condone the modern horror audience. If you expect hoarse female ghosts to jump out of the attic, look elsewhere. The strength of the film lies in its slow, gradual increase of terror, terror, so deep that it will stay with you for several days after watching. The climax is pretty damn bizarre, but when you think the movie is over, you get a “real” end when the captions start to roll, and damn, it's just a killer. In terms of acting, this is basically convincing. You get some comedic relief from crazy clairvoyance covered in tin foil, but it soon dries out halfway through the movie. The film also has a slightly “nasty” feeling than many Asian ghostly horrors, as some events also have a cruel band. <br /> <br /> In general, Nora is one of those whom you can see on your own, late at night. Since I saw The Ring for the first time ten years ago, I have watched a horror movie so delightfully. This is the one that will itch until it is too late, then it will be under your skin. Just let yourself go completely to this. And not a long-haired ghostly lady in sight ?? Not surprisingly, it was released outside of Japan, not to mention building an American remake. Check it out, if you can, be sure to look through my books!
