This topic is commonplace even in 1942. This is war propaganda. The fascists are among us, and they are doing everything possible to sabotage military efforts and prepare their victory, the seizure of power and the creation of an effective totalitarian state. But Hitchcock should make it a real thriller. Thus, he invents the first sabotage that succeeds, but one of the victims, the friend of the one who dies in it, becomes the main suspect and ran for sabotage. This allows him, so to speak, to visit the country and discover the cunning organization of local Nazis, who have acquaintances and support in a highly benevolent society and who use little disgruntled whites to do the dirty work. The pursuit of a real saboteur leads our young and false suspect from Los Angeles to New York and to the top of the organization. He meets a blind pianist who believes that his senses know that the boy is not guilty, his niece, who is the star of a billboard, but also a violent and fanatical patriot who only thinks about going to the police. Then the rich rancher and his nest. Then, along the way, some kind of responsive and friendly truck driver, a long caravan of the circus and their dwarf, a bearded woman, Siamese sisters and several other grotesques of this type. And he discovers a target in Soda City, the electric dam that provides Los Angeles and its military industry with the energy they need. He takes part in organizing sabotage on the Alaskan warship as he descends. And finally, with some ingenuity, creativity, and elbow grease, he and the pianist’s niece manage to clean out the whole game, most of them are arrested, and the first saboteur, a certain Fry, falls from the torch of the Statue of Liberty. He will not fry in the old electric stool ignition. But Hitchcock is still not used to having a personal cameo in his films, so don’t look for it. It is well built and well executed, but it is just a propaganda film with an extra style. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques CULARDO, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne and University Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines
