The series “Decline” is amazing, and the PS director cannot get enough credits to make these films. I'm a little surprised to see that not many people have seen this or two others, but they are worth digging if you want to get an idea of ​​punk in the transformative years between the end of the seventies and the beginning of the eighties. The film begins with a stunning collection of clips played on the music of group X. Many interviews with bands and punkers give an enlightening perspective on how survival was at the bottom of a popular rock ladder. In this genre, there is no collision with the Internet, trashy work and all hostility. For new children who have not heard about these groups or are just starting themselves, this film is a real lesson in rock music. All the performances of the group (and there are many of them) are simply amazing, especially FEAR, who never cease to amaze me. This and the second installment are amazing time capsules that offer those who lack the perspective on the lives of these crazy people. It's a real punk, like in an interview with a girlfriend Darby Crash, when they remember an artist who mysteriously / suddenly died outside their home, and it took them a week or so to figure it out, they take pictures next to the guy and everyone, including EMT, laughed on this, and in true form, the interviewer asks a friend if she is sad or upset that this guy died when he painted their house, in response, "No, I hate painters." How about Black Flag renting out their apartments / rehearsal rooms for $ 16 a month! At that moment, my jaw almost fell off, because I rented a ten-by-ten cabinet to practice 400. Between watching it and Deadwood, I feel that I was not born at that time, I just miss those old days and nights of cowboy. People and bands associated with the film paved the way for heavy music today, and they did it in their own unique way. A brilliant movie, ten stars, and see part 2, and equally amazing, part 3, although I do not know what to say.
