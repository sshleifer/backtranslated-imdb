In print, this is one of the greatest short stories ever written, brilliantly and poetically displayed on the screen by this team of father-son, working together, unfortunately, for the first and last time. It is fitting that John Houston should end his career on a high note, displaying the work of one of his favorite authors on the screen, which is undoubtedly the best adaptation of Joyce's screen. Houston made a career in adapting great literary works to the film, as a rule, quite successfully. It is sad and somewhat mysterious that Tony Houston began and ended his film career, adapting what would be his father's last project, and received a well-deserved Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Once I was lucky enough to sit in the company of the great scriptwriter / playwright Horton Foote, who in recent years called this film one of his favorites (at that time it was still a very recent release). Being a rather prolific screenwriter (and a brilliant screen adapter of his own work, as well as great authors like Faulkner, Steinbeck and Harper Lee), he was clearly impressed with Tony Houston's first efforts and, perhaps, equally puzzled by the lack of a holiday since. If someone has ideas to share this topic, I would be interested to learn more.
