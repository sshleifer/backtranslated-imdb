George Hearn really did his best, which in this case was great. I heard the version of Len Kariu, but she was too tamed. George was great in this character - very expressive. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury was perfect for this role. She gave a great presentation. She gave Mrs. Lovett an excellent insidious and ridiculous personality, balancing a grim story. <br /> <br /> I like dark humor when Angela Lansbury sings her songs, as well as her physical expression and Georgeâ€™s evil emotions. Listen to his songs of rage, revenge and suffering. <br /> <br /> I have watched this play 20 times since 1985, when I saw it on PBS. I bought it on video (after I copied it in 1985) when it came out in 1990, and I definitely bought a copy of the DVD when it came out in 2004.
