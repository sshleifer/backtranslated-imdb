Peer Babette, for me, about healing: correcting the split between mind and body in Orthodox Christianity. In this Puritan community in remote Denmark there is no adequate assessment of all God's gifts in creation. They brought the dualism of the apostle Paul to the extreme and emphasize the life of the "spirit" and not the life of the "flesh." Both young sisters in their youth were frightened by the lure of love and the temptations of life outside their simple village. They and their parishioners cling to the narrow biblical interpretation of their former leader and father of sisters. An aging gathering has become irritable and hostile, and the sisters do not know what to do. Enter Babette, a French stranger, and someone to whom they can show kindness. They have no way of knowing that she will eventually return their kindness and give fertile soil to their dry, dusty theology. Babette will give everything she has, and in the process will teach the sisters and their flock about grace, sacrifice, how sensual experience (like in bread and wine of the Eucharist) can change life, and why real art moves so deep. When they can forgive each other and themselves, they can focus on God's love that unfolds before them in a concrete way in the present. As a minister and artist, I cannot recommend a film more highly. True art and true grace !!
