Werner Herzog again explores the human psyche. In “Little Dieter ...” we meet an effervescent, brilliant man who survived the war in Bavaria, saw famine and strange sights, moved to the USA and fulfilled his dream of being a pilot. War, food, death, survival, supplies, airplanes, coming off heads ... how an American was born. The duke again considers insanity as a plane of existence, and Herzog himself tells a surrealistic mix with an acute problem, telling about this mental journey of a German who became an American, who flies on support planes in the war of the late 20th century, where the culmination of technology, pilgrimage and food garbage Banks with spoons with constant optimism turn into a person rethought into an American. As always with Herzog, we are faced with vivid madness, brilliance and what is a man in front of his own excesses, social and personal. We laugh and shrink and wonder at this person. Where else for this person besides America?
