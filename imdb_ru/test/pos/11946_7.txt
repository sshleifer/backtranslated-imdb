I adore this film as much as any other who loves to watch what they saw in their youth. it was one of those films that the Home Box Office showed every other day throughout my youth. this movie is stuck in my brain forever. For someone who hasn’t grown up around this film, you may have gone bad because of the ADD cycle that we have been in since the mid-90s, and it may be harder for you to appreciate this gem. It's cool because my sister was obsessed with the idea of ​​“better dead” before I saw it (which I raped and loved) - and no one, no one can deny the embrace of awkward teenage humor in American cinema in the 80s - it gave birth to everything we found tedious in teen comedies .. because with all the excessive use of slow motion, the current soundtrack, the new technology. I wonder if the cinema will return to these roots ... THIS IS A COMMISSION FOR YOUTH ... YES!
