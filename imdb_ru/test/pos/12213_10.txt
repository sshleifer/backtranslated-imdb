I really like the Surface show. The show is very interesting and clean. Show how the surface is interesting. It keeps my attention. He has compassion and anxiety. I love all the actors who are on the show. They are all very good choices. I think it is very important to have the right line up of any show, because this is what makes any show successful, and, of course, the scene and the show itself. Television has changed a lot over the years. He changed in a good and in a bad way. I love to watch comedies, action films, suspense and romance. And fantastic. But Surface is a show that I hope will return for many seasons, because this is a great show, and this is something that families can watch. My children have grown up, but my husband and I love to watch these shows. I appreciate your time and let me comment on your opinion. <br /> <br /> Thank you. <br /> <br /> Paulette Blackwell
