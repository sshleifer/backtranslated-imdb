This is a life-changing film; it is not an epic or something like that. But it is interesting and fun. This is a film that the whole family can watch together, and at the moment there are several precious films suitable for children, in which there is no love story! He tells a good story lightly, not trying to impress the public with super-capable special effects, as many films do today. It's pretty good to play in it, and all the music that was used fits very well with the content of the film. The acting game is also pretty good, the actors look comfortable and believable in their setting, and most importantly, the jokes are actually funny. I would recommend it for people of all ages - it certainly made me laugh. :)
