This film - a real fighter in all its glory. He does not get better than this. This is one of those films that you can just throw back and watch really good non-stop shooting and murder, plus there are some great stories for all of this. My favorite, there is one bad guy who breaks into this old family house, he steals a TV or something else, and he comes up to them and shouts: “I will come here when I want !!!” and right before jump out of the window, he shouts "At any time !!!" I mean, it's just a classic, so you have a choice, you can watch this stupid Will Smith try to act in an action movie, or you can watch one of the Masters of Charles Bronson !!!!
