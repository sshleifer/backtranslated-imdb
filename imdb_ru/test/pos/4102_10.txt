I saw this film a few years ago and immediately bought the soundtrack, because it was just superb. Baharahaâ€™s music is enchanting and should receive the recognition it deserves. The cinematography is awesome. Critics hated it, but they hated and MAIN ONE. I did not find it on video, but I welcome everyone who can find a copy.
