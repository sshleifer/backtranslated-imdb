The subgenre of the “old dark house” that dominated early conversations rarely does not disappoint when we revise old works today. Here is one that provides so many suspicious characters that you have to wonder how they can tie all the loose ends during the time of the 6 reels. <br /> <br /> “Curve Circle” is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who decided to take revenge on Colonel Walters (Burton Churchill), who sent one of his ranks to prison. They decided that he should die that night. Meanwhile, the colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to defend him at all costs. It doesn’t fit well with Thelma's bride (Irene Purcell) of club member Brenda Osborne (Ben Lyon, late from the mega-budget HELL'S ANGELS (1930)), who wants him to leave the club and stop endangering his life. The brand promises to resign after saving the life of the colonel. All head to the newly acquired Walters mansion on Long Island to wait for the killer. <br /> <br /> The colonel may be the new owner of the Melody manor, but this is an old dark house with eccentric neighbors (such as Raymond Hutton is a local hermit) and maybe even a ghost. Zasu Pitts with the highest score is Nora, the housekeeper who expects to see the spirit around every corner. Throw a cop (James Gleason), who is confident that Brand is a criminal, and we have a picture that is full of actions and surprises. <br /> <br /> You will immediately notice that the scriptwriter was at a loss to come up with too many dialogues, because many characters repeat the same lines over and over again. Yoganda (K. Henry Gordon), a Hindu mystic (who was loaded with films of the time), says: "Evil is on the way." many times, and I lost count of how often Miss Pitts says: "Something always happens to someone!" There are many suspects and two characters (Mr. Gleason in the role of the stereotypical blunt police officer and Roscoe Karns as the friend of Mr. Lyon) who serve as a comedic relief. The house itself looks rather creepy (in fact, I think the same set was used in the Phantom (1931)) with a lot of secret passages and violin music coming out of empty rooms, but for some reason you will never feel the danger. Maybe this is because there is no one in the film, and I mean no one! This is completely what they seem. It all comes out right at the end, though; but go into details - it would spoil you. <br /> <br /> Carefully ensure that Robert Fraser (from WHITE ZOMBIE) and Frank Reicher (best remembered as Captain Engelhorn from KING KONG) appear among the suspects. <br /> <br /> ROUND CIRCLE - funny movie. Some aspects of the plot are predictable, and some others are not. I suspect you will like it.
