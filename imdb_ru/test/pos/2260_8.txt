Not having read the book, I was more open to the fresh interpretation that each director gives to his medium (namely, the film, and not the literary reproduction) of this particular film. I was happy that the Holocaust that occurred in Russia (and in neighboring countries) finally got some attention. The Nazis were especially cruel to Russian and Russian Jews. If you read the stories and see the monuments built in Smolensk and surrounding regions, you will understand this film and why many people were silent when they should have spoken. <br /> <br /> It's time to tackle this issue. and I hope that this will make more stories. It's time.
