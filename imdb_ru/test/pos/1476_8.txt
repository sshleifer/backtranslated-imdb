Sam Elliot is great as a tough San Francisco detective Charlie Fallon. When his partner is killed during a meeting with an informant, Fallon snaps, beats the informant to death and dumps his body into the river. The next day, Fallon is appointed as a rookie partner and is assigned to investigate the killing of informants. Sam Elliot does a good job portraying a man who was tortured for his own murderous acts, and woe to the death of his partner, who may have been involved in police corruption.
