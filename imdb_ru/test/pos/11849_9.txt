I happened to be in the den this morning during a scene where Ed was busy in 3-Way and thought my wife was catching up on some early morning porn! To my great surprise, it caught my attention, and I rewound it, and we started watching it at 4:30 in the morning! What a very entertaining, rich, fun and well-developed storyline and script. Both of us really enjoyed it, my wife so much that she shared the experience with her friends at work! Continuing to recommend it and say what kind of "blow" she received from it. I'm over forty, and she's over fifty. I think this film will attract both young and old. An unexpected, very pleasant surprise. Well done! Thank! Two thumbs up!
