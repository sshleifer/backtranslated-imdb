It is a pity that this film has a PG 13 rating - it is really suitable for everyone - although young children may not follow them very well. <br /> <br /> He belongs to this wonderful genre of serial-comic ghost / angelic stories that should have included everything from Capra “This is a wonderful life” to “Wings of desire” by Wenders. <br /> <br /> A stunning picture, first-class acting and - a miracle of miracles - the tone lifts the mood. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that in the movie. At first, the two intertwined stories seem intriguingly mysterious; but they decide themselves too cute for my taste. As the director notes in his commentary on the DVD, all the components of Irvine’s story are on his bedside table. Symbolism for me is just a trifle. <br /> <br /> But what a skylark! My favorite scene should be when the relocation team tries to have breakfast at the diner. It is almost theatrical in its magic - the power of a witty game is subtle, playful and positively rhythmic - combined with vivid cinematography and a sharp look at the grotesque. <br /> <br /> “Northfork” is funny, touching, magnificent in appearance, magical (with the above reservations) and not having a single car chase. <br /> <br /> Light nine stars.
