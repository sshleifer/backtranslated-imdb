Even with only $ 6,000 and part-time actors, Christopher Nolan was a master. Nolan, in my opinion, is the next great one, and our first taste for Nolan does not contradict this. <br /> <br /> None of the problems that constantly interfere with and discredit the independent picture with a low budget does not haunt Nolan and his team. Our actors are inexperienced and young, but they deliver and involve us in this story. Honestly, I think “Follow” is Nolan’s best scenario because he controls him the most. This is a wonderful movie. This takes us to a world where we don’t feel limited by budget constraints. Dialogue and atmosphere are bold and intelligent. <br /> <br /> The Nolan trademark telling the story continuously is applied here for the first time, and here it is done in such a way that you tell the story completely to you. With Memento and The Prestige, you need to think a little bit to truly understand the genius, but Nolan is not trying to confuse people with his film prototype. We can distinguish time by the appearance of our protagonist. This story-telling method is both creative and engaging. I am glad that Nolan had such great success, because his films became more than they could be with this method. Payments in Prestige and Memento would not be exciting if the film were shown in the usual format. This idea was implemented with moderate success before, but Nolan really made it his own. <br /> <br /> The script here is the best of Nolan. I had some doubts about his writing abilities, in all respects I imagined that his brother Jonathon was a writing talent, but he proves that I am wrong with Following. This is a thought-provoking story that makes interesting observations of people and their functioning. Cobb's assessment of burglary and how this might lead you to understand what actually makes people tick sounds true. <br /> <br /> My only real complaint is that camera work sometimes becomes shaky, but it doesn’t take anything from History or acting. <br /> <br /> Below is the first film about a man who personifies the film industry of the 21st century in all its glory.
