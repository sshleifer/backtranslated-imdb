I, frankly, have to say that "The Cat in the Brain" is one of the most fun and unintentionally fun films I've ever seen. This film is filled with a silly dialogue, ridiculous scenes and plot, in which the legendary horror director Lucio Fulci himself takes part. <br /> <br /> A worn storyline about an aging director (Fulci, who is also named Lucio Fulci in the film ...), who begins to go crazy and hallucinate because of all the perverse things he shot in the movie for last many years. He goes to a psychotherapist who hypnotizes Fulci, and tells him that he will consider himself a murderer, but that the psychiatrist will indeed be a murderer. The rest of the film consists of frames from the “film” that Fulci directs during all this action, scenes in which psychiatric murders are smiling all the time like a jerk and some of the episodes of Fulci's hallucinations. Yes, and a few boobs added for good measure ... <br /> <br /> The cat in the brain is completely overdone and ridiculous in every sense. The classic Fulci Mountain is nasty and strong with some really decent scenes. The chainsaw section of the female corpse is pretty cool, like the chainsaw decapitation of a little boy. A lot of piercing, blistering and other cool scenes of murder make it a rather nonstop bloodshed. Easy dialogue (LICK IT !!!! LICK IT !!!), as well as some of the insanely dull scenes (the Nazi orgy, the opera singing the slap in the face and the flight of an innocent hippie come to mind easily). ..) make it fun like hell. Not as dark as in some other Fulci films - CAT is rather a condescending nightmare / comedy, which, if you don’t laugh at it, is actually sad. I say to take a fifth of the cheap bourbon and be content with it. I watched CAT with a few friends, and we laughed all the time. This is a nice touch movie of summer ... Recommended 8/10
