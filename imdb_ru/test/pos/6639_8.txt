Bergman got this: “What if all these bad things happened here in Sweden, with such good people like us?” And what he gives us, in Swedish, with Swedish actors, in Swedish locations (and using what seems like a genuine Swedish military vehicle) —that was familiar from war films made in almost any other European country — all this confuses the invasion and counter-invasion, political lies, internment camps, fake confessions , summary executions, torture, para. rioters, "employees" and so on. As in the modern short story, this is done abstractly, without real names, cities or countries. But the stronger faction is the “Nazis”: they are assertive, and some wear shiny boots. One even knocks things from riding (well, it really is a cane). The injured couple is called Rosenberg. Besides the shame they experience finding dirtier ways to survive - and who would not do what they did? - that all of the above suggests that the name is clearly intended to indicate the actual complicity of Stockholm with the Nazis. Indeed, what we are shown is what Sweden might look like if Germany had asked for a little more than concessions in mining. <br /> <br /> The first half plays like a black comedy. We see the “fog of war” from the point of view of a comically passive couple that ignores troops everywhere, long convoys, bombed-out buildings, news reports, etc. They did not even bother to find a working radio. They are final in "Not in my backyard." They talk about wine and lingonberries; in the meantime, friends are mysteriously recruited, and more and more soldiers appear in the city. They show no curiosity about the war that has been fought around them for many years. <br /> <br /> This person (von Sidov) is cultural, sullen and navel; the woman (Ulman) is somewhat more impulsive, passionate, and externally. There is a beautiful scene in which a man talks about his violin: the producer, he says unceremoniously, participated in the Napoleonic wars, but his own interest is limited to the cultural artifact in his hand - or, more precisely, by his own warm feelings. about owning it, and the security that this ownership right implies. Not in my backyard! But when war finally develops into their bucolic idyll, human timidity, irritation in good times, turns into responsibility, which he eventually compensates - as is often the case - as Bergman subtly and beautifully demonstrates. Definitely worth a look.
