Alistair Simms is a miracle in this. He makes such a good director. The role given here for George Cole was made for him. Consequently, the work on the film was perfect. I think it was one of those rare occasions when everything clicked. the storyline was good, the comic dialogue was a scream, and the senior prefects were enthusiastic !! Every character you love, even the villains. Why can't we make such films anymore? In fact, this is a very English comedy with good movement and mobility.
