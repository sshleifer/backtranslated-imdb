I wanted to love this movie. Everything seemed ready for a pleasant, if not innovative, film. It was installed in the south of France, the actors played beautiful and recognizable actors, and I really admired the bright African costumes, proverbs and music. Despite all this, I did not like it. Movies should convey their meaning when first viewed, but “Secret Laughter” does not. Neem and Matthew performed by Long and Fert (both of them played a romantic role before and should have known better) radiate as much warmth and passion as dried fish. I deliberately used “dried fish” because it was one of the few - too few - strong lines and moments scattered throughout the film. Another winner was when Nimi catches Matthew hanging about her apartment. He finds her book with a name written on it and says: “Your name is Nimi. I never knew. He then insists that she call him a Christian. I carefully watched this scene when Matthew again and again asked Them to “pronounce my name”, realizing that until that moment they had always called each other by their last names. I thought this was a turning point for the film, and I expected it to be better. This is not true. Why do Them and Matthew always appear to be ten paces away, even in this scene, “say my name”? What does Matthew like about Them, except for her obvious beauty? And why did such a sensible woman like Nimi fall in love with a comic book author who considers her marriage to be something that he can suspend when a beautiful exotic “adventure” comes? And I would like to add that it was a bit difficult for me to defend a novel based on adultery. Yes, Jenny is a wicked harpy, but if I were in her place, but I would probably have been in line with her tactics of cruelty to keep her husband from going astray. Believe it. History hints at Nimi’s painful past, but never fully explores it. Some critics say that Firth seemed a little awkward here, and I agree. For God's sake, the actor caused a more tangible desire and passion, like this snob at the beginning of the 19th century, Mr. Darcy (and while he wore these disgusting pants)! As for Long, who glistened in Love Jones, there were times when she seemed to focus more on her accent than on her character’s play. Despite this, there were many moments ?? the scene "say my name" among them ?? when she was in complete control and very good. However, “Secret Laughter” is not without its redemptive qualities, and I found that he grew up on me with a lot of views. Nene was well portrayed as supportive and benevolent, even if she doesn’t fully understand Them’s attraction to Matthew. I really liked it when Nene ran into Mom Fola in these duel scenes with proverbs. My husband liked it, and usually he sighs first and throws insults on the screen if he does not like what is happening. He even laughed at the scene when Sammy asked Matthew very frank questions about sex. So you have it. “Secret Laughter” was good enough to entertain an avowed jerk such as my hubby, but an avid moviegoer, like me, will need more than one viewing to appreciate what the director and screenwriter tried to convey.
