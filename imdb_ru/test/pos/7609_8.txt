I first saw this film many years ago, when it was still new, and I was pleased. This is a great Hollywood mock story for teens. However, this is not like life. No matter how you want to believe in it, such stories never happen. That's why watching such movies is annoying. They play with the minds of teenagers, just imagine how many girls in high school still believed in this magic and were disappointed. I would not recommend this film to my younger sister or cousin. The director had to spend more time thinking about the plot, and not on the actors. Yes, they (the actors) were good, but the idea is not worth 10. There are many films about teenagers. So why don't we do the best?
