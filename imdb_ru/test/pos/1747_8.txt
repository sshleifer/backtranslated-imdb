There was a time when not all the animation was Disney or pixel. So nice to see this wonderful movie again, and I really found a good, reasonable copy on DVD. Be careful, as this is not public knowledge, and there are some really bad copies. I received a very good copy from a company called Flashbacks, and it is pretty good. In the old days, I watched it on black and white on TV and its magic to see it in color. Much better than some would make you believe. The songs are amazing and the color is great. Interestingly, the characters are really well developed, which is strange in animated films. I loved Hoppiti, and the villain Mr. Beatle is a real goat. This is incredibly figurative. How inanimate objects, such as cotton reels, old jars, become part of the environment and have new features, fine. The anthropomorphic use of insects is surprising, given that many perverted creatures, unfortunately, most people find disgusting. I hope we never step on the insect again! The enemy of insects is man. In fact, these are insects that will survive. No matter how hard we try to get rid of ants, here in Australia, they keep coming back. The battle is lost, and we must live with them. There are several scenes that stand out, for example, when Hoppiti and Mr. Bumble get into the watering can, the great flood and the journey to the top of the building are all fine. It is also quite anthropomorphic, but in a sense charming. Human characters are very similar to Gulliverâ€™s characters, and this is incredibly effective. Wedding scene looks beautiful. This is a crime, this film was not proclaimed a classic. The only annoying remark for me is the cases in the film when the characters slip into verses. The talking verse spoils the narration, and this was not necessary, Verse is terrible and spoils another wise good script. This is great and the kids will love it. It's nice to look at. There is also a very smart ending.
