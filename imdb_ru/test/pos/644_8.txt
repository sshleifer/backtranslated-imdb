I just finished this movie, and my only comment is â€œOh! WOW! Jennifer Beals is fine as a bride, but Yancy Butler as a teacher of female dance is pure sex dynamite! After seeing her in WITCHBLADE, I was not ready for pure, flawless sensuality and gross sexual arousal, which she launches to the screen. <br /> <br /> I have to see THIS movie again ... at least for Yancy Butler as Corrin!
