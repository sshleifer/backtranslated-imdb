Judith Ivy, like an old crook, amazing. Emily Grace is a young girl. She is innocent and interesting when she finds out what is happening. Great direction and camera. The story is dark and disturbing. The supporting cast is good. Shows what is happening and can happen with failure. Great independent movie. Small cast. First, the pace is slow, and then moves well. A good movie to show your teenage daughter, who wants to leave home early, on the open road and on adventures. This film, the film, has a sense of limited budget, but it works because of the low life expectancy and the areas in which these people move. I will never stop staying on vacation, not thinking about this film and checking my tires before I leave.
