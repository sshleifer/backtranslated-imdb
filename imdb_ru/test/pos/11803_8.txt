“The Cure” is a very touching and sharp drama. The film tells about two neighbors guys who became good friends. One of the boys has AIDS. Boys become good friends, despite Eric's panic. The film shows the boys' journey to discover the “medicine” that, according to the National Expert, is in Ohio, and how it affects their relationship. The acting is great (I have never seen Annabella Sciorra doing better), and the film is just touching. I could not stop crying with the shoes of the scene. This is a good tear. Keep Klinex nearby. 8/10
