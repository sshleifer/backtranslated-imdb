From time to time, the mainstream media seems to be driven by a bunch of brainless reporters. In that they simply listen to each other and report what others are saying. <br /> <br /> This documentary shows what can be found if you put even more effort into reporting something. <br /> <br /> Genuine journalism should consist in providing people with different views on what is happening so that they have a real opportunity to form their own opinion. <br /> <br /> This documentary, along with messages from major media, will help you with this. At least for me, this gave a lot of relevant information regarding the goal / motivation of today's frequent protests around the world at various political summits.
