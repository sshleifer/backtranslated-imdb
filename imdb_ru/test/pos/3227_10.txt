Gilmore Girls is my favorite TV show of all time. They only broadcast the first 2 seasons in India, but I watched the rest on DVD or read them online. It is very pleasant to find a show in which the main character does not sneak around the back of his mother, but has an open relationship with her. The chemistry between Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, who play Lorelai and her daughter Rory, is truly gorgeous. all actions are superb, and the characters, though very bizarre, are still believable. The inhabitants of the star voids show all the funny quirkiness of the life of a small town, which contrasts with the endless snobbery and social norms that make up life in the society of Lorelaiâ€™s parents. On the one hand, there are dance festivals and festivals in the light of fires, and on the other hand - cocktails, DAR meetings and cocktail parties. all characters develop, and for more or less all there is a happy ending. There are dramatic elements, but also a lot of witty humor. Rory's guys are all incredibly hot, like her friend Lane. in fact, this is a cool, funny, very pleasant show that covers all aspects of life and gives you a feeling - if you work hard enough and wait patiently, you will get what you want, even if it was not what you wanted.
