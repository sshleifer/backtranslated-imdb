This outstanding film tells about the best acting skills you have ever seen, and that alone makes it a must-see. The whole cast is superb, but again, it had to be to keep up with Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep. It didn't take me long to get hooked on this film, and besides the scene in the courtroom, which is simply good, this is first-class entertainment. This is a rare film that actually deserves all the recognition of Oscar that he received. Convince yourself and you will not be disappointed.
