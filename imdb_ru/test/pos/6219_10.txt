This charming film is based on the novel by Arto Paasilinna. Bestseller is one of the best books I've read. Here is the story: <br /> <br /> Once a journalist and photographer Kaarlo Vatanen decides to leave his past and begins a new life, wandering through the Finnish forests and countryside. With him he has a companion, a young hare, knocked down by a machine. Vatanen should take care of the hare, because his leg is injured, so they go on a journey together, caring for each other. <br /> <br /> In the course of their adventures, they were nearly shot by hunters, caught by the police to meet many people, and finally reach Lapland, where they live peacefully, until a group of foreign tourists violates their privacy. The hare gets sick and they have to go back to Helsinki to see the vet. <br /> <br /> Vatanen found the perfect way to live, but modern society is trying to get him back to his duties and taxes. In Helsinki, Vatanen drank, even got engaged, and imprisoned, but in the end he and the hare fled.
