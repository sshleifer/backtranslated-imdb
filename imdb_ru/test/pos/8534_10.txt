(Warning spoilers) I can not say enough good words about this movie. This is a great horror comedy / parody that does everything right for a change. Humor is great and ranges from ridiculous to such funny - you will cry funny. In one scene, Ed is crazy about editing and deletes the big scene. When his boss looks at Ed's editing, he shouts: “Where in fu% # # is my beaver rape scene?!?!” Hysterical. There are also many other wonderful, humorous and memorable quotes and moments: Ed shouts: "Do not look at me !!!" while the poor schmuck in the face hit several times. Very funny stuff. The plot of the film itself is so ridiculous that it is invaluable: Ed is a man with casual mannerism, who is transferred to the horror film editing department, and after a while he goes crazy, sees monsters and attacks people, quoting horror films that he edited. This film has it all, and it's just fun. A DVD costs only about $ 7, and this is a great deal, as it is a nameless widescreen cut. I have a lot of DVDs, most of which cost a lot more money than this, but not as much as this movie. My Evil Ed DVD is one of the highlights in my collection, and I would beat someone with a handset if he tried to steal it. Evil Ed exudes style and quality - something that Hollywood filmmakers should basically learn. Evil Ed is a rare gem, and I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the creation of this wonderful film - you did everything right, and I love Evil Ed! 10 out of 10!!!
