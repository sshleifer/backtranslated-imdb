Mary Haynes (Meg Ryan), a rich woman discovers that her husband is cheating on her with a younger woman (Eva Mendes). She does not know what to do, and her friends Silvia Fowler (Annette Bening), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing) and Alex Fisher (Judd Pinkett Smith) are trying to help. <br /> <br /> OK - there was no reason to remake the 1939 film. This is a real classic, and it does not need to be updated and redone. Naturally, this was done. It received some of the worst reviews I have ever seen for the movie. I love the original and have seen it many times - I constantly compared it with that. Now this is not a classic, but it is not so bad. <br /> <br /> ** A LITTLE SPOILERS !!! ** First bad - the story is old and has been (poorly) updated. Indeed - a man cheating on his wife is hardly shocking today. Meg Ryan (wonderful actress) is pretty awful here. It seems her face can not change the facial expression! I could not believe how badly some of her scenes passed. Eva Mendez is also bad - but this is not really her fault. Her role is poorly written, and she must compete with Joan Crawford from the original. Smith character (cool lesbian) is falling apart in the operating room. It's funny ... but it shows that a strong woman instantly falls apart when faced with an emergency. The script also inserts a few clumsy passages in which Ryan tells his daughter about being himself. In those moments, he was more like a film about life than anything else. <br /> <br /> Now is good - this film saves the decision of the originals so that NEVER show a person on the screen. This film is about and for women - men are not needed (by the way - I am a man). Bening is just as great as Fowler - whenever it appears on the screen, the film makes a big leap. Smith is also simply wonderful - she is not too exaggerating (or underestimating) her lesbian character. Messing is also good, but she is not in it. Bette Midler is just hysterical in a small role, and Cloris Lichman plays the role of a housewife who does nothing. The direction is also good - especially during the fashion show. I heard that director Diana English had a lot of problems with directing her first feature film, but he didnâ€™t appear in the final product. There are also some clever references to the original (mostly certain lines) that were inserted without fuss. <br /> <br /> I saw it in an audience full of women (there were a few guys, but not many), and they loved it. The film ends in an operating sequence in which everyone howls. So - it was not necessary, but people say that this is not a disaster. In addition, people say that we do not need a film with all women. Why not? I see a lot of movies with all the guys in the cast, and no one complains about it! Ignore complaints and bad reviews and look at it. With Ryan's best performance, I could give him 8 or 9, but, anyway, I can only give him 7.
