Despite its age, this film retains its undoubted charm and appeal and is an excellent, preserved example of early British cinema. It has a fundamental atmosphere of eeriness interspersed with inclusions of humor that are not inappropriate and serve to demonstrate guaranteed direction and production values ​​involved.

In general, this long-forgotten little pearl deserves attention, despite one sharp note in the film, which, surprisingly, escaped the attention of the censor!
