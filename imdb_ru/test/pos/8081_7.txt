I like the phrase “British post-war paranoia in the post-war period,” which was used by one of the reviewers. He describes so well films in which John Mills excelled (“The Man of October” (1947), “Long Memory” (1952)) between the “big” pictures (“Scott of the Antarctic” (1948) and “War”). and the world "(1956)). <br /> <br /> In this plot of the" Eric Ambler "style, John Mills played Dr. Howard Latimer, who promised his friend Charles (invisible) to meet with the German actress on a visit, Fried Weldon (Lisa Daniel) at the airport. The creepy “reporter” Jeffrey Windsor (Lionel Jeffries) is at this time in his offices and offers to give him a lift, but while he is tracking down the actress, Windsor tells him that she is already in the car and is waiting !!! something suspicious is happening !!!). Howard was taken on a date and no longer thinks about it. <br /> <br /> On the next the night he finds her body when he returns home from work, and even more he finds that his friend Charles could not call him he was still in New York, and Windsor does not seem to exist. Earlier, about the patient Mrs. Ambler (Renée Ray ), which Dr. George Kimber (Mervyn Jones) conveyed to him, talks about his constant dream of searching for a dead body and a copper candlestick with a square base. interviews her, she denies all knowledge of the conversation - at from the candlestick later found in Howard Daimler's boot. <br /> <br /> When Howard lies low, Robert Brady (Wilfred Hyde-White) comes to him. He calls himself a "friend" - he has a picture of Windsor, which he wants to exchange for a box of matches, which Frida gave to Howard at the airport. Howard returns to the apartment, Charles calls, and while Howard is on the phone, an unknown person knocks him down and steals matches !!! Who can he trust - who has nothing to hide !!! <br /> <br /> This is the main thriller - not exactly in the same class as the "October Man", but John Mills does what he does. Best of all - to play ordinary people who have fallen into incredible riddles !!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
