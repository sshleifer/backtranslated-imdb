Blimey! the French really take possession of it. If we look at their first film about Asterix, we will see a good story with good actors (especially thanks to Gerard Depardo), but a very lame special effect. In such a fantastic story as Asterix, Special Effects are really important. Well, this time they did it right! It looks awesome. Personally, I think Mission Cleopatra is the best story about Asterix. There is not a single moment in the film when you are bored. Go and watch it! One thing! they didn't exactly follow the script, which I find a bit pathetic. For example, in the comic Obelix breaks the nose of the Sphinx, immediately all the little storekeepers begin to break the nose of their miniature Sphinx. (really fun to see) .. Well, they didn't put it in a movie, instead they buried their nose under the Sphinx. Asterix: “They will never search for it here” (guess again). It was funny, but not as good as the original. Another thing I didn’t like about the movie was their choice of music. It made the film childish. But nevertheless ... It is obligatory C! <br /> <br /> Grz Da Jean Holland
