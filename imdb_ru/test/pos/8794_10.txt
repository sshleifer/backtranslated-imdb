This movie is too good for words. This is incredibly cool, fun and believable. You just know from watching this that the person who wrote it REALLY felt what Jeep and his friends are doing through the film. At some point it was my life, and I relied on the fact that sometime in the evening I would come home to see “Trafficking in Persons” before I could even think about going to bed. I think you just love the characters and their lifestyle. Of course, this film is not suitable for older people aged 16 to 22 years. There is nothing wrong with this film, and it will be covered in stitches. He has no definite storyline. The general idea is the weekend in the lives of older teens in London and what they do. The places where they go, the people with whom they meet, the drugs they take and the experiences they have. You have to burn this movie to DVD, not to mention watching it, you must have it !!!
