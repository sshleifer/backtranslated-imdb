Feisty Dianna Jackson (the awesomely cool performance of the gorgeous former Playboy Playmate Jeanne Bell) goes to Hong Kong to get a ring with an evil heroin that killed her brother. Dianna, assisted by friendly karate master Joe (friendly Chiquito), faces opposition from an anti-drug agent under the cover of Elaine (cute, busty blonde Pat Anderson) and acts with a bold, ruthlessly ambitious Charlie (the essay with the highest n√©mene Charlie (the essay with the supreme name) ), preparing your revenge. against the vile drug lord Sid (effectively mucous Ken Metcalf). Directed by Sirio H. Santiago, working on a reckless crappy script written by none other than Dick Miller (!), Fills a lively and intense 72-minute running time with a lot of unsubstantiated starvation and a lot of poorly set martial arts scenes. (Bella clearly doubles the squat guy in a giant afro wig!). A certain sloppy raisin happens when topless Bell single-handedly beats up thugs in her hotel room. The raw, grainy, scratched cinematography of Felipe Sakdalan, the awkward use of exhausting slow motion, funk groove, funny battle scores, and the surprisingly terrible conclusion add extremely to the overall awesome fun of this delicious cheese exploitation of the hothouse greenhouse.
