I just came back from viewing this award-winning document, and was very touched and interested in exploring this guy's work, which I had never heard of before. Of course, I am the one who is fascinated by beautiful architecture, so I understand that others will not care. <br /> <br /> We can only imagine if there were a few more visionaries in Philadelphia at the end of the 60s, when Caen had plans what a wonderful downtown would be. If you are wondering if you will see more about the building in Bangladesh at the beginning of the film, have patience, because there it will provide the culmination of the film at the end. <br /> <br /> The son’s personal discoveries in the process of making this film are quite interesting, sometimes touching, and sometimes even funny. There is one of the most comedic anti-video trivia ever filmed. <br /> <br /> The touching moments of this document are completed with a touching musical score with excellent expressive string music. And expressiveness is the main point that can be found in the architecture of Caen. The perspectives of other architects on the spiritual nature of matter and how Kahn’s buildings bring it in unite the overall experience of this film.
