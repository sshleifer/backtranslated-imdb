In this tense and character-driven romantic tragic comedy, we are given an idea of ​​the intertwining lives of four thirty-year-old Parisians. In the center of Vince Cassell is the image of Max. Star Romeo, he falls on his heels for the beautiful stranger Lisa (Bellucci). Encouraged by his best friend Lucien (Ekofffy, in an understated, but effective performance), he conquers her heart, and they live happily ever after ... that is, before the intrigue, neurotic and obsessed Alice (universal Roman Beringer) becomes very involved in life and the love of others three. <br /> <br /> The rich plot is compounded by a curious chronological mess, and the film appears as a tangled puzzle, a tidbit of the postcard of Paris at the heart of all this. The use of color does not go unnoticed, especially in Lisa’s spectacular apartment (presumably considering the name of the film), where the red and yellow colors cause a fire of passion and lust. <br /> <br /> The audience can relate to Max. He really wears his heart on his sleeve and is constantly punished with irony and circumstances for that. In one memorable scene, our fateful lovers (painfully separated by a “choreographic” misunderstanding) hardly miss the chance meeting, which will surely unite them. Regardless of each other, they go to the same place: she is in the subway, he is in a taxi, almost one on one. However, fate seems to decide them, and the audience is charmingly teasing. <br /> <br /> The performances in this film are what distinguish L'Appartement. I still can not understand why Vincent Cassell is not a big star outside of France. He has presence and diversity in abundance. Monica Bellucci (Cascella's real consort at the time of writing) recently found fame in the English film industry, but perhaps for the wrong reasons - though she is divinely beautiful, but behind this is a talented actress who can dominate the scene in the classic style of the leading lady ”, Which many British and American actresses reject in favor of too easy a“ subtle ”approach. <br /> <br /> In general, watch this movie! I doubt you will be disappointed. This is an exciting, satisfying, funny, sad, generous and artistic filmmaking lesson.
