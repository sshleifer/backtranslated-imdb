A film for a mature, educated audience ... <br /> <br /> I saw “Random Hearts” at a preview screen shortly before its release in North America. This romantic drama was a real treat. I am sure that this story will not be a cup of tea for everyone, especially given the dark background of the film. But this picture has several strengths in its favor. <br /> <br /> Box office for all time. Harrison Ford ("Star Wars", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "Fugitive", "Air"). “Force One” (“Patriotic Games”) is at the top of its game, being a weary and desperate interior officer, a Dutchman. Ford’s very muted nuances demonstrate the range he can achieve with class and determination, attracting an audience into a world of loss and betrayal. This is a completely complex role and a completely different type of film for Harrison Ford to decorate the screen between his action films. The following year, Harrison Ford returns to action, first for director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Back to the Future) in his 2000 summer thriller What Lies Below, and reportedly later this year on the screen version of Tom . Clancy "The sum of all fears." "Fears" will be the third release of Harrison Ford as CIA operative Jack Ryan. <br /> <br /> Director Sidney Pollack (Out of Africa, Firm, Tootsie) plays a supporting role in this function, as political advisor to Congressman Scott-Thomas. This is a very sharp and energetic image of Pollack. Sydney Pollack is not only a gifted director, but also one of the most believable, natural and charming actors (see also “Eyes wide shut”). <br /> <br /> Christine Scott-Thomas (“The Englishman”) Patient "Horsemaster" shows that you don’t have to be eccentric or mundane to be considered sexy. This is one of her best films, and she does amazingly thoughtful and soft work that goes well with Ford’s endurance. <br /> <br /> Plots work great, especially the plot related to the investigation into the nature of Ford’s investigation of police corruption. Look for the frightening and effective turnaround of actor "The Heat" Dennis Heisbert, who plays detective George Beaufort, an obstacle that must be overcome in the investigation of police corruption in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> The rest of the support staff is a wonderful delight. Charles S. Dutton (whose long-standing role in the film) has long demonstrated that he is one of the best acting characters, and Bonnie Hunt, whom I find extremely solid in this performance, steals most of his scenes with this wonderful, charming smile of Wendy Judd. <br /> <br /> The technical side of Pollack's thriller with notches. Starting with Dave Grusin’s completely stupid score (Firma Pollack) and finishing with a clear photograph of Philip Rousselot (“The river flows through it”), to a sharp montage that keeps the movie feeling fresh, despite the unfortunate background of the film. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves a good mysterious spectacle, a well-thought-out plot, plot stories and romance - all in one. This is a terrific story about betrayal and forgiveness. It also shows one of the most amazing, yet sharp, and there will undoubtedly be conflicting endings for the Harrison Ford film lately. "Random Hearts", of course, one of the best films of the year. <br /> <br /> (*** 1/2 of ****) or (8.5 out of 10.0)
