Müllers Büro is a film that many will watch and enjoy until the end, while others will stop watching it for five minutes. This is a parody of detective films with all the twists and turns; the action takes place only at night in the dark corners of the city, reminiscent of Gotham City of Batman (carefully look at the streets, buildings, police car, pursuing criminals, etc.). This is also a parody of musicals with very funny characters, such as Muller’s secretary and Vitasek's lover (actor playing Muller’s assistant), who are trying to sing, although not very successfully. <br /> <br /> The spaces occupied by the characters have their own presence in the film, for example, the decadent “blue box” (in Vienna there is a real club with the same name), where in the background you can see a sailor who hits a girl, an apartment Muller with black paint plastered on the walls and dirty kitchen, Mueller's bureau with a pretty picture of his assistant, etc. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of humorous moments in the film, including “flat-to-face” humor, such as frightening Muller the face of his assistant, the prostitute Muller is paying for an orgasm, the ridiculous costumes of female thugs from Montana, etc. <br /> <br /> The legendary film of the 80s, especially for those interested in Austrian or German-language films.
