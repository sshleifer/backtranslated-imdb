"The Lone Ranger and Tonto" intended to bring to justice a group of hooded raiders who killed three Indians for what at first glance seems unreasonable ... until the Lone Ranger learns from a conversation with Indian leader Tomaha, the Man had a medallion . Five medallions, presented by Tomaha to his friends as gifts, which we will later discover when they are united, will be given to the leader behind the raiders with hoods a map of the legendary lost golden city. Will the Lone Ranger be able to protect the two surviving medallions before the hooded hijackers hit them? Is the lost golden city somewhere in the homeland? <br /> <br /> Watching this, I knew all the time what was going to happen in advance, and everything seemed to be really familiar to me, until, in the end, I realized that I had seen the same movie when I was a very young child ... suddenly memories flooded and I remembered how I had fun as a child, enjoying it with a group of my friends. Although for an adult the plot is somewhat predictable, but you know that, although not quite in the same league as the 1956 film, it is very fun to watch. Clayton Moore is ideally suited as the Lone Ranger and Jay Silverville, because Tonto steals much of this film, as he probably has more fighters than even the Lone Ranger. There are several very familiar faces, including Douglas Kennedy as Ross Brady, the head of the gang Hooded Raiders, Charles Watts as the fanatical sheriff and Ralph Moody as the good Padre.
