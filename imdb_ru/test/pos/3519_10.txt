Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers who send chills on the back every time you watch it! There is a great expectation in this film, a great acting game, a very well-made cinematographic work (great work, Mr. Lieberman!), Which makes an extremely well-made slasher! Despite the fact that in the 80s he remained weak, he still affects you after it. The first kill (crochet machete) looked so real! And the fist to the mouth of death left me stunned! Overall, I give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars! If you are looking for a bloody holiday, do not look here. but, if you want the chill to go away on your back, look at this one. There are 6 deaths, and you don’t see one of them, but you don’t want to think “how was she killed?” the strange topic reminded me of the 1977s "The hills have eyes", which followed the same concept, but in the desert with cannibals. But, nevertheless, fans of the slasher, give this forgotten gem, I promise, you will stay up to date!
