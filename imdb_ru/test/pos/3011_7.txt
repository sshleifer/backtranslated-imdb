I had no expectations when I started watching this movie. How I was surprised! This is a great, beautiful, twisted film that will help your workout! It's not easy. If you like only the style of the police academy, films without brains, this is not for you. “The Cell” is a deep, complex film influenced by such films as “The Cube”, “The Silence of the Lambs” and “The Lawn Mower”, as well as many completely new ideas. A beautiful, twisted setting, good acting and an exciting story make this movie one of the best I've seen in a long time! Be open-minded and you will like it!
