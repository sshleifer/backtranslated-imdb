Such an amazing film - I was shocked all the time and so emotionally overpowered in the end! The two young male actors in the film were more than compelling in their actions, as their friendship and support of each other were quite plausible, and I thought that the comparison / contrast between their family life and health situations was so real for them. The success in bringing this film to life, obviously, was a collective effort, so I’m saying “WELL PLAYING!” To the actors, EP, producers, writers, directors and all other directors, I missed I was so surprised that I had to actually explore (albeit briefly) the Internet in order to find the name of this film — something wonderful I had to know — a clear indication that this film should be re-released!
