One Sunday morning at 6:30 am we stumbled upon this show, looking through all the cable channels, and it turned out to be the best show! This is absolutely amazing. We need such shows for children (and for adults, since I, of course, have gone far since childhood). As one of the other comments pointed out, this show benefits from the simplicity of the characters and the plot lines. The dolls are fantastically cute, the backgrounds are bright, and although they are made of cardboard, foam, paint and pure imagination, they remind us of our childhood, when we could spend the day at our grandmotherâ€™s house, exploring the world around us. For those who have never been lucky to have such a beautiful grandmother like Nana, this show is for you, you will catch up! This show is a real inspiration, filled with intelligence, humor and just fun, both for children and for adults. In other words, do not miss this show, simply because you are older than three years! Spend half an hour with Mona, Nana, Mr. Vuk and Russell, they will become the friends you are looking forward to!
