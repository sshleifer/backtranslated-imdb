If I only saw the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably would not have touched her with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and, knowing that this made some noise in Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a really nice movie based on a very interesting plot. Renee Zelleweger impresses with her role as Nurse Betty, a woman who, after a psychotic experience, falls into a delusional psychotic episode. I also liked Morgan Freeman (unsurprisingly), and I was pleasantly surprised by comedian Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> The film continually bounces off comedy, drama, melodrama and thriller. However, despite this obvious identity crisis, it stands up pretty well. I found my eyes glued to the screen from start to finish, always waiting for the next turn in the story. The whole cast is strong, if not impressive. <br /> <br /> My only real complaint is that director Neil Labout (who made a sensation a few years ago with a very impressive and gloomy “In the company of men”) relied too heavily on many of the selected Hollywood conventions. which he pressed on our throats during every sentimental scene were unbearable! And he performed the standard old trick "let's take some minor characters and connect them at the end in an illogical and unnecessary romantic trick," just to be absolutely sure that everyone will go home with a smile on his face. Why should directors and screenwriters treat their audiences as idiots? <br /> <br /> But the film is still too pleasant to annoy him with this annoyance. In a very bad year for films "Nurse Betty" is considered one of the most pleasant surprises of 2000. 8 out of 10.
