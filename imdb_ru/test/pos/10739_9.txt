Cramer vs. Kramer is another film that needs to be saved and not forgotten. This is not one of the most popular films ever made, and certainly one of the weakest best picture films, but this does not mean that it is still not important. I thought the movie was well made and made you want to watch more and more. The performances were the best positive for the film, and Dustin Hoffman played one of his best roles, which he had ever done, as a lonely workaholic who should take care of his son, since his wife is separated from him. Billy, the son of Hoffman, played another great show along with Meryl Streep, who played the depressive mother of Billy. Kramer vs. Kramer is not one of the greatest films and not a perfect dozen, but he makes the film worthy of attention and worthy of attention. Of course, one of the best Hoffman films he has ever done. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Hedin Perspective: 9/10 *** + A-
