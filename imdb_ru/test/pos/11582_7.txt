I just saw Mar Ardentro and felt I should comment on this film. Euthanasia is a difficult topic in any field, and, unfortunately, it can sometimes distort the true value of the film. Many people were delighted with the great cast and beautiful pictures / camera work. Of course, Javier Bardem is an actor who contributes something extra to every film he makes. To say that he includes the real Sampredo is a little silly, because I don’t think that any of the reviewers knew Sampredo personally. Lying in place and using a certain charm is an acting technique that, although well performed, is not an “ideal” performance. Bardem just does what he does well ... and everything. The film is beautiful and causes feelings and perspectives that the film itself lacks. Sampredo is shown here as a man who is so prone to death that he leaves his loving family and marries a woman who is only looking for when the other does not help him in his quest for a decent death. Now I am not here to talk about the right for or against euthanasia. The problem is that commenting on these films, you can hardly avoid it. The plot of the film is so strong that you are almost forced to discuss a film on this subject. I believe that a weakness for the film - inadvertently - portrays Sampredo as an unsympathetic character. Someone who is much smarter than his family, as depicted in a simple cousin who does not "get" a two-layer poem aimed at him. The one who leaves a loving and caring family, because HE considers his life unworthy. A scene that is opposed to a female lawyer who, according to the film, makes the “wrong” choice, ending in the distant state of dementia, which indicates that Sampredo's choice was correct. The woman who constantly searches for him is almost not noticed by an excellent lawyer, but suddenly marries Sampredo when she agrees to help him die. These choices turn Sampredo into a prudent figure, no matter how charming Bardem portrays him. I would say that the argument is not completely convincing, and I think that Amenabar was not going to add this unbalanced element to his film. For a young director, this is still an impressive film, and there are certainly strong moments in it (for example, the debate between the priest and Sampredo). Camera work is impressive and the film is well shot. But 10 out of 10 ... no, the film does not achieve such perfection.
