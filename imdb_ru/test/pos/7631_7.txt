I read several reviews of this film, which was recently released on DVD by Eclectic. The initial headers appear to have a mailbox, but the rest (most) are full-screen. The first release, released by Planet Video in 1982, is fully packed in mailboxes. Despite the fact that it was a primitive release, he understood correctly. Later releases had clearer and better image quality, but they were fullscreen, like DVDs. Any release of this film should be a mailbox, as it greatly enhances the visual experience of the old Planet tape.
