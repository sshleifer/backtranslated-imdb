I use IMDB very much. Basically reading other people's comments about films that I have seen or not seen. I thought it was time to write a few words about this film that changed my life, and the way I watch a movie. I think I have seen him at least a dozen times since the fall of 94, when I first saw it in the theater. <br /> <br /> I feel that Keselowski is one of the best directors of all time. And I think this is his best. It was his last. I was very sad that day when I found out that he died, because I am sure that we missed the chance to get something more from him. <br /> <br /> RED is simply the best Kieslowski + incredible production from Trintignant & Jacob + cinematography from Sobocinski. If you havenâ€™t seen it yet, LOOK! If you have, just go back to it !! <br /> <br /> Red: just a masterpiece. please forgive my bad english !, reader
