I saw Five Fingers at the entrance to ... what, 1973, '74? It was the first Kung Fu movie I've ever seen, and it really entertained me. I recently bought it on DVD and looked again. I was also very entertained the second time. I suppose this is probably one of the most kung fu movies modeled on. Rival schools, different styles, revenge, the “white hats” of the good guys and the “black hats” of the bad guys. They even added Japanese (VERY bad guys) styles of karate and judo. I remember how I was amused by the dubbing dialogue, which sounded like: “Hi, you! You are a very bad guy! ”And“ They must not get away with it! I will go to this bad crowd! ” This time it was not a distraction, I guess I got used to it. If you have even the slightest rating of this genre, this is the one you should see.
