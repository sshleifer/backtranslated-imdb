This film is about loneliness and how at a distance ?? physical and emotional - between people, as a rule, build relationships. <br /> <br /> The narrative is simple to the commonplace: a young man Yusuf (Emin Toprak) from a rural village comes to Istanbul to stay with his eldest and successful cousin Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir); Yusuf wants to work in a big city. After several weeks of trying to find a job, but to no avail, it is too hard for Mahmut to live with Yusuf with him. They are arguing ?? nothing physical, only verbal. In the end, Yusuf leaves, leaving Mahmut alone again. The end of the story ... <br /> <br /> Except for the fact that the presentation of two men as relatives is one of the best in the film. Much said visually; Dialogue is used to reveal the differences, mistrust, hostility and insecurity that exist within and between two people. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of visual gems. For example, in search of work, young Yusuf, who needs a relationship, tries in vain to attract the attention of various young women throughout the city. The expression on his face, as he gets upset every time, speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> Or, lighting a cigarette, Yusuf opens the door to the balcony of Mahmut’s apartment and lights it in the cold December air, leaving the door open; Mahmut finally gets up from his desk, goes to the door (the whole glass), and the cousins ​​just look at each other, which seems too long. Then Mahmut closes the door, leaving Yusuf in the cold. The metaphor is complete. <br /> <br /> Or Mahmut cleans up for Yusuf, reluctantly and with increasing anger; and all this time Yusuf spends his time chasing skirts instead of seriously looking for work, and spends Mahmut's money on a toy for his nephew ?? Yusuf is emotional, untidy, impulsive and vulnerable. Mahmut is a rational, logical, self-confident and demanding freak of control: the dichotomy of the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere, beautifully played by two actors who speak more with a look, gesture, frown than any words can express. /> <br /> But Mahmut is not devoid of emotions: he still loves his ex-wife, who tells him that she is going to Canada with her future husband. Mahmut influences a distant and confident friendship with his ex, and makes sure that she is all right. He wishes her well. He says goodbye. He leaves the cafe where they were talking. Later, when she calls to say goodbye, on the way to Mahmut airport she goes there and secretly watches her leave. The sharpness of emotion on his face, when she disappears through the door, is worth the wait. <br /> <br /> In general, this is the outstanding work of the two main actors and director Nuri Ceylan. Some may argue that the pace is too slow; but life has been slow for most of the time, especially for those who are alone. Working with the camera is also relatively simple: select the stage, adjust the camera and lighting, and let the actors move around the stage, enter the stage and leave the stage, while the camera remains stationary. There were a few frames of panning, a few shots from a high angle, a few rural scenes ?? but most of the film is shown as if on a stage with a fixed camera and a wide-angle lens. With the exception of TV and radio music in the plot, there is no music track. And there are many long silence when the two men sit and watch TV together and / or enter into very limited conversation. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on TV, so I was surprised to see this on several occasions. I watched TV when they watched TV too. The silence in the film corresponded to the silence in my house (I did not sleep, everyone else was in bed); my chair and position corresponded to the position of Mahmut when he was watching TV. Pretty creepy, what gives me the feeling that I'm almost with him? And, I think, in a sense. <br /> <br /> I won’t say more, because I want you to savor other scenes that I haven’t described. This is not a movie for everyone, of course. More than any film I've seen, it shows how much we die when we are alone? just like we are all alone when we die. The face of Mahmut, which turns black in the last scene, will stay with me for a long time ... <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for serious movie lovers.
