This is a wonderful old-fashioned Christmas favorite, which I try to catch every year on TV, if I can. It revolves around Martha Stewart as a journalist named Elizabeth Lane, charmingly portrayed by Barbara Stenvik. However, unlike Martha, this lady is a fake without any home skills. Other actors actually end the story, and include Dennis Morgan (Jefferson Jones), Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan) and Sydney Greenstreet (Alexander Yardley). <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes articles about food portraying herself as a happy family housewife with children. In fact, she is a single woman who lives in an apartment in New York and cannot cook an egg. Her recipes are borrowed from her friend, the Hungarian chef Felix. Elizabeth goes astray until the publisher of her magazine, Alexander Yardley, decides that he wants a nice old-fashioned village Christmas, and invites himself to visit her, taking with him the returning war hero, Jefferson Jones, a shipwrecked sailor, Yardley demands his complete honesty employees. To get out of a predicament and save his career based on deception, Elizabeth leases a country house in Connecticut with her long-time fiancé-architect John Sloan, a dull, fussy guy who had been looking for a marriage for a long time. She also lends the child of the neighbor (in fact, several) to impersonate her own and her “husband” Sloan. <br /> <br /> Of course, this scenario brings a lot of fun. This comic comedy and charming romance, with an added Christmas atmosphere. Whenever I think about this film, I imagine falling snowflakes, a beautifully decorated tree, fire flashing in the hearth, roast turkey and baking Christmas cookies. <br /> <br /> Why was Hollywood forced to do a remake? I understand that there is a 1992 version, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Diane Cannon, Chris Christopherson and Tony Curtis. I have not seen this modern adaptation and do not want. This old favorite is just the way it is, and the holiday that needs to be seen, along with “It's a wonderful life”, “White Christmas”, “Miracle on 34th Street” and, of course, all versions of the “Christmas song”.
