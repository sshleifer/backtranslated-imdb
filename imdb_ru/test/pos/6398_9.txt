“MY WIFE AND CHILDREN” is, in my opinion, the absolute classic of ABC! I did not see every episode, but I still enjoyed it. There are many episodes that I liked. In one of them, Junior (George O. Gore II) obtained a driver's license. If you want to know why, you should have seen it yourself. Before finishing, I would like to say that everyone always gave good results, the production design was impressive, the costumes were well thought out, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, despite the fact that it is now visible by syndication, I strongly recommend that you catch him in case he permanently disconnects.
