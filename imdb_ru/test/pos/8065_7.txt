Although the concept of a 32-year-old woman, depicting a 12-year-old girl, can be strained for a modern sophisticated audience, in the 1920s, Mary Pickford’s fans wanted and expected this from their favorite star. The opening scene depicts Annie’s frustrated character as the obvious leader of a multinational street gang in a comic “battle” with a rival group. The sight of a young girl being worn in the jaw and kicking may be a little rough, but the scene unfolds like “Our gang”, that it would be difficult to take it seriously. In any case, Annie can both decompose it and take it. As Annie returns to her apartment building and replaces her street clothes with more girlish clothes, it becomes harder (especially close-up) to present this beautiful young woman as a street hedgehog. However, for those who can muster the necessary disbelief, the rest of the film has its rewards. The film ranges from comedy (Annie's gang arranges the show) to the mood (Annie plans a surprise birthday party for her father of an Irish policeman) to tragedy (her father is killed on his birthday), the film gives Mary enough opportunities to show a variety of emotions that will please her fans any era. <br /> <br /> Of course, the necessary “happy ending” was finally achieved; the villains are detained with the help of Annie's friends and rivals, and for the last time they see her in the company of her buddies who are driving along a busy street on a sunny day. What is a good way for any Mary Pickford movie to end. <br /> <br />
