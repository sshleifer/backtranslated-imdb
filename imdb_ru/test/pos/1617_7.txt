In defense of this film, I must repeat what I said earlier. The film is called “Arachin”, it does not have a cast, and I do not mean any name, like actors who play in little-known art houses movies. I mean without a name, because in your local school they decided to make a film without a name, and it may have a budget of $ 2. So what to expect? Hitchcock <br /> <br /> I felt that the film never took itself seriously, which automatically removes it from the list of worst films. This list is only for the large budget of all star films that take themselves too seriously. The film Oscar comes to mind, most of the films are Sylvestre Stallone. The two leading ones were not Hepburn and Tracy, but they did their job well enough for this film. The woman kicked her ass, and the guy was not an idiot. The actor who played the old man was actually very good. The man who played the anal preserving professor was not Clifton Webb, but he did a godly job. And Bimbo, in the absence of the best, was played by two competent actors. I laughed at the special effects for 50 cents. But it was part of the movie's charm. Played like a hybrid of Tremor meets the Night of the Living Dead. The premise of the film is the same as that of all films about the giant beetles of the 50s. Meteor or radiation excites the ecosystem, and before you learn about it, we have giant ants, lobsters, stones or lizards terrorizing the locals. Meteor was causing problems this time. I was very entertained. I did not expect much, and I go a lot more than I expected.
