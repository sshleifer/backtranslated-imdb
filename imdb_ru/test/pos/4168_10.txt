The title of my resume largely covers my review. <br /> <br /> It’s for me that Teenage Ninja Turtles were for someone 5 years older. While I missed this little wave of pop culture, I hugged the toy line and tv. TV series "Mighty Max" with both hands. <br /> <br /> You want to know how I understood it? I went as the Mighty Max on Halloween. <br /> <br /> Thank God for the Internet. Thanks to Demonoid, last week I was able to watch this great show from my childhood for the first time in more than a decade. <br /> <br /> I’m watching this right now, being just overwhelmed by Rob’s recognition. Paulson from Animaniacs, and I also love celebrity humor in "Tar Tar." After 4 minutes, and they already mentioned, NAME: Clint Eastwood, Governor Arnold, Dustin Hoffman, John Wayne, and Ace Ventura. Hell, yes. <br /> <br /> Hell, only after I wrote this, I realized that there is no way in hell, and I can give this series something less than a perfect result. Any flaws were lost in the fog of time. <br /> <br /> This is my childhood. It's amazing. It is Mighty.
