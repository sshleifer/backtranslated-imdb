Unlike the previous poster, I liked the celluloid treatment. It looked good and made the movie more enjoyable to watch. For me, this does not detract from the strength of the content of the documentary. In fact, I felt that the lightness of my gaze allowed me to lose myself a lot more in the content. The previous poster rightly compared the style with Nike advertising; it definitely looks like this. But for my taste, it worked very well (and Iâ€™m not a fan of Nike ads). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is how documentary films should be made. I can't wait to see the next installments from these promising directors.
