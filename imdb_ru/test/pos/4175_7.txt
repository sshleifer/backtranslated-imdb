Surprisingly, monkeys are my favorite. Yes, they could be the original rock band; a stunt that certainly went overboard in the 21st century. However, their music is one of the best in the 1960s. Last Train To Clarksville; Daydream Believer; I'm A Believer; and Jon Stewart Although they were not good musicians or songwriters, they had a pleasant presence on the screen and a lot of attraction, and some of their own things were really decent. Their show T.V. Obsolete in 2007, but I still watch the show as a temporary capsule to life in the years 1966-1968; This is a magical and dangerous time in US history. <br /> <br /> However, as we all know, as a forerunner of future events like Kelly Clarkson, “Monkeys” did not want to be considered production and just dolls for their record company. Despite their average talents, they wanted to write their own songs, create their own albums and make shots when it comes to tours. Unfortunately, it was a disaster; especially when Peter Torkom’s Jimi Hendrix’s choice as an introductory act was rejected because of his theft of the show and the harsh sexual utterances in his music compared to the content of The Monkees G-rated. <br /> <br /> However, the last nail in the coffin for monkeys (until 1986) was the infamous film “Head”. The head was written by Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson, while they were supposedly high on Mary-Jane. The film received bad reviews and earned only $ 16,000 at the box office. Today, this film is an iconic classic, ahead of its time and telling about what was in the minds of young people in 1968, “Summer of Wrath”. <br /> <br /> The chapter does not really have a plot. Basically, one to four Monkeys roll from scene to scene without any rhyme or reason. They move from food in the diner, to how Sonny Liston beats Davy Jones, to the West, to being dragged into a vacuum, to performances at a concert, and so on. The film basically offers indirect opinions about what was wrong with American society. Monkeys rage commercialism, the Vietnam War, American politics, censorship, the establishment and greed. You have to read between the lines to see what the ridicule goals were. <br /> <br /> Monkeys spend a lot of time in boxes at certain places in the film, symbolizing how they felt that their record company saw them; like toys for them when you had to record another hit album. The scene where their numbers exceed the number 16-4 on the western scene, can be a symbol of them against session musicians, songwriters, producers and the like who controlled their careers, and the weapon they shoot at is their way of saying “Run ! <br /> <br /> The film is a real psychedelic trip. Bright colors for ties, hypnotic concerts and belly dance scenes, as well as images of drug addicts are everywhere. Acting is actually very good, but it’s biased because I like The Monkees T.V. In a small soundtrack there is the “Song of the Porpoise” and three songs written by the Monkeys themselves. <br /> <br /> There are really funny scenes in the film; although perhaps they should not have been. Mickey Dolenc, who beat a coca machine that did not give him a soda or his violent blows in the boxing scene (I mean, he was a strange guy who probably weighed no more than 135) made me laugh at this. /> <br /> In general, this film is absolutely necessary for any Monkees fan. I think that many people will feel that this film is really “over the head,” but for those who are obsessed with 60s and society at that time, will find it an excellent time capsule.
