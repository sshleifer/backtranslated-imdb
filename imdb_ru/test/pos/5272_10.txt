The Helge Schneider phenomenon is not amenable to simple description or quick classification. Nevertheless, for an international audience who is not familiar with him, we can say that he is something like a rough mix of Weird Al Yankovich and Andy Kaufman, adding to it jazz music and 70s outfits. While his stage performances are already eccentric, his work on the film is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 00 Schneider, in my opinion, is Helge's best film. He plays a major role in two major roles - police detective "Commissioner 00 Schneider" and the killer-villain "Nikhil Baxter", as well as the doctor's role "Doctor Hazenbein." <br /> <br /> In the debut On stage, we see Baxter, a loving contemporary art, accidentally kill the circus clown Bratislava Metulsky, from whom he bought the defective Jaguar used, when his favorite sculpture slips out of the hands of the Metulsky. After reading about this incident in the newspaper, 00 is returning from retirement to investigate the case with the support of his faithful associate, Lieutenant KÃ¶rschgen, who is played by an elderly actor with the same name. They quickly select the track of Baxter and interrogate him in his strangely decorated mansion (one of the best scenes of the film!), But initially they cannot collect any evidence. The story unfolds through many twists and turns, with several scenes that do not always really promote the plot, but are funny, such as a dream by 00 (including the most unusual view of a short-dressed crotch running man in a story movie) Korschgen quarrels with his boss and must be hospitalized, as well as a visit to the already mentioned Dr. Hazenbein. Thus, Baxter is finally caught trying to escape to Rio de Janeiro by plane. <br /> <br /> It is always worth mentioning especially Andreas Kunze, who in this case plays wife 00, as he usually appears in the dredge, performing female roles in the films of Helge. <br /> <br /> Therefore, for those who are looking for new laughter, I highly recommend this film. Trick? You must understand German (since I doubt that there is an English version) ...
