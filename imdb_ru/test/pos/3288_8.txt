Passionate electronics lover Brian Foster (pleasant performance by Wesley Yura from The Land of the Dead) creates a computerized watchdog named C.H.O.M.P.S. (abbreviation for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss, Mr. Ralph Norton (nicely played by Conrad Baine), whose home security business is hesitant. A rival company hires a couple of inept criminals to get their dirty hands on C.H.O.M.P.S.; This task is easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey tells a charmingly stupefying story at a constant fast pace, maintains a surprisingly stupid and carefree tone, and sets up stupid gags from a farce with a significant sense. Moreover, the game has a universal, contagious aplomb: charming Valerie Bertinelli as a nice fianc√© Brian Casey Norton, Chuck McCann as a tough Brooks cheater, Red Buttons as no less clumsy partner McCann Bracken, Jim Backus as the evil general director of Mr. Mr Teacher Ermuna Baddeley as the cute old blonde Mrs. Foster and the exploitation of the AIP in the 60s feature the usual Larry Bishop as the clever, two-faced costume of Ken Sharp. Best of all, the title dog is a pleasant delight: C.H.O.M.P.S. jumps over fences, walls and windows with amazing dexterity, performs exceptionally strong actions, runs faster than a deer, and even does some fine martial arts. The story of a clumsy borzo named Monster gives a few extra laughter in the stomach (Monster is voiced by some uncredited guy with a deep enough, growing voice). The unique animated opening credits, the glossy cinematography of Charles F. Wheeler and the fun, throbbing score of Hoyt Curtin - all this is also solid. Cute little movie about children.
