This is not a serious film, and it does not pretend to it, but it is not as bad as some of his reviews, his title and the first ten minutes that make you expect. <br /> <br /> The plot is very stupid, but it adds carefree fun and enthusiasm that permeates the entire movie. Characters play sympathetically, and although they do participate in typical adolescent longing, they usually avoid the painful sentimentality commonly found in this type of film. <br /> <br /> Unusually installed in London, sympathetic to geeks, it is worth seeing if this happens; if you want some stupid nonsense and don't mind suspending your disbelief.
