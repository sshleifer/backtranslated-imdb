I thought this movie was great! I saw it when he went to the cinema, so I do not remember all the details. I remember that this is based on Homer's story about Odyssey. The names of places and events are changed, but you can still see the similarities with the fairy tale. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me funny how they get into trouble and how they get out of it. I really enjoyed this version of the upgraded old stories much better than Romeo and Juliet with Claire Danes. <br /> <br /> I agree that in some parts of the story it is sometimes a little silly, but this is all a great adventure with some famous actors.
