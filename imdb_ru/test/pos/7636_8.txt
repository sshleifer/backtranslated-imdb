It is true that this is not a realistic story, but a romantic comedy is not the genre to which I aspire. What is important is that the characters are cute and, if necessary, sexy. Shalom is handsome and relaxed, and Jake Weber is handsome in an unusual way. They have enough chemistry to make the story believable in an area that matters, sexual attraction. I would like to see them in another movie. And yes, the clown is also pretty cute.
