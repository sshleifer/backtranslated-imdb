This film presents some of the best ensemble works that I have seen in a movie or on stage. Actors beat each other with skill and vigor, which cannot be achieved by editing. <br /> <br /> Love Jones is a good story, period. But it is also an excellent depiction of an urban, middle-income, twenty-something African-American set that is not often seen.
