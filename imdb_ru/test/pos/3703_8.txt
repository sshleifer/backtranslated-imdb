“Karibe” is not a masterpiece in any of its narrative aspects. Nevertheless, it delivers a completely pleasant story, along with great cinema. The narrative structure is set around two narrative axes, one of which includes the other, each of which has elements that are connected and coexist in perfect harmony. The story never loses the right rhythm and shows a very good mix of the human figure with its natural environment (which is itself a character). The acting is great and we have to pay tribute to budding director Esteban Ramirez. In addition, the characters are very well written and expertly complex; therefore, as soon as you become familiar with them, you will be able to perceive their feelings, even if they do not say anything. I cannot say that I liked this picture because of all its excitement (in Costa Rica), but rather because of how it really shows an interesting portrait of what happens when you interfere with the balance of people's lives. We hope that Caribe will create a benchmark for future projects in Costa Rica, as this is a very good example of good filmmaking.
