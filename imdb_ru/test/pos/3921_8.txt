Admittedly, before I saw House of Wax, I assumed it would just be a second-tier low-quality slasher film, following in the footsteps of films such as The Darkness or Amityville Horror. After I caught an advanced show on my college campus, I can honestly say that the people in the Dark Castle did an excellent job with creating a slasher. <br /> <br /> Starting from the usual mainstream stories of teen horror films, such as a small group of friends going on a car trip, meeting a strange workaround, taking them along country roads, meeting horrific locals after a slow but mandatory plot This movie is really quickly made. Paris Hilton appears in this film, as many already know, but I really need to give her to her for her bold performance. Obviously, her acting was not worth Oscar, but the filmmakers use her looks to the full, squeezing two glaring satires into her, let's say, a less noble appearance in the media. Ms. Hilton also claims to be the biggest death scene in the film, and not just because it was her death scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is full to the brim with bouncing moments and cheap scares, but Jaume Serra has definitely created quality tension and tension between the characters. Causes of horror are partly based on making the viewers take care of the characters, which we do. The usual build-up was followed by a loud noise and yanked the camera with some other scary moments. These standard cinematic techniques, adopted in many past films, are practically improved by this film and give a lot of good panic. In fact, after they get to the small town where the scary Museum of the House of Wax is located, there is not the slightest delay. <br /> <br /> This film is in many respects obliged to many previous films of this and other genres, although I am not too sure how much of the original 1953 film of the same name. References to movies such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Saw, and even Titanic (see Paris Hilton's Death Scene, and you'll understand what I mean) are common, but the win will ultimately leave you scared and satisfied if you are looking for a good panic with a bit of laughter. Not bad.
