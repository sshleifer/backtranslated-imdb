The central element of Lackawanna Blues is the character of Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, who manages the boarding house and gives unabated support to the young boy, Ruben, the narrator of the film. Based on the experience of writer-actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson, the film lovingly recreates a boarding house in upstate New York and recalls the cultural climate of the transition world in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is almost non-stop music. In the second half, various characters in a boarding house are considered in more detail. The nanny's ability to “take fragments and make them whole” affects everyone in her area. A particularly bright scene - when she encounters an abusive husband, firmly telling him: “If you ever touch this child again, we will dance!” According to actress S. Epaty Merkerson, this line is so cruel and so determined that her with a hot-tempered character gets stuck in his tracks. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, Merkerson demonstrates team presence. Her character binds together the fragmented life of the borders of his house. It was a touching, emotional film with a wonderful cast. In the role of Merkerson, the character of the nanny simply radiates love. This is a film that I will remember for a long time.
