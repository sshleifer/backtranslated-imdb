A real surprise. Not exactly family entertainment from Disney. Some violence, many tense moments and a great story based on facts. The theme of "Night Transition" - the definition wins. Never losing sight of their goal, two East German families risk it all in their bold balloon, fleeing freedom. History and heartbreaking, and heartbreaking. Time is not on their side. East German police are approaching, and the outcome is far from certain, to the very end. If you are looking for a good evening entertainment that does not contain nudity and limited violence, then I highly recommend the "Night Transition". This is pure entertainment. - MERK
