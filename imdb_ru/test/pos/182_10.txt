In my review, which I just introduced, I mentioned a young actress as Catherine, when it should have been Veronica. I was so connected with the character and the action, I think that I was not so connected with the names. In any case, she and the film are great. As I said, cinematography and directorial use of editing is worthy of Eisenstein and his operator Tisza. Production design is top notch. The location of the actors in the foreground, middle and background within any given scene is worth exploring. Awesome, memorable camera movement and an ending with an emotional punch that leaves Hollywood films far behind. Gee! Heroic sacrifice instead of going to the rainbow. Thanks again, John Hart
