This film is an excellent film, however, since most films are quite predictable. The highlight of the film, of course, is the star heroine Amanda Bynes, who is absolutely gorgeous and cheerful. She is one of the few people in this world who can use all 53 muscles on her face to make the strangest and most grueling faces ever made. It is good for children and contains a top male nude and suggestive nudity towards the end. In general, they did a good job of updating the old classics and deserve to rest on the filmâ€™s stand along with O and 10 Things I Hate About You. Other actors also do an excellent job with their work, in many of their first debuts.
