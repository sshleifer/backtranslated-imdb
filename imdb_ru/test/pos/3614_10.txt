Beautiful, sensitive film that brings home the futility and cruelty of wars, despite the so-called reasons. The performance of Cage and Cruise was quite impressive, but it was the older Greek characters who received the highest marks. Irene Papas is as gorgeous as ever! Although at times some scenes seem a bit long, this film will become a serious contender to Oscar.
