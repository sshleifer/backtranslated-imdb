“Don't look to the basement” is so easy to knock out, but the truth is that Brownrigg is one of the real underground stars of the Horrors, and IMHO for a long time it is time to get due recognition. “Not” is his undisputed masterpiece. This disgusting psychodrama immediately draws the viewer into such a strange, incoherent, claustrophobic world of sweaty madness that you do not know what the hell is going on. Because of this, you feel strangely dirty, just dirty, because the world of Brownrigg is a crazy, dirty, nasty prison cell of insanity, obsession and all shades of mental illness. And he uses his low-budget palette to wrap his grotto blanket around him, like a bad memory. There is something very strange about this goddamned business. In short, a classic ... In addition, if you first look at "Not," then you will have an idea of ​​the insane style of psychodrama, which marks other Brownrigg films. To summarize, they really have not become more esoteric than this - well, in fact, they do are looking for “Keep my grave open” by Brownrigg. Mad genius. Do not accept replacement.
