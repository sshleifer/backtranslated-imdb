There were about 60 different films and television plays, besides the classic opera, which tells about the sexually insane girl and her unhappy lover-soldier. This story has been made so many times, in many ways. <br /> <br /> Vicente Aranda leads Joaquin Jord’s script on the adaptation of the classic novel and play by Prosper Merimee. <br /> <br /> This story is ONLY from Bizet’s “Carmen” Opera <br /> <br /> “Paz Vega” is a fascinating “Carmen”, full of passion and the ability to encourage ordinary people to do terrible tragic acts. Leonardo Saberlo is an unhappy soldier who has fallen into the poisonous network of Carmen and leads to bad deeds. <br /> <br /> Jay Benedict is the author of Prosper telling this story. <br /> <br /> a lot of action, BUT there are some very hot sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is almost an NC-17 movie. <br /> <br /> Since I have often seen this story in many I am not very impressed. <br /> <br /> This is a very well-made film that will be interesting to those who do not know about it, <br /> <br /> My not very enthusiastic review may be, I miss the fantastic score of the Bizet opera. <br /> <br /> See how you might like more than me. <br /> <br /> Ratings *** (out of 4) 82 Points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
