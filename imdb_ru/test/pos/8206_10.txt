Blimey! In my opinion, THE NET is a great techno-thriller with sharp nails that does not take long to wait. When I first saw this, I felt good for a few days. When Angela (Sandra Bullock) went to Mexico, I thought: "This is a really good place to stay." From the moment Jack (Jerome Northam) and Ruth (Wendy Gazelle) began to pursue her, I thought to myself: â€œDo not let anything bad happen to her! I also took a few deep breaths so as not to scream more than I already had. On the other hand, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. In conclusion, I give this excellent, exciting nail, techno-thriller "the edge of your place" four stars.
