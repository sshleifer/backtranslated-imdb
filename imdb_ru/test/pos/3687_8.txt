Minor Spoilers <br /> <br /> In Chicago, Grace Beazley (Kathy Bates) is a housewife who is in a twenty-five year marriage with attorney Max Beasley (Dan Aykroyd) and a hysterical psychotic dwarf daughter-in-law, Modei (Meredith Eaton). Grace worships singer Victor Fox (Jonathan Price), who will present a television show in Chicago and give five commercials in the first row of a television commercial. Kate causes the show and wins the ticket when Max simultaneously asks for a divorce, claiming that their lives are too monotonous. Grace is depressed, and when she goes to the show, viewers are told that a Chicago serial killer using a crossbow killed Victor Fox. With a broken heart, she decides to fly to England for Victor Fox's funeral. There, she realizes that he was gay and becomes a friend of his former friend Dirk Simpson (Rupert Everett). They fly back to Chicago, trying to find the killer. This film is a delightful, original and strange dramatic comedy with fancy characters. He has enormous potential to become a cult film with the participation of Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow themselves and a joke with Nicholas Horn's masterpiece Do Not Look Now, when Modi wears a red cloak in the underground part of the city of Chicago. The beginning of the film in which Jonathan Price sings "Hitchcock's Railway" is fine. I repeated it four times in a row. The cast has great work in which Kathy Bates, Jonathan Price, Rupert Everett and the unknown Meredith Eaton participate. Indeed, this film is great entertainment. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Amor a Toda Prova” (“Love to prove”).
