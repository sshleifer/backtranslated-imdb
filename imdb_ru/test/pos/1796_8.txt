Four Seasons Merchant - a film about the lack of love. The film begins with the main character; Hans Epp, who returned from a spell to someone else's legion. He returns to his mother so that he will not be told how much she loves him or how much she missed him; but to say that he was worth nothing and, worse, she would have preferred that the man with whom he went came back. It is the attitude of the character to women that makes this film so hated; the fact that his wife is higher than him symbolizes his relationship to the other sex; he is constantly humiliated by them, and it is thanks to his relationship with him that his life is not as great as it could be. This is also clearly seen from the way he treats his wife after drinking. He lost his job as a policeman because of his passion for a woman and even his wife; a woman who should love him will never show affection for him. Even at the end, his wife is more worried about what she and her daughter will do than about the condition of her husband. <br /> <br /> “Four Seasons Merchant” is a completely unpleasant movie. There is no scene in the film where someone is happy, and not only that; but the film seems insanely blissful to wallow in the sufferings of its main characters. The film, of course, is not recommended to anyone who is currently experiencing difficulties, that's for sure. Despite all the suffering, the film never goes beyond reality; every event in this film can, and most likely, happen, and it only makes the film more shocking. The film, of course, is led by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; a cult German film director who committed suicide in 1982. This is just my second taste of the work of this person, but after just two films it is easy to understand what kind of art he creates. Both films are subtle and sandy - but realistic works of art. His feature in this film is elusive; we only recognize the characters through their plight, not their character. This is a very smart way to show viewers that it is their environment that determines the people in the film, not the people themselves - and since almost everyone who sees the movie knows what life in urban society is like, it’s not difficult for most people to be. <br /> <br /> “Four Seasons Merchant” is a film that is easy to forget; the film is rich in content and little in style, and it creates a very memorable picture that anyone who considers himself a fan of cinema should experience. It is with this in mind that I give my highest recommendations to this film; this is not sweet and not pleasant, but you will not see a more realistic depiction of depression, and this film will surely stay with you.
