This film should be looked at music, which in fact is a wonderful cantata written by Sergei Prokofiev. Obviously, the original soundtrack is not exactly Hi-Fi, but there are many great versions available in classical music. Cantata can be evaluated on its own, but watching the movie helps. <br /> <br /> The story itself is a fairly standard Soviet anti-German wartime propaganda. The funny joke is that Stalin would later like to gain time by soothing Hitler at the beginning of World War II, that Eisenstein was temporarily assigned to a German film as an austerity. <br /> <br /> Prince Alexander Nevsky (revered by Russian Orthodox as a saint), gained his nickname, defeating the Swedish raiders on the Neva River, collecting Russian resistance against the invasion of the Teutonic knights, and completing his victory with a strict warning to other potential invaders. <br /> <br /> Interesting scene: Alexander sees how Russian columns are enslaved by Mongolian soldiers, and does nothing to stop this, since the Teutonic knights are his priority. The historical Alexander Nevsky paid tribute to the Mongol khans, as did his father before him, while simultaneously working to strengthen the future independence of his kingdom.
