Painting with Danny Devito and Billy Crystal starring. They are both famous actors, and in this charming comedy they try to kill each other's petition. Billy Crystal's pet is his ex-wife, who stole his book and put her name on it, and Danny DeVito's pet peasant is his malignant mother. Billy Crystal is the author and teacher, apparently, and Danny DeVito is one of his students. This classic comedy is very interesting for all ages. <br /> <br /> In this film, Danny Devito seems to be acting like a child because of his angry mother, who humiliates him all the time. She says things like "You have no friends!" and when Billy Crystal fell, she said: "Bury him before he stinks in the basement!" She also suppresses Danny, calling him "Ass of fat!" and other things just to piss him off.
