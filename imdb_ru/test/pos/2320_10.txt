Look, we rated it 10 at entertainment value. Of course, this is a comedy, not an epic of the “Lord of the Rings” or “Gone with the Wind” type. Nevertheless, for comedy, especially nowadays, this is 10. <br /> <br /> Not a long movie, it moves quickly and easily. Kelsey Grammar right at home is the role of a free but brilliant diesel submarine captain who fought against the US Nuclear Fleet in a war game designed to find out whether terrorists can get a nuclear bomb through our defenses. (sort of ironic of this plot ... pre 911) Do not take this topic seriously, because it basically laughs from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is second on the team (like Frank Burns) and laughs a lot. Everyone else is also perfect for their parts. Rip Thorn and Bruce Dern. <br /> <br /> It looks simple and clear, you have 90 minutes, and you need to laugh or pick me up, and you are not a hypocrite (this is some kind of language and understatement), and then rent it, or buy it (we done) and enjoy! I would like them to do part 2!
