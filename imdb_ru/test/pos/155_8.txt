In my opinion, the “fascination” of vampires really proved that it deserves such a shameful classification. Last year there were a lot of sub-genre films from many countries. I have reviewed many of them and want to discuss a few more. Sorry for my condescension, but since I recognized the trend as a phenomenon (which, by coincidence, shows my favorite main product of horrors). Now I’m going to move a little bit beyond North America and introduce you to films that we hope haven’t seen at the moment. <br /> <br /> Of the many effects of "Twilight" - the creation ". boyfriend and girlfriend movies about vampires. I hate this sexist categorization, which causes a whole generation of fans to “turn” into “parties.” I think men tend to hate the work of Stephanie Meyer (and her posterity) in some because they feel some treachery that the archetype that has always been theirs is now released. Women are unlikely to like the future "neutral" pictures, as they grew with iron expectations that were played four times. We need more directors to create Ilm's about vampires that any sex can enjoy (unevenly) if vampires are going to survive the craze and stay relevant. Cue: Thirst This Korean film was made by Oldboy Park Chan-Vouk. and is everywhere insignificant pleasure, or it is a capricious mess that does not decide which target audience it prefers, and therefore should not be considered by anyone. Don't let me convince you that the film has no inclinations. His director is a man whose fame is subject-oriented action movies. His main character is a man and has a passive-aggressive interest in his lover (more on this later). However, his desire for a woman he knew before and after mortality was not contrived, and his attention returned. There is a male bias in this picture, but it is not so one-sided that women cannot enjoy it. The same can not be said about "Sunrises" or "New Moon". <br /> <br /> The plot repeats the novel by Emil Zola named Terez Raken, which I have not read. According to Wikipedia, a novel about a novel that develops between a married woman and a single man. He kills her husband while fishing and starts dating her. Two of them cannot have sex because they depict the body of a dead person between them. Thus, they are driven to distraction, but they take care of the sick mother of the woman. At the end of the novel, they try to kill each other, reveal each other’s plans and commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Now transfer this almost 150-year-old French novel to modern South Korea, and you will get thirsty. Chan-wook doesn’t decorate the story enough to lift it to see. He often ignores many of his own ideas for following his inspiration. I think the most memorable parts are when his doubts upset the story. His use of mother-in-law as a foil for their bad romance is just perfect. Look at this. <br /> <br /> The main character is an initially devout Christian who becomes a vampire after an unsuccessful blood transfusion after he has voluntarily offered a new medicine. Thus he becomes the god with whom he was once slain. People flock to him and consider him a great healer. OK. This is really cool and could serve as an excellent basis for his relationship. Yet, this idea is given little time to present ideas when it turns into a realistic figure of Christ, who tries to preserve his virtue, even if his lifestyle requires him to abandon it. Instead of confronting delusional people, he instead sips the blood from comatose patients. <br /> <br /> Let's continue with the Christian allusion. A woman is cheating on a vampire male by killing her husband. Her ultra-protective mother-in-law suffers from a stroke and ultimately warns family friends about the betrayal of her daughter-in-law (moves her fingers). A man kills her, but resurrects her. Two of them invite former friends, and the woman begins to mercilessly pursue people. The man says that's enough, and decides to go to the beach and makes her wait for the sunrise with him. They both die, but he redeems her crimes (and his own, but the film portrays her evil more noticeably). <br /> <br /> A female character is a caricature, and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior. She is a housewife with no education, and the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive. Vampirism enhances their characteristics. She becomes a monster, as you would expect from someone without knowledge. He becomes a demigod with spirit. His life is how atheists consider themselves, and her life is how religious people look at people without divine intervention.
