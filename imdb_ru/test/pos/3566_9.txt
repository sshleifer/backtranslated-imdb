Leonard Maltin gave this film a terrible assessment of BOMB in his 1995 Cinema and Video Guidebook. What movie did he watch? Kid Vengeance or God Gun are bombs. This movie delights. That's fantastic. It is competent. It is well mounted. It is beautifully photographed, brilliantly uses colors. From the very beginning of the film, the film draws your attention and suggests that this film is a well-made satire of the entire western genre of spaghetti. The film from the very beginning to the end plays from laughter to Douglas Fairbanks, 77 Sunset Strip and the famous showdown in the film “Good, bad and ugly” Edd Byrnes, George Hilton and Gilbert Roland work brilliantly together to do satirical work. It is a pity that Mr. Maltin so poorly rated this film, as he was undeserved. One can only guess its reason. I suspect that he completely missed the point of the film and was expecting something more serious than was supposed in this film. Kudos to all who participate in this project. This film is a small gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate films and appreciate satire.
