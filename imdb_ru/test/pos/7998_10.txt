This sequel proves that Tim Burton was for all intents the best choice to ever direct a Batman movie. The story tells how Bhaman fights with three enemies: Penguin (played by Danny De Vito), Catwoman (graceful Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shrek (excellent Christopher Walken). <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best entry in the series has it all: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that really stands out. The cast is great, although DeVito is obvious as a multi-layered penguin. Here is a guy who is angry, pathetic, funny and, perhaps most importantly, scary. The infamous scene with Shrek's image consultants still makes me shiver. In other words, the cast is just fun to watch, and everyone turns into first-class plays. <br /> <br /> Feel free to say that "The Return of Batman" - my favorite of all released "Batman" (sorry, Fans of Dark Knight). If you want a superhero movie that can offer a little more than bright effects and a massive action, then please watch this very underrated movie. <br /> <br /> To say the least, this is at least the best movie that Bur Burton has ever made.
