The ninth feature film by David Lynch "Mulholland Drive" is a deeply touching story of betrayal and jealousy. In any case, this contrasts sharply with our ambitions and hopes for the often bitter truth. Each frame of this film is important and links to other parts and to themselves at the same time. Nothing is what it seems at first glance, and you still have a real puzzle when you try to put everything together. This is a film that does not compromise, nor does it fully cope with the complex shape and language of the camera, as could be the case with Lost Highway earlier. <br /> <br /> Although the classic Lynch motifs and devices are uniquely recognized, the film remains quite original, even in the light of the fact that it is a Lynch film. Lost Highway marked a new way to tell a story; spawned an unconventional way of setting emotions on the screen. Thanks to Mulholland Drive, Lynch not only managed to control this technique, but also raised it to a new level, making it much more complex and multidimensional. In doing so, he creates a framework from different layers in time and in the human mind. At a press conference devoted to the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, David Lynch said that the pursuit of excellence could, at best, give results when the whole is larger than the sum of the parts. Talking about such synergy becomes very relevant for Dr. Mulholland, where different sequences and many details contribute to the overall result; dreams and parallels are intertwined to create a story. In some art the beauty of this lies in its simplicity. This does not apply to Mulholland Drive and has never been with Lynch. This is the complexity that colors and builds the worlds that Lynch creates, the same complexity that characterizes the real world. <br /> <br /> It never becomes violent, like, for example, Memento, using the original way of communicating with the audience. Continuing to compare Mulholland Drive with other films, I think it proves that David Lynch is a master of what he does and connects art and film making in a way that no one has ever done. Compared, for example, with Alejandro Yodorovsky or a contemporary of Matthew Barney, I really think that Lynch more clearly controls what prevents the artist from dominating the filmmaker, or, more likely, David Lynch better understands and performs film production as an art form. <br /> <Understanding the plot is not a small feat, but Lynch’s way of working with sound, perspective, chronology and form is painted by a work of art so grim and frightening that sometimes it seems more realistic than real life. In the Lynchia cinema often and, of course, in Mulholland Drive, a surge of human emotion. Working with emotions is a delicate craft that requires understanding and depth. As Lynch says: “Too much, and the emotions go away. Too little, and this does not happen. " In Mulholland Drive, David Lynch has no problem keeping this balance. Lynch portraits cover all kinds of measurements and take different directions, creating incredibly realistic characters and situations. Watching Mulholland Drive is a journey through the subconscious. This is a true and naked film with undeniable artistic value. That is why I love Mulholland Drive and that led him to the top of the history of cinema. The ultimate movie.
