Beyond The Clouds is a stunningly beautiful and elegant piece of art. The overall softness of the light in which this film bathes makes you want to touch the screen. A ripe autumn mood could only be achieved by a director who has seen many years of experience. Or, in other words, an old man. I do not know of any other film that captures and uses the softness of the light and the seasonal mood with such a wonderful quality as Beyond The Clouds. Almost all the people in this movie are beautiful, unless you imagine a beautiful woman with a pneumatic blonde. The dialogue really does not matter much, not so much, and the plot lines, forget about it. Some films exist simply as a visual experience, this is one of them. Do not worry if you want “simple entertainment”, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> I can get involved in the visual perfection of this film for several days, but I will not. If you are interested in cinema, photography, directing, etc., see this movie.
