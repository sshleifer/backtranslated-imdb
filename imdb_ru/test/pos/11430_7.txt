Based on the novel Ermanno Rea, “Dismissal”, in essence, this is a story about a slow friendship that develops between Italian maintenance technician Vincenzo Buonavolonta (Sergio Castellitto, who can be considered the villainous king at Prince Caspian, and was the lead in Bella Marta) translator Liu Hua (Lin Tai). In fact, they went from the wrong foot: the first one punished her for inaccurate, but slow translations of what he wanted to say to the Chinese delegate who bought the defective equipment. Vincenzo wants to do the right thing, which is rarely the case today, and this means that potential buyers have to report errors in advance, as well as the difficulties that their purchase can bring, and considering that he is concerned about the fact that the deal is still It took place ahead. He has free time to create a component that would fix everything. <br /> <br /> But it also means that you need to go to China in search of an elusive machine that turns out to be well hidden and, apparently, disappeared without a trace. With the original reluctant help of Liu Hua, they went in search of treasure from city to city, which brings us to the less visible sights of China, from Beijing and Shanghai, to cities such as Wuhan, with industrial backgrounds such as steel mills and flue plants pipes dot the landscape. The mighty Yangtze River also appears. Along the way, the usual attributes of such travel-style films as, for example, the study of culture, ideals, food and, basically, the understanding that the world is without strangers, if only someone tries to connect, come into play. Although hints of some kind of romance between the two presenters are suggested, it rarely became controversial until, perhaps, at the end of the film (hey, opposites attract, no?) <br /> <br /> Besides large industrial enterprises and factories, we see various industries industries such as sweaters working in sweat shops such as the environment, and I believe that Cotton, along with the production of noodles. As a film, he gave me the opportunity to travel, without leaving his place for observation, and the merit is that he could not make moral judgments about exploitation and the like. And the glory for the film to engage in dialogue based on the characters' native languages, and not (and I will not name names here) some other films / intercultural collaboration, where the dialogue is forcibly duplicated and came out unnatural, and really tedious. Some may find that minor characters are too kind, always opening their hands and doors to a foreigner, but I would like to imagine that, perhaps, in more rural areas, people in general are generally more sincere, friendly and generally don't get hurt. in rat race to trample others or be trampled. <br /> <br /> If there is a message to be removed from the film, except for the fact that I mentioned that the world is without strangers, reminding myself that some things that I consider important may not apply to others. Importance is what one puts on something else, and its foundation really depends on how we define the boundaries that we set. Therefore, given our limited time of life, I think that I need a little more enlightenment, live and allow to live, and sometimes bask in the illusion that ignorance can be bliss.
