Antonio (Gustavo Falcao) in the village of Nordestina, located in the middle of the desert in Pernambuco, is the youngest son of his mother, who continuously wept for five years. When he is young, he falls in love with Karina (Mariana Simenes), a seventeen-year-old who dreams of seeing the world and becomes an actress. António promises Karina to bring peace to Nordestine, and once in Rio de Janeiro he takes part in a sensational television show and promises to go to the future fifty years ahead or die for love with the death machine he invented. Fifty years later, António (Paulo Autran) is trying to correct what was wrong in his journey. <br /> <br /> Makina is one of the best Brazilian films I have seen recently. A refreshing and original story is a poetic and magical fable of love that will certainly interest the most skeptical and tough viewer in a unique novel. The direction is excellent; the script is awesome; cinematography and colors are gorgeous; the cast of Gustavo Falcao, the icon of Paulo Autran and Mariana Ximenes is fantastic, with amazing lines; There are some excellent Brazilian songs in the soundtrack, which emphasize Geraldo Azevedo and Rento Rocha's “Dia Branco”. If this film is distributed abroad, please email me and rent it or buy a DVD because I bet you will like the story that will lead you to tears. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “Máquina ?? O Combustível é o Amor "(" The car - fuel is love ")
