I originally saw this film in Times Square cinema in the late eighties. Who would have thought that this film would create two sequels and this cult would follow. Demons' Night was like most other films that came out at the time. A group of excited teenagers was trapped in some isolated place, and then was killed by one from time to time in various terrible ways. If you think about it, the formula is still used and seems to work, as evidenced by Saw II, which I recently saw. <br /> <br /> I saw Mimi Kincaid at a convention in Fangoria six years ago, and she was so kindhearted! I think that makes her a pretty good actress if she can make a career playing this demon-obsessed woman in all these horror films. Anyway, I'm just this film again on a VHS tape and the film is still holding. First, a little slow, as I remembered when I first saw him, but then he quickly gained momentum. One of the eightieth horror classics and worth a look!
