“Subconscious cruelty” should be one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen. “Salo” and “Cannibal Holocaust” didn’t really bother me, but there’s a strange psychological element in “subconscious cruelty”. This movie captures your subconscious with shocking taboos, surrealistic visual effects and one of the most disturbing films and sound effects. Sometimes repulsive; Yes, but his visual talent can be compared with such directors of Avant Gard as Alejandro Jodorowski, Dario Argento, Dusan MacAveev and David Lynch. Take the most extreme elements of these 4 directors and add graphic violence to the film Luiko Fulci, and you can guess what interests you. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into 4 parts. The first part of the "Ovary Eye" is very short. The narrator tells us about parts of the brain and its functions. Then, a naked woman is cut open in the abdomen and an eyeball is removed. The second part of "The Larvae of Man" is similar to the movie "Eraser", but with incest. This concerns the man’s sexual obsession with his pregnant sister. Where is Frud when you need him? The third part is my favorite. It reminds me of Begotten and James Broughton’s short film 1972 Dreamwood. In this segment, people have sex with the earth. Men drive bloody holes into the ground, girls masturbate with tree branches. The branches bleed when broken. Watch with horror as the man gives the fellatio to the knife sticking out of the woman's vagina. These people really know how to get in touch with nature. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie is the most disturbing, and sometimes it borders on hard pornography. This part of the film made me remember “Holy Mountain,” “Sweet Cinema,” and “Cannibal Holocaust.” I was never bothered again by what I saw. A business man spreads his rows with fish hooks. Fu and oh! Two women urinate on the figure of Christ and continue to eat cannibal him like communion bread, and sodomize him with a tree branch. Poor guy. The last part was so extreme that if I ever watched the movie again, I would have to close my eyes or fast forward a little. Karim Hussien and Mitch Davis are obviously very talented. I think they made this project in the early 20s. Hussein continued to lead Ascension under the influence of Tarkovsky (2002), which is a much better film, and he co-wrote the script for Nacho Serda’s masterpiece after Dark Terror, The Abandoned. "Subconscious cruelty" - a fascinating and disturbing journey; with images that come from the unthinkable realm of the everyday human mind. Well, sort of.
