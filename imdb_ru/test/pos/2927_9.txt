I am telling you, although it’s funny how much curses are in this word, I’m sure that the amount of profanity and curses in it is likely to be up to about 200, because of what I heard last time, the largest number of curses for an episode with a southern park - this is 165 counts of the word s ** t, but other than that it is so funny because it contains obscene words and also pedophiles who shoot themselves in the head. Look at this for your own survival, also pay attention to the mention of the cartman’s father, as well as the annoying voice of Chris Hänsseyen, and Kyle must save the cartman from pedophiles (the predator’s catch is also on the time line), and they track down the peado, and when they get there, peado "shot himself"
