While this is no closer to Tarzan Edgar Rice Burroughs than, say, Johnny Vismüller’s clicks, he has his own special, and interesting, bias in history. This is a well-made film by Tarzan. Good landscapes, good photography, performance and a shout of Tarzan, repeating the one that Burroughs described. The players all perform well. I think the only bad moments were related. It moves slowly in some places. Is it a slow move? Makes this picture a long time. This could easily be 15–20 minutes shorter, which I think would help with the natural flow of the storyline and character development. But the rest of the film works well enough to transfer it to these two uneven places and still leave the audience happy with a click. A short version of the above ... This is a very good Tarzan movie.
