The 80s are largely considered the decade in which the horror decided to have fun. Sometimes there were certain brains behind all this (for example, Evil Dead II, Night of Creeps, and Return of the Living Dead), and then there were films that were thoughtless but had a certain charm for low rents. and were perfect for a night out with beer and friends. Movies such as "Pieces" and "Blood Diner", in the 80s and 90s, rented shelves for hire, offering little intellectual or skillful skill, but a lot of entertainment. The 1988 film “Night of the Demons” by Kevin Tenney is part of this tradition - stupid, not working well and not the original bone in his body, but damn it if you are not having a good time. <br /> <br /> The plot is so simplistic that it just had to come from the 80s: a group of stupid teens, played by a group of actors from the middle to the end of the 20s, decide to go to a party in the House of Hull Angela (Mimi Kincaid) and Suzanne the Legend of the Queen of Cries, Linnae Quigley.) Well, Angela and Co. decided to quit session. It turns out that this is what Will Arnett’s character “Arrested Development”, “Huge Mistake” would call him, because demonic power soon seizes Angela and begins to strive for others. <br /> <br /> Take The Evil Dead, The Nightmare On Elm Street and your average dull teen movie, throw them into a blender, and Demons' Night is what you get. The film is not original, and indeed, it is not a very good film. All this is an insanely derivative, acting is terrible, jokes are often ineffectual, characters are annoying (especially the character Rough), and plot holes are numerous. It's out of the way, it's still very fun. So why? <br /> <br /> Well, firstly, the effects of makeup and baking at the highest level, with some really memorable moments (especially unpleasant and just a strange piece with a tube of lipstick) that really stick out. He also rarely, if ever, takes himself too seriously, but, with the exception of some terrible puns, he plays directly and never spends the time of the audience on waking self-awareness. Plus, there is a certain energy and enthusiasm for the entire enterprise, against which it is almost impossible to resist. Yes, this is nothing special, but he knows it and can no longer be proud of this fact. This is a goofy horror movie for parties, and it never pretends to be anything big. <br /> <br /> This may not be a classic, but “Night of the Demons” is a good example of terrible junk food cooked properly. It may not be too memorable or original, but sometimes you do not want a beautiful beer. Sometimes you want a Budweiser.
