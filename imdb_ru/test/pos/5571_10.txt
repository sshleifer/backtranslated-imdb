I admit that the first time I managed to catch Sci-Fi "Sci-Fi Prime" last week, but despite the fact that I was a big fan of Sliders, the Farscape experience has now easily become my favorite of the four shows. <br /> <br /> Unlike most modern science fiction shows (including, unfortunately, two new Star Trek series), this show can be fun, not being the food for MST3K.
