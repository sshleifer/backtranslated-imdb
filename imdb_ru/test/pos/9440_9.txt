Rose and the good Doctor find themselves on a space station that is on a planet that is completely impossible to soar in orbit right under a black hole. The stationâ€™s crew is as baffled as the two new residents. Quite similar to the ghost in its atmosphere, and it gets better, because the Doctor and Rose find themselves in a quandary because of the uncontrollable circumstances and speak through the submissive alien race Ood, something quite dark emanates from the crust of the earth. I did not see the second part of this two-part, I can not vouch that the end is just as strong. But this is really for one hellish start. <br /> <br /> My rating: A
