Nominated for the best documentary role at the 2004 Academy Awards, My Architect follows director Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to learn about his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lu Kahn died in 1974 when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited amount of work, unpaid debts and three separate families living a few kilometers from each other. <br /> <br /> My architect monitors Kahn’s life, chronologically inspecting his buildings and mixing their beauty with the history of a charismatic, but selfish and emotionally immature genius. As a son that Lou never publicly acknowledged during his lifetime, Neith delicately placed himself in history without interrupting the main focus. <br /> <br /> Investigating the glorious Salk Institute in California, Neith recalls the father’s mythical use of space and light in his buildings, making it a peaceful and entertaining exercise for viewers. The shot of Nate on the rollers in the smoky white central meeting place of Salk emphasizes the harmony of the building with nature. It is breathtaking. My Architect also talks about the difficulties that Louis Kahn faced with accepting his projects. Some fantastic buildings exist only on paper, rejected by more practical architects and developers. Only when Louis Kahn went to the East did his visions be enthusiastically received. In India, where he built the Indian Institute of Management, a former employee calls him a guru. In Bangladesh, where he built the magnificent National Assembly building, citizens consider him the father of democracy. <br /> <br /> Observing my architect is a great way to start or continue the study of architecture and the importance of space. But this is the irony of Lu Kahn's egoism combined with the transcendence of his work that will inspire you. 4 stars.
