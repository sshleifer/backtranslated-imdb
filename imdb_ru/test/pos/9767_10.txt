I remember how eagerly I watched this series and was very disappointed when it came to an end. Over the years, I tried to find out if I could get a copy of it on video or d.v.d., but to no avail. Nevertheless, I was glad to find this website with detailed information about it, only to be disappointed again at the time of purchase, that the available videos will not be played on English recorders! This production was so wonderful, it was absolutely accurate with the novel by Neville the Jester, telling the storyline after the war, followed by the joint life of Joe and Jean - absolutely amazing - and I just wanted to see it again, since this is an original program in British there was no repetition of television.
