As a local performer, I thought that “Grease” demonstrated what Broadway producers are looking for, and this highlighted a few acting populations. Although my favorites did not win (but ranked second), I liked to compare myself with them and see what I liked, and where I could improve as a performer. <br /> <br /> They brought Olivia Newton-John because she is the obvious link between the Broadway production and the television audience. <br /> <br /> They sang songs from the film (“Hopelessly Devotee”, etc.), because these songs will be included in the new production. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous comment that the cast of B'Way looks much older, but you have to keep in mind that these are people who were on Broadway and worked out their tails to be there. If the whole cast were green and fresh, then I believe that this would jeopardize the casting process, through which the producers chose their talent.
