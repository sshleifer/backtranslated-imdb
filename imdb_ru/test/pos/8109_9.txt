... this film was made when Hitler (and Mussolini, who was also in the film) was at the top, and many politicians and even the Roman church usually turned a blind eye to the cruelty and evil of Nazism. Especially in the USA there were many people who did not understand what was actually happening in Germany and Europe (for example, Charles Lindenberg). It would be like today a big actor would make a parody of Berlusconi or Chirac. Chaplin may have made many mistakes in his life, but this is truly a masterpiece of humanity and IMHO is an excellent demonstration: he was a courageous man. The film is funny and deep, the final speech has terrible power and is still being updated. I think this film is one of the best ever made.
