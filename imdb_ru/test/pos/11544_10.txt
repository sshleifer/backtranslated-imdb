Figures do not lie, 109 people voted for this film. It says a lot about the position of one of the most intuitive insightful comedians of the late 20th century. And for those of you who know the work of Bill Hicks, if he was alive today, imagine what he would say about the boy president from his home state? The fact that his short career remains unrecognized is a sad situation, and this film, more precisely, these two films explain why. First, you see how his talent was obvious from the very beginning, again and again, those who knew Bill Hicks always say that he was not only funny, but also unique. The film also shows how the quality of its material was too complex for many in the entertainment industry. His drink also contributed to his career problems, but this is less obvious in this film. And then the second film is a complete presentation. If you have never seen or heard Bill Hicks, this is a great acquaintance with a man and his dark but clever humor. Especially because the themes are almost 14 years old, but they still remain ironically relevant, which is underscored by the fact that many events took place under the first President Bush. <br /> <br /> Watching them together — first a biography and then a performance — you will find out how talented this young man is, how quickly his life has passed and how the American media can sometimes act as a great homogenizer. Let's make sure that nothing is too provocative, nothing will be too interesting And the result? Well, as the man himself said: go to sleep, America, your government controls ........... During his life, at least in the UK, this artist was known for his talent and achieved success there. 11 years after his death, 109 people in IMDb can say something about the film. After you saw them both, I hope you understand why more and more people should listen to Bill Hicks.
