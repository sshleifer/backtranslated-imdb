This film is about a young Indian guy who once comes home and gets engaged to a woman. The problem is he is gay. To stop the wedding without telling the parents that he is gay, one lie leads to another until she gets out of control. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny and I laughed many times. Sally Banks' game is gorgeous, and she plays this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly. The plot is also outstanding. I find the plot very realistic, and I can completely identify with the feeling that Jimi is scared, excited and upset. On the other hand, the guy Jimi, Jack, in the film receives much less attention. I would like him to be given more lines in the film, and he had more character development. However, as I believe, the director wants to make this film more popular, his love for Jimi and Jack is not shown in the film. <br /> <br /> Nice to watch a fun positive movie. In addition, this film teaches us to accept the differences of other people, be it sexuality, culture or lifestyle. This film makes the viewer think. <br /> <br /> We need such films to give us a boost. Thanks for making this movie!
