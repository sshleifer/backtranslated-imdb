Brilliant movie! I am sorry to say that it reminds me a bit of Pulp F., but this is the post-pulp era. Many images are automatically compared to him, because this is just a gangster movie. But this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters, who are family members, resemble something from Tarantino, which is a good resemblance! <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is about a guy from Australia who gets entangled with a tight criminal gang, and ultimately deeply indebted and deep * S It. He is assisted by his late brother (does anyone remember Val Kilmer in True R.?) To pay off his debts and escape from the gangsters who are on his way. Gangsters are cool, but take the time to play chess and focus on raising your children! They also get tea from their grandmother when planning a bank robbery and have problems with what to do with their children during the robbery. So, a humorous gangster movie with Heath Ledger in good shape (although I'm not a fan) and Brian Brown in great shape as a gang leader.
