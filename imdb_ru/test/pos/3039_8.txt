I believe that this is not only the best film that John Voight has ever made (Midnight Cowboy, Returning Home), but also a real tribute to teachers. <br /> <br /> Despite incredible chances, Pat Conroy (Voight) managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to basic literacy and world awareness. His methods were criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs, such as Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronin), but teachers, such as Conroy, will always be winners. <br /> <br /> Voight really showed that he loves to teach and that it is naturally high for him. he did not play the role, and I discovered that he is absolutely believable. Voight is Konrak. <br /> <br /> In addition to the love of teaching, we also see another important point in this film. No matter how good you are at work, if you rock a boat, bureaucrats will get you.
