The funniest performance was at Shalom Harlow, like supermodel girlfriends Matt Dillon. She was for me more interesting than all the leading actors. In this film, everything is wrong; Even the most reliable actress of the century, Joan Kyuska, could not rise to the absurdity of the plot. I really enjoyed hearing "Macho Man" from the Village People during the closing credits. The rest of the film could have been tolerated if it had risen to this level of energy.
