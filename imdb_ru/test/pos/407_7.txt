Red Skelton plays a radio detective known as The Fox in Whistling in the Dark, also starring Ann Rutherford, Conrad Weidt, Yves Arden, Virgin Gray and Rags Ragland. Wally Benton, aka Fox, believes that his plans to marry his bride Carol (Rutherford) were thwarted when he was abducted by the leader of a fictitious cult (Wade). Joseph Jones (Weidt) just learned that his cult, Silver Harbor, does not receive the promised inheritance due to the existence of an old woman's nephew who is going to live off of interest. He wants Wally to come up with the perfect murder plan, so that he can be killed on the plane to meet his lawyer. For backup, and since he is not sure which of them is Walley's fiancé, Jones kidnaps Carol, as well as the daughter of a radio sponsor (Gray). <br /> <br /> This is, in any case, for me, the best film for the second entry in this series “Whistling in Dixie”. The plot is better, the cast is better, less farce and less trite jokes. Skelton, when he does not make faces and does not roll his eyes, is rather amiable, and Rutherford is very good. Weidt always brought these evil people to perfection. Eva Arden is an agent for Wally, who sets up a date for him and Gray to make sure his contract is extended. I only saw Gray in the films of the 1950s. She was always a beautiful woman, but who knew that she was such a knockout in the 30s and 40s? This is a fun movie with a neat cast.
