In 1895, in a small village in Japan, the wife of the litter Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura), Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) started a love affair with a man, twenty-six years younger than Toidji (Tatsuya Fuji). Toyji begins to be jealous of Gisaburo and plotting to kill him with Seki. They stifle Gisaburo and throw his body into a well in the forest, and Seki tells the locals that Gisaburo has moved to Tokyo for work. Three years later, locals gossip about the fate of Gisaburo, and Seki is haunted by his ghost. Seki and Toyji become unbearable when a police body arrives in the village to investigate the disappearance of Gisaburo. <br /> <br /> “Ay no Borey” is a surreal and supernatural love story. The repentance and guilty complex of Seki make her see the ghost of her murdered husband spoiling the perfect plot of her lover. Cinematography is under threat due to the quality of VHS released in Brazil, but there are very beautiful scenes, including Ringu and the American remake of The Ring, using the inside view from the same angle. The performances and direction are excellent, which makes “Ay No Borey” a great movie. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Império da Paixão" ("Empire of Passion")
