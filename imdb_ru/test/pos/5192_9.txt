I found the film very real, as well as Salvation of Private Ryan and gave a preliminary report from the German point of view. The graphic action and the individual characters gave this film a lot to interest me throughout the film. Stalingrad was a very fierce battle, and the scenes gave this film the vivid reality of this battle. I recommend this for anyone interested in military history. This was my second viewing of this film in several years, and he was again fascinated by his realistic nature. Weapons, uniforms and hearing them in German when reading subtitles helped a lot to get a good war movie. In fact, since it was the German perspective of the battle, I was rooting for the Germans, although they were the aggressor and the ultimate loser in the war.
