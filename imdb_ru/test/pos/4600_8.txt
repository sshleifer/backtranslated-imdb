Let me begin by saying that if you expect subtle humor, you are in the wrong theater. This is a low forehead and strong blow. But he doesn't want to tickle your funny bone. He has a sledgehammer and he drew a bead on your head. But do not be afraid. As the films go, this is a rather mild education. Oh, besides, it's hard to curse, but then again, Mike Judge, not Fred Rogers. <br /> <br /> Was this movie called “Intelligence”? F *** no Pearl, the essence of which lies in the fact that Mike Judge has the ability to make people laugh at themselves. Beavis and Butt-head were the most popular among adolescent boys, the very people whom they constantly made fun of. <br /> <br /> Given this, I do not think that the humor in this film is aimed at the super smart. Maybe you are too smart to get it. But he is not aimed at you. He is targeting your ordinary Joe. And he has a message: get together and for God's sake, study botany! It's a little incoherent, and the narrator begins to annoy a little after a while, but once again, this film is intended for people who need a lot of narration ;-) It's funny. He has a message that he wants to make sure that we all understand. <br /> <br /> I question the role of Luke Wilson in the role of a man with 100 IQ. Sometimes he cannot downplay (what does he have, for example, 104?) To the level of his character. Slightly forced from time to time. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Dax Shepard in this. I remember seeing him in Zatur and thought: “These guys look like an idiot.” In this film, he makes a great idiot. Maybe I'm a psychic. <br /> <br /> It took time to warm up with Maya Rudolph, but I gave her some freedom. In the end, she had to play an honest man on the entire planet. But as soon as she received some screen time, she made a significant contribution. <br /> <br /> Terry Crews played the same psychotic, aggressive character he had played many times before, but he nonetheless makes him a first-class president. <br /> <br /> Another bonus is that the place was almost empty. Except for my girlfriend and me, there were literally six people in the theater. We could have a barbecue pit and a mariachi group. Thus, people who are not annoying say that it is the norm in the “television speaking” era. <br /> <br /> In general, a good premise and competent delivery, given the intended purpose, There was a lot of laughter everywhere. <br /> <br /> What made this movie scary was that when we left the theater, it looked like the movie was still playing. We saw a lot of idiocy in the people who surrounded us, maybe it became more obvious because of the dose we received in the theater ... <br /> <br /> They are all pods, they are all!
