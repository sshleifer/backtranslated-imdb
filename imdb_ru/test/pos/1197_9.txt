Hair is one of my favorite films of all time. Even without being a part of my generation, I have already watched this film 9 times, and I cannot get enough of the wonderful message of understanding, passion, beauty and love. This film is against the Vietnam War and shows how people should be united regardless of color, origin, religion and classes. I like the characters Berger and Vuf, and I think that the Central Park of the 70s is one of the most beautiful places I have seen in my life. <br /> <br /> By the way, I still have this music: <br /> When the Moon is in the Seventh House, And Jupiter aligns with Mars, Then the planets will rule the world, And love will rule the stars. <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of the Age of Aquarius. The Age of Aquarius Aquarius! Aquarius! <br /> <br /> Harmony and understanding. Sympathy and trust abound. No more lies or solutions. Golden living dreams of visions. Mystical Crystal Revelation. Aquarius! <br /> <br /> ps: I am surprised to see that the director of this film is the same director AMADEUS. I just love both movies!
