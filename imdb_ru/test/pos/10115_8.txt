The radio will make you laugh, cry, feel. This story, based on a true story, is the perfect movie for a couple. There is enough for both. Cuba Gooding Jr. portrays the title character to perfection. His performance is worthy of a nomination for an Academy Award. The sympathy of the film is obvious. The film causes a lot of emotion. I genuinely liked this movie.
