“The boy next door” is a fun prank from male neurosis. In just fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that cannot compare with most feature films. Excellent performance, great camera work and editing — this short classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis for his double duty as a director and star. He is the funniest fool ever since Woody Allen. And what a pleasure to see Richard Mall again. If you thought that all he could do was play the bailiff's Bull at the Night Trial, think again. This gem of the film shows brilliantly funny essay by Stephen Garvey. Remember this name. Forget about Charlie Kaufman, Steve Garvey is the real king of an unusual comedy.
