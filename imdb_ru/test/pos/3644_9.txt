Pretty decent for his early work and without Kokaku Kidotai without him, and gets 2 extra points for Easter eggs. For Shirou, definitely a stair on the stairs. I am inclined as a fan of Shirou, but it was a big step from the Dirty Couple, which was what I knew about him. Violent fun with porn soundtrack! You can not miss it. I know that people appreciate him for the Ghost in the Shell ... but all the deep spiritual overtones were examined in Appleseed. ESWAT is killing terrorists, fighting for people to remain viable, as bioroids disable them, and Deunan remains thin, despite the fact that she gets junk food. They definitely like the characters even a traitor ... and I don't know why.
