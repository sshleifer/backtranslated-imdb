I have loved this film since childhood. I remember the night when my mom brought me this film home. I loved it, and I still do. I think it is very funny and original. There are also some very memorable melodies in this movie. Lou is also an amazingly good singer. The actors who portray Prince Arthur and Princess Eloise are also fine, but Abbott and Costello are the best. Former heavyweight title sensation Buddy Baer, ​​also brother of former heavyweight champion Max Baer, ​​is good in this film as a cop and giant. He is a better actor than a boxer. He had a natural talent. The beginning of this film is funny, as Lou Costello continues to crash the car and how he gets in trouble with Buddy Baer. The farce in the house is also good. I especially like the comedy in the castle of the Giant. My favorite parts; the part where Lou rises to the beanstalk, and they all sing like a farewell. Jack sings to them in return that he will return. Lou Costello sings very well. My other favorite part is when Jack fights the Giant. I like it when Jack makes explosive eggs, and when he tries to make the Giant an omelet, they keep exploding. Abbott and Costello are the funniest and greatest comedians of all time. This is just one of their great films that I will love and cherish. The reviews for this film are not very good, and I cannot understand why. This is a very good movie by Abbott and Costello. I also like the way Lou Costello returns to reality and thinks he came back in a dream when Bud hit him. He begins to sing his song and leaves with such an attitude that no one is going to push me. A very good movie.
