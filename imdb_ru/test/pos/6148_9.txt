An example of brilliant filmmaking. The epic story of the three main stages of a young boy's life is told with eloquence and crude fearlessness. Rarely does a movie appear that makes me say out loud during most of the viewing: “This is a really good movie ...” again and again. That is exactly what happened when I watched this movie. I really do not understand how anyone did not like it. In moments when I cried and laughed, I could not control my feelings for the stage. The game is outstanding. Eric Mabius - why is he not on all screens of films? He was really unusual. His seemingly easy on-screen attempt influenced me deeply intuitively. I thank him. In my opinion, Eric Schaeffer is one of the best filmmakers in the world, and I hope that he continues to solve his tasks, trying to give us art in the face of fierce commercial filmmaking. <br /> <br />
