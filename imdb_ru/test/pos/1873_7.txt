Cult icon Bruce Campbell took years to launch this project from scratch - but he finally realized that he was here - and what a great entertainment it is! Looking at the plot; It sounds like two things. A great basis for a very stupid B-movie, and a shameless excuse for Bruce Campbell for what he does best - a playful sense of humor in the style of Evil Dead II, and this film justifies both sides. “The Man with the Screaming Brain” is nonsense of comics, but there are really wonderful scenes, and it’s almost impossible to miss this movie. Bruce Campbell wrote, directed, and produced in this film - and although it’s not quite Citizen Kane, I must say that this is an achievement for a man best known for fighting with his own hand in a forest hut. The plot follows the American businessman William Cole on a business trip to Bulgaria with his girlfriend. However, the trip goes awry when he, his girlfriend and his taxi driver are killed; thanks to the same woman. Mad scientist Stacy Keach is on hand to unify Cole and the taxi driver's brains into one; and we have a cult click on our hands. <br /> <br /> The first half hour or so is interesting and causes some laughter; but as soon as the main point of the plot was completed; the film really picks up. Bruce makes the best use of the script in all silly situations: from dressing up in a garbage can to solving (with a taxi driver in the brain) what is in a restaurant. Humor basically refers to a variety of farce, and anyone who enjoys Evil Dead II (it should be anyone who saw it) will surely enjoy it too. It seems that Campbell is playing too hard with the whole project, but if you tune in and not see Bruce, who does what he does best, disappointment will follow. In addition, there is no disrespect for the person; but he was never the biggest actor. Although it was a lot of fun; the film is not great, because sometimes it gets too stupid; and there is a whole story with a robot that I didn’t like; but in general, “The Man with the Screaming Brain” is a film that, unfortunately, we do not see too much these days. The film is a total, without rules, B-film; and it deserves respect if nothing else.
