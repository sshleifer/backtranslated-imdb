I love this film. is it more on the air? What can I do to air it again, because I miss this movie when this movie is on the air again? I really love this movie. Does anyone know how much time has passed since it was last time at Disney? It was a very, very long time, and I was so tired of waiting! I want to see Susie Q again. I swear, they shoot all the good movies from the air and play the new stupid gay, which are fake and backward. I miss this movie, I want to see a star, Kazaam with Shaquille O'Neill and a lot more. Where are all the good movies? I want to return them. I miss all the good movies and they donâ€™t have them anymore. if anyone finds out if Susie Q or some good old Disney movie will come out, please let me know, my email is girlygirl148@aol.com girlygirl (no spaces) 148. thanks and I hope you want to return this film too. have a nice day
