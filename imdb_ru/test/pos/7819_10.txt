I liked this movie, it was cute and funny! Lauren Holly was wonderful, funny and very believable in her role. Kostas Mandilan was also very good, it is also a pleasure to watch him !! Brenda Vaccaro, as usual, was a pleasure to watch, she did a great job with her character. It was very nice to watch a movie that is funny, interesting and the whole family can watch. It's hard to find good useful movies anymore. Thank God for the distinctive films, they are wonderful! I would like to buy it, if anyone knows where I can buy this film, please let me know! I bought several Hallmark films and am very pleased with them. I hope I can buy this one !!
