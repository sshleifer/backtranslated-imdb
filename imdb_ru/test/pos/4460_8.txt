DO NOT ATTEMPT WITH THE DUCK (Lucio Fulci, Italy, 1972). <br /> <br /> Of course, the main candidate for the title of the craziest movie ever thought, and this is a real achievement in the world of galillo. Initially, the film was even more ridiculously titled, “Don't Try Donald Duck,” literally translated from its Italian title. The small figure of Donald Duck is depicted for a short time as a toy, but hardly enough to reproduce such a title, but apparently it was changed because of the fear of legal consequences from Disney. I was a little protesting against the earlier "Lizard in the skin of a woman" Fulchi (1971), but here are all the right ingredients. Surprisingly spectacular mystery, successful cast and creative approach to the unusual countryside. Everything just clicks. I think this is rightly proclaimed one of the most outstanding achievements of the director. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds against the background of a small mountain town in Sicily, where someone kills young teenage boys. Among the suspects, the most obvious is a young woman, Makiara (Florinda Balkan), a self-proclaimed witch, who is seen with suspicion by digging up the child’s skeleton and inserting pins into the stuffed animal. Giseppe, the village idiot, is also under suspicion because he made a weak attempt to take advantage of the disappearance of one of the boys and went straight into their trap. By the time the smart newcomer (Thomas Milian) arrives from Milan to cover up the killings, he immediately begins to question the authorities' assumptions when he meets two other potential suspects: Don Alberto, the local priest (Mark Porla) with an arrogant attitude, and Patricia ( Barbara Boucher), a bored young woman from a city with a troubled past drug-related crime who also loves having sex with young boys in the city. Talk about your pristine red herring. <br /> <br /> Fulci contrasts beautifully with modernity and tradition thanks to the recently built elevated road that leads along the Sicilian hills, past the old cities, where life is still firmly rooted in tradition and superstition. You can argue about the political position of the film “North vs. South” or as a commentary on the virtues of a small town — social conventions in general — which too often dangerously approach moral decay, chaos, and — ultimately — to yourself. justice from the public. The film has often been criticized for its anti-Catholic tone, but it is hardly an important element here, with the exception of obvious plot-related reasons that distribute too much. This is actually quite boring compared to the film, as in Joel Serian’s film DO NOT SUPPLY US FROM EVIL (1971). Probably a rather unflattering picture of a film about the Sicilian values ​​of a small town. may be the cause of insults in Sicily, but - given the problematic relations of Sicily with the rest of Italy - it is hardly problematic for other Italians, I think. The film turned into obscurity too quickly to have a big impact anyway. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Fulci, the amount of blood is usually the main topic of discussion. Despite the fact that there are not enough scenes that catch the eye, the film contains two very graphic scenes. In the final final, the killer falls off a cliff, smashing his face against the rocks on the way down with terrible results (though not very realistic ones). And the sequence of chain beats with Florinda Balkan in the cemetery shows Fulci’s inclination to sadistic violence and, as a rule, he does not hold back a graphic representation of what most filmmakers simply hint at. Of course, one of the most horrific scenes in the repertoire of Fulci. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a tight, well-written, effective little puzzle, beautifully filmed by Fulci, with an impressive mix of standing genres such as Barbara Boucher, Mark Poril (not very convincing as a priest), Thomas Milian and Florinda Balkan (crazy as a city witch). <br /> <br /> Camera obscura --- 8/10
