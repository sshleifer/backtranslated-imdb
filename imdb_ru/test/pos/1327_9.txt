I heard that after the first Oceans film, the prequels begin to descend. I believe that this is not the case (at least not for this film). This movie is even better than the first movie! The original team returns three years after they successfully robbed Terry Benedictâ€™s casino. Now Benedict visits each of them, personally saying that they will return the money within two weeks. To do this, they must do a couple of robberies in Europe in order to get money. <br /> <br /> The game is very good. Star composition exceeded all expectations. Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones were probably the best in this film. <br /> <br /> There are some confusing moments in this movie. But it does not matter, because there are only a few confusing moments. Be that as it may, this film was created just for innocent fun. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great robber movie. I rate this movie 9/10.
