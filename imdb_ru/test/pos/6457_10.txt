I first saw this movie on cable in the 80s, and it struck me deeply. He reappeared on television about six months ago. <br /> <br /> Black-and-white cinema, shot on the spot, graphically depicts New York in the 1950s as the sandy “urban jungle” at a time when there was much more industry and port activity in the city, especially in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes has always given particular intensity to his game and is great as an army deviator. His short series “Johnny Staccato” of 1959 is also a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Sydney Poitier and (later in the film) Ruby Dee bring freshness and vitality to their roles. But this is an excellent performance by Jack Worden as an evil, brutal shift supervisor who caught my attention. To get an idea of ​​Warden's versatility, watch this movie, and then watch an episode from the 1962 television series Naked City entitled Ghost of the Gang on Pink Street (available on video). If you are a fan of film noir, this is a must see. Enjoy!
