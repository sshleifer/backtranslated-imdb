I really liked the North and the South. I think this is one of the best and most gorgeous TV shows I have ever seen. The casting caliber is awesome, you have actors from the golden age of cinema, people like James Stewart, Gene Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Gene Simmons with other actors from the 1980s like Patrick Swayze James Reed, Jonathan Frakes, Jean Francis, Philip Kaznoff and Lesley-Ann Down. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the story is the friendship of two completely different men, there is Orrie Maine (Patrick Swayze), who is from the south and George Hazard (James Reed), who is from the north. Throughout the series, their friendship is constantly threatened by differences in their origins, especially with regard to the treatment of slaves in the south (especially at Orri Plantation), but when each of them needs another, they will forget the arguments and go and help their friend. I really liked the chemistry between the two men, and it was very interesting to see if their friendship could survive the war. <br /> <br /> I liked how the series showed what life was like before the war, so that viewers could see that there were factors that led to the war, what was happening at the time, then the destruction of the nation that was torn apart apart, and then the nation, had to rebuild the country again. The scenes of the war were very well set and very realistic for me. <br /> <br /> I think that in this good is the fact that there are so many elements in it, romance, history, battles that may be of interest to the majority of the audience, there is something for everyone. I especially liked the romance between Brett (Gene Francis) and Billie (Parker Stevenson / John Stockwell), especially when she first confronted her sister Ashton. Other novels were interesting because they were not the same, each had something different from the others, which made me look especially the storyline Madeline and Orry to see if they would end up together. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best American mini-series Iâ€™ve watched, the story had the right balance of romance and a more serious historical side that was happening in the country at the time, but it was developing just right. The characters are very watchable, and the locations are beautiful, and the music, especially at the beginning and at the end of the episode, is so good and works with the mood of the story.
