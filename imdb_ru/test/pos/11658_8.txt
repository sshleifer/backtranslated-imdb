I read a book before watching a movie, and the film is one of the best adaptations. Very true and true to the book. Sean Penn and Sarandon are awesome. Robbins is a talented director, and I would like him to add more to his repertoire. He made the film very intrusive and deliberately slow to add depth. A particularly bright moment of filming was a reflection of the victims who appeared in the glass of the execution room at the very end.
