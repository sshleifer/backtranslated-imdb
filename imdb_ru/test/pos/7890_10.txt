I voted just fine because this film made two shots of Americana: one in 1970 and once a year. <br /> <br /> Nothing really changed. <br /> <br /> Joe is actually a jerk, a big, stupid bibling who is angry at everyone in the world because of his idiocy. This is not really a spoiler, but the key to the film is that the big corporate guy "never makes a mistake" made friends with this semi-troglodyte Joe, and he gets some kind of ... test from his bigotry, stupidity and resentment. <br /> <br /> However, few would argue that the merchant guy really deserves to be killed. And these children should not have ripped off Joe and Compton. Both Joe and Compton actually stuck into the hash and young skin, until they were ripped off. A simple film in many ways, except that in 1970, New York was on par with the battle zone thanks to Nixon care, and all the money went to the Vietnam War. When I write this (02/25/2007), Netflix has a “very long wait” for this film - which makes me happy because I think there are people who want to learn. It was a pretty good shot — not an exact, a bit of a cartoonist — but actually quite close to how it was then. And the terrible thing - things have not changed much. Of course, wealth is no more, but it means that the slavery of wage labor has triumphed. <br /> <br /> It’s amazing how millionaires complain that they don’t make enough money and then complain that $ 5.15 an hour is too much to pay their people.
