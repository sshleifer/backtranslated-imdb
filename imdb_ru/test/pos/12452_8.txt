Although the films about Edgar Rice Burroughs, the famous Russian hero Tarzane, have been watched by filmmakers for almost a hundred years, this is the final version of the story. Greystoke is the real story of the origin of Tarzan, set out by Edgar Rice Burrows in the second decade of the last century. I was assured by the experts. <br /> <br /> Tarzan and Sherlock Holmes are perhaps the most filmed fictional characters in history. I have no reason to say this, just an intuitive feeling. The most popular Holmes was Basil Rathbone, the most popular Tarzan was Johnny Weissmuller. And the films they have made with both of these characters will be endlessly criticized by purists. <br /> <br /> But Greystock is a real deal, an exact adaptation of Burroughsâ€™s first story about the origin of his hero. I can't remember another film that shows that Tarzan learned French before English, but this is shown here, and this is natural, since it was a French survivor of a mass safari performed by Ian Holm, who discovered Tarzan, who was raised by monkeys how his shipwrecked parents on the African coast died there after his mother had given birth. <br /> <br /> His parents were actually the son and daughter-in-law of Count Greystock and the surviving earl, played by Ralph Richardson, of course, I am very glad to know that he has a grandson. Of course, there are others who do not welcome the new heir in society. <br /> <br /> Andy McDowell plays, of course, Jane. She does not communicate with Tarzan in response to his grumbling and monosyllabic commands. Tarzan speaks concisely in English, French and understands the language of monkeys. As for the language of love, Tarzan and Jane do not need lessons. <br /> <br /> Graystock received three Oscar nominations for Best Monkey Makeup, Best Adapted Scenario, and a posthumous nomination for Ralph Richardson for Best Supporting Actor. He also had to evaluate a nomination for cinematography of jungle scenes in Cameroon and scenes of the British aristocracy in several iconic places, such as the Hatfield House and the Blenheim Palace. <br /> <br /> Burroughs Greystock purist is a real bargain
