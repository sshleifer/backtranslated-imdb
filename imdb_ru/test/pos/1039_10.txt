... the dream of a real girl fan: high technology, high drama, smart guys, full sex and big explosions. (VERY big explosions.) Sam Waterston is so natural in the role of Oppenheimer that the recordings of REAL Oppenheimer sound strange: obviously, he had a voice similar to Ronald Reagan! Oppenheimer's triumph and tragedy is one of the most exciting dramas of the 20th century, and this film serves as a model of what documentary drama should be: the facts make it possible to speak for themselves, and the fictional parts are used to enhance and complete the record so as not to attract Attention. An interesting fact: some technical details have just been declassified, and therefore are of particular interest. Must see!
