You can find an anti-war statement here without looking too hard; this layer is beaten. Or you can find a cost-neutral comment about the madness of war (devoid of “judgment”); this layer is completely uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Or you can watch this for the damn good entertainment value of one-lined Duvall, but this is just a cover for commercial chewing. <br /> <br /> You can try to look at it as a “realistic” film about the Vietnam War, but ask any veteran, and he will refute this opinion - most veterinarians will say that he stinks. <br /> <br /> Or consider him as or he will not play morality - there’s nothing rich there either. <br /> <br /> Where I found value is in excellent self-reference. Coppola needed a container with a sufficiently large size (war) to match the greatness of a skilled multidimensional actor playing the "great man." <br /> <br /> Brando, the man, was as individualistic as the Kurtz character. Studios was uncomfortable because of his acting “method”, but he always excelled and received honors; The “generals” do not like Kurtz’s “unhealthy methods,” despite his strategic genius. <br /> <br /> So Coppola makes a film about Brando's greatness. In order to give a thought, he puts himself in a movie (like Hopper, a manic photojournalist loaded with several cameras) to give his praises. Brando himself is visible only in half-light and silhouettes - the brilliant cinematography of Storaro, which only increases the strength of the actor. And he goes, like a sacrificial bull, to complete the narrative equation. Oh, yes: "horror ..." <br /> <br /> Other interesting things: a lot of use of perspective camera views, including "participation in a shootout" long before "Private Ryan"; innovative use of sound, especially the ominous flanging and sound image of the acid shut off. <br /> <br /> Do not fall into the outer layers; The rich part that you have to get rid of is the brilliant core of sound, vision and self-reference.
