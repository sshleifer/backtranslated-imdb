“Love is a multifaceted thing,” which unfolds in Hong Kong in 1949–50, and tells the story of the relationship between white American journalist Mark Elliott and Han Suyin, half of a Chinese European doctor. This story of mixed racial love was a pretty bold topic for the fifties, and, as it often happened, Hollywood tried to soften the blow by choosing a white actress as a supposedly non-Caucasian woman who falls in love with a white man, which today would be considered politically incorrect at that time, it was quite acceptable (recall, for example, the role of Ava Gardner in Show Boat or Natalie Wood in West Side Story). in the British colony there was also, perhaps, a way to study racial problems in ways that caused less controversy in America. Suyin loses his job in a Hong Kong hospital because her British authorities object to the fact that she is dating a white man whom she cannot marry because his ex-wife will not give him a divorce. As it was sometimes, European colonialism became a whipping boy for some of America’s flaws. Imagine the sensation that would be unleashed if such a film were made about a female doctor of a black or mixed race in an Alabama hospital. <br /> <br /> In addition to racial issues, the film also raises questions of international politics, meaning both the seizure of power by the Communists in China and the beginning of the Korean War. Han Suyin was a real person and famous author of the time; in fact, she tended to support Mao's communist regime, but here she manifested herself as an anti-communist. This, however, is not primarily a “problem” film about racism or politics, but rather a novel, a good example of what was known as the “female picture” at the time. Such films, although mostly made by male directors, were mainly targeted at a female audience. They dealt with love and romance - often unhappy romance - from the perspective of a woman, and in the main role they had a strong female character. The genre often gave the role of actresses older heroes of standard romances. Earlier examples were usually monochrome, but by the fifties, they, like here, usually used lush, luxurious color. <br /> <br /> Although a Chinese or Eurasian actress would be more convincing in this role, Jennifer Jones does a very good job, like Suyin. I found William Holden, like Mark, quite charismatic, but that doesn’t matter much, since Suyin is a very dominant figure. She is on the screen much more than Mark, and the film explores her family and professional life much more than his. Although Jennifer was still strikingly beautiful, she was in her early thirties, she was older than most of the romantic characters in films from this period. Holden was about the same age, unusual for the fifties, when "a boy meets a girl" often meant "an older man meets a girl." <br /> <br /> The film is not very deep, but it is well-made with some attractive photography, especially Hong Kong itself, reflecting the growing tendency in the 50s to take pictures on the spot, rather than in studio shooting. Rarely can Hong Kong look so beautiful; The view from the hill overlooking the city is of particular importance, since it is here that Suyin and Mark are sent on romantic assignments. The general mood consists of a sharp, doomed novel, a mood elevated by atmospheric photography and musical accompaniment, including one of the most memorable themes from films ever written. 7/10
