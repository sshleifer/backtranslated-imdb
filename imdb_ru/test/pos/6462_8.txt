1957 Edge of the City, directed by Martin Ritt, stars of John Cassavetes, Sidney Poitier, Jack Warden and Ruby Dee. This is the story of a restless man, Axl, who has a mysterious past that gradually emerges during the film. He has a connection that makes him work in the loading dock, working for Charlie (Jack Worden), a real villain who gets kickbacks from his workers and rolls them hard. Charlie has a strong dislike for the black, TT (Poitiers), who holds the same position. T.T. invites Axel to work in his team; Axel challenges Charlie and does it. Axel finds housing and communicates with TT, his wife (Dee) and their son's white school teacher (Kathleen McGwire). When tragedy happens, none of the people on the loading dock will talk to the police, and Axel must recognize his values, what he stands for, and the meaning of friendship. <br /> <br /> This is really an excellent black and white film, which, oddly enough, is not about being black or white! It is actually about the boundaries that a person puts in front of him and knows who you are. Charlie is a fanatic and hates the fact that a black man has a good position on the dock. T. teases Charlie and gives as much as he gets. There is no talk about having TT. and Axel spent time together or that son T.T. there is a white teacher with whom the family also communicates. The fact that Axel, alone, is difficult - to accept any friendship or to trust someone - he learns these things through TT <br /> <br /> Poitiers absolutely shines in “The Edge of the City” - he is warm, energetic, loving and intelligent, a person with real enthusiasm for life, not afraid of anything. Cassavetis is great and plays the very opposite character - hiding in the shadows, chronically depressed and always nervous. <br /> <br /> The film leaves open to what is happening with Axel. Whatever it is, he is now a different person. <br /> <br /> A strangely underestimated and unknown film, perhaps in the shadow of the many films about evil young people who came out in that era.
