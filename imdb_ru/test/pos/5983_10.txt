In Belarus in 1942, two Soviet soldiers were captured by the Belarusians friendly to the Nazis. In captivity, the attitude of two men to their fate is very different. One of the soldiers manages to gain inner strength and spirituality, incomprehensible to another person. Larissa Shepitko's latest film is one of the most beautiful military films in the history of cinema. Vladimir Chuchnov’s cinematography is incredible — especially in the opening sequence, where long, slow, traced footage depicting the loneliness and almost desperate nature of the winter landscape in the countryside of Belarus ideally create a mood. Comparison with Tarkovsky's films is easy to carry out, especially since Tarkovsky’s alter-ego Anatoly Solonitsyn plays a small but important role in Ascension. The game as a whole is brilliant, especially Boris Plotnikov, in the role of Sotnikov. The film reveals the old-fashioned faith in the power of religious passion, which is associated with such characters as Prince Dostoevsky Myshkin or the pursuer of Tarkovsky. However, this is not a weakness of the film, but one of its strengths. Religious content seems so honest and human that it is impossible not to move. The emotional richness of the film can not be overemphasized; the answer is not as simple as a short summary of the plot makes you think. The slow development of the characters and the emphasis on their complex relationship with each other is somewhat reminiscent of the "Commissioner", another great Soviet film. The ascent deserves a second observation, as well as a third and tenth. He continues to offer interesting ideas, beautiful images and emotional complexity.
