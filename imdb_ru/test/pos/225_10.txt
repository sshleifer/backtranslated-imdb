I watched this show after seeing the Naked Gun movies. I found it a lot better than movies, and I thought the movies were great! This series literally sticks you to the TV in anticipation of the next pun, spectacle, or funny situation (nightclub, flamingo club). I don't think I've ever laughed at a TV show in my life, even after watching movies for the first time and, thus, recognized some jokes. I think it is a shame that only six episodes were produced, but I agree that it will be very difficult for authors to maintain this level of comedy for any other episodes. In general, the series is mandatory for those who love puns, bad jokes and fun.
