This film is a masterpiece. It was exciting from start to finish. The story of writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson about a porn star is told with style, grace, humor, even sharpness. The actors and characters they play are first-class, including Mark Wahlberg in the title role, who proves that he is a good actor and can make a film. Burt Reynolds is probably the best performer of the director who has ever recognized Wahlberg. The film recreates the end of the 70s and the beginning of the 80s with the utmost precision, from the disco scene with which the film begins, to Valberg Don Johnson's “Miami Vice” costume, which he wears in the final scene. Most ordinary moviegoers who see this film, without a doubt, compare it to PULP FICTION, but in fact it has much more in common with the films of Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese. The film is a triumph in style. The first track from which the film begins is just as impressive as in “GAME” and “ABSOLUTE BEGINNINGS”. Editing by Dylan Tichenor is simply phenomenal. I could not believe that the editors did not receive an Oscar nomination (GOOD WILL HUNTING was the best edited film?!). The best scene in the film should be with fireworks. I had butterflies in my stomach, because the scene is incredibly intense. When I saw the movie a second time, I had exactly the same reaction to the scene. Unfortunately, this may not have the same effect on television as in a theater with good stereo sound. It is a pity that many people did not see this film during his theatrical performance, because it is the best way to watch it. Anderson's widescreen use will suffer on television (so take a DVD or tape for mailboxes). It's amazing how easy Anderson makes it all look, because it's just his second movie. Music, scenery, costumes, photography, unusual characters, sex, violence, happiness, and broken hearts are depicted by a guy who is clearly in love with filmmaking.
