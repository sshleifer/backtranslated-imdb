If you were to ask me to choose the best movie ever made, this movie would be on the short list with 1951 Streetcar Named Desire. I believe that I will find a few more suitable ones, but Kramer vs. Kramer is an outstanding exercise in naturalism. So this is a very pleasant experience at this level: just watch the amazing, trial performances of Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and Justin Henry's baby in particular. One of the best children's performances in history. <br /> <br /> But I am also very pleased to see, because this is such an exciting story - it always makes me forget about my problems. He has such an excellent narrative drive. As soon as you glue Cramer to Cramer, and Alice Kramer leaves Ted to juggle her work and their little son, telling him nothing but the fact that she has to open herself â€” you keep watching to know that everything is all right. And even if you know how everything happens, every moment of the trip sounds so brilliant that it is a joy to watch it happen again and again. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake - Kramer vs. Kramer is not an easy game: a very realistic depiction of the consequences of a divorce for all participants. <br /> <br /> 10/10. <br /> <br /> For one of the best scenarios (created on the basis of conversations between Benton and Hoffman, who was going through a divorce at that time), he ever wrote, executed, and executed beautifully and flawlessly. Not to mention what a fascinating story it is. Simply put, a perfect movie.
