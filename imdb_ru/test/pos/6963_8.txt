The beautiful but deadly Alexandra (the amazing stately blonde beauty Stacy Randall, who looks completely broken in a tight-fitting black leather suit) must find the magic amulet so that her evil demonic master Faust can go into our dimension. It is up to the fearless, rude policeman Jonathan Graves (handsome Peter Liapis) to stop her. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, two pitifully unfunny “comic reliefs” of gnome-gnomes are raging. Experienced veteran expert on the operation of shlok, Jim Vinorsky, talks about an extremely senseless story at a fast pace and does not take any of these nonsense seriously. The actors fight playfully with stupid stuff: charming Barbara Eline Woods as an impudent person, addicted to police captain Kate, Raquel Krelle as a cake, sexual prostitute Janine, Bobby Di Chicco as an awkward, excited partner of Graves Scotty, Peggy Trentini as an enchanting teacher. and Ace Mask as the merry doctor Rochelle. Children's script for cutting cookie Mark Stevi, a funny little sense of humor, Chuck Sirino's cheerful Cornball, two dwarf guys wearing obvious cheap rubber masks on Halloween, simple cinematography by J. E. Bash, lack of tension or useless female nudity that you can talk about and tasteless (less than) special effects further enhance the overall delightful lightness of this primary piece of celluloid Velveeta. Entertaining brainless piece of an attractive lousy woods.
