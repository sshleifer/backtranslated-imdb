This film is just one of the best films I have. It took me years to come up with this film, and it was worth it. The film is intended to promote the drug, but turns into the opposite, although not halfway through the film. A biased look at the faces of players who receive a drug reward makes everyone who watches happy. Until the final phase of their drug-induced life, heroin comes to the rescue. YIKES! This is an anti-drug message, which is so incredibly sought. The soundtrack for the film is stunning! Today it is one of the best Pink Floyds albums ever! If there is a chance, look, listen, and a moment to witness a spectacularly made film.
