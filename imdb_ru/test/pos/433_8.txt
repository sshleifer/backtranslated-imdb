Being a longtime fan of the 2001 film Moulin Rouge and a more recent fan of the film industry of Jean Renoir, I knew that sooner or later I would inevitably watch his French Cancan. The film tells the fictional story of the opening of the Moulin Rouge nightclub. Impresario Danglars (Jean Gabin) is trying to turn the laundress of Montmartre Nini (Francoise Arnoul) into a Cancan star, without causing the anger of his stormy mistress dancing Lola's stomachs (Maria Felix). This is just one of several love triangles in the French Cancan - true to the stereotype, these French people from show business always fall in love. <br /> <br /> Renoir is guided by his typical tender humor and attention to the characters who support the characters, and also wrote the lyrics to the beautiful waltz song that was presented in the film. Gaben perfectly embodies the aging hero of the French playboy. Arnoule is a cute redhead who keeps herself in dance numbers, with the exception of a few tricks where the double is clearly used. <br /> <br /> “French Cancan” is declared a musical comedy, and while there are many of the musical numbers that occur on the nightclub scene, etc., only one character, Casimir, ever breaks into in the song in the middle of a conversation. The actor who plays him, Philip Clay, is fun to watch - a really tall, skinny young man who sings, dances and bends. <br /> <br /> The film ends with a long Cancan sequence, as all the characters learn to overcome their problems and create art together. The dance is much more brightly lit and harmoniously edited than in the Moulin Rouge; In fact, if I have one complaint about the "French Cancan", it is that all this is too technical. Even when Nini feels grief or someone sings a sad song, the lighting is bright and even, without any shadows. Yes, the result was a cheerful and hearty musical comedy; I just can't help but think that in real life things weren't so bright and innocent.
