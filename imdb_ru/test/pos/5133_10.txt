I must admit, I was surprised at how good this film was when I first watched it. I planned to see him in cinemas in the summer, but I found it unpleasant that it had already passed and passed. Therefore, I expected him to be removed from the cinema because it was bad. Then, today, I rented it and watched it and really enjoyed it. The speed of the events was doubtful, it could have been a little longer. I found that this is very true for the book, but it does not take into account some important parts: the real name of Mullet Finger, etc. I felt that if I had not read the book, I would not understand what was happening. The game was pretty good, one more thing I expected to be poor, but a cop, sorry, I can't remember the name of the actor, could have been a little better. In general, I found this film very interesting and recommend it to all viewers!
