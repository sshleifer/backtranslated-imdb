I like the National Anthem. I like the National Anthem, if for nothing else, just before the Midnight News, I imagine that I play the cymbals in a group. Not as easy as you think! One two three four; One two three four; but then what? So I sympathize with a practicing bass player in Roy Andersson's beautiful film, patiently waiting for his cue while listening to a 70s tape player. <br /> <br /> The motive of the 70s seems to go on all the time, with some classic soulless furniture. In addition, in each scene there is a terrible jade wash, which emphasizes the smallest nuances of the finest acting skills. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to Jessica Lundbergâ€™s outstanding purple boots. Boots that would otherwise inspire the Silk Cult advertising campaign. <br /> <br /> But everything is more complicated. Someone asked me what it was about. Well, there is a scene where the first line "I don't have that length in green" is brilliant. Right out of the box, Gary Larson. <br /> <br /> I can't say what it is about. Go yourself. <br /> <br /> Ron Plasma <br /> <br /> Hmm. Larson! Sounds Swedish <br /> <br /> (Viewed April 15, 2008)
