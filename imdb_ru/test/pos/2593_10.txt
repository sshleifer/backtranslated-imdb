In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fadd hunts and Duffy tries to get him to shoot Zhukov. Needless to say, Bugs has its own agenda. In addition, in the “Rabbit seasoning” it is interesting to use the word order and pronouns (warning: it can be ridiculous and royally spoil your speech). <br /> <br /> I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Duffy. One of them seemed to be risky for 1952 (especially in the cartoon), but they did an excellent job, as always. In general, it just shows what kind of geniuses were the people behind these cartoons.
