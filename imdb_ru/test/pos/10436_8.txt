I first saw this film when I was about 12 years old. He has been one of my favorites since then ... He is so perfect in all its glory, complete with a stunning soundtrack, cheerful dialogue, and it was both fun and terribly sad. The first movie I really just remembered at the end ... I won't ruin it for you guys, but damn it, it's a tear ... I just remember how sad I was for Gary! What a bunch of cool characters in this movie, this is a genius !!! They are all so cool that even the nerd Gary does not like ... (although she had a beautiful little body). I can not believe that all the girls go to Rick, he is such a bastard with his handkerchief tied around his neck !!! ha ha ha ... When watching this movie, be prepared for many sexual jokes with sexually transmitted diseases (almost). But a love story in the depths of the soul is connected with real problems associated with uncertainty in life, changing decisions that make you think and feel sincere sorrow for the cast. I love this film !!! If you like Valley Girl, you will always be classic!
