If you're looking for a movie that doesn't take itself seriously ... then Haggard is for you. Before writing anything else, I have to say that if you haven't seen any of the CKY (Camp Kill Yourself) videos, the film most likely will not be HOW funny. My advice is to watch some clips from those videos that Bam and his friends shot. Haggard does not take himself seriously, and this has never been the goal. Throughout the film, you will have random moments that have nothing to do with the plot, which can be annoying, but this is not due to control. Even with all this, the plot remains focused, and the story of Ryan Dunn's character unfolds quite well. This story, which I was told, is based on the real story (for the most part) of the ex-girlfriend Ryan Dunn. Brandon Dicamillo is definitely the best character in the film. He has many talents, and he knows how to make people laugh. He stole the movie if you ask me. In general, I love this film for its simplicity and direct oddity. These are people from the Bam movie, this will not be normal. Haggard is full of funny quotes that I and my friends have consistently used since they first saw it. I saw the movie 6-7 times and still every time I found something new. The soundtrack is just as good. Everything from Gnar Kill to New Order and some techno. Just do not enter the film with high expectations, let it all unfold and then judge it, what it is.
