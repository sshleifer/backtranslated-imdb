Ninja Hunter (AKA Wu Tang vs. Ninja) is pure entertainment from start to finish due to its outrageous characters, meaningless conspiracy and the absence of any complaints. The creators of this film gave us a truly OTT masterpiece that we need to see in order to believe in it. <br /> <br /> The plot is centered around the villain U Tan, Abbot White, who wants to destroy the Shaolin monks and become supreme. martial arts master. For this, he combines with the ninja clan, led by three masters ?? golden ninja lame, white mustache ninja and black ninja ?? and successfully destroys the Shaolin Temple and most of its inhabitants. However, there are some survivors. Their task is to transfer the knowledge of the blow of Shaolinâ€™s finger to the new generation, which the ninja and Abbott White must conquer if it is necessary to restore peace and order. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Abbott White is difficult to defeat the enemy, as he is able to make himself practically invulnerable, sucking the life force from hot naked chickens (justify some long-awaited gratuitous nudity!) <br /> <br /> Other pleasures awaiting the audience include many very impressive battles (despite the fact that some were sped up), some really amazing outfits (the aforementioned golden ninja ninja, Yin-Yang Abbott White and even some killers in the Swastika tunic), a ninja turning into a flying carpet, plus some raw blood for good measure. And I almost forgot to mention the really impressive eyebrows shown in this film? certainly a good reason not to give up this gem.
