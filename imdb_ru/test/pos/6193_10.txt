scary real drama, no other drama that would scare me as hell, heroes are not your typical Islamic terrorist, you have a fair-haired, blue-eyed guy who is as stupid as he looks. He is a converted Muslim. A well-respected businessman who pretends to be a Jew and a Frenchman who converted to Islam, but clearly raised the word of the Koran to a whole new level. The hero of the conspiracy is Darwin, an undercover FBI agent who has entered a terrorist cell and must do all sorts of horrible things so as not to be detected. The first episode is a little taste of what is to follow. Although we are talking about Islamic terrorists, there is a unique way in the drama to indicate that not all Muslims are extremists, which console those who are preoccupied with racism, given that half of the terrorist cell is Islamized, it makes you think that perhaps they to be afraid of The scariest drama I've ever seen. The reason why this is so scary is that you never know who your friends are, your husband or your neighbors. Terrorists can be anyone, anywhere, anytime.
