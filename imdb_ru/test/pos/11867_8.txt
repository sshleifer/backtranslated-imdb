Liv Tyler in his sexiest movie! <br /> <br /> She miraculously embodies the role of “Femme Fatale”, at the same time she manages to look like a super-sexy woman, keeping the position of “cute girl” and not being overly evil, like other similar films (for example, Femme Fatale ”with Rebecca Romaine) <br /> <br /> Before this movie“ The Lord of the Rings ”was the only movie I ever saw (I was hooked on LotR) <br /> <br /> Item: With LoTR I formed the opinion that the role of a purely sweet woman was the only role Liv Tayler could interpret, but when I saw "One Night at Mc Cool", I Absolutely changed my mind. She is the sexiest woman in the world! <br /> <br /> Therefore, the film is a mediocre comedy with a “confusing” plot.
