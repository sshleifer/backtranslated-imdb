A young ambitious nurse, Ms. Charlotte (Rosie Holotic), is sent to work in a psychiatric hospital that is located off the beaten path. For three days she faces strange events, even a patient in her bedroom is watching her, but she still remains. All patients with mental disorders turn away a little (especially from the judge), but my favorite was the old crazy biddy (Ray McAdams). The storyline is good at best, and the game is surprisingly fine, but after a while it gets a little bigger. But, nevertheless, it is fun, bizarre, strange and original. <br /> <br /> Note: the thing in the basement is hardly terrible, so the name of the bananas is a bit.
