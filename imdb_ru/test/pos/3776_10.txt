This is a cute actress who played the nurse with gonzongami - this is the same actress who plays Elvira, the owner of darkness. Another little piece - the actress who played the nurse who gave her a wedding ring, was the mistress of Lady Roy Munxin at King Pin. This is the most glorious story ever told. He has to sell more copies than the Bible. My parents played a role in the proposal to release this film in a local cinema. The film lasted a week, and we were one of 4 families to see it. The lady who gave permission (friend of the family) was released by the theater. I was 3 years old. I recorded 4 copies on VHS and finally converted them to DVD. It is beautiful.
