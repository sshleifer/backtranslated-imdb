I thought I had written a commentary on this film before, but I cannot find it here. Anyway, I am writing this again. I accidentally found this film from my college library collections. Watch was free, so why not. <br /> <br /> Of course, I am glad that I looked at it. I love this film. I have seen several Russian films before, most of them have serious themes. I'm surprised it was a good comedy. I laughed great while watching. and this is the movie I want to buy. this thing is so funny and they are not just silly funny, these plots were very original and well thought out, so they don't seem to be silly at all. I am surprised that this film did not attract many viewers. This is a classic that can be watched over and over. <br /> <br /> These actors were also very authentic, their actions are real, not fake. if you have not watched, go get a copy soon! definitely recommended.
