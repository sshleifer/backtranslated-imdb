ATTENTION: SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> This is written for movie lovers who may have moved away from Mood for Love, puzzled and entangled in the ways that the main characters choose in life. From reading other comments and feedback, it seems that many viewers and critics have missed some very important details that may have prevented them from enjoying this delightful teasing of the film. <br /> <br /> We are so used to seeing blatant sex in the stories. that we forget that there was a time when filmmakers offered a “dirty act”, simply showing couples with a saggy mouth leaving in a sledge or a hay hut, only to return to the next scene with a bulging belly or fat kid stuck to hip ... "Meet with your baby. " <br /> <br /> The director chose the same nostalgic approach, telling the story of Mr. Chou and Mrs. Chan. The last warning ... SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> Mr. Chow is deceiving Mrs. Chan by showing her real emotions when they rehearse forever about his departure. Next scene: Mrs. Chan leans over to Mr. Chow in a taxi and says, "I don't want to go home tonight." Translation: “Let's do it.” <br /> <br /> Why, then, did the couple simply not do the modern thing, throwing their cheating spouses, divorcing, raising their beloved child and living happily ever after? The answer is that this whole story takes place in Hong Kong in the sixties. The bastard would live in a dismal shameful life if he were a child of adultery, whereas a “legitimate” child could live a tragic but noble / honest life if his mother decided to raise him away from his cheating “father” - invisible Mr. Chan . In short, Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan sacrifice their relationship for the sake of their child’s future. <br /> <br /> That is why Mr. Chow, having learned that Mrs. Chan lives alone with a little boy, smiles knowingly and finishes his dream of making Mrs. Chan his Mrs. Chow. Then he also understands why Mrs. Chan went to Singapore itself, to be with him, only to reconsider the last moment and leave ..., having decided never to see him again (but not before accepting some unnamed memory) Mr. Cho lives with this wonderful secret, and no one to tell. Nobody, except for the collapsing wall of the temple and, of course, we are the spectator, but only if we listen carefully.
