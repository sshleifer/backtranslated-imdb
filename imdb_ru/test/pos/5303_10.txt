Simply put, I was tickled when I watched it at the cinema, and smiled from ear to ear; with wide eyes, trying to understand all the details, while at the same time incredibly simple, fresh, but incredibly complex, exciting and creative. <br /> <br /> In terms of the age range of the audience, probably Totoro. The plot works because of the pure heart of five-year-olds, who focus on what they want and are conscientious in their pursuit. They live in a world that is not spoiled by the cynicism and cultural knowledge of how things should work. Although most critics can ignore this film due to the lack of a film “message” or “plot” (although it is somewhere there), this is the reason why the film should be protected. Too often our judgment is hampered by our own limitations of the cinema and cultural position. Like most Miyasaki films, each one is completely unique, but no doubt Miyasaki. Sometimes a ponyo may seem so unique and fresh that it may look like an alien. <br /> <br /> The viewing experience provides a wonderful change from all typical baby products that are usually commercialized to like adult demographics (for example, Animals speak like their human counterparts, Eddie Murphy in Shrek.) Be aware that the good old-fashioned hand-drawn cells still work so incredibly well in this digital age, when Toystory / WallE / Shrek / Cars usually win. Therefore, the feeling of nostalgia and at the same time makes the film feel out of time, something like the fact that the book of Totoro and "Jungle" is not really old. <br /> <br /> The subtleties of expression of each character and body language are reflected in this form. nuanced interpretation with which digital films, such as Wall-e, can never compete, or if this happens, it will be a very expensive process. For Wall-E, it would be a great pity to win over this at the Oscars, and this will probably happen this year. However, it would be unfair to compare these two environments, as this is really a mastery and a story that wins at the end of the day. For this, Miyasaki is a true master.
