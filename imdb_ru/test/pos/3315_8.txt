I watched the first few minutes at TCM a few years ago, but after 15 minutes I stopped. I saw him on schedule at the Stanford Theater in Palo Alto and swore that I had 40 minutes to go. Stanford is an old-fashioned cinema that starts every movie with curtains closed. Yes, they have curtains. They opened when Fox logo fanfare started playing. When "The Best of Everything" appeared in huge pink letters against the background of the skyscrapers of New York, I realized that I had the right to wait. <br /> <br /> I posted this movie. There were so many little moments that added to the look of the film: when Hope Lange first entered the publishing house, the names of the magazines published there were engraved on glass (“Teenager and Elegance”); The chic apron of Joan Crawford, which she wore, so that she could serve her guests at her party, without being tangled in her clothes; how the camera leaned over to show how crazy Susie Parker becomes (at some point she was almost on the side); as Hope Lange continued to live in this obscene apartment, which she shared with others, although she obviously made a lot more money than at the beginning of the film (I think it was too scandalous for a lonely girl to live alone). <br /> Hope Lange was so beautiful; like Susie Parker. What about Mark Goddard in a non-speaking role? I fell in love with him when I was a kid looking at Lost in Space. <br /> <br /> After seeing this gem on the big screen, I planned another trip to Stanford to see the Old Dark House. By the way, I bought a small soda and popcorn on a concession stand, and I was stunned when an employee asked me for two dollars.
