It was a romantic, simple funny movie. I really enjoyed it and would definitely say to watch it and enjoy it, Will Smith was funny, cocky, nervous, sweet and just a simple guy who was hit by Love. It was nice to see him fall in love with someone, and he was so nervous and lost in regards to what to do or say. That was great. He was great, as always funny. Eva Mendez was better than I expected her to be the same, I thought there were moments in the film when Will got hit, he did everything he could, being a good guy and still receiving bad treatment. The ending was romantic and happy, and it was great. I have seen it several times, and would have looked it again. A funny movie that you no longer see. It was a sense of old with a fresh new look.
