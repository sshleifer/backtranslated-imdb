I was very impressed with this film, at least for comedy. This may not be the sharpest, most witty humor at all times, but I found it suitable for every scene. <br /> <br /> The flow of the film is, of course, a little confused, sometimes even confusing, but that is how the characters feel. Sometimes we watch the slap and other scenes revolve around a crucial conversation about relationships. This may upset some viewers a little, but it brought me closer to the dilemma of characters about irregular chaos. <br /> <br /> The game is excellent for everyone. I am a big fan of Andy Richter, but I was not completely off his ears, like everyone else, it seems. He did very well, but Julianne Nicholson and Lauren Graham stole the show for me, both in their relationship. Jay Mohr performs as expected, if you have seen him in other films. I always liked him. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very funny and offers several good foundations for several types of relationships. When it comes to issues and relationship problems, some films try to surprise. The conclusions offered here are not surprising, but it is interesting to see how they will be seen throughout the film.
