Imaginary characters, the remarkable work of the then 24-year-old Dan Harris, are tagged "People are never what they seem." Perhaps this is wisely chosen as a marketing ploy; Nevertheless, I made this film contrary to the slogan, and not because of it. And I'm glad I did. I found the course insightful study of the tragedy. I personally discovered that this is a film about how to cope with dreams, especially with lost ones. In the case of one son, the “loss” requires a deep study of what he had and what he did not have in his life. Nevertheless, the film’s central tragedy, while raising tempting questions in and of itself, acts primarily as a backdrop against which various survival styles are facilitated. I believe that the film involves an important question: how do we cope with our dreams, especially when the characters become imaginary?
