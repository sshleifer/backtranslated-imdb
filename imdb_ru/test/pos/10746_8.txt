Dragon Ma (Jackie Chan) returned, having saved the sea from the terrible Pirate Law. Returning to the land, he was assigned to the police force, where he was to eliminate corruption and crime in the local suburbs. On the way, he becomes involved in the fate of several Chinese patriots who are trying to win sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause. The Chinese Manchu government is persecuting these revolutionaries, and anyone who stands in their way is in trouble, even if they are in the police. I had great expectations from this film after I saw Project A. But, unfortunately, I was a little disappointed. Too little action compared to the first movie. There is only one good fight scene before the big finale. This fight scene is in the “gangster spot” and that’s good, a lot of people fly all over the place, and Jackie Chan and his stunt team don’t disappoint here. The finale is very interesting, Jackie Chan shows us why he is the best stuntman in the world. Really exciting stuff! The only bad thing about the finals is that the fights are too short and forgettable. Conclusion: a lot of fun moments, good acting and crazy stunts. But the struggle for the highest rating is not enough.
