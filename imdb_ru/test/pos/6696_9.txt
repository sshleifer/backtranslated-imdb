As in some of the best films and TV shows, I came across this quite by accident. It was already late, there was a full storm on the street, and I was comfortably sitting on the sofa when I slipped past the channel, which one of the episodes was about to show. I intended to just watch a couple of minutes, waiting for the end of advertising on another channel, before switching to this or that comedy. After about an hour and a half, I remembered my determination and was so happy that I did not. Needless to say, I made sure that I saw all the other episodes. <br /> <br /> John Hannah was brilliant in almost everything I saw him, and he also fails here. All other film crew members perform stellar work. My personal favorite (except John Hannah, of course) is Gerard Murphy. <br /> <br /> The only negative side of this series is the limited number of episodes. Only 8 with JH and another 1 with someone else. I would really like McCallum back on the screens, although it should be with JH!
