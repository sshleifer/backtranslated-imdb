Film to share their viewers. Only criticism indicates his funerary pace, overly used large-scale images and constant, long-lasting views between the main characters. Lawyers point to the mighty performance of Dirk Bogarde and the reference photograph of Venice Pasqualino de Santis. <br /> <br /> In general, this may mean a condescending romanticized elegy for the nobility of homosexual love (at a time when in 1971 it was all legal). In fact, Visconti managed to make a richer and more complex film than such a single-release car. He connected his ideas - weaknesses and everything else - in a meticulously developing arc. <br /> <br /> Inside this really is the central representation of Ashenbach Bogard. Instead of simplifying, Johnny, who recently came to be gay, manages to give a miserable composer, beaten by tragedy and misunderstood integrity, who sees salvation in Tadzio. His hypnotized reel around the increasingly hellish Venice after the boy is a direct metaphor of the artist’s perseverance to the truth in the mafia’s teeth of the amateur (and this is clearly cut out with such a memory). <br /> <br /> Mahler’s music may be a little overused, although it is well appropriated. Italian is imposed - it is a frayed anachronism, but, fortunately, acting skills do not suffer much. 7/10
