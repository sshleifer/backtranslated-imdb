I have to admit that when I first heard about the Apocalypse, it was a concern. <br /> <br /> I mean, what they have, what to match, is not it? When they first staged a stage show, they won the Perrier Award, and when they performed on the radio, they won the Sony Award. When they ventured to our television channel, they received the Bafta award, the Royal Television Society Award and the Golden Rose of Montreux. <br /> <br /> When the first episode was released in January 1999, it was amazing! Real breath of fresh air in British comedy, and when the second episode aired a year later, it was based on this foundation and consolidated the status of a cult show around the world, our web statistics show that we received visitors from every single country on the planet. ! “Local Show for Local People” demonstrated the talent of the Gentsevs for a live performance and opened the doors for Gent performers who could come up with a large number of live performances, such as “Art” in the western region. <br /> <br /> A favorite of fans has always been the Christmas Special, fewer sketch shows and more tribute to classic horror films, but still wrapped in a delightful league style. <br /> <br /> And then, of course, there was a “difficult” third series, still Of course, to hit the loyal hardcore fans, but perhaps a little ahead of its time for a mass television audience. <br /> <br /> As I said, much can be justified. <br /> <br /> So now we have a film and ... Well, the film is different, isn't it? This will be seen in a much larger number than on the radio or television series, and in view of the third series I was worried. <br /> <br /> As you know, I was fortunate enough to see the film yesterday at the press show in London, and all my doubts were dispelled (literally) in the first few minutes! I'm not going to disclose storylines, as some reviewers did, and I will not tell you the key phrases (although in fact there is only one), but I will try to tell you what they managed to achieve with the help of this film! Coming out of the cinema on Monday night, I could only imagine what I wrote: “Oh my God, this is great, this is amazing, this is the best thing they have ever done, better than the first, second and special offers all in one!” Of course, I owe my visitors a much better explanation than this! So why is it brilliant? This is a film for everyone, a casual fan, an obsessive fan, a casual fan, and even someone who is not in the cinema! You did not need to watch the show to enjoy this movie; It works on many levels. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me why I'm a fan of the Gentlemen League! You can say that the shooting was a real labor of love too; The attention to detail is incredible. TV show kits have always been detailed, but I’ll have to watch the movie again to look at the background! The story moves at a rapid pace, the action takes us from Royston Weissy to the real world, where we meet with the "Creators", who, of course, are themselves the League! On the way, we manage to come across our favorite characters of the series, but always in the center of the plot, unlike the TV show. <br /> <br /> I was glad that the film was dark in places, a bit scary and a bit strange ... only suitable for the Gentlemen’s League. The gents also managed to get revenge on the BBC censorship, and not so much slipping into the word "Mongoloid", as shouting it from the rooftops! Some may think that the Gents are portraying themselves a bit condescending, but this is a joke, and with this comes my only concern, the jokes that I mention below may puzzle some viewers, and they may come too smart ... but I should not worry, There is always a poop joke waiting just around the corner and talking about jokes, they come thick and fast, and in a mixture of clever references, wig jokes, ass jokes, visual jokes and cock stuff! I haven't laughed out loud at the movies since ... well, I don't remember! Fans who from the very beginning were in the “League” are rewarded with a lot of “in” jokes, some of which work on two levels, the main audience can laugh at the reference to the CD for one reason, while the fans of the “Local” show will laugh for another reason! Cameos are brilliant! Peter Kay and Simon Pegg form the strangest double act you have ever seen, Simon gets one of the loudest laughter in the movies, just making a noise! I was a bit concerned about the aspect of the film of the 1690s, when I first heard about it, but like a story in a story that I just started when ... but it will tell! All I need to say is that it fits perfectly and adds the overall feel of the film! I'm not a professional film reviewer, so it's hard for me to put it in words how much I liked this film, but now I just say that if the intended reference point for British comedy films of recent years was excellent, then “Sean is dead, then I'm sorry, but an inventive, funny, and sometimes a bit scary, just set a new benchmark ... Gentleman's Apocalypse League. <br /> <br /> Jason Kenney 2005
