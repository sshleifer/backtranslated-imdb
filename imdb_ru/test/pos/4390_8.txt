I was truly and surprisingly surprised: “Oh, brother, where are you?” The video store didn’t have all the films I was planning to make, so I came across it. I came home and, when I looked, I was consumed and found myself laughing out loud. The Coens again made a great movie. But I think that the first time you watch this movie, you will recognize the characters. The second time, now that you know them, you laugh so hard that it can hurt you. I would strongly recommend ANYONE to see this, because if you don’t, you really don’t have enough of the film’s gems for centuries to be 10/10
