Adam (Eric Jungmann) and the disgusting best friend of Harley (Justin Urich) are driving cross-country to the wedding. Along the way, they pick up the sexy hitchhiker Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Then, for no reason, the monster truck continues to try to knock them out of the way ... and maybe kill them. Who does it and why? <br /> <br /> Pretty good horror movie. Its energetic and full of bright direction that brings you straight into action. This is also a horror comedy. Most of the humor is infantile and REALLY rude, but actually quite funny. In addition, this film accumulates from time to time, but it is a GOOD thing! The action is in order - Jungmann slightly exceeds its role as a botanist; Urich is stuck with the hopeless role of a dirty, sex-obsessed best friend - but copes with it; Brooks is also good in a limited role. <br /> <br /> BUT I could see that the "turn" ends long before it happened, and the logic completely disappears at the end (especially in salvation). However, it is a terrible, sometimes funny, and sometimes scary horror film. I give him 7.
