I have seen this story before, but my children have not seen it. A boy with a problematic past joins the military, confronts his past, falls in love and becomes a man. Mentor this time plays great Kevin Costner; An ordinary person with common household problems who lives with extraordinary conviction to save lives. After losing his team, he takes a teaching position, teaching the heroes of the new generation. Young distressed recruit plays Kutcher. While his scenes with local love interest are a bit tough and do not generate enough heat to melt the butter, he well compliments Costner. I never truly understood Sella Ward as an abandoned wife and felt that she should have Costner give up concern for his safety, unlike her selfish needs. But her presence on the screen is a pleasure. Two non-accredited stars of this film are the Coast Guard and the Sea. Both powerful forces that cannot be taken for granted in real life or in this film. There are some slow moments in the film, and they could spend the 15 minutes spent on strengthening the relationship with the character. But it still works. Rescue scenes are intense and well shot and edited for maximum impact. This film elicits applause from the audience. And the applause of my two sons.
