I gave these 8 stars out of a possible 10. They had a great storyline, and Peter Coyote and Michelle Lee, like the rest of the actors, did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> Both Peter and Michelle were too long in their teeth for those ages that were supposed to be their characters, and their children in the film would obviously be better suited as their grandchildren. <br /> <br /> I missed the first ten minutes of this film. So I don’t know how this body appeared after 25 years and was traced to Denny Trainor (character Peter Coyote), but I had no problems with the selection of the plot. <br /> <br /> Barbara Treinor (Michelle Lee) is stunned when her long-time husband, Denny, is arrested for murder in Oregon about 25 years ago, Danny state claims that he has never been. <br /> <br /> However, as evidence accumulates against Denny, his story changes. Then his story changes again and again, until Barbara knows what to believe. <br /> <br /> However, Barbara decided to sort out the secret circling around Denny’s fateful time and a young girl named Sherry took a trip from a stranger named Wayne Kennedy, which ended in murder. <br /> <br /> I found the film interesting, with a good pace, and he made me guess what really happened between these three people. <br /> <br /> From what I saw during the closing credits, this seems to be based on a true story.
