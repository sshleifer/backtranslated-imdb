This film is excellent (I watched the French version). There are many side stories (which usually distract from the whole), but they pleasantly reveal and are consistent with the main theme of "revealing your true self." In fact, the whole film (besides its story) is a journey towards discovering yourself (or someone else). Is the King a “good monarch-peacemaker” trying to wage “war to end all wars,” or is he just a disturbed bloodthirsty bully? In the end, is he the real king? Is the Queen's assistant mother just a lustful, movable career, a limp puppet sock, or, rather, a witty, brave man? Does the lady / concubine understand who the king really is? What is between the king and the old chancellor? What is the secret everyone knows, but they will not tell? What is the real reason the killer quit his "job"? Plots (something that I don’t particularly like) are processed well and follow them to the end. The scenes are well thought out, and the CGI fits perfectly without going overboard. Suspension is properly maintained, and the actors are up to the task. There are a lot of smiles with brain damage, but that’s the way it should have been at the king’s court (as the lady / concubine complains). Realistic movie without superheroes. This Chinese film really disgraces Hollywood cardboard colossi (Gladiator, etc.).
