Having seen “Indisputable 2”, I understood what to expect from Isaac of Florence. <br /> <br /> Shepherd: Border Patrol is a good film (not the best for Van Damme, but definitely not the worst). VD supports the cast, but it makes sense. <br /> <br /> The storyline and plot have already been made before, so there is nothing new about this. I mean this is Van Damme. We really don't expect an amazing plot, do we? So let's talk about what we all want to see this film: about the fighting. <br /> <br /> Without giving anything away, I thought that the fights were filmed and filmed well, better than some of the latest VD films, such as Second in Command, in which the entire final battle is terrible. With the Florentine behind the camera, and if you saw Undisputed 2, he seems to know how to photograph battles, and enjoys it. Several battles in the Shepherd reminded me of old VD things that we all want to see. The fights were good, and I said “oh, cool” out loud a few times. But I was hoping a little more, considering how well I thought that “Undisputed 2” was. <br /> <br /> Something that intrigued me was the daughter of V.D. in film. This is Bianca Van Warenberg, JC's real daughter. I had never seen her before, so it was a pleasant pleasure. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is not so bad. Yes, the story was made before, but at least JC tried to make a good movie. Next time add more hand-to-hand combat! I think he still has what it takes to make another big budget movie ... his acting skills have improved since he starred in DTV, and he is really in great shape at 47 years old. I don’t know about you, but I’m one of those who think that most of his DTVs are really good, except for Derailed. All he needs to do is get back in the form of a “bloody sport” and make a martial arts film ... and I think people will respond well even if he is not Jet Li. This movie is definitely worth renting. =
