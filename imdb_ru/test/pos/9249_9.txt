I’m a bit biased because I’m appearing in this film, but I liked it, and I’m only seven minutes away, and I'm not the most interesting part of it. The film is an honest and intriguing story about a noble, independent group of filmmakers trying to make an attractive film. It is also an account of inflated expectations and fallen heroes. Interviews are well arranged in editing. Different people are all interesting and never too many of one person. In addition, the interviews are filmed in a rather interesting way, which makes the film visually satisfactory. Definitely a worthwhile movie. I hope it will cost.
