This film is a powerful commentary on family life in North America today. The story is so well constructed that it seems that it is happening across the street, right now! If you are in any way connected with your family and society, this film will capture you and take you to Travis's house, rather than letting you go until the loans are ready. <br /> <br /> Our imaginary heroes, through many innocent circumstances, often unwittingly, lead us along the path of grief, confusion and isolation. The Travis family invites each of us after a terrible tragedy; Father, mother, brother and sister, in their lives to share their experiences in dynamic circumstances that simply will not go away. We see all of the above and, ultimately, joy in the powerful performances of the main players and other actors, which makes this film an absolute treasure of the audience. <br /> <br /> In a film made as well as it’s usually difficult to find something special, Sigourney Weaver Sandy Travis’s image was outstanding. I would be surprised if others would not recognize it as such. <br /> <br /> Obviously 10. Great!
