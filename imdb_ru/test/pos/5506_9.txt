many people said that this film was not good, in terms of horror, I agree, it was not very scary, it had some horrible methods of torture, yes (hooks go where they should not), but not scary. but it was a good comedy film, I thought it was fun, such bad behavior from Snyder with his stupid theological doubt, and every second word he said sounded like "what is ____, define ____", but then the evil mob in his house with one of them holding a sign saying "we won't take it" (this is the song of the perverse sister of his group. but I think the part that made me laugh the most was the dead wife of one guy) Dee Snyder kept her and made her dance when I saw that I had tears in his eyes ... so I would not recommend this to avid horror lovers, but for those who love horror for his comedy, I recommend this movie 100%
