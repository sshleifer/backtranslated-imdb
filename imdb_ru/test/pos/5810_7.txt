Hammer's House of Horrors: “The Time of the Witches” takes place in rural England on Woodstock Farm, where the stressed musician David Winter (John Finch) lives with his wife, actress Mary (Prunella Gee) and is currently writing music for a horror movie. One night while searching for his dog, Billie David finds a mysterious woman in her barn calling herself Lucinda Jessop (Patricia Quinn), who claims to be a witch who has endured herself from 300 years ago now. Obviously, it is quite skeptical that David finds it hard to believe her, so he locks her in a room in his farmhouse and calls his doctor Charles (Ian McCulloch) to examine her, however, as soon as he arrives and they enter the room, Lucinda disappeared. Charles explains that David drank too much, but over the next few days, strange and disturbing things start happening with David and Mary ... <br /> <br /> Witches time was episode 1 of the short British anthology horror series Produced by Hammer Studios for television and originally released here in the UK in September 1980, the first of two episodes of The House of Horrors, filmed by director Don Liverr (the second episode of Mark of Satan), I really enjoyed it very much. Since the Hummer House of Horror series was dedicated to various topics, and all of them were not related to each other, with the exception of the title and, not surprisingly, Watching Time is an ominous and effective little tale about a witch, Anthony Reed’s script benefits from short duration of more than 50 minutes & moves at a good pace. The characters are pretty good, like the dialogue, there are some good scenes here, and I liked that it never turns out that David and Mary are crazy or not. I think this is a well-structured, entertaining and rather creepy horror TV show that I liked more than I thought. <br /> <br /> Being made for British television, the boys in Hummer had a lower budget than usual, if it were possible, and therefore there are no great period settings, as in their most famous films “Frankenstein and Dracula, ”although the modern English setting does give him a certain atmosphere, which you can associate with a bit more. Another limitation on television is that the operating levels are lower than you would hope, there is some nudity and blood, but not so much, although I did not mind, since the story here is pretty good. This is well done due to the fact that the experience of Hammer in their feature films has probably helped them to look good, and is also good at acting because the favorite genre of Ian McCulloch looks a bit like. <br /> <br /> The time of the witches is a good start for the series “House of the Hammer of Horrors”, since the 50-minute part of British television is damn good, and now why they don’t make such a show anymore?
