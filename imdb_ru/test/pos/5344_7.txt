In the original three films, there was something special and delightful - perhaps their length. Unfortunately, this lacks charm, but it still turns out to be a funny movie. <br /> <br /> The bright, shimmering side is that our favorite clay figures still do an excellent job, good clay animation is used, there is a silly, but well-structured and interesting plot, an exciting, fun adventure, a good plot idea (a werewolf rabbit and a huge competition for vegetation) and good new characters! <br /> <br /> Aside from the lack of original charisma, the only other slightly dark side of the film is that the humor, although good, is a bit exaggerated, especially when compared to the original films. <br /> <br /> The popular “Giant vegetables” contest is approaching, and Wallace and Gromit are helping to control the rabbits by eating any vegetables, now they are against Pesto. They do their job well, but danger comes soon. Nearby is the werewolf rabbit ... <br /> <br /> Recommended to all Wallace and Gromit fans, as well as people who love plasticine films, enjoy Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the werewolf! :-)
