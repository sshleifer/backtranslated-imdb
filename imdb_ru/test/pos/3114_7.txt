George Cukor is and will always be one of my favorites. Unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Kyukor in the same breath with John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder, and yet watch his filmography. From the sparkling comedies Philadelphia Story, Adam's Rib, Vacation, Psycho-Melodrama, Gaslight, Double Life, the great semi-western Heller in pink tights "or" Traveling with my aunt. He was in the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera. I feel a certain tenderness, watching how the “rich and famous” flashes of the old master are still very obvious. For the first time in her career, Candice Bergen gives us an idea of ​​the wonderful comedian she was going to become. Jacqueline Bissett is a return to the days when Greer Garson, Loretta Young and Hart Bochner enter, teasing us, promising something impressive that ultimately materializes in 1989 with Little Quarter Meg Ryan, as Bergen’s daughter is already Meg Ryan. No matter how tired the formula is, it remains a Cukor film, and I collect one of Almodovar’s favorite films.
