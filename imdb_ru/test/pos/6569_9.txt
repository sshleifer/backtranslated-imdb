"Uzumaki" occurs in a small Japanese rural town where people go crazy. They go crazy over whirlwinds and spirals. The crisis is exacerbated because people turn into snails, and whirlwinds appear everywhere. “Uzumaki” has to be one of the strangest and most original horror movies I've ever seen. The plot is really clever, and the horror scenes are very funny, since the film does not take itself too seriously. "Uzumak" wonderfully photographed, and the use of flowers - at the highest level. . The characters are pleasant, and there are enough shocking surprises to satisfy fans of Japanese horror. Despite some funny scenes, the overall tone of this film is rather dark. Uzumaki is not as good as Ring, Ju-on or audition, but if you like Japanese horror movies, you will not be disappointed. 7 out of 10.
