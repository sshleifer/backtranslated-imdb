The _Saltmen_ is a long film for its genre, and quite often its pace is much slower than Western viewers expected. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it completely both in terms of an interesting subject and with the magnificent images that this film contains. Some landscapes are truly breathtaking, and there is enough interest so that most of the _Saltmen_ can survive with minimal use of fast forward.
