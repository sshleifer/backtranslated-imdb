Patty Chaevsky was years ahead of the most successful writers and playwrights in solving sensitive topics. In this 1971 film, he followed Sinclair Lewis and AJ Cronin (respectively in ARROWSMITH and THE CITADEL films), critically considering the world of medicine, although his goal is focused on a particular scene: the modern hospital in Manhattan. Chayevsky's point of view is very straightforward: are there hospital places where people can come to recover, or are organizations bringing money where people often die because of incompetence. <br /> <br /> Like a man who was recently in Too many times in the hospital (and I will soon have to return). I find HOSPITAL a very timely and useful satire. George S. Scott - Dr. Block, one of the leaders of the Manhattan Surgical Center, the main training hospital. He had just started his day when he was told that one of the residents of the second year of life had died at night in apparent confusion. It seems that he was calm and used drugs when he slept on the bed (he had a meeting with the nurse), and someone faked intravenously. it was supposed to contain water with glucose in it (it later turns out that he received an overdose of insulin IV). Soon, Scott discovers that whenever he turns around, some other employee dies from a heart attack or a failed operation. The key to all of this, apparently, is one patient who came to the hospital for regular examination ten days ago, has since lost one kidney, almost lost his other kidney and is now in a comatose state (Barnard Hughes). <br /> <br /> Hughes' daughter (Diana Rigg) wants to bring a comatose father to his home on the Apache Indian reservation in Mexico. Scott is not completely against this idea - after all, hospital errors almost killed Hughes. In addition, Scott is experiencing a mid-life crisis due to the breakup of his marriage and family, as well as growing doubts about what his chosen profession is actually pursuing. This is not only a look at the case, similar to Hughes. The hospital is in constant chaos, in which staff members (Scott, Stephen Elliot, Nancy Marchand, Stockard Channing) are overloaded with work and overloaded, and they fight with the business staff (as was the case with Francis Steenhagen in a very cold version). The local community is hostile because of plans to expand the hospital, but when they meet to “discuss” issues with Elliot, they are just as controversial (black panther fighters against local clergy against birth control seeking women and an abortion clinic) types). Rigg (who falls in love with Scott during the film) becomes more and more confident that leaving the madness of the city makes sense, and Scott also plays with the idea. <br /> <br /> Scott was in his acting height in this movie that with ANATOMY KILLER, HUSTLER, DR. STRANGELOVE, and PATTON under his belt before HOSPITAL was created. His anxiety manifested when he and Rigg met each other (she does not allow him to kill himself because of despair). He cannot say whether to do something in the hospital, and shouts out words in the “Consolidated Line” into the window. Although he later relaxes a bit about how well his training is for the doctors who study with him, Scott is really never completely sure about all this - he nevertheless fully accepts his own sense of responsibility that others simply give up. Rigg was also at the peak of her international fame (if not her acting skills) - her Mrs. Peel in Avengers was several years old, but at the same time she was recognized as the leading stage talent in the UK. as one of the sexiest female performers of that period. <br /> <br /> Supporting actors are good too. In addition to the frightening Steenhagen (requiring Medicare / Medicaid information / insurance against comatose patients in E.R.), there is Hughes as a religious maniac who wins, and Elliot as fed up with the head of the hospital. There is also my favorite caricature: Richard Dysart as Dr. Elwell. Elwell is a butcher who has found a real home in the Grand Council of the Stock Exchange, joining together for tax breaks. Anyone who recalls his performances as ethical characters, such as the head of a law firm in L.A.LAW or the friend and doctor of Melvin Douglas in the movie “To Be Here”, seeing how his greedy doctor Elwell sees another facet of this underrated talent.
