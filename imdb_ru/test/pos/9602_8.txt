I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at a film in my entire life. <br /> <br /> I love football like crazy, but I tend to hate almost any football song or movie as they tend to be unreal. It was not. <br /> <br /> I watched it once, it was over 2 years ago, and it was great. Everyone I know loved it. I remember gay physio, a 45-degree slope, and Footwear (the player named that way because he once appeared in training in a new pair of shoes). Brilliant, that's what happens in park football. <br /> <br /> Defined 10/10. If someone from the TV industry is reading this, considering all the crap you repeat on the English body, please make sense to show it again (and the dolls while you are on it). Also, does anyone know if this was shown on the BBC or ITV. I think it was ITV, so itâ€™s worth asking them if they plan to show it again. They must do.
