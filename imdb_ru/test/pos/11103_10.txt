In real stories, there is something that makes them so much more interesting than fiction. I think it is a fact that truth has always been unfamiliar than fiction. Falcon and Snowman tell a true story about Christopher Boise and his friend Donton Lee. Boyce (Hatton) is a former novice and intellectual trying to find an occupation that can support and entertain him. His FBI father can make some commitments and force his idealist son to work in the Ministry of Defense. Boyce has few responsibilities, and he seems to be smugly drinking and having fun with his colleagues. However, over time, Boyce begins to recognize top-secret information, which causes him to doubt the morality of his government. Soon, the idealist Boyce sees the illegal operations that the CIA conducts primarily in Australia. Boyce, after all, decides that he will hand over some of the secret information to which he relates. Of course, the mistake of Beuys is the assumption that, since the US does bad things, the USSR is a good guy. Over time, Boyce and his drug trafficking buddy Lee (Penn) begin to sell their top-secret information to the KGB. What once was idealism turns into capitalism and espionage. The strength of this film is the incredible performances of Hatton and Penn. Although one of them starts with the best of intentions, they both will soon end up in an endless downward spiral. Great direction, music, everything. Not only a great movie, but also one of my favorites.
