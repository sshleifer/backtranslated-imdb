In this scenario, Paddy Chaiefsky, George Scott shows his best and funny dramatic drama. Diana Rigg is an attractive and rather complex young woman. This film takes place between tragedy and chaos in a New York hospital in the late 60s with stunning consequences. Barnard Hughes, as always, is amazing (a great theater actor). <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. Best performance = George S. Scott Chayesfsky was a big blow when he put Vaness Redgrave down at the 1978 Academy Awards, but he is a good writer. Really ensemble cast that works wonders, down to the smallest role. It won the best scenario at the Oscars, and Scott was nominated. He should have won for it instead of Patton the year before (in which he was also brilliant). Look for it!
