I just watched this movie tonight. Going into it, I thought it would be good, because I really like Natalie Portman, and Susan Sarandon is also a great actor, but it turned out much better than I could have imagined. You get out of the film, feeling great. The acting was excellent, which can be hard to find lately. Natalie Portman is meant for great things, and I, as a college student at New York University, think it's great that she goes to school, and not just as an actor. In any case, returning to the topic, the film makes you interested in all the way, and I definitely think that everyone should watch it. I would give more details, but I do not want to give the film.
