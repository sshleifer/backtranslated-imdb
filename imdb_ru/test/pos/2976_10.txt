I saw this film when it was first released, and I really liked it. What film is 40 for me now, I have two teenage children, and I would like them to watch this film. I would recommend it to anyone who loves romantic movies or older Elton John music. <br /> <br /> I searched most of the stores that sell both new and old films, but I haven’t seen them. <br /> I bought some old melody movies in Hong Kong that had a rather old collection of films, but they didn’t have them. <br /> <br /> I also watch the sequel, Paul and Michelle. <br /> <br /> Can someone suggest how to get a copy of a VHS, DVD or VCD. <br /> <br /> I really appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much.
