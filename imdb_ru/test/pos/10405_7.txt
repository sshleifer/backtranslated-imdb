I can not praise this film enough. He had a lot of that portable, amazing first-person camera that I love (and some hate because it makes them sick), for example, REC, Cloverfield and Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> This is a long film for its kind, but I didn’t even notice because the film was so interesting. Just by showing shots from a paranormal reporter’s work, the film keeps pace with the times, turning it into a viewer’s experience in real time. <br /> <br /> Although I would never call this film “the most terrible horror that has ever happened” I would say that this is one of the best I've seen. The fear factor here is built from the details on the images, camera failures, events connected with each other, which give the film a very mysterious and haunting tone. The horror is more in that which is not shown, but left for our imagination. The end is perfect, and keep in mind that after that you may have nightmares. A second viewing is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Watch one in the dark, do not expect anything, and you will have fun.
