Wonderful family movie, which should be the main Christmas. It's a mystery to me why this is not so. The real lost film that I first encountered ran on my old 19-inch black and white RCA when the One Million Dollar film was still in vogue on Channel 9 in New York. This fantasy, directed by Rudolph Mate, should be hidden under everyone's Christmas tree. But this has never been released on a home video. Very bad. I think I saw some of this on AMC a few years ago, before they cut out many of their old films from the rotation. TCM should take up the slack and play it on Easter or Christmas Eve. Any film with Santa, Aunt Bee, the owner of Cupcake Lady and an actor named King cannot be bad. Anne Blyth, as Sally, is a bundle of energy. During her school years, She rushes to the chapel to pray for St. Anne to help her and to give guidance to her mixed and financially disadvantaged family. It works. Therefore, after graduation, she puts the statue of St. Anne in her bedroom. At one point, O'Moyneâ€™s entire residence moved to a different address. I think this was done to end the neighbor dispute between O'Moyne and the mean guy in the neighborhood. Blyth is good as a button. Edmund Gwen can play a hermit grandfather in a dream. Overall, this is a satisfactory movie experience.
