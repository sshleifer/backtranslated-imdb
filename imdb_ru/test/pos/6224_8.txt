I suppose it depends on when the person first sees the film, when his impression is shaped as it is. <br /> <br /> I saw him as a child on TV in 1973, when he was Stranger, and I liked it. It was a time when the space program on the Moon became a reality, when such shows as "Search "," UFO "and" Man 6 million dollars ", showed the child 12 years old from what the world can keep in its future. Adventures and technology. <br /> <br /> You could see the show only once, and that was when the network broadcast them. The only way people could cut back your shows was to make their own parody of it; I didn’t manage to take your show and add my comments to it. <br /> <br /> I didn’t know what the notion of “pilot was.” I saw the film and hoped that Stryker would return home; that it will continue after two hours. <br /> <br /> Then I would understand that so many people hate the film now? I doubt it because I don’t remember it as such. Now I understand it? Not for that to understand the story, you need to look not from their point of view, but from the point of view of the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> If someone looks at an American, it may seem ridiculous because of his absence. security in a police state ..... but if someone is a subject in that state, then you can expect compliance and security may be less. When things must be perfect, perfect to the utmost degree, perfect, which cannot be doubted, then it is hardly possible to ask questions just as quickly when things are out of order. <br /> <br /> Plots The film is interesting, for example, an old man who remembers the time before that, but keeps track of his words, as he suspects that there are spies everywhere. Or that the police state appreciates knowledge to some extent because they are careful about how they control or damage their mental activity. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, they probably know exactly what the film is about before they see it. , so much waiting, surprise is lost. But the duet between the cosmonaut and his doctor at the beginning of the film is an ideal exchange, considering that this film went well into the cold war, and the cosmonaut’s greatest fear was that he was wrecked in the USSR. The film is far enough before it becomes apparent that such an opportunity is the least of his concerns. <br /> <br /> This is the main difference between the “Stranger” and the “Double”. The latter can be considered timeless, since any of his comments about the USSR are relatively minor and are lost early in the film. In the first case, these links go through the entire film, presumably, directly at the beginning, and then as a variation of the theme after the arrival. <br /> <br /> Despite all my memories of the film, it's pretty easy. to see that he would not do it like a series. Stryker made friends every week, Benedict stalked, Stryker left. In the end, the Benedict society will get rid of him. Someone else will catch the chase. Track develops. There may be a blow to something new, for example, another member of the Stryker mission team may appear, but this will probably not be enough to continue the show. <br /> <br /> If someone comes in with knives that others used to cut the film, they will most likely also cut it. But if we recall that this was done during the Cold War, and what were the fears and assessments of the other side at that time, because of what the popular medium contained for the viewer, then they might find interesting and intellectual topics in it.
