The last of the sequels, not counting Abbott and Costello, meets Frankenstein, who was more or less deceiving. This time, the countdown to Dracula (John Carridin) is central to the search for a cure for vampirism from the amiable doctor (Onslow Stevens). Larry Talbot (Lon Cheney, Jr.) appears also in search of a cure. A good doctor successfully treats werewolf Larry, but Dracula deceives the doctor and ultimately pollutes his blood and makes a good doctor a crazy madman. And all this time, big Frankie (Glenn is strange) is lying on the table, waiting for the electricity to be corrected so that he can do some damage. It was a kind of short film, about 70 minutes and some changes, but the action is there, and there are great actors. Lionel He appears as a police inspector, here are some little things, Lionel appears in the son of Frankenstein, the ghost of Frankenstein, Frankenstein meets the wolf man and the house of Frankenstein. and then this one. If there was another series in which they could add a creature from the black lagoon to the line, I give the house of Dracula 8 out of 10.
