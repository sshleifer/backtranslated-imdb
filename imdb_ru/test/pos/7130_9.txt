I have just returned from the European premiere of Gamers: Dorkness Uprising. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that if you are a gamer (CRPG, RPG or LARP), this film is for you. And if you're not a gamer? Well, it's still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> The game, of course, is not worthy of an Oscar, but on the whole the element of the film adds charm. Humor is everywhere, along with some very nice touches (Gary Gigaxâ€™s tribute is especially well done if you can notice). Actors look very earthy in appearance, which is consistent with the fact that they are ordinary people enjoying a common hobby. <br /> <br /> The quality of the sound and vision of the film is adequate, but, again, all this simply adds to the atmosphere, which helps define this film as the film Dungeons and Dragons, written and performed by gamers for gamers. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid to use terminology specific to one system, they still manage to allow product placement to be part of the film, but in a very understandable and completely honest manner. It also affects some of the biased prejudices that some gamers may have regarding other players, and copes with it quite well. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is largely based on a well-considered equal balance. character, plot and entertainment (Bard is a surprisingly good value for money). <br /> <br /> In the end, this film is quite difficult to make, so I put him 2 points. <br /> <br /> Rating (for non-RPs): 7/10 (A few moments can pass over your head, but the main sections of the film just work so hard and achieve much more.) <br /> < br /> Rating (for RP'ers): 10/10 (it all fits, in perfect quantities and with perfect charm and mood)
