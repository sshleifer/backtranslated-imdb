The 13th and last RKO Falcon film begins with the mutual injunction of Tom Conway, when Tom Lawrence as Falcon and Ed Brophy as Goldie from No, Ladies! While they are preparing for the holidays. While you are still wondering where they are going on vacation, because they have not had a job since the beginning of the 1st film in 1941 (although Sanders in the role of Gaia and Jenkins in the role of Goldie) they encounter a woman and find themselves embroiled in wretched industrial espionage. <br /> <br /> They promise to help her when her uncle is killed by taking an envelope with the details of a formula to replace industrial diamonds to her business colleague in Miami. Suspect everyone here except the cops who are stalking Lawrence? and Goldie for the kill. To console himself, Goldie paraphrasing travel brochures: “On the coldest day, you can always enjoy the warmth of a nice cozy electric chair” for one. Some of the pleasant languid atmospheric scenes of a nightclub encounter particularly bad behavior of villains. Favorite moment: a decent game of hide-and-seek / thimble hunt, which the calm and courteous Lawrence has with the villains in the sleeper train. Least favorite bit: the most awkward scene in the entire series in an alligator hut? definitely for kids! <br /> <br /> In general, not the best in the series, but another fascinating day off, with a common plot and many episodes, even in this, that make me want them to continue for a few more years, like this Colombia did with the Boston Blacks, although RKO produced them faster. Absolutely without sex, without much violence (in fact, by today's high standards, there is no violence at all) and, of course, the lack of information - all this makes this type of film anathema for serious people who can only consider films as an art form that should depend on these three pillars. <br /> <br /> Three Dietetic Falcons were made later with John Calvert in the lead role, I don’t mind them, but I could never bring myself to count them in the main series, which Tom Conway made it his time. It is also sad that after that Conway had to face difficulties, which in 1953 switched to television, behind the scenes and even played well “Norman Conquest” in Park Plaza 605. Did he also have serious problems with eyes and alcohol ?? I don't know if they were related? he found himself in poverty and in 1967 was found dead in a hospital in the bed of his girlfriend. For us, people who want, at least, we still have his 10 entertaining “Falcons”, as well as a number of other worthy, even classic RKO films from 1942 to 1946, with the help of which we can recall it.
