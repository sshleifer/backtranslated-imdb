This film was clearly an early attempt for a new director, but still managed to be original and interesting, and also in some moments forcing him to think. However, I must say that this story would not have been noticed without the star performances of Paul Anthony in the role of Pip. He made the well-written parts very believable and impressive, and the more poorly written parts became more tolerant. I also have to mention the performance of Alan Cumming. It was nice to see him in that role. He gave weight to his role, which provided a very important element of the film. As for Paul Anthony: who is this guy? Why didn't I see him more? Someone give him more roles please!
