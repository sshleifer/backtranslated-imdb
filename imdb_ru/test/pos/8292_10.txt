I loved this movie for a long time. I haven't seen it for a while, so I checked it again and actually found it even more enjoyable now. I liked the cartoon “Chipmunks” when I was a kid, so naturally, I adored “The Adventures of the Chipmunk”. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can’t think of a better plot for this film. This is not wildly creative, but I have always wanted to travel around the world, and therefore it is so fun to watch him, as my desire for travel increases even more. The fact that Elenor sings to a little penguin always makes me cry ... <br /> <br /> “The Adventure of the Chipmunk” will always remain my favorite, I'm sure. I think it's because I saw it when I was so young. I don’t think it would have much impact on someone older if he saw him for the first time. (Unless, of course, they have a young heart)
