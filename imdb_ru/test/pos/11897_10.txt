This film was a modern scar. I had toes. This film is one of those rare epic films that makes you want to continue. I especially liked Damian Chapa, his performance deserved the award of the academy, which he deserved blood for his work. The only thing I did not like was the backstage scenes, because they did not have the intensity that the film had, and I would like to see less narrated scenes. But the film was great, and this is in my top ten films of all time. Plus, the acting was great, there was no bad scene in the movie, I liked it, Jennifer Tilly was great, like all the actors. I do not see how someone I did not like this film, it was great.
