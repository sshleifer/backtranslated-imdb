Although the film has its flaws, it reveals some of the problems associated with living in a country where there is no democracy. It makes you sympathize with the people who are under the authority of such a government, and it encourages you to learn more about their life, their struggle and potential leader Aung San Suu Kyi. It makes you wonder why our government will intervene in places we donâ€™t need, but ignore those who ask for our help.
