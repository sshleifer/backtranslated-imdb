Down Periscope has been in our library since it appeared in VHS. Since then, we have purchased a DVD and digital version from Cinema Now. <br /> <br /> This is a strange film that does not go militarily overboard for or against. This is, first of all, a comedy, and as a means of transportation for the main characters, I am very surprised that a sequel was never offered. <br /> <br /> The film gained followers bordering on cult obsession, even among the very young. I learned about this while visiting the USS Drum in Mobile, Alabama, in 2002. A group of young scouts, including my grandson, took on all the roles in the film and planned to survive it during the night on board. /> <br /> This is a funny joke that makes you proud of our Navy and Hollywood ... which is a rare company. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Kelsey Grammar, Lauren Holly and Rob Schneider for what they could have done could be an unremarkable film, such great entertainment!
