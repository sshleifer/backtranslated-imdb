This is the fourth feature film by Mark Speech. With the third “forest” - empty-handed - I promised myself not to cut my veins anymore. But this time the plot is completely different - a kind of tribute to Ramon Barnils (Sabadell 1940 - Reus 2001), a Catalan journalist. The visual effects in the trailer are stunning - a sparkling river bathed in sunlight - and the promise that Mark himself will be in front of the camera with his twin brother - not one of the professional actors - convinced me, finally, six weeks after it was released. Leave yourself to this very unusual road / river movie. Almost nothing is known about Ramón Barnils except for his most acute heritage: his constant struggle with amnesia, which we Catalans have decided to forget. “La batalla de l'Ebre” - a look at the battle of the Ebro on Wikipedia - was lost not once, but twice, because after 40 years of silence and 25 years of indecisive democracy, no one did much to remember the right side of the Spanish Civil War and those who fought. This film is about lonely people wandering around the same places without much conscience about what happened there 70 years ago. This film is about landscape.
