A very sweet love story between Brenda Bletin and Alfred Molina. The whole story is very strange and funny. The Undertaker (A. Molina) loves a married woman (B. Bletin). They try to fake her death in order to avoid her husband and village. Scenario strange situations begins. As good as SAVING GRACE and LONG LIVE NED DEVINE.
