Insanely well-developed mini-series. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him twice when he was shown on the American Playhouse on PBS. Was greatly enhanced at that time. I suppose it may have been one of the earliest mini-series featured on PBS outside theatrical masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Full-length production was shown, I believe, only once during its first show. Total was 6-8 hours. This duration has been reduced to 6 hours. Cut out some interesting, but slow scenes. <br /> <br /> I very much hope that people with current rights will execute and restore the full, non-edited version on DVD. At the moment, you should not create a VHS version. <br /> <br /> Fits perfectly into the genres of mini-series or dramatic stories.
