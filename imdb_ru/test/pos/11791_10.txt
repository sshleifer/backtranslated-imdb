I really liked this movie. If other people want an average of about 5.0 / 10, this is their choice. I would give it a 10/10. The performance of Sutherland as a private eye is absolutely amazing. The story is amazing, human, exciting, smart. Dialogue is good. The story may not be perfect, but in any case the mood of the film is good enough to make up for it. Moreover, the ending is incredibly cool, and their mystery really comes back together. Anyway, I liked it. I also thought that the lead actress played very well. I'm not a big fan of detective films, but this one was really good, also because it has no meaning for conventions of the supernatural.
