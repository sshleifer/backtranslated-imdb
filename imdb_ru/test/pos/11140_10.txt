I am delighted with actress Bobby Phillips and her superb skill as an action movie! This film is being promoted by her wonderful acting and stunning mastery of action. I am a fan of science fiction, but I must say that this film is superior to most science fiction films in cinematography, and basically it is an actress whose presence exceeds the plot, which is fine, but nothing new. Despite the fact that this film seems to be made for television, in my opinion, it is better than most theatrical films of this kind.
