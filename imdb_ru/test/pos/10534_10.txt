Centurions are one of the best cartoons in the entire history and need to be shown on television and DVD so that people of the younger generation can enjoy such a good show, which is much better than the garbage they have done in the past 14 years. I have an online petition at http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html, which initially tried to get this show five days a week, but now it is trying to transfer this show to DVD, since The television station on which it was focused has poor public relations. We all need to convince the people who own this show to burn it on DVD so that future generations can see it. In addition, since Hasbro Toys now owns the line of toys for this show, we can try to convince them to make a lively action movie out of it, just like they did with the Transformers, and sometimes this year G.I.Joe. We need good cartoons, like this one, to come back and enjoy the younger generation. Please sign this petition so that we can one day get a DVD with guys who are famous for the shouts of “Power Extreme!”
