I will do this briefly. It was a joy to watch. It may or may not be more effective if the characters were similar to their real counterparts, but in addition to this minor observation, I found that the characters of fantasy animals are most pleasant. The visual effects were stunning, with the exception of second-rate CG scenes that could be omitted. In any case, I do not like computer animation, it defeats the purpose of a biopic, such as this one. Look, you also appreciate it!
