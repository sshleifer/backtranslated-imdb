I must admit, I donâ€™t remember this movie very well. But, of course, I liked it. I think it was the best adaptation from Burroughs novel, really. And, of course, this is one of the best films from Christopher Lambert. <br /> <br /> A good film about Tarzana, just as iconic as in the film Weissmuller.
