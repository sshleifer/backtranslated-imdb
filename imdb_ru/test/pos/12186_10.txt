I remember that I didn’t like this film the first time I saw it, but it grew up on me. I love the costumes and poses of actors, humor, cinema, soundtrack. The scenes are very rich and they move very fast. Every time I look at it, something new is striking. Aaliyah like Akasha is probably the only thing that destroys it, but not enough. <br /> <br /> Also, Lestat is different in this film, it’s not the same character. You can see that character Arman is given qualities similar to Lestat, because, I believe, Ann wanted him to appear. But it makes no sense to throw out this film just because it does not look like a book; it is charming in itself.
