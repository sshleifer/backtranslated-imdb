One of the early reviews of this film ends with the words “Only for big fans of leading actors or fans of exotic films of“ Romance / Adventures of Holywood ”...” as if they had no reason to love it! Anyone who sees this film complains about Connery's accent, or lack of historical credibility, or realism of political motives, or any other problems associated with additional films, simply do not like movies. Look at this and be delighted with the star power of two heroes, exotic, romance, photography and music, as well as the bold adventure of a truly escapist film. This is proof that Hollywood can "make them what they are used to" when they really want to. Solid 8/10.
