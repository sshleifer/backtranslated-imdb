Happy 25th Birthday to Girl Valley! Great soundtrack, a believable story, great performances ... conveys the spirit of the 80s; mainstream slang and rogue. Excellent performance of school life and the "sandy city center" in terms of the suburbs. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack contains Modern English, Felony, Josie Cotton, Sparks, Payola $, Josie Cotton, The Plimsouls, The Psychedelic furs, people at work, flirting and bananarama. <br /> <br /> This film is Romeo and Juliet (without double suicide), shot in the 1980s in Los Angeles. Julie's dad, played by Frederick Forrest (Sonny Bono, anyone?) Is hysterical, like a hippie-idealistic dad, who wonders how he spawned such materialistic offspring. However, he does not judge, do you dig ??
