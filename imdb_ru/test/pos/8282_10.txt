I liked this film, and I never knew that it was so old, it came out that day and the year in which I was born, and now I'm 19, now I still love this film, especially songs like "My mom "and" Boys and girls from rock N "Roll", and I remember how I was 5 years old as a child, my sister was 6 years old, and my cousin (boy) was also 6 years old. We used to pretend to be heroes of the film, I was Eloner and Janette, and my sister was Brittany and my cousin was Alvin Simon and Theodore, those were good times, and I miss him, and this film is on commemorates the good times to me, since my cousin is old for this material, and therefore my sister and I, we are not going to forget about the chipmunk and the film about the chipmunk, I still remember by heart songs and words, although I have not seen this film 12 years now, but now I'm starting to love him again.
