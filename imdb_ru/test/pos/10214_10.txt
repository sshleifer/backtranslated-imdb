Nightbreed is a wonderful film with amazing and wonderful characters, a new mythology, beautifully designed and executed decorations. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the absence of a famous lead actor has made the film grim. <Br /> <br /> The directorâ€™s homosexuality may also have resulted in the film being unwittingly censored by a white audience, which the film condemns. <br /> <br /> Still, the film is a treasure of the monster / superhero genre. <br /> <br /> It will be interesting to see the continuation of memories in the Highlander style to various epochs in history. <br /> <br /> Another idea is the basis of the new Midianite. Perhaps in Texas or the swamps of Louisiana with crocodile men and a traveling circus freak.
