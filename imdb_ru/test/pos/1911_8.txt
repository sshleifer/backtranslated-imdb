This film was a classic black rogue film, and he was very influential in rap music for Rudy Ray Moore's "toasts". Toasts are long rhymed stories that are funny and make sense, and you can see how they naturally turn into rap. To learn more about toasts, Rudy Ray Moore and why this film is important, go to the website Dolemite.com. <br /> <br /> So we'll just talk about the movie itself. In this film, there are a lot of “laughs at funny clothes and hairstyles,” since almost every frame has some kind of outrageous element or dialogue. It all starts with the fact that Dolemit is released from prison to find out who set him up and bring him to justice. I did not know that prisons release people so that they could prove their innocence, but it is me, I am a neophyte on the prison scene. In this he is helped by the queen bee, who is Dolemite’s main prostitute and managed her brothel while he was gone. She also conducted all of her prostitutes in the karate school, so now he has an army of female karate fighters. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in two parts, which is usually a mistake, but in this case it provided an interesting contrast. The first part, which I watched during the lunch break during training, and I did not like it at all. It struck me as a particularly poorly made game, with a ridiculous story, a crappy skill - well, I think it sounds as if she had SOME skill - and a lot of outrageous places, outfits and dialogue. But I didn't enjoy it — in fact, it kind of made me feel dirty. Let's face it, a white guy watching something like this laughs at the outfits and things that the characters say, in fact, enjoy racism: how absurdly these black people dress, what stupid things they say. I did not like it, I did not laugh and did not want to look at the others. <br /> <br /> Later that night, when I was in a “much more relaxed state,” I watched the others and legitimately loved it. As in Disco Godfather, which I watched a few days ago, it is based on warmth and sweetness that make it pleasant, even if it is stupid or cruel. The character Dolemite has an element of self-parity that makes it all fun, and the appearance of several actors who were also in Disco Godfather implies that we are watching the group work of a group of friends who just want to do something fun together. Even bad dubbing, karate fights and everything else makes him even more charming. <br /> <br /> What interests me in the films about the Dolemites is that there is some moral ambiguity in them that I don’t see in other cases of blast films, and, of course, in very few mainstream films. There is an African American woman in this film who speaks about the (white) mayor, saying that "he did more for the black community than anyone else." Later we find out that the mayor, surprisingly, is corrupt, but I like that the film will present this woman as essentially misinformed and will not try to “redeem” her in some other way. There is also a Hamburger pimp figure who is presented as a useless addict, and no one is trying to find some kind of redemptive, socially positive view of who he is, he just is. In The Godfather of Disco, the religious character playing Lady Reed is presented as simply crazy for wanting to pray for her child, hopelessly lost to angel dust. I like the fact that such sharply critical images of people in their own non-sugar coated community or attempts to buy them out will be presented in the films to make them more delicious. <br /> <br /> There are many interesting elements, such as when Dolemite says: "Move over and let me go, or I'm going to pull these Hush Puppies out of your Muthatf ** a **." Queen Bee stretches out her hand and answers by telephone: "The general experience of Dolemite." And you can't miss (although you might want to close your eyes) the extended REPULSIVE Mayor nude scene. I'm all for older baleen animals, but even I have limits ?? - and my limits are usually located a few miles from most people, so be careful. The DVD that I had was clearly edited, which is noticeable in some dialogue scenes, and at the end, when Dolemite’s killing of the main character with his bare hands, obviously excludes the main event. <br /> <br /> If you get a DVD, however, be sure to watch all three Dolemitic movie trailers because they scream. I was not going to watch the “Human Tornado”, but after seeing this trailer, you had better believe what I am. In addition, there is a scene in the Dolemite trailer that I don’t remember from the movie, when Dolemite waves a Mexican thug, obviously misses, and the guy rushes into the trunk of a nearby car. <br /> <br /> After seeing the first half, I was going to say to skip it and watch “The Godfather of Disco,” since the process of making the film and the story improved a little, but after real enjoying the second half, I would advise to watch this “God’s Disco's father ”is even more incredibly cheerful, outrageous and good-natured, and there are toasts in it that even if a person does not understand the roots and nuances of form, there is still something to look at. <br /> <br /> --- See other reviews on my site about bad and cheesy movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
