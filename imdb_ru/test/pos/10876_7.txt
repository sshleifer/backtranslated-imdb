I was really pleased when I played this game. The graphics were something new. The missions were great. But still, I felt I wanted more from this game. For James Bond, she is pretty good, but not as good as his other games. . It would be great if they could do 360 Remake for this. It would be much better then. This may be simply because I am in games like the Resident Evil, Rising of the Dead and similar games. So it could be better, but it could be played. One thing that I absolutely hated in this game was Natalia! She was annoying to die all the time and could not run. I recommend this game to those who love FPS games more than me. 7/10 STARS
