A soldier-soldier kills a person for being a Jew, and tries to pin him to the same soldier. Not as good as in the novel in which it was founded (“Brick Fever”) in which a gay man was killed ... but Hollywood would not touch it in 1947. However, this is still a very good movie. Anti-Semitism is treated very well, but it is driven into the audience that fanaticism is bad ... well, yes! But it was 1947. The pictures played well the whole cast (especially Robert Young and Robert Ryan) and the tone is very dark ... as it should be. Very atmospheric too. Honored hit in his time ... worth seeing.
