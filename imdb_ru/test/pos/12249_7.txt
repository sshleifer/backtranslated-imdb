I actually didn’t see a lot of Holly Hunter movies, but seeing her in Broadcast News was a pleasant surprise. She is tough journalist Jane Craig, who has devoted all her time on television news shows. Her colleague Aaron Altman wore her torch for a long time, saying nothing. The love triangle is completed by Tom Grunnik. He is a slightly detached ex-athlete, a new reporter. For Jane, he symbolizes everything she doesn’t like about the news - turning it into entertainment, not serious business. To her surprise, Jane attracts Tom. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter does an excellent job as a fun journalist. But I do not quite understand what she finds so charming in her new colleague, Tome. This is what keeps us close to him personally. Almost as impressive is Albert Brooks, who gives all his authority as a professional, who gives more than 100 percent for his work, but does not receive as much in return. In fact, for a while, I thought it was Steve Guttenberg from the Police Academy (1984). He has a few funny lines, and if it was a picture of Meg Ryan, they would call it a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> If within two hours several scenes could be edited or completely deleted, for example. Jane and Aaron's trip to Central America. In addition, I am a lover of happy ends and preferred the other end than just a reunion between three of them seven years later.
