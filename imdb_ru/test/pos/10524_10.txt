Given that this film was released 8 years before I was born, I do not feel too bad if I watched it for such a long time. Back in January 1998, I attended the Quentin Tarantino Second Annual Film Festival, which was held in Austin, Texas. A special theme of the films of this night was “The abandoned crime films of the 70s”, and the boy was her rights. The “Train Sauce” (or “Dion Brothers” in the form in which it was printed) was an absolute decoration. Great performances, bizarre characters, clever plot, funny comedy and just a great pastime. Rarely do you see a crime film that is so interesting and fresh. Margo Kidder in one of her earliest films is also very sexy. I hope that some cable networks will get this film and allow many more to see it. In the meantime, go to the indie video store and hope you have it.
