Of course, it seems that in each episode there is only about 17 minutes of real content, but it is certainly interesting to watch. You can be in a chair when a friend puts his foot in his mouth and gets shot, or chuckles and shakes his head when some ridiculous line actually works. The host group has a more good-natured, friendly (I dare say, Canadian) style of commentary compared to the merciless reality show in the US I think that people who complain about this show do not get a joke. They take the show more seriously than the show. The keys to the VIP - this is a great caricature of the reality show, sports television culture and club scene. I hope they make another season, and I would be interested to see if the American version will appear. This is, of course, a fun, original premise.
