The film, shot at the height of the Black Force movement, depicts the African-American Putney Swap (Arnold Johnson), who became the CEO of the corporation after the death of the white CEO (all white executives hate each other and cannot decide who should succeed the previous CEO). Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know how Robert Downey Sr. did, but he did! "Putney Swope" - this is the final blow to the power structure of America. It is as if it occurred to Richard Pryor. This is a comedic classic in every sense of the word. A real masterpiece. Fun.
