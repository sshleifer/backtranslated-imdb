Leos Carax is great and is one of the best filmmakers in the field, so it’s no wonder Pola X is an almost perfect shot of the most painful story. Seriously. If I could find a way to get inside my video monitor, I’d beat Pierre half to death. No one has the right to be so self-absorbed and so stupid at the same time, with the possible exception of Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's “Dirty Heights”. After spending 134 minutes with Pierre, I need a big glass of brandy. I have never been so angry with the main character. Well, having said that, Pola X is a terrific movie from one of the few absolutely honest sex scenes I've ever seen in any movie ... which means another piece of brilliant filmmaking ... here, by the way. Pola X, hell, will knock you out of the rut, so make sure you're ready for this if you decide to watch it.
