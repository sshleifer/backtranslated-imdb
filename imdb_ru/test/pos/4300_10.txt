This is a terrific movie. Crude and sublime moving. It was like a very exciting, clever stage play (but without the excessive theatrical feeling that you can get by watching people on stage), which plays on everyoneâ€™s fear of white lies, with horrible consequences. All major players are fascinating. In the end, Tom Wilkinson broke my heart ... and everyone else is judged by how much he does with his handkerchiefs and his hands rising to faces among men and women. Julian Fellows won again. He is a national treasure. Gosford Park, Vanity Fair, Mary Poppins ... and now it is. Can he do wrong ?! Go and see! This is a film for real adults.
