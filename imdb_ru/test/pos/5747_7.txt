This is a very believable film, in which everything looks almost the way you want it. I am a Christian and I liked the movie. He had some average actions from the main person, and it was a low budget, as you can clearly see. It may be a bit boring, but the film has some pretty good cars that save me from a lower rating from me. Like a Christian film, it was pretty good, but perhaps a bit believable. The film works best on the big screen. * SPOILERS * A fight scene with two brothers can remind you of a fight scene between two brothers in the Christian thriller "Streets of Charity" with Eric Roberts in the lead role. * End of Spoiler * I give it 7/10.
