"Hey, I did not order a taxi!" "Yes, well, you have one ..." What can I say about Hack ... what a man among men. He was an agitated ex-cop turned into a golden-hearted taxi driver. If you could (and, fortunately for American viewers ... one person per week) penetrate the cold, hard surface of the exterior of the Hack, you should see a caring person who is committed to justice. The show was great, I laughed, I cried, I smiled ... all in the same episode. My hands broke into goosebumps when our dear friend Hack left his cabin in another dark alley ... no more than fists ... ready to avenge the offended civilian. A smile would have flashed on my face when a criminal was visible on the screen in the expressions of a dark alley's face, when the lights of the Taxi of Justice lit up his face. Week after week I canceled my duties as president of the Klingon Association to enjoy the warm glitter of Hack's brilliance. I have never seen a better show, and I mourned the loss of one of Americaâ€™s greatest treasures when the show was canceled. In other news related to Hack, I would like to announce to the world that my wife and I expect the appearance of Hack Koen in about three weeks.
