This film interested me from the very beginning to the very end with a lot of laughter and real touchdown, played by the whole actor. Glynn Thurman, (Peach Jackson) - the star of the picture, playing the role of a smart guy who loves poetry and has a very sexy girlfriend. Lawrence Hilton Jacobs (Cochiz Morris) was an outstanding athlete in the Cooley H.S. and even won a scholarship at a famous college. This photo has scenes from the Chicago police department, chasing all these guys in Cadillac, and visiting Lincoln Park Zoo with scattered monkey manure. The music is wonderful, and there is a beautiful picture around Chicago. Great movie, enjoy.
