As a man who rode for hours on the back streets of North London, trying to avoid a terrible congestion, he immediately liked this film. Be interested in how London was at the end of the 70s, and you have a basic premise for my version of television paradise! On paper, the film is marked with all the necessary frameworks, and having just viewed “Knowledge,” the cinema itself, of course, justified, if not surpassed, my high expectations. <br /> <br /> Visually, I was surprised at how different London looked back (I lived in Islington in the 90s, long after gentrification changed the area). It really seemed dirty, inconspicuous and missed. In London, there may still be bad residential complexes, but the overall feeling of this place is much cleaner, brighter and more pleasant today (based on what this film shows, and not on my own memories). <br /> <br /> With regard to the history and current, well, the highest ratings, obviously, get to Nigel Hawthorne as a vampire. Absolutely brilliant! He acts deliberately unpredictably, alternating between absolute seriousness and surreal mind games to upset the Knowledge Boys, as he puts them to the test for testing. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was an excellent, completely enjoyable journey back to a very specific time and place, which I find infinitely fascinating. But even if you are not particularly interested in London around 1979, you will still like to follow the ingenious dialogue and cute characters of "Knowledge".
