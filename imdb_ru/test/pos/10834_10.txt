I noticed that people were asking if anyone had this show. I have all 26 episodes that went on the air in the USA, and I will be ready to share them with all those interested. All I need is for you to put VHS tapes or blank DVDs that I have in both formats and pay for shipping. My email address is: creator67@pipinternet.net, just send me an email and your request, and I will inform you about it and we will be able to agree. The quality is very good, and they are very pleasant to watch, especially if you have not seen them since they went on the air in the 60s. It was one of my favorite performances in childhood, and it held a special place in my heart, because it brings back many memories of my childhood, as well as other shows, such as Ultraman and Astro.
