Much more eloquent reviews than this describe quite a spectacular game, casting and styling this film. It seems that the only negative reviews relate to the perceived imbalance in the solution of the film moral issue (euthanasia). <br /> <br /> This film, with the exception of the last scenes, carefully underlines Ramon’s conviction that he doesn’t emphasize that for him a life without dignity is a life that is not worth living. We, as spectators, see a huge amount of dignity in his life - we see his family, friends and culture and, beyond its physical limitations, life has completely lived. Central to the tragedy of this film is that in fact there is only one person who believes that the life of Ramon is not worth living - this is it. <br /> <br /> To watch this film and say that the only counter-argument from visiting an awkward priest is nonsense. The visit of the priest is a pure farce, a direct attack on the simplicity of the answer of the Spanish Catholic Church to the problem of euthanasia. However, the sister's farewell words to the priest for a moment expose the powerful moods "against life" that underlie the entire film. We are constantly encouraged to see the hope and beauty of life with love. As the film progresses, we may be gradually prompted to understand Ramon’s reasoning, but we never put up with his decision. <br /> <br /> I don’t remember the movie that touched me and provoked as much as this one.
