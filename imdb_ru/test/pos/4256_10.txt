If you have a chance to get this lost (for many years) gem, I doubt that you will be disappointed. PS has a strange mixture of social satire and ultra-cool exploitation - even hints of farce, but it is so strange that he not only outpaced his time, since then there has been nothing of the kind. <br /> <br /> I strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated, especially with "Bamboozaled" (SP?) Spike Lee several years ago, which was an unsuccessful attempt to capture the same message. (Good filmmaking, incoherent screenplay.) <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Downey is brilliant, allowing many of his actors to improvise, the film gets better as you go, and jokes are entertained by hitting or missing single-line lines that are forgiven as , like those found in Mel Brooks’s comedy, just for non-PC. I can't believe they just said it was “fun.” <br /> <br /> Favorite videos, commercials. The film switches from the sandy black and white images of an advertising agency to a beautiful (perhaps 16 mm) color and gets away with it. <br /> <br /> I refuse to hint at any spoilers, but if you have the opportunity to watch a DVD version, be sure to watch the Downey interview (but leave it until the end of the film). <br /> <br /> My voice 10/10 is the most underrated film of the late 60s, early 70s. Thank you, prince.
