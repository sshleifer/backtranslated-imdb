This is one of the most outstanding horror movies I've ever seen in my entire life. Forget about the exorcist and all the other horror movies about the hype. John Carpenter shot a terrible epic with amazing special effects, great performances by Kurt Russell & Co. and a great soundtrack that will haunt you forever! The great thing about this film after 17 years is that it is not dated, it looks fresh and new, and there are not many such films. In 1982, it was against E.T. and, of course, he failed and was the bomb's box office. Over the years, THE THING as became iconic thanks to sales of video and television, as well as a large number of new fans. In the end, this film kicks ass, and for me, as never before, a loss is an edge to scare you and me, this horror film. Long live John Carpenter!
