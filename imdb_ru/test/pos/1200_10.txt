The songs are fantastic and the storyline is good. Like many other schools of acting, mine also produced hair. For most hairstyles, this is a great opportunity to make nude, but my production was fully dressed ... I do not think that full nudity in a film or play guarantees artistic quality ... Like the filmmakers. The film version is gorgeous, classic hits follow each other, allowing the plot to evolve to a chilling peak. Great cast, dancers and singers.
