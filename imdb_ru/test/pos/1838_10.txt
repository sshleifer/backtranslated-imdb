"Return to me" - a charming gem of the film. With an absolutely star cast, who can go wrong in this modern day fairy tale? It also includes many, many jokes written by the funniest girl Bonnie Hunt who wrote and directed this film. David Duchovny is also very good, showing a different approach than his eternal alter-ego Mulder on my favorite show, The X-Files. great movie date!
