This show is my pleasure from guilt! When I first tuned in to the American Top Top, I expected her to be bored, and I find it very, very stupid. I do not This show is really serious fun. I read in one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America’s next top model. And so it is! Who doesn't love the glamor and excitement that come with being a model? At ANTM you can see what it really is. And who doesn’t like to hear girls quarrel with each other and fight? Or do you like to throw something at this lady Janice? <br /> <br /> Give it a shot. Do not expect something clever or a show that you can watch on the lesson of life. Just enjoy that which is. Serious fun!
