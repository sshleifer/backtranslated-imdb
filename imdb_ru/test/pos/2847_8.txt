Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but that was pretty close. This film jumped from a crime drama into a romantic comedy with fools and returned so quickly that it seemed like two different films that were played at the same time and then reunited at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found that the bloody parts (such as the scalping scene) are also fun. I almost vomited, but I think it's just me. Greg Kinear is great as a soap opera actor. He has the ability to perform these overly dramatic soap scenes with the correct facial expressions and voice intonations. His scenes with Betty seem like something like Insomnia in Seattle or some other romantic comedy like this one. You almost forget that Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are looking for Betty. Morgan Freeman's charm with Betty was pretty creepy, considering that he could almost be her grandfather, but the scenes where he talks to her photo are definitely worth a few laughs! Chris Roc's performance seems rather wooden, but he has his own moments. Renee Zellweger is as sweet as Betty, an attractive waitress with a rude, unfaithful husband who treats her like dirt. It is unlikely that she would really get a job at the hospital without any real authority, but hey, this is a film, just agree! Her roommate, Rosa, also shines like a woman who cares for Betty, but doesn't quite know how to deal with Betty's disease. And finally, Crispin Glover. As his fan, I naturally thought that the film could have been funnier if he had been in it anymore. No one else has such a style of play as Crispinâ€™s, and the argument between Chris Rock, Crispin and the sheriff about the soap opera is ridiculous. I guess I say that I really liked this movie! If you can survive the blood, violence and a lot of obscene language, it is worth it to look and give you a lot of laughter!
