On a dark, gloomy New Year's night, a sick nurse, her life slowly dying away, demands that David Holm be introduced to her immediately. We still do not know who David Holm is or why this nurse wants to see him, but her only dying desire is to talk with him again. On the other side of the city, conveniently located among the tombstones of the local cemetery, Holm (Victor Shstrem, who also led) and his two drunken supporters are eagerly awaiting the coming of the New Year. “Here we can say for sure when to drink the New Year,” exclaims Hill, pointing a finger at a large clock tower that looms in the dark. However, few know that he will not be alive to greet him. <br /> <br /> To pass the time, Hill cheerfully tells the ghost story. He once had a friend named George, "a funny guy," who was "smarter than all of us." On New Year's Eve, a few years ago, George broke out in a potentially catastrophic scuffle, fearing that the last person who would take his last breath before midnight would be condemned to drive a ghostly chariot for the next year, following Death's orders and collecting the souls of the deceased. "And, gentlemen, George died on New Year's Eve!" - Hill happily completes, not bothering himself with the ridiculous skepticism of this man's beliefs. <br /> <br /> Of course, the fate of an unexpectedly violent encounter leads to the death of Hill just at midnight. When the transparent spirit of a man cautiously rises from his earthly body, he, to his horror, testifies to the distant approach of the ghostly carriage. The driver, a frail masked figure - a sickle, tightly clamped in his hand - comes down from the carriage and approaches. We are surprised to find that the driver is nothing more than a decrepit George preparing to transfer his terrible debt to the successor of this year. <br /> <br /> Given the era in which Körkarlen is being created, the special effects in this film are absolutely gorgeous. Cinematographer Julius Jenson used a double-exposure photograph to create a creepy, ghostly silhouette of a carriage and its cursed driver. Even today, the end result is very effective. A particularly impressive scene involves a ghostly chariot that travels to the bottom of the ocean to bring back the soul of the drowned man. In another scene, reminiscent of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) in the Stanley Kubrick film The Shining, Holm breaks the kitchen door with an ax to get to his fleeing wife and children. <br /> <br /> Really ominous and disturbing in his performance of the film “Körkarlen” by Viktor естeström is an excellent film work, which successfully describes Hollow’s steady alcoholic decline, its inevitable doomsday and the final encouraging possibility of redemption.
