This movie is worth what you can hear. Marie Dressler’s speech (I hope I write this correctly) as a drunken old chatter is reason enough to watch this movie. This is an amazing presentation. She is in a drunken stupor in three scenes for quite a long time, and she never does the same thing twice. You can smell the alcohol when it finishes. Amazing. And Greta, of course, speaks her first lines about the film, and she’s gorgeous. Eugene O'Neal's story is solid and, like most of O'Neill's stories, very deep and rich. This is not a light entertainment, but if you really appreciate these great actors of the characters of the 30s and 40s, you'll like it. Part of the film is technically fuzzy, but generally worthwhile.
