This is one of those films that are getting better with every viewing. I watched it three times and actually registered with IMDb because I wanted to comment on it. Movies "about food" were shot before, some of them are really good - like, for example, a certain Japanese comedy that Asian movie fans will still recognize. But this one is really in its own league. It is based on a Protestant Christian parable, symbolizing the ideal of kindness, but it is not only dogmatic, but also affects the "good" in each of us, regardless of our religious beliefs or their absence. In Babette's Feast, there is a piercing understatement and refinement, but this makes the idea of ​​the film, in any case, stronger, and not at all weaker. If you cannot attend the unusual physical banquet offered by Babette, you can still attend this celebration of the soul. Highly recommended !!
