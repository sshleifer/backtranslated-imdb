Infinity infuriates me that now and forever I will have to identify this film (which I consider to be a masterpiece, and I do not use this word lightly) with the qualifier “Not Michael Douglas film!” Not only are the names the same, but they refer to the same - radioactive fallout, which fell on the survivors of the first nuclear bombardment. In Imamura's film, this is not a cheap metaphor; the whole film is about the consequences, physical and emotional, from Hiroshima and the war itself. As the deterioration of the couple and their adult niece becomes increasingly dark, the ironic images become more and more powerful, starting with the old hours, which are reset every night, to the stone gods, who gradually accumulate outside the door of the heroine. (They, in turn, are cut by a veteran in shells, who in a series of tragicomic episodes are forced to attack something with the help of a motor that approaches the city.) The bombing day itself is shown with partial memories that terribly terrify. However, “Black Rain” (“NtMDm!”) Can be observed, even several times, because of Imamura’s compassion for his characters. I repeat: a masterpiece.
