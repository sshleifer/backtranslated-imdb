I was pleasantly surprised to find a very nice film that kept my attention everywhere. I'm a horror fan and I see almost everything in this genre, but the Dead Line managed to scare me. The pace is very skillfully set, and Andres Bagg shows himself as a desperate man. What is under the main plot? Ride to the madness. How can you finish like that? Martin Sanders asks himself while he sees a homeless person talking to himself alone on the street. Toward the end of the film, the character of Aaron Mandel asks the same question, while he sees another homeless person doing the same thing; not knowing yet that this homeless is Martin Sanders, answering the question about the beginning of the film. Broken glasses in two are a clear symbol of breaking and separating ... personality. The end of the jaw, and you just know that the sequel has to be done.
