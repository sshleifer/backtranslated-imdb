The composition for this production of Rigoletto is excellent. Edita Gruberova sings Gilda beautifully and passionately. Luciano Pavarotti also sings great. Vergara - beautiful Maddalena; Feodor Barbieri is a famous elderly singer who sings the maid Giovanna. Veikl sings Marullo; Pixel sings both Rigoletto and Monterone. Like Rigoletto, Wicksell is perhaps the most persuasive actor singer in this consummate ensemble of great singers. Kathleen Kuhlman in the Countess. All directors are well known and famous all over the world. <br /> <br /> This is an exciting Rigoletto both visually and musically. <br /> <br /> I have it both on the laser disc and on the DVD. You must have it too!
