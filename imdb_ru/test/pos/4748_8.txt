I recently filmed “Seven” on video, and I must say that it was a very nice movie. Roy Shader and Tony Lo Bianco are great as a policeman and a crook, respectively, and young Richard Lynch is as magnificent as Crazy Moon's assistant. The late Bill Hickman is pretty good as his assistant, Bo, and sets up a brilliant chase after car that will make you stand on the edge of your seats. The remaining three members of the Seven-Ups team are pretty soft, but that was to be expected. <br /> <br /> I am glad that many people on this site supported this film. I think it should be a film that should be released on DVD, and not just forgotten. I certainly enjoyed every minute of it. The final scene between the two leads is excellent, because the bad guy has to face the consequences of his actions. Seven-UPS does not disappoint.
