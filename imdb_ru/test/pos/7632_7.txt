A surprisingly good film, shot after the Exorcist, about a young woman who is possessed by the spirit after she goes to an empty church to restore the size of life and a life like a crucified man. The part was Christ and two thieves, but Christ was sold out long ago. The trouble begins when the figure is removed from the cross, and it seems to come alive and seduces the woman. From this moment on, it becomes a battle for the soul of a girl. Creepy, scary and much better than you think, the film works, because its composition sells events that are clearly adults. It helps that these are real people with disabilities, so itâ€™s easier to communicate with them. I really liked this film, and seeing it again, for the first time in ten years, I was shocked how good it was. Definitely better than any of its countless shocking names.
