In & Out was a funny comedy with good performances by Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck, Matt Dillon and Kevin Klein. The idea that Kevin Kline was gay was very funny. If I were him, I would not want to say that I am gay at his own wedding with his family, friends and that he is going to be a wife there. This very rarely happens. I also loved when he danced, when the voice on the radio spoke to him. I would say that In & Out was a stupid comedy with lots of laughter and giggling. This is a recommended comedy, and Kevin Klein is excellent as gay. Believe me, you will like this movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
