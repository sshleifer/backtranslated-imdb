with this, carry the same dark weaknesses that we all unfortunately possess: lies, deception, laziness, the list goes on. <br /> <br /> However, as an American, I was shocked to see that corruption and racism exist in the modern world. the police force, as evidenced by a terrible detective of the Duvall County Sheriff's Department, and the police are working with the murder of a white woman tourist and a 15-year-old accused black youth. I shyly shook my head that the detectives were protected from their abusive work, while the young man's LIFE hung on a curve of equilibrium of justice. <br /> <br /> However, there is a story of hope with our judicial system and the way low-paid public defenders stuck in their guns (deliberate irony) and ousted the truth from detective stories. I wanted to fly to Florida and tell any influential person what a great team of public defenders they have in Duval County; These lawyers care about the "little" person and, most importantly, about justice. <br /> <br /> Another storyline is about faith and family. Praise the family of the accused and his strong Christian (to present any religious faith) beliefs and remarkable family values. I hope they win their lawsuit against the Duvall County Sheriffâ€™s Department. <br /> <br /> Bravo for justice !!! Bravo for the little guy !!!
