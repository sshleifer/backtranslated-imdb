This film should be as perfect as John Ford. The film is a magic, a masterpiece, the reason why Ford was, well, and Ford. If you want to know why Ford was great, that explains it. <br /> <br /> The photo is, of course, gorgeous, black and white, as it should be black and white, great shots, not a conversation over the shoulder. , pure Ford, great moments, big and small. Famous ripped pants Ward Bond. Obviously, the two dogs continued to invade the film set and fight, so Ford wanted to use them on the battle scene, but instead of fighting, one dog ran away and the other attacked Ward Bond and tore off his pants, which did not cause Ford endless fun . The whole scene around the weaving of the rope. The way Ben Johnson burned cuts his rope, which heralds a wonderful anticipation and anticipation of the final. Naive courting of Harry Carey Prudence. The usual Ford line is about how to be afraid and not show it. Bond's horse accidentally fell into it and remained in the film. Johnson and Bond are great in this scene. Lord, help any Ford actor who doesn't stay in character while the camera rolls, even when the horse falls on you. <br /> <br /> A couple of very enjoyable novels that do not affect the whole focus, two very nice presenters, not to mention girls, how many times the cameras focus on the rather adorable backside of Ben Johnson. <br /> <br /> A lot of old stuntmen taking on roles and roles, Cliff Lyons, Frank McGrath. Some wonderful characters study mostly looking people, all villains and major stars. Many villains who can compete with any group in any western region. <br /> <br /> A lot of Ford photos of people, groups, children, women, little things, foals in the background (it seems Ford loves images of foals) women in aprons, allowing the moment to cross the river carts, and the camera is delayed. <br /> <br /> This is probably not a western picture, but a picture of the artist, which, as it turned out, is set in the west. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the film was shot in 1950, because it is impossible to imagine that such a film could be made again, but then it is such a work of art that it would be blasphemy to try it.
