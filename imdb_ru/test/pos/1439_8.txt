A grim and painful look at the dangers of addiction, Sinatra is great in this film. It is enough just to watch his mad crust, cry and destructive rage near the end of the film, so that someone would think twice about trying heroin; perhaps they should show it to children in a health class instead of meaningless nonsense, which we have to endure year after year. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a person who is just trying to create a new, clean life for himself after being in prison, trying to get rid of his drug habit and his work on the distribution of cards in illegal gambling, which was pulled dirt is evil of human nature. It is used by his employers, drug dealers and even his mysterious, cunning, but stupid wife. <br /> <br /> Even if you didnâ€™t like the movie itself, you only need to watch the soundtrack. It's all heavy, swinging jazz with big drum and copper sections. This, with its excellent but slightly ominous sound, helps to create a mood, along with grinning, vicious drug dealers and cards that seem to always float like vultures around Frankie's car. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone - especially if you like noir films, art nouveau costumes, fedoras or jazz.
