The film, which earned theatrical release. This film for television is a cinematic gem that illustrates the technique of Michael Mann with exciting contemporary music, closely integrated with visual images. Always with Mr. Mann, the increasing influence of music is almost the same as if an invisible actor who had been awarded an Academy Award was added to the cast, the writer, the director and the cinematographer. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely one of my favorites of all time. While nothing is perfect, this film comes very, very close. <br /> <br /> Along with an excellent script, great directing and acting skills of Richard Strauss, there is a star ensemble of actors-characters in all its glory: Roger Mosley; Brian Dennehy; Ed Lauter; Jeffrey Lewis; Richard Mall; Miguel Pinero; William Prince; Burton Gilliam; Ji-Tu Kumbuka; Richard Lawson and Billy Green Bush. You may not recognize the names, but you will recognize each face. <br /> <br /> If this happens on TV, sit down with popcorn, turn on the sound for a stunning soundtrack and musical score and get ready for being chained. 97 minutes of the movie. I highly recommend recording it, since it is only available on VHS and DVD from Holland, and the DVD is region-encoded 2.
