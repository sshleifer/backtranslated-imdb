The Summer of My German Soldier was one of the many television films that became the main feature of the small screen in the 1970s (the others were Brian's Song, Sybil and Someone Looking at Me!) It depicts a Jewish girl (Kristi McNichol) who became friends with a German prisoner of war (Bruce Davison) in Georgia during World War II. One of the things that the film shows is that many German soldiers were not Nazis, but simply conscripted. After seeing the film, I felt that at that time everything was in the South; I mean, can you imagine yourself a Jew who is accused of supporting the enemy? <br /> <br /> So, I definitely recommend this movie. I believe that it is always important to show the things pictured here. Random replay keeps the film from a full-scale masterpiece, but, as a rule, it turns out well. I hope the movie will eventually be released on DVD. Also starring are Esther Roll and Michael Constantine (the patriarch of "My Great Greek Wedding").
