Glory has been one of my favorite movies over the years! This is not just a musical film of the 80s about “that” school in New York, this is LEGENDARY people no longer refer to the High School of Performing Arts, but the “School of Glory” !! <br /> <br /> The characters are real, they are not Hollywood and their stories are real. The film tells about them during the four-year school, starting with a powerful monologue of one student at the auditions and ending with an exciting graduation show. <br /> <br /> Apparently, some believe that the Broadway show is better, but it’s my opinion that you should definitely see this movie anyway, and then have your own look. For those who like to watch movies and would like "classics", this is definitely one of them. This is an example of one of those films that were really great, with actors that we loved during those two hours, and then never saw them again ... they are classic “Students of Glory”. <br /> <br /> make Glory live forever.
