I’m serious too, I mean, don’t get me wrong, if you don’t have a penchant for this type of Z-class, squeaky creature {why do you look, my first thought?} but for me it is a special nonsense that returns me to the pleasant time of my childhood. You know those memories that never leave you. I look forward to it with youthful amazement when Doug McClure and Peter Cushing pave a tunnel under the mantle to fight with many creatures and subhuman species. ” And guys! now that we have all grown up, we can most seriously admire the wonder of Caroline Munro and her severe schism. No wonder my older brother really wanted to take me to the movies to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the consequences are bad, the men in the costumes, the strings that ping the monster-parrots around, and the exploding rubber frog entertain us greatly, like little things. And yes, Cushing and the amazingly plump McClure behave as if they were really mesmerized by the evil Meihs in the “core” of our film. But it does not matter, crazy, awkward and filled with gorgeous color. “At the core of the Earth” is a return to a special period before ILM, when children like me lined up around the block to see such joyful nonsense. 8/10
