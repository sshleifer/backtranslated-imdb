The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is the anime that made a pretty strong impression on me. Partly for the characters, many of whom fall into the stereotypes of anime fiction / fiction, but placing these stereotypes in a rather ordinary setting of high school is a turn I appreciate. Then there is the somewhat insane title character who is something else: a stubborn, almost immoral girl with a ridiculous amount of talent and a secret she doesn't know about. <br /> <br /> Setting up the show for a bit of a trip to the head. In fact, Suzumiya, unknown to herself, is a kind of super-powerful being capable of the divine feats of creation and destruction, as she can destroy and restore reality at her whim. Our narrator and protagonist is Kayon, a high school girl whose sympathy / curiosity for Haruhi seems to force her to drag him against his will into a club in which she begins to revive her life because she is tired of normal life. In search of adventure, she demands three more unusual participants, each of whom has her own secrets, and they all end up being dragged into her crazy designs. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, we’re a little crazy, but pleasant, philosophical considerations discuss whether the world is just Haruhi’s creation, when she’s tired of the old, and whether our characters exist to serve her or to serve her to continue to exist or whether they can exist without it. This is a bit of a mystery, but still pleasant. While science fiction / fantasy scenarios happen occasionally on the show, I think the joy of the series is how normal things are, while stress remains that if things are too boring, Haruhi can destroy the world in the hope on make it more interesting. <br /> <br /> The art is pure and in line with what I’m used to expect from anime, which is usually imported to the United States; I like the character designs, and although there’s not much action on the show, I think it would be better. The series is narrated from Ken's mind, and he does not play an all-knowing narrator, but only comments on what he knows and how he feels. He has a lot going on, but in fact he says little, so it's good that we hear it. <br /> <br /> A voice in English dub is acceptable enough, but I prefer the Japanese to play over it. This series has several odd aspects, some of which are both a parody and fanaticism traffic, which seemed funny to me. In the first season, I have to admit that there is a lack of closure, as the series does not really have a big arc of stories, but it seems to take things one by one, so the series is easy to take and postpone, although I think that because The entertaining qualities are still quite difficult to overwhelm. It is also based on a series of light novels, and the author directly participated in writing the series. <br /> <br /> Although it is based on novels, I still would like the series to have stronger story arches, but I like how naturally we watch these characters develop and how well The series can play both quiet and crazy moments. It was a real pleasure to watch Haruhi grow by herself, as well as to observe how relations develop between the SOS brigade (Haruhi club). <br /> <br /> It’s not for everyone, because of its perverted background and “unusual creatures” in the worldly world. ” This is probably not going to satisfy fans who are addicted to action / science fiction / fantasy, and may be too frank for relationship-oriented drama fans, but for those who want to try something a little different or something similar. strange series like this one, I think The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a rather refreshingly unique and enjoyable series. More please. 9/10.
