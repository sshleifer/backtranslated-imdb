It was a great show. He appeared on PBS at home in Chicago, and I remember Cindy Herron (from EnVogue) playing a teenage daughter. The show dealt with topics such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. It was about a black middle-class family, who had a daughter and teenage son who moved to the middle class area from Auckland or somewhere else (I don't remember). I remember several episodes, but most of all I remember when their cousin first got it. I was probably 7-8 when I first looked at it, and I was able to keep up with the program. It was a great show. I can't remember the name of the guy who played the son in the series, but I always confused him with Kevin Hooks.
