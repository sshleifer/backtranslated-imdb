I had the opportunity to catch this independent film and was impressed by it, despite the lack of excitement in the plot. The game was very good by all participants. Amy Madigan played the role of a mother who is attacked by wine, who is tired, but with good intentions and intends to rectify the situation of her younger daughter. However, in the process, she neglected her older sister, who is more interested in playing with her brother and sister with Savant syndrome and living in the world of escapism. <br /> <br /> Men in the film are very strong in their supporting roles. Christopher Lloyd in a very understated role shows us why he is so versatile. He plays a teacher who is dedicated to his profession and literary research, but craves a constructive relationship. He and Madigan are very well connected to each other in their scenes, but both know that nothing can come of their friendship. Their silent farewell is nothing short of a brilliant, acting lesson for beginners. <br /> <br /> And in a small role, Fred Savage is fun to watch. <br /> <br /> You can understand why the film is based on a play; it is probably very good on stage. On the screen, this is not particularly exciting, but, nevertheless, very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties.
