Watching this show will probably make you feel what our parents felt when they first watched Star Trek. <br /> <br /> This series has it all. Stories that make you forget how to blink, characters that make you jump on TV to join the action, and an atmosphere that makes your hair curl in fear and endless admiration. <br /> <br /> In short, we start with John Crichton, an astronaut who was shot dead in a wormhole and ended up in a gang of prisoners running from the bad guys in black, ironically known as peacekeepers. <br /> Other colorful characters consist of D'argo, a big guy with a short character and a sword / laser rifle. Aerun San, a former peacemaker and Ph.D. in the field of batking. Zoto Jean, who is a plant. No, really. She is also a priest, but with malicious intent. There is also Dominar Rigel XVI, a fat lazy bastard who puzzles with helium and usually does more harm than good. <br /> <br /> Later on in the series, we meet the sexiest alien who has ever been on television, namely Chianu. Young and seemingly chronically excited non-barin. She is played by Gigi Edgley, a name you should remember. <br /> <br /> One of the many things that I like about these TV shows is that because John Crichton ended up in this part of the galaxy by mistake, he continues to give links to "Real Life." Namely, when it is difficult for John to accept the fact that he will be frozen as a statue for 80 years, one of his many complaints that when he returns, Buffy, the vampire slayer, will die. <br /> <br /> So Frarell all the other series, collect your own Dren and spend An on one of these episodes. I assure you, Sci / Fi, as you know it, will change forever. <br /> <br /> This series has it all. This is sexy. This action is packed. This is incredible. This is Farscape
