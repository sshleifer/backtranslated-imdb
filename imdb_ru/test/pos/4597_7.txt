Like social satire, idiocracy is as good as office space, but with wider coverage. I think that to criticize this film as too childish because of insignificant humor is to miss the moment. There are, of course, farting jokes, etc., But in reality they are not meant to be ridiculous for the audience - they exist to define the state of “culture” in the world of 2500 AD, which Joe visited, as background of a strange state of affairs in which he wakes up. The film’s true humor lies in the fact that many of the spectacles and views present in this future society are only a touch of what we face in our daily life, and which should serve as a warning. My personal favorite is the Fox News image. The subtle brilliance in the film is that he also catches the eye of "smart" people, and the average Joe loves heroes. Pay attention to the moments in the film, when Joe and Rita almost subconsciously obey the idiots around them, and you understand that idiocracy was created not to choose any particular group of people, but for the culture of idiocy in general. I don’t know what to say about Fox’s "plotting theory" behavior on release of this film, but if he doesn’t play in your local theater, ask for it. We all need to watch this film, if not a social comment, at least for joking jokes ...
