This is the film that I love most of all. I try to reconsider the main places in the films in Oakworth and Oxenhoop, when I can, which helps restore the magical qualities that this film seems to embody so uniquely - recalling the milder and more educated age with its unspoken assertions that people really make that family life is not just one-time, and this life is really worth living (although sometimes we can doubt it). In short, a film that soon causes tears in my eyes, perhaps due to deeply evocative music — some tunes are funny (for example, Perkov’s melody played on a trombone, sometimes with spoons), an exciting melody when the family first sets out to go to Yorkshire , not knowing what lies ahead, and an obsessive little melody played on a solo clarinet (or is it an oboe?) that precedes sudden changes of state in childhood. <br /> <br /> This is also a film for adults, as well as for children, referring to the eternal child in all of us - a key that effortlessly revives those deep and obviously long lost values ​​and feelings buried in us, which are usually ignored by the requirements of modern daily life. This is a film about basic human virtues and decency in which we, the audience, have to make from it what we do and have good touches of humor, sometimes added for good measure, such as the arrival of an aunt or, on a more Earthly level, scene Perk's bedroom on his birthday Perk - “Okay, Bert, - how's your birthday!” I have to know every scene, every line of this film, and nevertheless, the magic is so great that every time I watch, I seem to open a box of delights for the first time, enjoying every moment - sometimes with you rum, sometimes ... ... well, it is very different. As Peter says in the film: “It's perfect — more perfect than you know.” And so it is !!!
