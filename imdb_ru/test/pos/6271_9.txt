This film, Master of Blades, may be cheap, clumsy in appearance, and sometimes it is, but it shares thoughts about problems that go far beyond the era in which this film begins. Ator is the chosen one, who must protect the earth from terrible weapons, which is compared to atomic weapons in an unforgettable and unpredictable way. He overcomes obstacles like a witty character who is more than just muscle strength, although he has quite a lot. I would say that this aspect of the film is superior to the film, like the barbaric Conan, which, at least, can be called brainless. This in no way diminishes the great adventure film of Conan, but gives Aator his utility, which he does not share with the barbarian. For a film with a smaller budget, this film is good in terms of the setting, and the fights are in most cases believable. Zor, the villain, is held captive throughout the film, which is one of the most interesting psychological confrontations that create tension in the film, even if Ator seems too suitable for the task. <br /> <br /> What makes this film especially attractive are scenes that may look weird, but worth mentioning. The fight against the serpent-god, although he is a giant puppet, copes well, since the serpent with good lightning remains a silhouette, and the struggle is rather convincing. The climax of the film takes place in a most unusual way, rather anachronistic, but breathtaking: the sequence of a hang-glider. The scene itself is not presented properly, do not read at all where Ator took this car, it is rather unconvincing, but it leads to a really poetic and beautiful consistency in the air, which is separate, is the climax of the film, raising Ator a place where there were several human fantasy heroes. <br /> <br /> If Blade Master is not one of the best science fiction films of all time, this is not surprising because of its flaws, this is an even bigger surprise, given the philosophical approach he chooses in opposing good and evil, though and this shows the heart that this film is so undesirable. I offer this for every fan of the genre and I try to take it seriously as a smart film that needs to be taken more seriously than it seems.
