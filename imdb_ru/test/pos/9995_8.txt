As you know, "The best game in history" is a game of golf. I used to laugh at the overly dramatic title, but thanks to the brilliant visual presentation attributed to director Bill Paxton (better known for his role in the Twister movie and the funny supporting roles in Aliens and the True Lie), we find that greater value than the game. <br /> <br /> Although the film is about golf, it seems that sport is just the foundation of what is really happening. What actually happens is the story of people who are told that they cannot fulfill their dream, be it age or social status. The conflict between the desires of the son and the requirements of the father. English golf legend, who wants to return the title home, when the country breathes around his neck. <br /> <br /> Shea LaBuff (Even Stevens) plays Francis Uymet, a Caddy with a God-given talent who has never been allowed to play golf in the first place. Despite the resentment of the "gentlemen" of the upper class, one cannot deny that Francis had a gift. The big threat was the disappointment of his father, played by Elias Koteas (Sugartime, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), who felt that playing a simple game would never improve their poor living conditions. With the continued support of his mother, Francis eventually encounters his idol, golf legend Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillan). <br /> <br /> More impressive than the game itself was the cinematic achievement of the film. This proved that storytelling was successful thanks to pure cinema. The whole film could be told without dialogue. There are scenes in the film that create strong tension and strong emotions with photos only. In one particular scene, Francis Uymet swings, and the whole crowd turns their heads to watch the ball fly away, everyone except the face of Harry Vardon, stares intently at Uimet without a shiver. The way golfers visualize the field brings more aesthetic pleasure. <br /> <br /> A pleasant support line completes everything. Peyton Liszt enjoys love interest and looks worthy to play for him, and Josh Flitter plays an attractive caddy that keeps Uymet in focus when the pressure tires him. A golf fan or not, you will appreciate the film for its beauty and the reminder that the movie can be an excellent way to tell any story.
