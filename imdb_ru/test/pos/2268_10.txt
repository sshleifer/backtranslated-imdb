What an original work. I always liked Liev Schreiber, the “actor”, but now I need to appreciate a person on a multidimensional level. How did he get this field of sunflowers? Whether it was computerized, it really looked real. And how do you listen to the dog, knowing that you will get such performance? Does the academy have a category for animals? I think what I am saying is that I really loved this unusual, original, small indie film. From a great cast (no one would ever know that Eugene Hatz was not a professional actor), to a cinematographer (some beautiful frames) music (bought on a CD when leaving the theater) and, of course, two “D” (direction and DOG), Total "10". <br /> <br /> /
