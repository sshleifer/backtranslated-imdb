I was very pleased to read some bad reviews about this film. First, many said that they took their 4-year-old daughters and granddaughters to see it, and they did not like it. First, I do not believe that this is a children's film, at least not a film for very young children, and not 4, at least. He has a very subtle humor, but he is not meant to offer quick entertainment, as seen by Tom and Jerry or something like that. Many people also complained that everything is going very slowly ... I think that all these people are accustomed to quantity, not quality. Despite the fact that I have a small problem with the quality of this film, and this is the fact that the film was not so focused on details as short films, I still believe that it coped quite well for a full-featured film. And how can people complain about jokes ?? The jokes were reasonable, timely and well thought out, never rude and offensive. Wallace is very clever, but cautious, and Grommit is the most charming, clever and cute character he can be. It was a wonderful film, and the topic was very suitable ... for adults, that is .... especially with the rise in obesity and metabolic diseases in the world, there is nothing wrong with promoting vegetables and fruits this time ... and this was done very tastefully in the sense that ... while people are concerned about the aspect of vegetables, this does not necessarily mean that they are healthier or that they eat more of them ... but just that they balancing nature, which is actually what made the legend of the rabbit come true. And for those who complained about religious jokes, I say ... come on! are you serious? Many villages revolve around the local church, and legends / presentiments, etc. Are normal subjects, no harm has been done. This film was just awesome, but some had negative comments, and I find it absolutely absurd !!!
