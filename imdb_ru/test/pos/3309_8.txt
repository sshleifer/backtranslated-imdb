A nice movie that will give you romance, psychodrama of women on the verge, sexual harassment in the workplace, adultery and fashion. It is all there. Typical characters are found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is an ordinary female bitch who has worked for a long time and feels the need to be so because she is with the big boys. Nadezhda Lange is an ambitious entry-level worker who decided to reach the top using her mind, not her body. Their personal life is secondary. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe for the movie is excellent, but someone forgot to tell hairdresser Stephen Boyd that "a little smear will make you!" The amount of Brylcream in Steven Boyd's hair is sometimes distracting. The relationship of his character with the character of Lange was never fully developed, which I found disappointing. In general, the film is nice. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
