The whole world falls prey to the deadly disease, and the rain never stops: nevertheless, in this nightmarish atmosphere, man and woman discover that they are neighbors, thanks to a hole in the floor in the manâ€™s apartment. They fall in love: at least everything would not have been lost. Although this wonderful film expresses the loneliness and weakness of a person, there is also room for hope in brilliant singing scenes.
