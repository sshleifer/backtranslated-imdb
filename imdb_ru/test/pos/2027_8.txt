I saw this movie when it came out. I thought it was an average movie. Now I realized that this director was ahead of his time. This is a great movie and a great soundtrack. I saw my share in rock films, but although this is far from a spinal blow (which I didnâ€™t like)> This film really takes us into the life of an 80s rocker who wants to be nothing else. This is nothing like our inner child, who wants to grow up and become a * rock star * Yes, I said that. Everyone wants to grow up and be in the light (says the weather or not). This film simply immerses you in the essence of emotions, and you almost feel Izzy's excitement. I have to admit that acting was less than nominal, but the music and history was enough to keep you in it until the captions rolled. Worth a look, especially if you are a fan of powerful hair bands.
