Like a few people I know, I was late for the Stingers; only until 2000. Three years later, I would never miss an episode. The show is really so good and, more precisely, it has retained its integrity, unlike, for example, from the "Blue Healers". Crime is a thing; There is a personal life, but it only affects the effect! When Gary Sweet was invited, some fans seemed worried, but he really felt good, which didn't surprise me. Gary could compare with any British or American actor in a similar series. The composition of the actors sometimes changes, but each change brings something new and fresh. The Stingers, possibly with Australiaâ€™s best team backstage, will continue to be the foremost drama series.
