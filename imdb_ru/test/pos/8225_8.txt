Ronald Coleman was the star of the screen for several years, when there was talk, and how it affected his career. His Oxford English accent is so fascinating that I could listen to him, reading the farmer's almanac, and not be bored. <br /> <br /> Coleman plays Willie Hale, a 30-year-old playboy from a wealthy family who spends time doing women's work and gambling. Nevertheless, he is a cute swindler - not only pleasant from the point of view of the audience, but also from family and friends. He again went bankrupt because of his regular gambling and is selling his possessions abroad in order to pay off his debts and secure a return home to England. When he gets there, he is first met by his father, who insists that he expels him - he had it with Willy and his ways. However, five minutes alone in the room with Willie and his charm, and dad not only forgives dad, but dad gave him a hundred pounds. <br /> <br /> Willie then goes to rest with his day. sister and her friend Dorothy Hope (Loretta Young). That same night, Dorothy will be engaged to Grand Duke Paul, mainly because her father wants royal families, and in her life there is no one else special. The situation changes after her day with Willie, and soon a scandal erupts, as Dorothy refuses to marry as planned. <br /> <br /> Ronald Coleman always enjoys watching these early films that he shot for Sam Goldwyn, where he plays a confident adventurer, or Cad, or both. He has behavior similar to Errol Flynn, but he is unable to show Flynnâ€™s physical dexterity due to the disabling wound he received during World War I. However, what he lacks in physical dexterity, Coleman always filled in the dexterity of the soul. Loretta Young, who was only 17 years old when this photo was taken, shows the beginning of her beloved girlfriend who can burst into flames when the occasion demands it. Myrna Loy plays Willy's girlfriend from the past - Mary Creil - dancer. Here, Mirna still plays a role similar to the exotic parts of a vampire with which she so often gets stuck in Warner Brothers when she was a contract company from 1926, shortly before this film was shot in 1930. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty light and fresh romantic comedy from start to finish. If you are in the mood for some kind of escapist entertainment that lit the hearts of the audience during the Great Depression, this small film meets all the requirements.
