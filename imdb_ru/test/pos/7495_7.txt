“Thursday” is a good film, but we learn too much from other films in its genre, and therefore it lacks originality. If you saw Goodfellas, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and a bunch of other films that were inspired by this last one, you saw almost every part of Thursday. There is a scene that includes torture, which has the same dialogue as in Tarantino's Wheelchair Dogs. <br /> <br /> Still, this is a good movie. Since not all parts are taken from the same film, all of this has new ideas and nice touches. The initial sequence, to begin with, is quite impressive. We meet Nick (Aaron Eckhart), Dallas (Pauline Porizkova) and Billy Hill (James Le Gros). They enter a fight with a clerk at a gas station over a cup of coffee, and this ends with the death of this clerk and the arrival of a policeman. We have already seen a suitcase with a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Then we met Casey (Thomas Jane) in Houston. He is married to Christine (Paula Marshall), but used to work with Nick. She doesn't know anything. Then Nick calls him and says he is coming. We learn that he set up his friends, and the problems are about to begin. <br /> <br /> I cannot reveal what is happening exactly, but we meet some other characters, everyone is interested in money or drugs. Nick was also with him. Casey confused them. <br /> <br /> Very funny moments, a lot of blood, a very funny story with the participation of actor Michael Jeter and some surprises (although if you really think about it, you see that they are coming)) this is a good movie with very good views, shot by director Skip Woods.
