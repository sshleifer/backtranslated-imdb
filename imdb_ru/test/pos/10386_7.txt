First, the positive side: great work on the image of urban landscapes in accordance with the mood of the film. Some of the pictures may be pictures of De Chirico. Sophie Marceau, beautiful. <br /> <br /> Negatives: history is hard to believe. Unreal, one-dimensional characters look and condemn 100% of the time, as if they are on some kind of podium. This is not Antonioni from his earlier, much better films, nor Wandera, whom we all learned and appreciated. Malkovich excess baggage in this film.
