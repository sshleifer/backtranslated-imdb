This film is a benchmark in the history of non-mainstream cinema. Using montage is a quantum leap from relatively simple Strike comparisons (Eisenstein's 1st film). Take the stage on the steps and notice the repeated shot of the descending soldiers to repeat the horror point that really happened! Very intellectual monumental film, which all students of Cinema must see!
