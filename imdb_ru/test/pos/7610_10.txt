I thought this movie was really awesome! One of the best drew. I'm also a fan of Michael Vartan, so I thought he was so hot in this movie. Why all the bad reviews. I would love to watch this movie again and again if I could. I also loved the finale. This film clearly showed a smile on my face! I was also surprised that James Franco and Jessica Alba were in it. I love them both, so I also highlighted this film. In the end, when Drew makes a huge commentary on the truth, he does tell the truth about what sometimes happens in high school. Again, the movie was awesome. Defiantly 10/10. Hope this comment was very helpful for any IMDb reader.
