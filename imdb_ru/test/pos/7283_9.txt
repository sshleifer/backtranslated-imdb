A good film, all the elements of a good film were there: the story, the actors, the script and the direction. I sat all the time on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> No doubt this is a low-budget film, but I liked it more than many big budget films. <br /> <br /> Andres Bagg plays Martin Sanders, who deals with his unfaithful wife. Then a voice on the phone, and then just fear. <br /> <br /> Virginia Lustig is beautiful and gives a powerful presentation. She is a great part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked the growing uncertainty at the end, although we know that the main character may be involved, we continued to look at everything from his point of view and ask: Who is the killer?
