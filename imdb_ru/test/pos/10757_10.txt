After returning from a 20-year stay in China, the young missionary refuses to become a CAT for a gang of hooligans from his native city. <br /> <br /> This film is a bit away from Harold Lloyd’s previous films. It is dominated by comedy, based more on dialogue, often quite serious, and not on the complex sights that fed Harold’s classics of the past. However, there are some great moments that are purely visual fun, for example, when Harold tries to follow the gig along a crowded street or when he desperately tries to keep a nightclub stripper from losing her clothes. In the basement of Chinatown there is a scene where Harold happily jumps into the darkest comedy. But much of the humor stems from Harold refusing to be the culprit of the criminals who ruled his hometown for many years. <br /> <br /> And this is a whole collection of crooked politicians and thugs that Harold plays against. a group of excellent actors: George Barbier, Nate Pendleton, Grant Mitchell, Edwin Maxwell, Alan Deynhart, Warren Heimer and the Stuttering Fuzzy Knight. Perth Una Merkel is at hand, like a tobacco girl who catches Harold's eyes and keeps him intrigued by his reckless outlook on life. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers recognize Samuel S. Hinds as the father of missionary Harold; Charles Sellon as an elderly priest from Stockport; and Herman Bing as a German gangster - all without accreditation. In addition, for just a few seconds, Noah Young, the familiar face from Harold's silent films, which is being filmed for the last time in Lloyd's film, appears as the captor's attempt. <br /> <br /> Fox made a great movie. values, especially in the initial scenes set in China.
