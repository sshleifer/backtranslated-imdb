The film that John Waters gave us is one of the funniest films ever. Yes, it can be rude, but it is filled with hysterical moments that no one has done since then. The notorious scene with dogs should be one of the highlights in the movie. not a film for the easily offended, this is one of those films where you always see something new. Divine fulfillment is worth reputation. Mink stole hysterics. This film is responsible for the Farrelli brothers and the entire comedy genre Gross-out. I know this sounds a bit extreme, but think about it. Prior to this, comedies were very mill-like and almost identical. After this film, the comedies became weird and weird, but in a good way. I would give 15 out of 10 if I could.
