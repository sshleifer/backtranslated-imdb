I watch the show every day, and it's very interesting. It provides technical news updates, video games almost everything a geek. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, a gamer or something really, you will love this show. They have definitely improved their game since the guy is below my review (2006). This is the only place where I can get technical information. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Mann work great with each other, and there are always segments in the show that relate to things in the game, movie, comic book ... Universe. If you know these universes, you will understand the jokes. In short, aots is a fun show that gives me and any person all the news about everything that concerns you. I watch it right now when I type it, they are “in” San Diego, covering the red bull race. Pretty.
