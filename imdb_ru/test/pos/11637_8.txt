(*** Minor spoilers ***) <br /> <br /> If there is something in the world of silent clowns that puzzles me, then this is what Charlie Chase never received his well-deserved "breakthrough" in films. Well, okay, maybe it's not so strange, because he never starred in full-length films. But when I think about it, this explanation makes it all just more mysterious - because, damn it, Chase did not receive any offers to play a leading role in the games? One explanation is that his character, however funny, was simply too realistic to fit the longer story; without the parody elements that Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Langdon and other comedians possessed, it can be assumed that the comedy he shot and which worked so well for twenty minutes will be repetitive after a few more drums. I’m not exactly buying it, though, since the design of Chase’s gag is gorgeous and, I suppose, could at its best show only the interest of the audience for a longer period; at least, I am tempted to think so when MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE starts the show. <br /> <br /> Mr. Mus is not very handsome, and Mrs. Mus is hardly a “classical beauty”; he has the truly greatest front teeth among all the people on the planet, and she has a surprisingly large nose. They both undergo plastic surgery without the knowledge of the other, and when they accidentally meet a bit later, he does not recognize his wife, and she does not recognize her husband. A lot of funny misunderstandings begin, with many cunning jokes. I don’t think I’ll reveal anything else to make viewing more enjoyable for you. Because if you're a fan of quiet comedies, or even if not, MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE offers so many memorable moments in such a short amount of time that I would consider it just a shame not to see it; really silly, but no less extremely funny.
