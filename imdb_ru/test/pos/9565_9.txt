I saw this film with an open mind, not knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this film was written, shot and shot in such a way that every minute of it is a delightful clock. People do not think that they act, more like they are real people who really train dogs and lead the life depicted in this film. There are some wonderful moments when you laugh or laugh, some jokes can be dry, but presented in a very visual form. Highly recommended!
