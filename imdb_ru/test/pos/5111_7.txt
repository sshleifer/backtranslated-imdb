It was easily one of Ernest's most bizarre films, especially with regard to production design. What happened to the pink uniform? Unfortunately, this film probably destroyed Ernest’s series, turning the series into a “direct to video” series. However, Jim Varney played one of his best roles by playing Nash, his criminal alter ego. Error in the series, but in most cases it is not so bad (Electro Man's routine was a classic)
