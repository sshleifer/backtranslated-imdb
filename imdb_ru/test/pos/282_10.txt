In recent years, comic secret agents have returned with Mike Myers "Austin Powers" and Rowan Atkinson "Johnny Inglish", and more recently with Steve Carell in the widescreen version of the hit "60s" "Smarter!". <br /> <br /> Back in 1974, David Jason was wearing a holster on his shoulder and carrying an attache bag full of documents marked “Secret”. <br /> <br /> “Edgar's Top Secret Life” Briggs was his first lead role in the sitcom, after many years working as a supporting actor on such shows as Six Meetings with Barker, the series “Doctor” and “ Hark on Barker. <br /> <br /> Humphrey Barclay found him working in a theater at the pier in Bournemouth and was impressed enough to include him with Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Erik Idl in the children's comedy show “Don't Change Your Set!”. <br /> <br /> TTSLOEB called Jason “Edgar Briggs,” a well-meaning but incompetent agent of the Secret Intelligence Service. While John Steed had a bowler hat, Briggs had a trilby. While Napoleon Solo wore a radio knob, Briggs owned the tube. Objects fell into pieces in his hands. He read Confidential Documents in bed while his wife (Barbara Angell) was looking at Women, in one case it would be the other way around. When he traced a couple of Russian agents to the heliport, he accidentally turned on the Tannoy airport system and announced his plans to capture them! When he hid in the train to photograph the meeting of C.I.S. man and his enemy contact, he moved aboard with him and took him straight to Brighton! When he tried to organize the desertion of a Russian woman scientist, he took the “short cut” to escape his pursuers, but was hopelessly lost in the parking lot. Nonetheless, like Inspector Kluzo, he always seemed to come out on top in the end, much to the dismay of his colleagues. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, he was married. His wife, Jennifer, understood what work he was doing. Although once they had a scandal because of which she screamed at him from the window of their high-rise apartment: “The Secret Service is this, The Secret Service is this! You will never stop thinking about the Secret Service! ” He shouted back: “Think about the neighbors! They should not know that I am in the secret service! ” <br /> <br /> Briggs was part of a team of agents, including Coronation Street. the villain Mark Eden (he was psychotic Alan Bradley) in the role of Spencer, Michael Stainton in the role of Buxton and Elizabeth Cowsell The Doctor in the Sea in the role of the beautiful Katie Strong. They replied to the “Commander” played by the late Noel Coleman. The commander was abducted in one episode, leaving Briggs temporarily in charge of C.I.S. - which naturally horrified everyone. <br /> <br /> This fun show was from Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna, who wrote for the Doctor series. Instead of faking Bond, it was rather a series of serious spy shows, such as Callan (although there was a Bond melody). Thieves meeting in underground parking lots, hacking codes, plans for hijacked missiles and all that. Jason brought a lot of energy into the role, performing many of his own stunts, such as Briggs, falling down the stairs while decorating his apartment, and falling down the hill into a bin for papers, and reminiscent of those that can be found in The Pink Panther Films. <br /> <br /> Briggs had all the ingredients to be a hit. Unfortunately, it was not online. In the London area, he was dispersed on Sundays at 7.25 pm. where it was beaten in the ratings by the soap drama B.S. "Brothers". Then it was postponed on Friday at 7 o'clock in the evening. because I.T.V. I wanted to showcase my latest American import - the television version of "Planet Of The Apes". Briggs never found the audience. A similar fate befell the following major Jason show: “Lucky Feller” of 1976. Only in 1977 and in Ostrom inhale, he found his first successful solo car. <br /> <br /> You can see the title sequence (along with two short excerpts in German!) for this series on YouTube. Unfortunately, this is all you can see. Jason will not allow his early leading roles to be repeated or released on D.V.D. Great shame. At the moment, however, the life of Edgar Briggs should remain in the strictest confidence. <br /> <br /> CODA: I recently saw several episodes, and I am pleased to say that this is incredibly good.
