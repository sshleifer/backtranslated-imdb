I think it is better for a person to advise to read or watch (I prefer to read) “Twelfth Night” before seeing or re-reading “She is a person”. The film itself is good, but comparing the two and finding jokes makes it much more fun. Shakespeare was inspired by others. I think he would give a thumb. <br /> <br /> Garld Bloom said in “Shakespeare, the invention of man” that most people in “The Twelfth Night” should be locked up. Malvolio, the man on whom Malcolm is based is for no reason. People in "She is a Man" in their right mind. For example, Duke Orsino leveled more than Duke Orsino. He also shows that a man can feel without being gay. He shows great composure. <br /> <br /> This is a young comedy (clean), so there are no dark edges. For example, Olivia in the play mourns the death of her brother. In the film, she was abandoned. <br /> <br /> If you like Sir Andrew and Sir Toby in the play, they don't get the same attention in the film. <br /> <br /> jokes are quite often quick. The name of the hairdresser Pauls is given once. This is Antonio. Many people who have read the play say that Antonio loves a person more than a friendship. In those days, there was a deep love between men. Some see this as the sexual side - homosexuality was illegal. <br /> <br /> The only line from the play that I caught is when Duke Orsino quotes the coach about greatness during the game of Socar. In the play it says Malvolio, quoting Maria).
