I really liked this movie! <br /> <br /> Films and plays perform their tasks when they reveal the social, political and other problems that affect the majority. This film served this purpose. <br /> <br /> I identify with the plot and know the people with whom it happened. During the creation of this film, the concepts presented in this film were put forward to the public, but have already met with my friends thanks to people in influential positions. And I know what it is like when people do what you did to Angela Bennett with you, because they did it to me. <br /> <br /> I really liked the image of Sandra Bullock, depicting Angela Bennett / Ruth Marx. She portrays a pretty, intelligent and witty young woman who has the courage to avoid giving up to superior enemy forces, fight hard to keep her sanity and restore her life, and try to protect those she loves. The loss of self-esteem and the concession to this age-old attempt to raise fallen self-esteem, pandering to sex with a stranger, added a sharp touch of reality. <br /> <br /> The climax of the plot reveals the only real solution to this problem.
