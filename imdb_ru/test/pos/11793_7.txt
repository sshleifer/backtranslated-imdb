ALICE is a film that they shot in the 30s and 40s. Never tries to be an event. Just want to entertain. And it is. I was surprised by Kiefer Sutherland. In a role that could be a cliché, he made it a reality. The plot makes hints of Alice in Wonderland. The guy in white passes through the hole, and Kiefer falls. Like Alice, the plot is spinning and spinning, but with freshness you don’t see in small films. I really liked the direction, Sutherland, just a very fast and interesting movie.
