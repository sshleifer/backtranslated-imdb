Not many people seem to know about this film. Which is very bad because I think it is pretty good. Of course, sometimes this is a bit silly and can have a predictable storyline. But the filmâ€™s presentation is pretty well done. I think casting is good with cute actors / characters. Tom Selleck is a good baseball player (go to the head ... I guess not too tightly), and Ken Takakura (from Black Rain) plays the lead (the coach of the Japanese baseball team). There is not much to complain about. It's just a light, fun, funny comedy, and I recommend it.
