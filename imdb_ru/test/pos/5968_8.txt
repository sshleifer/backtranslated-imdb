During World War II, two Belarusian (Soviet Russians) soldiers try not to be captured by Nazi occupiers, as they roam the snow-covered terrain in search of food and security. If you don’t like black-and-white “foreign” films, you can still enjoy “Ascension” (translated “The Ascent” in English). Directed by Larisa Shepitko moves in the film unusually well, despite the fact that this is largely introspective work. Unfortunately, her premature death in a car accident made the last film of this Ms. Shepitko. <br /> <br /> After the announcement of the opening mission in a snowy forest, little can happen, but Shepitko and the changing environment make him unexpectedly thrilling. Leading players Vladimir Gostyukhin (as spiritually wounded “Fisherman”) and Boris Plotnikov (as physically wounded “Sotnikov”) successfully avoid crushing with ever-growing symbolism. Their allegorical representations under the keen guidance of Shepitko give a memorable and thoughtful provocative take on a familiar story. <br /> <br /> ******** Climbing (4/4/77) Larisa Shepitko ~ Vladimir Gostyukhin, Boris Plotnikov, Lyudmila Polyakova, Anatoly Solonitsyn
