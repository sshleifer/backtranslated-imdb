I stumbled upon this movie while switching channels to Tivi late at night. He continued to interest me about twenty years later because of an important lesson from real life, which he teaches us about the dark side of human nature. And although he tells a true story that happens in World War II, he surprisingly refers to the ugly things happening in Europe today. <br /> <br /> If you thought that “ethnic cleansing”, as it is called today, has something to do with race or ethnicity, you will think differently after viewing this story. <br /> <br /> I think I was rather naive, believing that evil follows any prescribed set of rules. Evil is the same as evil. <br /> <br /> This film provides a valuable lesson, and I especially recommend it, for example. church groups or civil rights organizations. <br /> <br /> I don’t think that it will be too easy to find and rent them, but I would really like to see her again, because there is one amazing scene in it, it gives a completely unintended and at the same time interesting idea of ​​banal the intricacies of "race experience". In this scene, the main character, who was captured by the Nazis at the beginning of the war, was “discovered” by the SS race and entered the room. There they play some guessing game, where an SS officer can determine where our hero came from (Anthony Quinn's character) and where his ancestors came from. Well, “go to find out” that Quinn's character is not a member of a “lower” race, but on the contrary, he is an ideal, typical Aryan! That does not mean much for the character Quinn, who is more interested in talking about the cities, rivers and mountain ranges that the SS guy just called ... However, being the perfect Aryan archetype has its advantages. Among other things, he can quit his job at a slave labor factory, where he wears striped rags, and at a slave modeling job, where he can wear an individual Nazi uniform. Yes, this is the best gig for a guy who always liked to wear beautiful clothes ... until the Allied armies arrive and recognize his face from the covers of magazines. <br /> <br />
