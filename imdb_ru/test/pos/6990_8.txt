It was a great movie, and the sequel should know that we are all right! The action will be non-stop, and I just bought a special DVD release with an animated background storyline similar to Animatrix. This will bring Vin Diesel back to the spotlight and hopefully give him the desired role in Spider Man 3 as Venom. He would be the most logical choice for the role. Returning to PB, this film, despite being an indie thriller, has a great story and characters with a background that scream that you want to learn more. If they were doing books or comics, that would be a great read. There was one thing that I felt was a bit unfinished. For the final it was necessary to work a little, but not every film will have a better final.
