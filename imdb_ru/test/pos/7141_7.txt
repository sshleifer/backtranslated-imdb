True, this is not the best movie of John Sales (“Brother from Another Planet”), but he is also not completely forgotten, if not for some other reason than his message. Like Batman, the parents of the Wild Item were killed in front of him, leaving him to fend for herself in the “Zone”, the corrupt part of an unnamed city where greed and violence reign. Instead of getting involved with such as Chopper (Robert Davy), Wild Thing fights for justice, using its taiji abilities and creepy cat impressions, sometimes igniting itself in the fire. He becomes something of a city legend, a modern Robin Hood and a hero for the ages. 1987 in all its glory, WILD THING LIVES
