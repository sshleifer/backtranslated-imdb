If you have a box with napkins, a comfortable couch, a large bowl of popcorn and no social obligations on Friday night, then this is definitely your movie! It is romantic, hot and difficult. For most of us, gay, religion is just one of those things that we did when we were children, and probably just starred in the role of a new boy and his mercy! But in recent days you have seen the struggle to be gay, when your whole world revolves around beliefs that completely contradict being gay. The two main actors were very hot, but at the same time they managed to conquer your heart and even make me “almost” cry (I never cried in the film!), Which, it seemed to me, was quite impressive for a class B film. I highly recommend this click, you will laugh, you will cry (if not your me), and you will definitely drool! I love it so much that I even bought a DVD for my collection. This is truly the most beautiful film ever.
