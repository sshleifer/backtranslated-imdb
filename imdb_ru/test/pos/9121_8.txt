I like the film, which mixed extreme expectations, laughter, style, good acting and a bit of self-parity. Hitchcock consistently dealt with this, and in Le Cercle rouge, Jean-Pierre Melville does the same. I was sorry when this long movie ended. <br /> <br /> I agree with the English commentator, who found the comments of one of my chauvinistic compatriots. I love French films, Italian films, English films, Indian films - and ever more rare good American films. I also feel that the writer who conceived the film for the fact that it is not even a good copy of the American gangster film completely missed the point. But I think it looks like jazz: either you get it or not, so why waste time explaining. <br /> <br /> Just watch “Le Cercle noir” and get ready for amazing entertainment.
