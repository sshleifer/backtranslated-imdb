Fantastic film with great Australian talent. Director Mark Lamprell dealt with a potentially sobbing subject that was humorous and refreshing. Definitely a highlight of the 2000 Brisbane International Film Festival. Australian film veteran Sam Neal, as always, was great as Frank University professor and new talent Matt Newton, who gave a performance in which people said: "You know, Bert Newton, Matt's dad!"
