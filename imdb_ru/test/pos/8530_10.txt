Well, first of all, I'm a big fan of horror films, but, nevertheless, I am tired of all these damned American horror films. They are all about the same thing - blood and violence. It's not even creepy. Well, the blood is all right, and all this - it does not even bother me - but this is not what makes the movie creepy! That is why I find this film fascinating - it is amusing to see a satire that makes fun of the concept "the main horror of the USA". American spray / rock films, they should not be creepy, just ridiculous. This is normal. But when they think they are “creepy,” it basically becomes pathetic. However, there are some great American horror films (Poltergeist, Psycho, Birds), but in the end it’s the same thing. That is why this film brought relief. Evil Ed is not just a cult film - it's a classic! I can't wait until lead director Anders Jacobsson makes another damn splatter film! Until I again have to watch Evil Ed - and again - and again! But I don't care - this is such an outstanding film!
