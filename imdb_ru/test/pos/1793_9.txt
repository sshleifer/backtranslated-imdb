THE FOUR SEASON CONSUMER was the first shot of Rainer Werner Fassbinder in mainstream adoption. For a stormy career that lasted only fifteen years, he managed to create an astounding amount of work in film and theater, both as a performer and as a creative producer, actor and director. Although this film may not please many viewers, the film has a lot to offer. The storyline is pretty simple. A person is ostracized from his family from the upper middle class due to emotional and economic problems and is unable to control his downward spiral. THE TRADE OF FOUR SEASONS is rendered with slavish devotion to elegant details, and each set is very carefully designed and engineered. Each item on the set looks painstakingly organized to evoke layers of emotional texture. Many religious paintings and icons adorn the walls of various rooms and seem to speak of Hans’s desperate search for spiritual significance or direction in his life. Many thought about how lighting and color were used to contrast and enhance the drama. Several times during the movie I froze the frame to marvel at the beauty of the composition of the frame. I broadcast this film, and the print was almost flawless and unsurpassed. Fassbinder hires its actors in an almost violent "anti-natural" style. He does his best so that the actors do not react in a normal or conversational manner, and this creates a rather unnatural effect. However, by doing this, he introduces almost “hyperreality” to the narrative. Instead of showing a worldly melodrama, the actors of an almost militant lack of affect force the viewer to confront the film differently. The film Fassbinder deliberately prevents the viewer to easily connect with the characters Trial and adversity. You are constantly outside, looking inside. For many, this will be an embarrassing experience, but I believe this is a unique and satisfying artistic adventure.
