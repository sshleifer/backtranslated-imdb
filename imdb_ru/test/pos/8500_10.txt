This type of show should not occur on television. This is a type of wit usually reserved for an independent film. This is what HBO only needs to do. The fact is that Denis Leary managed to create one of the best television shows in the entire history, easily joining The SOPRANOS, OZ, ED, and so on. My only complaint is that the show is not long enough ... an hour will make it better, but I can't wait for the next episode!
