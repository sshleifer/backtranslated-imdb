I saw this movie for the first time last night. I thought about it all night and this morning. I can not say that it was my favorite movie, at least for now. I need to see it again. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is awesome. Each shot has lyricism that one would expect in a film to which Wim Wenders is attached. <br /> <br /> It is always tempting to see de Chirico in any picture of rows of orders disappearing in the darkness, but in this case the analogy fits. In many ways, the figure of Malkovich, walking through the mist and wind of Ferarra, echoes the shadow of the statue outside the canvas, which often visits Milan in the main works of the Italo-Greek artist. He is slightly threatening, the presence that observes and, as a director, has an impact on the whole story. <br /> <br /> Wenders' dedicated fan cannot help but think about how Damiel and Cassiel roam the streets of Berlin, watching everyone, but not directly interacting with the people. And, following the metaphor of Himmel Uber Berlin, the angel (or, in this case, the director Malkovich) begins to interact with one of the stories. <br /> <br /> At the moment I have to stop being distracted by criticism. I need to watch the movie again. I am quite sure that this is the thread that will unite Malkovich's monologue. <br /> <br /> Perhaps his reflections and pontificates are a pretentious, empty dialogue that sounds good, but cannot be analyzed in real communication. Maybe that's the whole point. No one can make such a judgment with any degree of confidence or authority until he has done his homework. <br /> <br /> We must be careful when using the word "pretentious." It is easy to write off everything that smells of intelligence as pretentiousness, but this leads to a terrifying mental state, in which a single conversation, regarded as genuine, earthly or genuine, is the most commonplace. When we avoid all discussions about philosophy, God, existence, meaning, and all this candy, we set up our culture to die a slow, stupid and ugly death. Perhaps this is the warning that Wenders and Antonioni give us. This, of course, is not the only theme of the film, but I think it cannot be ignored. <br /> <br /> Another (and most obvious) leitmotif is satisfaction. A lot of things have been said here, and a thorough review of all the subtleties and implications of the development of this leitmotif would completely exceed the 1000 word limit for this review. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch a movie, But I offer a warning: this is not a standalone movie (at least I don’t think so yet). Some films interact so strongly with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their time that the viewer must have an idea of ​​the spirit of the time before approaching the film. Par-dela les nuages ​​is one such movie.
