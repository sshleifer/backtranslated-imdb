I discovered this late on the Turner Classic. I kept saying to myself: “I will turn it off as soon as it stops being funny,” but it goes without saying that I watched it all the way. <br /> <br /> I’m a drug addict from the cinema, but I have never even seen THE LISTENED this movie (or, if I did it in 1971, I forgot) It is worth looking only at the performance of Goldie Hawn as a tart language. Her game is a revelation in this film. Yes, the script is sharp and excellent (when was the last time they filmed a Hollywood comedy with a smart script?), But her game is outstanding. I never realized how funny Goldie could be, and that makes her later performances in roles like Laugh in the Film and Private Bejjamin a bit sad. In her later career, she is too unbearable compared to her minimalist, wickedly funny appearance. <br /> <br /> It’s nice to watch the young Mattau, the great Bergman and the star actor, but Goldie Hawn, who will make this film worth seeing again.
