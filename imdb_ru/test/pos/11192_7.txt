so I won't disagree with the critics, but I really wasn't completely excited about this film. I hesitated a bit to rent it, as I am passing through some of the things that the main character must experience. however, I took it off, thinking that I could experience a catharsis or at least understand that I was not alone. Although I understood the annoyance of the main character because of his careless cousin, I did not feel his inner struggle with isolation as much as I would like. I felt that a lot more attention was paid to his subversive cousin, extolling his greeting. it is a beautifully made film, and I really appreciate the use of silence to create a feeling of isolation.
