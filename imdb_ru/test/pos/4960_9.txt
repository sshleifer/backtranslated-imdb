I really wanted to write a headline for this review that would not seem trite or hoarse, but still described my feelings for this show. Now I see that it is impossible. “American Family” is one of the best shows I've ever had the pleasure of watching on TV. Several IMDb reviewers mentioned the word “beautiful” when describing this show. Never has a word been more appropriate. The cinematography for this show is awesome. Each scene and frame looks like a masterpiece. Lighting, camera movements, scene composition and colors ... I have to constantly remind myself that I am watching a TV show, not a cinema masterpiece. Lee Holdridge and Nathan Wang's account causes tears in my eyes. And most importantly, the acting skills of actors from all sides honestly and sincerely. I do not feel that I am watching the performances ... I feel that I am watching the real life. If only real life was so beautiful. <br /> <br /> “American Family” really raised the bar for high-quality entertainment on television. I highly recommend this show to anyone who wants to watch it. I could easily blame CBS for missing this show, but I must say that for me it doesn't matter who broadcasts it. I'm just glad that everyone will see it. So I thank PBS for not letting this show disappear into nothing. <br /> <br /> I should especially note how the finals of each season ended. The first was pure creative brilliance, and this brought me to tears. I waited to see if the second season would end in a creative way, and, of course, it happened. Again the tears. <br /> <br /> Thanks to everyone who participated in this. You really made a special piece of art with this show, and I sincerely mean it. It's a shame that we only have two seasons, but it's a miracle that we even have something.
