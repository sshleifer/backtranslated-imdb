What can I say? You expect from the BBC only the best in drama, and MESSIAH is no exception to the rule. <br /> <br /> MESSIAH is a great thriller, a truly shocking and creepy story about a serial killer that cuts out the victims' tongues. and replaces them with silver spoons. Police officer Red Metcalf (Ken Stott) and his team should try to unravel the mystery of seemingly random events before more people die. <br /> <br /> But be careful - despite the fact that the rating is "15" (in the UK) MESSIAH is a bit awful movie. Some of the murder scenes are similar to the scenes in SE7EN, and one or two can be really shaking. But if you can stand it, sit back and enjoy ... although, most likely, you will be on the edge or hidden behind it. <br /> <br /> The BBFC rated “15” for moderate violence and violent horror.
