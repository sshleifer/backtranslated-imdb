Do not be fooled: this is not just another tired example of how Girls from Space pretend to be a French ski team that came to Earth to collect as many sperm cells in the genre as possible, although in a brief statement we can assume otherwise. This film is a gem, an absolute gem that has enriched my life from the moment I looked at it. “Ach jodel mir noch einen” is a fun, exciting, action-packed and stunningly erotic Euro-Madcap Tour-De-Force, a roughly underrated Bavarian classic. <br /> <br /> Stop everything you are doing and run for hire or, better yet, BUY this movie immediately.
