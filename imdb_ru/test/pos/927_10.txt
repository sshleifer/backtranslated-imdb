Trilogies are very interesting. Some come out with a bang (The Lord of the Rings), some are getting weaker (the Matrix), some are lost in obscurity (Blade, Back to the Future), but some support the genius, this seemingly ever-growing bright light that floats beyond the surface of its flawless appearance Case and point: "The trilogy of three colors." This chapter in the trilogy, being the last, is the most philosophical and makes you think. In “Blue” we had a more visually stunning plot, more character-oriented, in “White” it was rather a frivolous, narrative story, where we listened more to what the characters say than anything else. "Red", however, is focused on "what if" and "how it turns out." He questions our own destiny and focuses mainly on the past and the future, and not on the present. <br /> <br /> This chapter tells about a young model who runs after a dog and returns it to its owner. Soon she learns that the owner of the dog is actually a cynical retired judge who monitors his neighbors' phone calls through modern spy equipment. All three films in the trilogy have very simple plot lines, but they bring much more into the story. Remember in the "Blue" the story of a woman who lost her loved ones. We are constantly shown ideas about contemporary French society and how this reflects the behavior of the character. “Red” is not only a young woman who finds refuge in the life of an elderly man, but also a chance, hope and fate. <br /> <br /> Irene Jacob plays the lead role in the role of Valentin Dussault, who is first found by an old man (Jean-Louis Trintignant), whose name we never find, is extremely selfish and disgusting. Although, thanks to self-reflective analysis and her voyeuristic intentions, she learns that the judge would be the perfect man for her if only he were 40 years younger. Irene lives opposite another, younger judge, who is very similar to the old man. This is “what if,” which continues to spin in the film. What if Irene was born 40 years ago? An old man would be her perfect match. But what if the junior judge is actually her perfect match, since he is very similar to the older one. Valentine does not know this, only we know, and Krzysztof Kislovsky subtly offers this in almost every frame in which Irene is located. We constantly fall into the face of his presence, as almost assumption about the fate of Irene. <br /> <I mention that the old man has no name for a reason. The reason is that it is very symbolic for a common topic in history. We have to compare the old judge with Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit), the younger judge, in more than one way. We learn that the old man once had someone he loved, but she left. In another scene, we see Augusta with a broken heart, when the love of his life disappears with another person. There are constant reminders of whether Valentine will ever meet this person. Even if they pass each other, not noticing every day. There is also a phone motive, for Valentina, this is a way to stay sane and renew her life, for Auguste, this is what leads to his broken heart, and for the old man, this is the only thing he left. These three elements serve as a shadow for the characters of their own psychology. This is a kind of statement about who they are and who they are. <br /> <br /> All three films “Colors” defend a certain principle, most common in France. “Blue” means “Freedom” (personal being), “White” means “Equality” (adopted by more than one), and “Red” means “Brotherhood” (for communication, education). And although this last chapter is obviously focused on the principle of Brotherhood, Kislovsky makes sure that he cites two others in order to connect all three stories. For example, we see an old man trying to connect with Valentina and enlighten her with his espionage equipment, which is a reflection of the principle of equality. In the end, we also see that Valentine is searching for the soul and that she cares more about herself than others (without picking up the phone when Michelle calls), which is a clear example of freedom. And after all three principles are established, Kieslowski perfectly unites all the characters in the final and most soulful scene. <br /> <br /> “Red” is where you could be if you were older or younger. It is about whether someone is perfectly perfect for everyone, and whether one person can change your life. The final chapter in the most inspirational trilogy ever made, this film breaks down the barriers of both directing and storytelling. It is not only about our modern life, but also about where life can and should be in our modern time. And although the film is more subtle than Blue and White, he boldly exclaims about love and compassion. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to imagine that “Red” was Kislovsky’s last film, and that he died at such a young age. Nevertheless, the trilogy will always be his masterpiece, and we will always remember him for his work, which is equated with Bergman, Fellini and Wenders as a truly remarkable director who has never been awarded an Oscar. Kislovsky, you missed you!
