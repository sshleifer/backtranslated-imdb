First of all, I watched this show since childhood, and I always liked it. Of course, maybe I didn’t understand this when I was young, but I still enjoyed it! And now that I have been able to understand this for several years, I love it even more. The musical score of this musical is the most amazingly detailed note I've ever heard! Every note is perfect, I don’t even need to hear the singing to enjoy it! <br /> <br /> Moving on to this particular production - this is great! Of course, no one could play Mrs. Lovett, except Angela Lansbury, and she does it perfectly. And she must, she plays this role for several years. George Hearn is absolutely gorgeous. The best Sweeney Todd I've ever heard. He has a wonderful voice, but he can pronounce his voice so well! His “epiphany” is incredible, as you can see from the reaction of the audience. Judge Toby, Anthony and Pirelli are also great in their roles. Everything is perfect! Well, I still need to move forward through the green finch and Joanna's bird. She just sings that song badly. <br /> <br /> This show CAN be appreciated at any age, but it is not always accepted. I'm not your typical middle-aged theater fan, I'm only 15 years old, but Sweeney Todd gave me a higher appreciation of music than I received from any other musical.
