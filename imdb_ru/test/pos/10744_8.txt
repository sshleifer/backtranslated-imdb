Hello! Being able to speak Cantonese, I found it very funny and could find all the jokes that could not be obtained due to language barriers. The fight scenes are spectacular, and this is a good film. However, I have my criticism. First of all, I find it is not as good as the first A-GO Project, and LOOK NOW! :-) The reason is that spoilers do not read if you have not seen the film !!!!!) because in project A Jackie ends up fighting with his enemy; the man he sent to kill, Sanpao. This is what he wanted to do the whole movie, and the fight was impressive. But in A II, although he fights with Chan, the scene of the battle between Jackie and his sworn enemy is not long enough, and the bulk of the action is directed against the people of the Empress. They are not so “bad”, and played only a minor role in the film in relation to Jackie, so, although their fighting episode is impressive, they are not the ones that Jackie hunts throughout the entire film, so leaving the viewer slightly unrealized. However, this is just my humble opinion, so do not take this word for word and see for yourself! This is a great movie in itself! Take care of yourself and hope your admiration for Jackie will increase! Regards, Ian PS. Do you know the police chief in A II? He is the same guy in the first strike - it's nice to know that he is still strong!
