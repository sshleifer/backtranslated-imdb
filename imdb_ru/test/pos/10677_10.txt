I saw this film in the early 70s, when I was about 10 years old. old on tv. It was after school, and when I looked, I was so passionate about the whole idea that two astronauts were sent on a mission to another unknown planet that I asked my mother if I could get a tape recorder. She let me. So I wrapped the microphone cord around the channel knob so that the microphone hung in front of the speaker. This film is the first I have ever paid enough attention to - and took care of the recording. (Audio only - there were no VCRs at the time.) The plot makes you hang on every word ... every minute of this movie ... The ending will amaze you. After watching “Traveling to the far side of the Sun” ... You will have memories of this for a long time. I have been playing audio for many years ... and "saw" it again and again in my head. Then - maybe 15 years later ... when VCRs were common, and they sold tapes in stores ... I always looked for it ... but I never found it. But when the Internet appeared one day, I searched for it, and in a second I bought it. So, about 30 years after I first saw it, I saw it again. WOW! ~~ That was impressive! Just for reference .. I should have watched it 50 times since then.
