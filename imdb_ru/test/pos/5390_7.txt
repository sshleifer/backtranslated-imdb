Gary Cooper is a cool guy. Always liked his calm characters. As some others have commented, there are some oddities in the script, for example, an American marshal who got his job and can't even hit the barn with a gun. The owner of about thirty hands, but it seems, can not keep him from the fact that his cattle did not knock down. <br /> <br /> But there are a lot of fast shooting Cooper to entertain you. <br /> <This film was shot in 1950. People between the ages of 20 and 30 cannot understand that these films are made for entertainment, not for Oscar. <br /> <br /> To expect Oscar material to make this film unfair. We are talking about good guys who find a way to collect bad guys. <br /> <br /> Rent, borrow or buy this film, try the corn and once again enjoy the chicken coop.
