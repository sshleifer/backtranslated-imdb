If there is one theme of this film, it is that people can cope with difficulties by having a good imagination. This family is poor, their father works at the cemetery, and the mother works in two shifts, and Peter is constantly chosen for various reasons, and he is increasingly disappointed that he is often mistaken for a girl. He is just beginning to approach the age of 10 or 11, when your perceptions begin to change, and he thinks that your appearance is beginning to matter. The background of this story is the World Exhibition of 1967 and the centenary of Canada. The greatest moments of the film occur during various fantasy episodes, where we see how they cope. Look at the flim, and if you ever had a childhood friend with whom you dreamed, and then for some reason lost it, you will really like this film. Children may like this film, but only adults will appreciate it, including references to the Bolsheviks and what parents will do for their children.
