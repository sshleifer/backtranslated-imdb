I read that Paolo Sorrintino's inspiration in “The Consequences of Love” came from the fact that he just watched a businessman in a Brazilian hotel and pondered what he could do there. The film unfolds to us in a similar way. We see the existence of Titta, who lived alone for 8 years in a hotel in Switzerland. He is secretive and avoids friendship. Order and regularity reign in his life. Gradually, the truth of his existence is revealed to us, until finally his world begins to disintegrate. <br /> <br /> The Secret of Titta is central to The Consequences of Love, and it works thanks in large part to Tony Servillo’s superb performance. His character becomes more intriguing for us when small details are revealed - he injects heroin once a week, that he has no imagination. Although some people here criticize the dialogue for being non-naturalistic, in my opinion, it does not matter - this is not such a film, and I think the script is great. The filming work is also excellent. <br /> <br /> If you have to criticize, the film in the later scenes really gets lost, because we discover the secret of the existence of Titta, and when his world begins to fall apart. However, the tragic final scenes are as good as the earlier scenarios.
