Since I grew up in Czechoslovakia, I have been following the history of pilots and crews of the British Air Force in the Great Patriotic War, their stories and tragic events in military or communist prisons and camps. This is, without a doubt, a more than dark chapter in our history, although the fact that these brave people to whom we can go through all this and recover after this is amazing. For all the people who want to see a great movie ... this one! During a recent visit to the Czech Republic, I saw this film three times in three days (they just show it for three days ... otherwise I will go to watch it a few more times !!! It's worth it!) I hope you like it, although it requires a little more thought and knowledge of the basic information underlying the story, almost the same as in the movie “Nick”. This is not a simple film because of its deep history, and the way his story is likely to make you cry ... did it to me three times in a row ... Zdenek Sverak made, as always, a great script, his son Jan did a great movie and cast? Without a doubt, they all did an excellent job, I was amazed by Ondrey Vetchi, the excellent role of Aldrich Kaiser and all the other actors who made this film GREAT !!! If this is not an Oscar nomination, I think I will strike in Holywood.
