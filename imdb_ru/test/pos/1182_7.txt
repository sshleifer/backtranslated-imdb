Competent comedy that delivers laughter to fans of Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau. I assume that this film was made for those who enjoyed the two GRUMPY OLD MEN films, as there seemed to be several such friends who were covering the comic duet in the twilight years. The idea is infallible: Mattau, a clumsy player who has thousands of dollars in debt, forces his unsuspecting friend Lemmon to go on a free cruise with him, where they can meet rich old women; The catch is that they are signed as Dancing Hosts, and Mattau does not know how to dance. <br /> <br /> “OUTSIDE THE SEA” is a funny movie, and not all the chuckles can be found thanks to Lemmon and Matthau. I found that Brent Spiner (best known as “Data from STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION”) is very humorous as a coordinator of snobbish dances. As the bona fide boss of two aging actors, he manages to pick them up in the laughter department. Although the film is not really needed, there is also a love story or two that can be found here, featuring Dayan Cannon (which looks pretty good during her years).
