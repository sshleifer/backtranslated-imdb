Honestly, I don’t really understand why there was so much debate on this show. It covers the elements of the original, expanding them. The narration has been updated, and although some episodes seem a bit “quick,” that's good. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston fits perfectly in this role. Easy as good as Tom Baker. <br /> <br /> Rose is one of the best companions, along with Sarah Jane Smith or Leela. <br /> <br /> I like the idea that the temporary overlords have been destroyed - There is no more politicking with the Doctor acting president. And it adds something to the character so that he remains the only one. <br /> <br /> SFX is outstanding - especially when compared to the original. <br /> <br /> Take it from me (And I was a huge doctor, Doctor Who - I actually took notes when I watched the show from doctor number 1 to doctor number 8. Personally, I threw a horrible movie out of a gun, personally) This is the best sci-fi TV show now, maybe. Ever. Watch it and buy a DVD.
