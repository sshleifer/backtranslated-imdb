It was a rare pleasure to see "Check Out." I was touched by the characters, laughed a lot at the wonderful script and was deeply touched by the genuine emotions perfectly depicted by this cast, especially by Peter Falk. In fact, one of his scenes in the kitchen of his apartment with his children, where he talks about his experiences of his life, his deep love for his wife and his decisions about his life in the future, is so deeply real that she is at the highest level of the best academic awards He is an unsurpassed actor who has surpassed himself in this film. The screenwriter offers a combination of literary knowledge, time, a gift for dialogue and fun situations that made me laugh out loud in the theater. I highly recommend “Checking Out” to anyone who wants to enjoy high-quality narration of superbly played.
