Travis and Sandy (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr.) are horse traders who are forced to sell their animals to a Mormon group and lead them across the border to the settlement. What they do not expect is to run into the infamous killers Clegg and his wounded leader, Uncle Shiloh (Charles Kemper). Ward Bond portrays Elder Wiggs, the main voice of the Mormon group moving the carriage to the destination of the Lord. Along the way, they also run into Doctor Loxley Hall and his Van Hucha Kucha and assist them. <br /> <br /> Fondly directed by Ford, who pays close attention to details with realistic problems that any group can face. during a stormy van track. There is a wonderful cast in the film, consisting of character actors, and there is no real star in the film, which is actually a blessing, if not for a change of tempo. Young Johnson and Cary Jr. responded very well, but this is Bond's movie to show its best. Johnson is the one who seems to understand hooligans and cattle such as Shiloh, and will certainly come in handy when a certain conflict can develop when Clegg's boys ride alongside them. <br /> <br /> I have to say this is one of his best and least rated westerns and seems to be flowing very well.
