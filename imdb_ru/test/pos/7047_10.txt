I first saw this film in the mid-80s and thought it was a funny film. When I'm older, I watch this movie for a variety of reasons. I like to look at it when I feel sad / nostalgic about my “lost youth”. I was a teenager (14 years old) at the time of the release of this film, so I can identify with many of the same problems / dilemmas as campers / CIT in this film. I like to see the clothes that were worn at this time, and to hear the same old urban legends that were told during the night canoe trip. The film is also full of funny liners. I highly recommend this film to anyone who was a teenager in the late 70s - early 80s.
