An excellent introspective / interpersonal piece that really has teeth, with no sense of hopelessness or worse, manipulative and artificially pleasing. There may be a nice double feature with American Beauty also The best performance to date, which I saw from Anita Mui, and each actor in this seems to be a power center. I take my hat off to Anne Hui for leadership and Ivy Ho for a brilliant script. Seriously one of the best dramas I've ever seen, especially if you have a taste for ALA classical poetry literature. Again, great.
