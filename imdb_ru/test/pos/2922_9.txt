It often happens when it grows up, the Hollywood film impresses young people. This not only lasts a lifetime, but also inspires him to study ancient cultures as a career. So it was with the 1954 film entitled “Egyptian”. The audience was shocked by the scenery, costumes and great game of this film, so other films soon followed in vain. This is a story about a young Egyptian boy who did not remain a parent immediately after birth. With such a dubious start, it is not difficult to wonder why he will spend his life asking questions. A Sinuha boy (Sin-oh-way), which means "He who is alone" (Edmund Purd), becomes an adult and continues to ask why, even when he finishes the School of Life, to become a doctor. During his formative years, he gains a lifelong friend by the name of Kaptah, brilliantly played (Peter Ustinov), and Horemheb (Victor Mature), who rises from a mere security officer to Army Commander. His life offers everything: from the rapid improvement of social status to a convicted criminal, to a pariah, an amazing healer and, eventually, to a life path that he never expected. A wonderful acting game goes to Gene Simmons as Merit, Michael Wilding as Ahnaton, Bella Darvi as the temptress, Nefer and John Carradine as the memorable grave robber. Tommy Rettig plays Toth, the son of an Egyptian. In the last years of his life, “He Who Is Alone” finally finds the answer that he has been searching for all his life, and which he bequeats to his son, now under the care of his friend for the rest of his life. A great movie! ****
