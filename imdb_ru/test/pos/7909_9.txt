This version of the Peter Pan musical with Mary Martin in 1955 demonstrated most of the original Broadway cast, including Kathleen Nolan as Wendy, who was a more natural actress than the girl they hired for the 1960 television game. It's a shame that most people will no longer look through something black and white, because in many respects this is an earlier production - which is not even displayed in IMDb lists when you put Peter Pan on a search engine! - surpasses the more pleasant color version that most people watch. I got the original on the disc and then worked on it to make it look and sound better in digital form. Now, when I put on the color version of 1960, it looks catchy by comparison. I suspect that Mary Martin herself, without a doubt, chose this original television version of 1955 b / w Producers' Showcase. <br /> <br /> As an additional benefit to the disc I received, original commercials and an introductory promotion were also shown. How far the 1950s seem now is such an innocent time compared to today. I miss that.
