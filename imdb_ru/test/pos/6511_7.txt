If you like stupid comedies like “Airplane”, you will love this movie! It is definitely in the style of Airplane and Scary Movie. Hilarious movie! He has the strangest characters in one movie. Michael Jackson, Evan Marriott, Joyce Girard, Stuart Pankin, Charlie Schlater and Eric Roberts. Hockey special effects, but I think they should be, as this is a stupid comedy. Obviously, there are two versions of the film, one on the blockbuster and one on the official website: MissCastaway.com. A preliminary version signed by the director is available on the website. Behind the scenes there is funny stuff shot in Neverland with Michael Jackson. The film was shot in 2003, and it says that this is a joke with a PG rating.
