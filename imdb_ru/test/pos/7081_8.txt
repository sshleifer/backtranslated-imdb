This film began to confuse and turned into one of the best films I have seen ... The game was great, and when I didnâ€™t wipe away the tears, I enjoyed Meryl Streep, whose performance was incredible. The film tells about the difficulties of a distant family, coping with the mother, who develops incurable cancer. Watching the movie was very difficult and heartbreaking. Soundtrack fit this movie. Brava Bette Midler !! From 5 stars I give this 4 1/2.
