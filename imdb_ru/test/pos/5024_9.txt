Unusual, but very delightful John Travolta game starts this very funny comedy. His interpretation of the archangel looks like a cheesy, effeminate, plump, ladies' man. And he certainly has a bewitching effect on the women he meets with during his trip to Chicago. John Hurt is very restrained in his role as the main reporter for the owner of the Chicago tabloid Bob Hoskins. Angie McDowell plays the role just as she played her role in Four Weddings and Funerals. Maureen Stapleton is neat in cameo. Her comment "Michael does not tolerate fools" - this is just one of many memorable moments. Bob Hoskins is the only one of the leading performers who can't connect, a little bit to the wall. Basically you are here to see Michael taking the bull, hypnotizing waitresses and dancers in a western-style restaurant and fully demonstrating that he is a complete free soul. This is a catchy comedy that costs more than one viewing.
