“Japan takes the best from all over the world and makes it its own”, although this may be true, this applies to all but one thing, that is, ... major league baseball .... but do not worry. all this. But only who will change whom is the part of the film that really makes it awesome! Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors, and he really plays in his comedic roles. The storyline may be plausible for life, but the plot is dead. The Japanese are gentle, respectful people, whose traditions and traditions are very different from Western society. All these elements and obstacles are combined into one truly enjoyable, funny movie. It is definitely worth a look!
