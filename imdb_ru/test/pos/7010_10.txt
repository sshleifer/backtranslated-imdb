I watched this film at least 30, and maybe more, and every time I watch it, I get drawn into the film and return to 1963! The film takes me to a nostalgic vacation every time I watch it. <br /> <br /> I think it’s important to say here that I was 15 years old in 1963, and I can remember “before President Kennedy was shot and before“ Zhukov ”came." I feel that say something like: “I carried a watermelon.” and then I realized how stupid it was! Jennifer Gray plays Frances “The Kid” The housekeeper in “Dirty Dancing.” The kid is going to go to college in the fall. mom, dad and sister Liza. <br /> <br /> One of the regular dancers, Penny (played by Cynthia Rhodes), will become pregnant by another employee (one of the colleges). chikov, played by Max Cantor), and they have a chance to get an abortion, but at night she and Johnny (Patrick Swayze) should dance in a nearby hotel. <br /> <br /> So the dancer for Penny. Johnny is convinced Penny and his cousin Billy (Neil Jones) that he can teach Toddler to dance on time for the show. A kid learning dance steps with Penny and Johnny are great scenes! <br /> <br /> The father of the kid (Dr. Jake Houseman, played by Jerry Orbach) Penny comes to the rescue when the abortion is wrong. Dirty dances came back to me this time in history, when girls got pregnant and had abortions in the meat rooms. At about the same time (1963) many girls actually died from this kind of abortion, but then the girl did not have much choice. <br /> <br /> Lonnie Price plays the great arrogant grandson (Neil Kellerman) in front of Max Jack Weston. Kellerman. Jane Brooker does an excellent job with the annoying sister of Little Lisa Houseman. <br /> <br /> The music is great, and the dances are wonderful! "Dirty dancers" are absolutely wonderful and very sexy - I feel Baby's surprise when she sees them dancing for the first time and says: "Where did they learn to do it?" <br /> <br /> Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze are just perfect together in their respective roles. Patrick's song “She's Like the Wind” causes tears in my eyes every time I hear / watch her in this film. <br /> <br /> The film ends on a note, but leaves a desire to know what will happen next in the life of the child and Johnny. Dirty dances give something new every time they are watched - they hypnotize the observer with nostalgia, a sense of desire to see the year 1963 again.
