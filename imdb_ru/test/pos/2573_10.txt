This is if the first film that I gave 10 years. If ever there was a film that needed word of mouth to promote, this is it. A box for 4 million dollars is a shame. People don't know what it is about. If you have any appreciation for the blues or just good use of great music, this is one of the reasons to watch it. How many people knew that Jackson could sing, and damn well. You hear books and films mocking that they are about salvation. Seeing this, you can never forgive such a trivial use of the word. Yes, it is sandy, sexy, homemade, true, strange and present in your face. Isn't that the best reason to watch a movie? Those who understand me will not stay away from this week.
