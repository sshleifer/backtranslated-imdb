I was about 14 years old when I saw the music version of Lost Horizon. I really liked the film as well as the songs, and I went to the cinema several times to watch it again and again. My mother bought a record and I learned the songs by heart, just like I did with Sound of Music (which people hardly know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-styled critics, whose comments are being published, is that they have no romantic soul and they have not seen the film through the eyes of a young teenager. He may be a fan of Ingrid Bergman, but I was happy with Liv Ullman. Can Ingrid Bergman sing and dance? What is so good about her? Perhaps the critic did not appreciate this because he needed new glasses or contact lenses, since he sees a close resemblance between Liv Ullman and Bill Clinton. It was the idea and history of the film, the philosophy that was the most important and interesting factor, and the color musical simply made it more interesting and enjoyable without damaging the intellectually attractive aspects. It's a shame that many other films with so-called great actors and actresses with unimportant themes / stories are completely boring in comparison.
