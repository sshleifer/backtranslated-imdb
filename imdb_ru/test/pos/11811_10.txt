It was such a beautiful film. Such an amazing performance from Joseph and Brad. Very innocently written and executed. Must see !! I cried out almost the entire movie. This is a film that every family should look after children, and he teaches us all a very important lesson in life and how we should approach the severe topic of AIDS, how we should teach our children to cope with this and the people around them. Not only with AIDS, but with any incurable disease. I did not even hear about this movie until I turned on the TV. one day and stumble upon it. I recommend everyone to watch this, just do not forget your box of napkins. More films should be made like that. Extremely touching.
