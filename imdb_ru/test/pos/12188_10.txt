Queen of the Damned is one of the best vampire films I've ever seen! The film was the unknown, the action and the blood. The combination of the hard and demanding position of the queen and the rock mood of our star, beautifully played by Stuart Townsend, makes a wonderfully made film that only this combination can create. I am always the one who gives advice to my friends and family members, which films are worth renting, and when people ask me if Queen of the Damned is worthy, I tell them what to buy. This film is undoubtedly a must-have in all homes of horror film lovers!
