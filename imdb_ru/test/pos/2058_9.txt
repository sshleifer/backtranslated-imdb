I really liked this movie. I am really in films where women rip off a lot of ass, so this film already had my hopes for some decent entertainment. My hopes were met and exceeded less than 20 minutes of the film. The action, humor and wit of this film easily made it one of my favorite films of all time. It was attended by Sam Jackson and his undeniable presence on the screen, Gina Davis, whom I had never seen her before. She demanded your respect and persisted in taking it, even if you did not want it. <br /> <br /> Gina plays Samantha Kane, an amnestic, desperately trying to remember something about her past, but quickly realizing that the more she learns, the more she wants to forget and is eventually absorbed, until Samantha will not be so much more, and Charlie is all that remains. But now, can Charlie and Sam, two completely different women, exist in the same body? We have characters that appear and go out of the film and bring up each side of Sam / Charlie, like Sam Jackson and Craig Bierko. Craig is also as compelling as Timothy, the sexy bad guy without a conscience. <br /> <br /> This film was wonderfully played and well played, excellent and surprisingly interesting. You look impossible and applaud when it happens SO worth your time. Look, you will not regret.
