Forget all those people who tell you that this is not as good as a book. So what? This is a movie after all. Watching the joy made exclusively in Kefalonia is a magnificent photo, but with dark and disturbing moments. The only problem I encountered was the obvious miscalculation of Nicholas Cage as Captain Corelli. In addition, the film was a very pleasant surprise.
