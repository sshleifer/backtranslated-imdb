“ROCK STAR” is a well-narrated version of the story in Hollywood, based on the fact that Ripper was the replacement of Rob Halford with Judas Priest. Mark Wahlberg poured his handsome masculine charm and performed with an incredibly wonderful performance, which he, as we know, has been doing since the release of BOOGIE NIGHTS. <br /> <br /> Steven Herek, unaccustomed to musical films, gets the audience through the wonders of the dizzying lifestyle of an extinct species, the god of hair-metal rock. "Izzy" Wahlberg plays the role of the lead film, in which everyone plays to see how his wish comes true. His handsome character quickly wins the heart of the viewer, who wants to see how he succeeds, and gets the opportunity several times to give him a metal sign "goat horn." <br /> <br /> The only real complaint in the story is that the auxiliary staff, namely the other members of the group, were not concretized and were not even properly represented. More interaction with these lifelong rock musicians would strengthen and reinforce Izzy’s new environment. <br /> <br /> Naturally, ROCK STAR is filled with great music. Rabin's rating, the original work of Steel Dragon and many metal hits in the style of the 80s make this soundtrack a must! Let's all hope that films such as ROCK STAR not only give credibility to the musical style that a generation has helped define, but also provoked a much-needed revival.
