I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was great in this film, since she played the role of Harry's girlfriend (Mike Wagner). Harry is a robber for his luck, trying to do another heist. Harry goes to the funeral, where he meets Vittorio de Sica and takes him for a walk. When something goes wrong, they put mines together to find the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with the help of Vittorio De Sica from there to the mob. Be sure that no matter what happens to the gang after that, the result will never be the same and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The rest go out, you need to take care of yourself. As for Raquel, if you're a fan here, then you need to watch this movie, because she never looked better standing on the beach with the word ******. I give this movie 10 affection stars only on Raquel Welch's body. No wonder why she was the hottest actress in the sixties. She was a sex symbol that everyone wanted and nobody could get. Not only does she look good, she can act even better. If you like, Raquel Welch, then you will like this movie.
