This film was excellent from start to finish. I was fascinated by action, black humor and the incredible failure that our hero encountered at every turn. Thomas Jane is a great actor, and I hope to see him in many future films. Reading the comments of other people, I must admit that I never thought about Tarrantino while watching “Thursday,” but now that I think about it, I think there are some similarities. I think I do not spend a lot of time trying to connect everything with everything else. The rape scene between Poritskova and Thomas Jane is one of the most popular in history.
