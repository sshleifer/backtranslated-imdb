The cast is perfectly selected and well balanced. This cinematography is excellent. The music is delightful, as is all the music of Bert Bakharah, and corresponds to the storyline. Creating a musical version of Hilton's story is a welcome change from a delicate rework. We see experienced actors who add depth to the emotional content and meaning of each scene. I cannot agree with the critics who have overlooked this sparkling stone of the film. This is a silver screen treasure! Find him if you can - and let his magic take you through the routine of daily worries, inspiring you to find your own “Lost Horizon”.
