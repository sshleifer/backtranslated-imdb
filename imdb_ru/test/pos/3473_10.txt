I did not know anything about this film until I looked ... my brother actually suggested that I look. However, as a rule, his proposals are not so good, but I was stuck on seeing something, so I looked at it. <br /> <br /> In short, I give it a 10/10. /> <br /> The film tells about two people who meet while living in the same place. One initially depends very much on the institution around it, the other is a rebel. One does what he likes, the other, as he is told. <br /> <br /> From the first moments of the film, we quickly see the friendship between the two buildings and see how they are a little erased with each other. This is a wonderful job that manages to tell a good story without excesses, people jumping out of baths, or superheroes who are ready to save the day. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of sand and reality there, not everything can go well - not all abysses can be closed - and this film amazingly shows a lot. <br /> <br /> If you are watching this movie and are not impressed ..... I would advise you not to watch anything else.
