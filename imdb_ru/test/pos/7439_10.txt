this film is simply awesome .. unfortunately there is not even a shadow of it in Portugal ... and I agree with the previous opinion, only FF fans really give the film a real loan ... but otherwise ... I dare you to watch it. the story is excellent, and I thought the game finished the story, but the writers gave us a great story to the god of all role-playing games ... left, as usual, he came from heaven; the small details that they (us, fans of the game) are beautiful .. like a ringtone - the winning song of the game, and even some movements are quite familiar, just look, it's a great movie, great story, great animation ... just 10/10
