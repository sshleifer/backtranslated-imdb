I may be biased because the F-16 is my favorite fighter — although the F-14 is probably the second or the third — but I liked this movie. The sequels (Iron Eagle II and III) do not correspond to the acting skills and plot, but the first one - along with Top Gun - has excellent flights and music, as well as reasonable plots and acting skills. II and III are clearly less than the “flight budget”, but their main drawback is the plot and action. I suspect that the relative fame and popularity of the Iron Eagle compared to Top Gun almost completely reflects the fame and popularity of Jason Gedrick compared to Tom Cruise. Another plus (for me) is too short a speech by Shawney Smith. 7/10
