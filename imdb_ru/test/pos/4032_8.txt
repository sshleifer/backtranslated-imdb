For all those who believe that the dialogue is worth something and who appreciate a farce that is smart enough to take it seriously, this film will surprise you. This is not a “date” for people who cannot follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid). <br /> <br /> Cornell teaches in Southern California, near the tar pits. He has not published the novel for four years, his wife divorces him, he drinks a little, and he is blessed or cursed with acrid wit, which he freely distributes to his students. He recommended a friend for promotion, and one talented young student presented him with a manuscript as an independent project. Cornell doesn't even want to read it, so he gives him an “A” and pushes him aside. Leaning back with a drink in his office, he looks out the window when a bright young student falls past his window on his way to a meeting with the pavement in a collision with a splat. <br /> <br /> Hal comes to talk, and they chat, drink some more. Cornell realizes that he must read the manuscript, now. When he goes home, his wife waits with divorce papers. He drinks more. She leaves, and he goes to the faculty, only to find her there. He drinks even more. And when his wife finds out that the student is dead, she faints, and he finds out that she had an affair with a student. This, of course, encourages him to make a more serious drink. The next morning, he wakes up to be in the dorm room of one of his students, a freshman named Sid (Meg Ryan). <br /> <br /> He feels worse than a hangover, goes to the doctor and finds out that he was poisoned, it is irreversible, and he has 24 to 48 hours left to live. He doesn’t have much time to find out who killed him, and at every step there are plots, motives, relationships and surprises, although in the end everything makes sense. All his discoveries and exchanges are decorated with sarcasm, a dry mind and sharp observations. Let's just say this movie will add a new meaning to the saying “publish or perish”. <br /> <br /> This movie has no bad notions. There are duplicate images and symbols used at careful intervals. Watch out for cracked glass and distorted images through the glass. Some of the camera shots are revolutionary for 1988, and some of the violent actions are carefully and skillfully delivered. The music is unobtrusive and pertinent, although sometimes it makes its own statement in the lyrics. The visual effects in this image are impressive. <br /> <br /> If there are any failures, the first 20 minutes move a little slower and almost put to sleep. But the pace starts quickly, with enough exposure between the segments of the action. <br /> <br /> There are no obvious sexual contacts, although there is violence and obscene language. <br /> <br /> This is a film writer, and it will be best appreciated by those who have a sense of humor regarding their own success or failure. I think that if you take this seriously, you already have big problems.
