I was born in Beijing, China, and moved to the United States at the age of 9. Since then, I have been to Beijing several times and loved it every time. One of the many things that I like about Beijing is the people and the atmosphere that they bring to the city. “You’re hahahaha шsho” (which more precisely means “if you have something to say, say it beautifully”) delightfully and truly reflect this feeling of Beijing. I believe that you would have to live in Beijing and its people in order to get the most out of this film, although you might like it. <br /> <br />> The story is not complicated, deliberately some kind of bizarre and fascinating. I will leave it to reveal myself and not tell you too much, except for some comments. Every detail, from the paintings on the wall to the scenery, streets and restaurants, resembles a house. (Most likely, Zhang Yimou filmed everything “on the spot”). But, more importantly, the characters — our “hero”, the girl, the kind-hearted, but the unfortunate “man with the laptop” and the owner of the night club — are all from Beijing and are attractive. in their own way. Their conversations truly reflect the essence of each character. The story, mainly driven by situations and conversations (with the exception of the brilliant bafonarium near the end), is intriguing and always interesting. <br /> <br />> Now I am 21 years old. My parents and I love this movie. We are always so amazed at Zhang Yimou's ability to turn ordinary people into believable screen characters, and everyday life into unusual situations. <br /> <br /> “Keep calm” is another. cheerful. meaningful.
