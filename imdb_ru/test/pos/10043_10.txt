that's cool!!! There is no partnership like Errol and Olivia. there is true love! I am 24 years old, but this film is as exciting as I am sure it was 60 years ago. Raul Walsh is an underestimated genius, his direction is so wide, so wide, but so intimate. The last scene between Colonel Custer (Flynn) and his wife (de Havilland) almost brought me to tears (it’s not easy for a 24-year-old boy !!), it’s so heartbreaking. there is also a deep Christian meaning: the faith of Custer in your fame and trust and the faithfulness of his wife, allowing him to leave so that he can fulfill his moral duty to protect the innocent. civilians from a certain slaughterhouse. There is no such film, which would solve these problems, as this. Be sure to look for anyone who wants to look at this defining moment in American and military history from the inside. patriotic, for all the right reasons. I knew that Errol Flynn was a star, and De Havilland - a screen legend - this only confirms my suspicions that they are one of the most outstanding!
