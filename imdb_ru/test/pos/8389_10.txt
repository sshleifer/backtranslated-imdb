Inglorious bastards do not apologize, do not ask for forgiveness, it is a merciless attack on the senses. Tarantino does not care if he offends, if he transcends stereotypes and clichés, this film does the purest. It's nice to see a filmmaker, whose work clearly does not interfere with the existing forces. Tarantino is a master who effortlessly pumps enormous tension and suddenly mixes him with loud laughter; You are not sure whether you should look with disgust or ride with laughter, anyway, this is a roller coaster, and this is not to be missed! It’s not for everyone, and I’m not sure how the Germans will take the film, of course, if you’re not a fan of Tarantino’s style, it can be a little hard to swallow, but nevertheless, it’s a film that just needs to be seen. No self-respecting movie fan should miss this. And the performance of Christoph Waltz ... Oscar, do not dare to ignore him !!
