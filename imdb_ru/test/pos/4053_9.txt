As in many modern American films, there must be a supernatural element in the plot, but if you just let it go, it will be a story with a bunch of charm and a kind heart encased in a crab shell. <br /> We were presented with a scene from a city in an economically depressed area, struggling to find something that could please you. Bo Bridges’s character actually stands up to him with a growing family, a zero balance in the bank and a son-in-law who is sold to a large business chain that he secretly hates but in which he wants to rub Bo’s nose, D'Onofrio believes Bubba’s life is limited by the need to look after his “blessed” younger brother Joey, and he longs to flee from the shackles of this dead city. Their boss's business is shutting down (largely against his will) due to the lack of new customers, and he is haunted by memories of his father, as he creates tension towards his own attempt at self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Joey, who seemed to personify the curse of his life, died at sea — thought to have drowned — as a result of a strange accident. His miraculous recovery for them by the Portuguese trawlers, whose boat they had just built and launched (perhaps the symbol of the angelic crew), is the sign they were waiting for, and they all decide to give one last roll of the bones to life. <br /> In this work, a wonderful thoughtful mood reigns that perfectly holds our attention as brilliantly as “The Shipping News”. There are other parallels with later works that suspect a touch of a remake. I like Signs of Life for a simpler, less contrived history and star performances by actors working on their craft, and not for being noticed as stars.
