Seven-Ups is a good and exciting movie. He is full of credible performances by Scheider, LaByanko and Richard Lynch's effective scary performance - although most of the characters are cardboard guys. Character development does not develop at all on the screen. The only thing we know is that the good guys are good guys, and the bad guys are bad. In contrast to the criminal history rule, the Seven Apams manage to throw Scheider and the team into the center of the construction plot in a unique writing. The location of New York and the excellent choreographic car chase highlight the film. The only drawback of the film is the slightly tangled storyline at the beginning. They give the viewer little evidence that the abducted people are associated with the crowd (as long as the film does not exist). If someone blindly began to watch the film, perhaps he was a little confused in the story. Otherwise, the “Seven” is a pleasant pastime, full of testosterone.
