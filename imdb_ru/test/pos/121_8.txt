Now I understand that this film was not an indictment against all Indians, but it is an amazing film because he dares to investigate the hypocrisy that some Indians are experiencing with regard to their women and sexuality. For some time I have known that sexism is very common in this society (when women are killed, because the husband’s family no longer wants them after his death, or because she had a small dowry, and also frequent killing of female fetuses, because they are considered as a curse instead of blessing). I also understand that some of this culture will be greatly offended by the film, but the point is that there is some truth to this - even if the film was attacked so violently when it debuted in India ten years ago. As a result of extreme misogyny in the film, most Western viewers will be shocked, or at least emotionally embroiled in the plight of women in this film. <br /> <br /> Although I am a man, I am not I am insanely feminist, and I am frank, the film has had a strong positive impact on me, and this is NOT an agenda film that only lesbians and “human haters” can enjoy. In fact, I do not think that the film promotes hatred of men or homosexuality, but instead gives a convincing argument that in the case of these two ladies it was the only reasonable alternative because of their evil husbands. Yes, I use the word “evil” and I mean it, since both husbands living in this big house are very selfish and do not care about the sexuality of their spouses. In many traditional societies this is indeed the case, and women are doomed to an empty emotional existence. <br /> <br /> One husband married a cheerful young woman, Sita, because of family responsibilities. This arranged marriage is inconvenient for both of them, but at first Sita tries to contact her sullen husband. However, he sees himself as a victim and could care less about Sita - and he still has an affair with a liberal Chinese woman. To make matters worse, he didn’t do anything to hide the case and didn’t apologize. In their dead marriage, sex was intended solely for the birth of children, and Sita could not satisfy her sexual or emotional needs. And, unfortunately, he could care less. <br /> <br /> Another husband was married to a woman who was barren (Radha). Oddly enough, after the first attempts to have children, the next 13 years they passed without any sexual contact! This is because this person decided to become an ascetic (that is, in Hinduism, a person who refuses the pleasures of the world in order to gain inner enlightenment). Now his desire to do it was good, if he was not yet married and had obligations to his wife. However, being married, it was an incredibly selfish act, and, like his brother, he assumed that his wife had no sexual feelings, and he did not seem to care. The closest thing he allowed her sexually to do was sleep next to him, since her presence next to him helped him learn to "overcome the desires of the flesh." This must have brought her only disappointment. <br /> <br /> So, in the same house live two abandoned and normal women who crave emotional connection and out of their sexual needs. In the end, these needs bring these slants together - at first, simply emotionally, and then sexually. The film was great, as it made me look and understand how in some cases homosexuality is inevitable and even useful compared to living in emotional despair. <br /> <br /> Late in the film, when the intensity of their sexual relations is found, they lead to a not entirely unexpected reaction from the “enlightened” husband Radha - a person who seeks religious understanding and peace, but is so absorbed in himself that true understanding and growth is impossible. <br /> <br /> This is a very complex and adult film. Although the nude nature is very small, the theme is very adult, and this film is not for your children. Indeed, that small character who masturbates in front of an old paralyzed lady is very disturbing - as I said, this is not a film that allows your children to watch. However, for a mature audience, this is an excellent and very erotic film that makes you think. <br /> <br /> In the film, excellent acting, complex characters, excellent writing, great mood music and a slow tempo. It may annoy some, but which I found useful. The only serious drawback is that I cannot blame the film itself, as well as the idiots who released it on videotape. This is because although the film is in English, sometimes the stress is quite strong, and it is not always easy to understand what is being said. BUT, and this is the worst, there are no closed or open signatures, including for Western viewers. If you watch this film, see if you can find it on DVD, or, I hope, in the new release of the video there will be subtitles - mine, of course, not. <br /> <br /> By the way, director Deepa Mehta (a popular female director) made several other great films, such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD / Hollywood. A constant theme in her films is the conflict between traditional Indian culture and expectations and Westernism - with a strong focus on female characters. It is no wonder that this lady thinking in the West makes her home in Canada and has divorced - a truly unusual woman, if not more. For a similar film that explores traditional culture and western culture, try another Canadian gem, EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN.
