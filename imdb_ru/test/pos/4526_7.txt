“Murder on New York” is an entertaining recording in a series of films about Charlie Chan, but if you pay attention, many holes in the plot appear before an observant eye. During a trip to New York to the annual police convention, Chen (Sydney Toler) meets the former investigator of Scotland Yard Hugh Drake (Frederick Warlock) on the same flight. Currently working in military intelligence, Drake hunts down Paul Narvo and his Hindu servant, suspected of sabotage all over the world. Drake believes that by contacting the elusive wife Narvo, he will be able to establish the whereabouts of the main criminal. <br /> <br /> When Drake is dead in the library of George Kirby, President of the Metropolitan Aircraft Building Corporation, Charlie believes that he was killed by a newly discovered poisonous gas called “tetrogen”, which is introduced through a glass ball, which releases poison when broken. Calling Kirby to collect all the guests of his party, Chen and police inspector Vance (Donald McBride) question the audience, since one of them may be the killer. Among them are Herbert Fenton (Melville Cooper), another Drake Oxford student, actress June Preston (Joan Valerie), unknown to Drake, but asked to be present, Ralph Percy (Kane Richmond), chief designer of the aviation company Kirby, and Keith Jeffrey (John Sutton) , stock broker Kirby. Kirby Butler Boggs (Leyland Hodgson) is also a suspect, especially after the son of number 2 Jimmy (Victor Sen Jung) catches him on an open telegram, the content of which concerns Boggs himself. <br /> <br /> There are some other cleverly planted characters in the process as well. Mrs. Narvo appears in the role of Patricia West (Marjorie Weaver), and despite Drake’s suspicion that she may bring him to Narvo, she is actually on the run from her ex-husband and marriage failure. She is associated with David Elliott (Robert Lowry), the head of a chemical research firm and, therefore, suspected of a tetrogen perspective. <br /> <br /> As with many Chan films, racial commentaries must be taken in the process. This one offers two bright. When black servant Kirby is called in for questioning, he states that he knows nothing about Drake’s murder, that he is completely “in the dark”. Chan's answer: “Conditions seem contagious.” <br /> <br /> Later, following orders from Inspector Vance to collect all the Hindus in New York, Jimmy Chan comments on their arrival: “They all start to look like me.” In fact, the scene provides one of the elements of comic relief in the film, as Shemp Howard disguises himself as a Hindu mystic “The Great Rashid”, but in fact the police find him a scammer Shorty McCoy. <br /> <br /> Before the end of the film, two more victims fall to the clever Narvo - his like-minded Ramulla and the magnate himself Kirby Aviation. To uncover the killer, Chan sovm With Elliott, he organized a test flight aboard the newly developed TR4 bomber after detecting a poisoned capsule set up by the mechanics on the plane the day before. that Fenton is not Narvo. The real Narvo reveals itself when it offers a poisoned cup of water to the nervous Fenton, who is seeking to keep the secret of Narvo. But Chen was smart enough to be wary of such an attempt, and discovers that the real killer is Narvo, now under the guise of stockbroker Jeffrey, underwent a reconstructive operation after a car accident. <br /> <br /> Now about the plot holes. During the first investigation into the murder of Hugh Drake, the police claimed that the fingerprints found in the library did not coincide with the fingerprints of any of the dinner guests. However, Geoffrey / Narvo attended the dinner party. It has already been established that Drake had one unbiased visitor in the library, chemist Elliott. If the fingerprints did not really belong to Narvo, then it was pointless to create their problem. <br /> <br /> Also, at the end of the film, when Narvo offers Fenton poisoned water, how did he think he would run away? with this with everyone there as a witness? But even better than the fact that a saboteur traveling the world, such as Narvo, would have time and money to establish itself as a stockbroker in New York, simply does not make sense. <br /> <br /> For lovers of small things it is worth mentioning a few more points. In film number 2, Jimmy's son is a college student who studies chemistry when he comes to the aid of "Pop" to solve a case. In Chan's previous film, Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum, Jimmy studied law at the Faculty of Law. <br /> <br /> The poison gas formula will be reworked in Chan’s later film, this time with Monogram with Roland Winters in Chan’s Role in New Orleans Docks. In this story, poison gas is released from destroyed radio tubes in the same way as to claim its victims.
