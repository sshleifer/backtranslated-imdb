Lifeforce (1985) was a film sponsored by Cannon, directed by Tobe Hooper. This is a very interesting film, which tells about a pair of space vampires who accidentally returned to Earth during the last mission of the space shuttle. Steve Railsbek stars as the only survivor of the tragedy. But in fact, this film is just a demonstration of the natural beauty of Matilda May. She alone smokes a hot number. The director was a big fan of the female vampire (a.k.a. Erotikill). Miss May recreates the lead role of Lina Romaeus. The film is beautifully photographed and shot. There are a lot of bloody effects to please fans of genres. <br /> <br /> I have to give this film a very high rating. Tob Hooper was a man. During this period, he made three interesting films for Cannon (Texas Chainsaw Massacre II and "Invaders from Mars"). If you like sci-fi / horror movies, Tob Hooper or Matilda May films, this movie is just in your side street. <br /> <br /> Highest recommendation! <br /> <br /> Did I mention that Matilda May smokes hot?
