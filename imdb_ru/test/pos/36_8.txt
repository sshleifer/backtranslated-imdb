LACKAWANNA BLUES is a fascinating, exciting, emotionally charged HBO-TV film based on the childhood memories of actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson (which also plays in a small role). This joyful film about the film is centered around Santiago-Hudson’s childhood guardian, Rachel “Nanny” Crosby, a strong and emotional black woman who ran a boarding house in upstate New York in the 1950s. The nanny was a social service organization consisting of one woman whose boarding house was filled with drunks, outcasts, cripples, drug addicts, losers and everyone else in the city who needed handouts instead of handouts. The essence of this story is connected with the relationship of a nanny with a young Ruben (well played by Marcus Franklin), a boy whose divorced parents could not properly raise the boy, so the nurse took him in her arms. S. Epata Merkeson, who was spent over the years in the ungrateful role of Lieutenant Van Buren in NBC "LAW AND ORDER" turns into a powerful performance in the role of a nanny, a neighbor, whose pension became a symbol of the oppressed black people in her city. Merkesson is nothing short of a magnificent performance that brought her the Golden Globe and the Emmy Award. Merkeson supports the impressive cast of all the stars, including Terrance Howard (brilliantly and heartbreakingly like Nanny's husband), Louis Gossett Jr., Rosie Perez, Jimmy Smits, Delroy Lindo, Macy Gray, Michael C. Williams, Jeffrey Wright, Henry Simmons Patricia Wettig, Ernie Hudson, Mos Def and Hill Harper as an adult Ruben. Colorful and exciting, beautifully photographed and gracefully priced, this is a one-of-a-kind filming experience that works at all levels, but if for some other reason, you should look at the exciting performance in the lead role of S. Epatah Merkeson, who is given the Role life and makes the most of it.
