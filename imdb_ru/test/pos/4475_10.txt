What an incredible story and what a beautiful film! Hats off to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Courier and the great Honore de Balzac. This exciting movie conveys the passion the characters have experienced so easily and at the same time so much. I watched her hypnotized, almost holding her breath as the story developed to an inexorable end. The performance of this film was almost impeccable: simple and clean, it plays with our hearts, helping us to understand the strange, platonic, absolute, thus possessive relationship between two beings not intended to be part of each other's world. Both are capable of attachment, but ironically, it is a more “developed” one who becomes addicted and proprietary, unable to accept the freedom of another. It is one of the most exciting and intriguing views on many forms of love, and an incredible exploration of how oppressive and destructive human love can sometimes be. <br /> <br /> Only a rudimentary mind can link this story with any kind of bestiality.
