Miss Cast Away is a fun little thing that doesn’t do a lot of the plot or character development to get as many jokes as possible. It is best to enjoy with a large audience that is open to such entertainment and may have drank a few drinks. Most of the jokes are based on current events, so in subsequent years this film may become a time capsule for references to the pop culture of the beginning of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> Convert 30i to 24p In some places, the footage really creates a jerky view, the first aerial shots are especially noticeable. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Michael Jackson is a truly strange non-sequential event. But I, for one, am encouraged that Mr. Jackson showed a useful interest in one of his protégés even after he (the director) had passed from the stage of a sweet teenager. <br /> <br /> The effects don't work as bad as one review suggested. Most of this was done by a one-person team in a short period of time consisting of animator William Sutton, whose name seems to have been left out of IMDb credits. His work is an outstanding achievement and really helps to fill in the gaps in this film. I hope he finally paid!
