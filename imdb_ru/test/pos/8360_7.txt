Being a fan of time-travel stories, I was surprised that there was no “device” that would send a character to Russell Johnson in time. He only appeared in 1865. This was the disappointing part of the episode. I liked the premise of the dangers of “changing” the future by changing the past. Other episodes of the Twilight Zone about time travel, such as “No Time Like in the Past”, “Once”, etc., I liked it more because of the use of “devices” of time travel. Perhaps if Russell Johnson's character was the same as he played in The Execution, he would be more acceptable to fans like me. As science fiction fans know, no character should “die” in episodes of time travel. All kinds of plot twists can be applied to these types of stories. This was the only flaw I could comment on in this episode.
