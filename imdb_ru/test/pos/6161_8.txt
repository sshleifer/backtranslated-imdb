This is such a beautiful film! He not only depicts war, but also friendship and love. Slama's life is filled with sadness, every aspect of his life has collapsed. I can only imagine how he would feel when his friend made the final sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I see a slight resemblance to Pearl Harbor, which also has two pilots who are in love with the same woman. However, this film is made much better, because it does not portray a woman to be unfaithful and calm. The friendship between the two men is also much more convincing and strong. I definitely recommend this movie to all people.
