I have heard of "games" and "Dungeons and Dragons" before, but I knew that this may be similar to what I saw in Gamers: Dorkness Rising. These guys are so funny and fun to watch. Especially the guy who plays the “bard” or “minstrel” or something else, he has a gift for physical comedy and time. Some scenes have so much background humor and energy that you really think that at least some of them were improvised there on the set. I had to work on the special effects for a bit, but I saw it at the convention last year, and this is one of the things that they said they were going to redo and do better, so probably this is now vicious!
