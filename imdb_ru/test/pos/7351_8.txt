This, without a doubt, is the greatest reversal that Jakass ever made, damn it, he even throws Jakas out of the water. <br /> <br /> Imagine: you have a group of guys who just don’t want to grow up, spend a lot of money and some cool tricks, and you have Viva La Bam. <br /> <br /> This is a family show, not just a “gang”. "running, being a complete jerk (like in Jackass). For example: Bam's parents, April and Phil are present in every episode, with the advent of fat uncle Bam, Don Vito, to download! The reason Margara's family makes us laugh is simple: someone in our family can talk. April: a woman who wants to live by the book and follow the tradition. Phil: a guy who is trying to be a good father, and finally Bam: that son who never grew up from high school. < br /> <br /> Jokes and jokes in each episode are guaranteed to laugh at you, and buying a DVD is certain but it is recommended! Another thing that is amazing to see is how everyday Margera is. In an interview, he said that in most episodes he doesn’t play, but simply acts instinctively. <br /> <br /> However, I liked most all of this is Margera's influence. MTV has more. He wanted Slayer to play in his backyard, MTV did it. He wanted to spend one day with Dani Filt and have a Cradle Of Filth concert in his backyard. This happened. <br /> <br /> Add to this your passion for the love-metal (and discussed as emo) HIM group and his brother's garage group CKY, and there are a lot of head-strokes happening there. <br /> <br /> If you like the Jackass, you will fall in love with it. Last year, I borrowed season 1 from a friend, and I would have thrown my legs to meet with the crew of Viva La Bam. You will not be disappointed, and I can promise that by the end of all this you will be in the seams!
