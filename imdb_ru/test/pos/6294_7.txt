Along with "In the Army!", This film is considered one of the best films of Paulie Shore, if there is one. While the clash of West Coast and Midwest culture is not new, this film makes the story a bit more interesting with the wild and unpredictable antics of the then fresh Shore. Although a change in values ​​probably would have gone in a different direction, the concept itself was quite interesting. The interaction between Shore and the family was not only funny, but also in two amazing and early roles with Carla Gugino and Tiffany-Amber Teyssen (she will always have Amber in my book). One of those films that I watch on TV without any problems.
