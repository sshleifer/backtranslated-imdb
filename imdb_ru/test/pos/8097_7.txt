It must have been one of Chaplin’s most ambitious projects; he adds almost everything, from visual jokes and comedy sketches to social significance, romance and even some violence. The mix is ​​complex and intriguing, and there are many interesting and tricky episodes in the film (for example, the one in which Chaplin and four other guys try to avoid searching for a coin that will bring their self-sacrifice), but the ingredients do not always converge and the mix (and tone) seem disharmonious. As for the famous final speech, although, undoubtedly, to be honest, it also seems a bit naive today, with its hints of "a better world where a person will overcome his hatred and cruelty, and his soul will fly." Great performances of Jack Okey and the beautiful Paulette Goddard. (***)
