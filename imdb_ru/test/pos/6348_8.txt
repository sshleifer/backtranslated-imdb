First of all, let me say that I am a big fan of the original series “The Lonely Pigeon” and the book from which it was founded. I delayed watching this sequel for most of 10 years because of the bad reviews I heard about it. If Tommy Lee Jones didn’t play Captain, call me, I didn’t see the point. If Larry McMurtry wasn't involved, why should I worry? How I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This is in many ways a worthy sequel to the Lonely Pigeon, perhaps even more than the gloomy mood of Laredo Street. History, acting, production, cinematography - all this is top notch. Of course, the script is not as colorful as Lonely Pigeon, but it has its moments. And, to my great surprise, there are pieces of “Lonely Made” in this series; The relationship between July and Clara, completely rejected in the prequel, rises here almost identical to the book, which is the most pleasant surprise. The story is not all roses, it has its own surprises too. Of course, the biggest surprise is the interpretation of John Voight "Captain Call". Although he is not a direct copy of Tommy Lee Jones, he is true and unique to Voight's reputation. The cast is fantastic across the board, and I don't think Rick Schroeder did a better job than in this series. Oliver Reed practically steals the show here, he's great in the role that makes you take care of his character just as you hate him. <br /> <br /> It’s worth looking at this if you don’t have bad criticism, especially because the DVD is so affordable (I got a two-disc set for $ 10.99, you probably will find it cheaper). It is by no means a disappointment that the “Walk of the Dead” turned around (well, that was for me). And MCMurtry has been associated with this!
