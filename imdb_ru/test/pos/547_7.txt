The main attraction is Anywhere, but Here is Natalie Portman's excellent performance. She gave her a rather ungrateful character that is much appreciated emotional depth. Susan Sarandon, a wonderful actress, quite sincere as the figure of the mother. I thought the chemistry between the two stars was plausible, chemistry that could be developed more with a more involved scenario. I’m not saying that the script was bad, I’m just saying that it seemed underdeveloped at times. I don't think it was a screenwriter mistake. The film suffered from being too long, and sometimes became unfocused in longer scenes. The film looks beautiful, with good leadership and excellent performance. In general, of course, it is watchable, but maybe more for the older audience. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
