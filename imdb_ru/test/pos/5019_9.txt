Why would this film be so good, but its total cost was estimated at $ 95,000,000 and there were NO premium nominations? John Travolta knows what he is doing. He knows that he is Michael, smoking a cigar, a magical, magical angel-arch who went down to live with a dying lady and is now in a car with the staff of the National Mirror and their dog Sparky on the way to Chicago. Then it turns into a journey that is both awful and awesome. I donâ€™t even think that the death scenes (3, to be exact) make it tearful. The soundtrack is best with "Heaven Is My Home", "Up Around The Bend" and "Chains Of Fools". I have very high hopes for this, and I say that in the 90s this should have been a little more respectful. Read my comment. Goodbye!
