To be honest, I loved Michael. although there were parts of "give me a pillow, I need to take a nap", it was cool. I think everyone has done a great job in this film. and Nora Efron on my "good" list of directors. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see John Travolta a big-bellied angel. It is not very often I see one in the film. Some people might call it a boring movie, but for me I loved it. angels and all.
