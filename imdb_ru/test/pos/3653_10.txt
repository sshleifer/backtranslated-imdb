Labor of love. Each frame is perfect for the image. Then obvious emotions and storytelling will lead you through a dream that will remain with you long after the movie. The director gets your heart and leads him after 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are part of the characters' emotional journey. I saw this film at two festivals, and he received applause at every show. A wonderful story goes beyond nationality and language, and I felt part of the drama unfolding before me. Casting is as perfect as possible. Vijay Raaz, Camilla and Benoit each keep theirs. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates a good movie. I can't wait for the commercial release of this film.
