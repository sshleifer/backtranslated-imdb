When I was a teenager, I watched this film every time he appeared on TV (and was in large numbers) because of his witty, attractive humor for a teenager. Maybe this is not what critics consider a 4-star viewing, but I love it for what it is - an amusing comedy designed to appeal to viewers. Teenage actors of my generation (maybe that's why I love this film so much), and they looked like a fantasy series of favorite TV shows of the early 90s - “Full House”, “Family Affairs”, “Fresh Prince” - all shows were presented and the result was probably the best teen movie of the 90s. While this may not include high doses of nudity and violence, which many teen filmmakers consider vital for success among demographic youth (or perhaps because of their absence), I strongly recommend it to all teenagers and teenagers.
