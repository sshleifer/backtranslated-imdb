This film was filled with great acting, great musical sounds that completely amaze the imagination. Larenz Tate, (Darius Lovehall), "Talia Glubokaya", '06 was a sharp cat with girls, and he soon met Waterloo with Nia Long, (Nina Mosley), Big Mama's House, 2000. Nina put her heart and soul into this role, and when she meets with Darius, sparks first flare up, and then some kind of hate relationship arises. The whole cast made this film very interesting, with a lot of comedies, dramas and lots of love and fraudulent activities. This is a very down-to-earth film, and at the same time it shows how everyone ultimately has his own destiny in life and is in his own little corner of this big world. Great movie, enjoy!
