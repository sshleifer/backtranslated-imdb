My friends and I rented this film just to satisfy a friend who really wanted to make it, despite the fact that he had no idea what he was talking about. We all thought it would be like “Canadian-American Pie,” but when we watched it, we were completely surprised, we were all silent throughout the film and we liked it! It was not an American pie at all, and it had a plot that adolescent girls adore (seeing the guy finally knocking the crap out of him), after that night he became my favorite movie not only for his plot, but for actors and great writing. There was not a moment when I thought it was incredible. Everything is very realistic and accessible to anyone who lives in a small town with little prospects. I absolutely adore this movie and recommend that you rent it the next time you have a chance, it's worth it.
