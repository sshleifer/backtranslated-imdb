This morning I saw two completely different adventures of Holmes, but you would be amazed at the similarities. <br /> <br /> This was probably the first collaboration between Basil Rathbone (if I were the king, Romeo and Juliet) and Nigel Bruce, and directed by Roy William Neal. This was not their first adventure with Sherlock Holmes, which they had done a couple of years before. <br /> <br /> This is a great team, but I prefer the Hammer version, which I will cover later. /> <br /> Holmes relies on a lot of disguises to do his job, and I am constantly surprised at the manners shown when they figure something out. It seems that they always catch the eye when they find a new hint. <br /> <br /> The story itself about how to keep the bombing site from the Germans in World War II was interesting and kept you in focus on the mystery.
