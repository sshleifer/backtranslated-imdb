I watched it on HBO because he won an Oscar the week before. It compares favorably with the fictional court dramas. <br /> <br /> The story of a 15-year-old black boy who was brought to trial for the murder of an elderly white woman in Jacksonville, Florida, almost exclusively on the basis of identification of the victim's husband and on the confession that protects the defense, was forced. <br /> <br /> About half of the footage - the trial; it is complemented by a video of defense lawyers (two public defenders) explaining their case, interviewing witnesses and visiting key places. It is edited with a minimum of unnecessary repetition and is placed in a logical order. The camera is pretty solid. And there is a slightly amazing epilogue.
