I saw this film at the Locarno Film Festival in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Paradise is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 7/10 because of its good moments. <br /> <br /> * ahead spoilers * <br /> <br /> There are some really good cinematic moments in it, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> Although my general feeling is too long (more than 2 hours and 40 minutes) and contains too many dialogues. And almost no dancing at all. <br /> <br /> Obviously, a Bollywood film such as Lagaan or Devdas is a completely different film compared to Bali Baller.
