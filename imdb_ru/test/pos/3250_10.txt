A few years ago I saw Two Hands in Sydney, and he immediately became one of my favorite films. It has action, adventure, comedy and romance, which are combined into one (and added a little Zen). As in many Australian films, the plot is easy to follow, but it is surprisingly interesting, and Jordan should be justly proud of his work. <br /> <br /> In any case, it was on television just now on channel 4 in London, and my favorite comedy scenes were cut out, not only of this film, but of any other film! So if you are watching this movie, make sure that this is the original version.
