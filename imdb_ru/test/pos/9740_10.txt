In the 60s, the Cleveland television audience could watch the Flash Gordon episode at the Gulari Show (23:30 Fridays). It was the best mockery each of us had ever seen in high school. We would have regular “overnight stays” (although we didn’t call them that) to enjoy viewing this material with a group of friends. Then next week we will quote our favorite lines from Cornball from the last episode. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie today has the same reaction. But if you can stop laughing at dialogue, lame creatures, silly costumes and terrible spaceships for long enough, there are some good things that I didn't appreciate the first time. Designers of production created several excellent sets, both for rooms, and for laboratory devices. The character of Charles Middleton, “The Merciless,” was the best villain of all time, certainly up to that time and controversially better than anyone ever since. Gene Rogers is amazingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
