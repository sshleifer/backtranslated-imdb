This is an exciting adventure film that can be seen, with a great cast and a good story based on real events. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the story of the film is based on real events. This is primarily an adventure story with all the usual ingredients that can be expected from adventure films made in the Arab world. So, a lot of sword fights, good old-fashioned honor, religion and a rich, proud country. But the film is also filled with humor to make the film easy and enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> The constant transfer between Morocco and the plot involving Sean Connery and Candice Berger and the American storyline with Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith), in my opinion, is not the best approach. These two things have completely different tempos, completely different characters, they are just completely different worlds! Of course, both storylines are connected and focused on the same thing, but the contrast between the two worlds is too great to allow it to work. This does not always make the film feel connected and a bit disconnected. The American storyline is in most cases more political, and the Moroccan storyline is purely adventurous and full of action. In the end, you may even wonder what the point or Roosevelt is in this film. It seems that John Milius is just a big fan of him. Often, the American storyline took away most of the tempo from the much more interesting and action-filling fast-paced Moroccan storyline. After all, John Milius was always at his best as a director. <br /> <br /> Half of the film is gaining momentum. Then the biggest movie action begins. Especially large-scale final battle does not disappoint. I wish the whole movie was like that. No doubt this film would be more famous. <br /> <br /> In the film, Jerry Goldsmithâ€™s magnificent musical score, known, perhaps better than the film itself. The film also looks good with great industrial design and beautiful fighting. At first glance, the film costs only $ 4,000,000, but it's really hard to believe, given the settings and the size of the film. I mean John Milius, his most famous film, Conan the Barbarian, cost about $ 20,000,000, but it was much more decent and less impressive in scale. <br /> <br /> It's pretty funny to see an Arab speak with a big fat Scottish accent, but hey, this is Sean Connery, so you just tend to accept that. He is well suited for his role. Like Candice Bergen. It is always difficult for a female character to appear believable and work in a film like this one, but she copes. Also John Houston plays an important role in this film! <br /> <br /> Wonderful movie! <br /> <br /> 7/10
