If you want a movie with a full range of emotions, look NO further; dramatic and funny, and scenes of excruciating emotions; I can guarantee with confidence that VERY few will be able to watch this warm and VERY human film without losing their tears from time to time. It is hard to believe in the actions of the two sides; you would swear that two young people really suffer from muscular dystrophy (Rory) and cerebral palsy (Michael); Simply put, two of the best performances I have ever seen; they are also two very believable characters, and you never had the feeling that you were simply "thrown" for dramatic purposes or to evoke sympathy. In the DVD release as “add-ons,” they have “deleted scenes” (including an alternative ending) and “extended party sequences”; why these clips were not included in the final film is difficult to understand, since they are ideally linked to the rest of the film and are by no means redundant. But unconditionally, I can wholeheartedly recommend this film to everyone; one of the best I've ever seen.
