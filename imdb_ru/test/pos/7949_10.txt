I was lucky to see this film at the recently concluded international film festival here. In fact, I was able to watch another South Korean film (“The Power of Gangwon Province”), but Christmas in August caught my attention more. The story is quite simple, an ordinary guy meets a girl (or, shall we say, meets a girl?). What made it special for me was how it was provided. You could say the movie was quiet and sweet. We do not have a bright and contrived novel here, only two ordinary creatures, surprised by their friendship and unexpressed love for each other. I also liked how the film used pictures as an expression of the relationship of the past and the present. I wanted it to be shown here as a regular movie. I am sure that this will cause a large audience.
