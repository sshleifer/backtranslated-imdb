Sarah Plain and The End of Tall's Winter were the best movie I've ever seen. The man in the story I liked the most was to be Cassie by Emily Osment. Just because of her energy and how she expresses her opinion. For example, when Anna calls from the city, Cassie wants to answer and says, “Hello? Anna, guess what. The great father died, but he returned, and he is not a good man! ”I liked all the films about Sarna Plain and Tulle, and I think Sarah Slane and Hyle were in third place. Lark was number 2. The end of winter was number 1! If I could live in any family from the past, it would be the Whiting family. I think there are so many good roles in this movie that I can't name them all. I think they chose the best and most accomplished actors to play all these people in the film, so if you ever want to watch a movie from the past, I highly recommend Sarah Plain and Tails Winters &.
