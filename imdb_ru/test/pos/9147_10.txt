No matter how many times Famielius Famishius Wail Etelbert coyote tries to get Runner Runius Roadibus, we always know what will happen, although our sympathy is always with WEC. The highlight in "Hook, Line and Stinker" is a scheme in the style of Ruba Goldberg, which, as the WEC hopes, will finally achieve RR; but of course you know what happens. <br /> <br /> So, Wil E. continues to have fun with fanaticism (George Santayana defined as doubling your efforts after you forgot your goal), while Road Runner almost never becomes aware of the potential danger - or lack thereof - in which he may be. This is a classic. <br /> <br /> And yes, coyote Ethelbert's second name. I learned it from "Danger!".
