Lackawanna Blues is a drama to the end. It details the life of a strong woman named Rachel Crosby (S. Epata Merkerson). Rachel is mentioned as a nanny by everyone who knows her, but she could just as easily have been called Miracle Woman. She personified strength, willpower, confidence and determination. She owned a house that she used for almost every person that society would refuse. Its tenants consisted of a lesbian, a veteran of the psychotic war, a person with an amputee, and many other vagrants who made the house far from ordinary. Each subsequent event Rachel perceived with success and flawlessly. She was not a dictator, devoid of compassion, but in fact she was completely the opposite. She showed sympathy for almost wine, providing shelter and shelter to so many that she seemed to overestimate herself. <br /> <br /> Merkerson did a good job, but I still think that this role was in her alley. The film had an even keel that never deviated from Rachel. There were, of course, dramatic moments, but they were to be expected. Nothing was shocking or deep, except Rachel herself.
