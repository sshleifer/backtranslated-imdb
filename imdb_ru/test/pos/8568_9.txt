I remember hearing about this film and how it played in almost every movie theater in Toronto. We are talking about a group of girls who are not accepted by other universities in their college, so they start their own and, of course, call it H.O.T.S. This is a funny movie that just breaks from nostalgia for the car! A lot of fully gifted T-shirts, vans, fighting games and football matches like no other! It is compared to Animal House, which is a good film in itself, but nothing compares to H.O.T.S. He has his own brand of fun and character. If you are looking for a classic movie T n'A, look no further, because H.O.T.S. Come to the aid of girls, shorts-boom-boom and all!
