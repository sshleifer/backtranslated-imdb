Sigrid Thornton (SeaChange) was born to play the role of Philadelphia Gordon in Cato, in this story, which is often compared to the classics of the American Civil War Margaret Mitchell "Gone With the Wind." Waters (Heaven Tonight) is perhaps in his best role as well as her love interest for Larraquin, and these two are heading a wonderful Australian cast in this perhaps the most famous and beloved Australian mini-series. This is <br /> <br /> an outstanding production from all sides, although do not try to watch it all in one hit, and it deserves to be remembered as a magnificent image of life in the Australian federation. Rating: 8/10
