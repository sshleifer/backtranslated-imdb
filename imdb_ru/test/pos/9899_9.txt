The release time of this film could not be better, especially in the light of all the upheavals in the modern world. The film is a touching, cute and witty movie. If you have brothers and sisters, and the parents are still alive, it will be good for the viewer. If you lose your parents, it will deeply affect you. Laughing often, the cast works very well together and believable. This film is written wisely, and the lines that come from each of the actors make the viewer often laugh out loud. There are moments that will cause tears in your eyes. I would recommend this film to anyone who respects the importance of the family and can watch an intellectual film.
