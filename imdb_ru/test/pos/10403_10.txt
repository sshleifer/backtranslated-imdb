For example, I really liked this movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a “typical Asian horror” where you can see the horrible look of a ghost (usually a woman) that scares people. You hardly see the ghosts in most films, but the way this film makes you interested in the plot and characters is ingenious. This is not a movie for you if you are horrified (for example, Saw, Hostel) or “scares a surprise” when things pop up (Hollywood horror films, slashers), but this movie has a “creepy” factor throughout . The whole movie I loved. “Norah” is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to horror among ridiculous remakes and non-original crap released by Hollywood in modern society. <br /> <br /> Please do not let the documentary style of filming distract you (why is it ?!). It is far superior to the Blair Witch project, because, first, the acting game in Nora is great, and it really makes you feel that you are watching something that you should not see. <br /> <br /> “Norah” is definitely one of the best horror films I have ever seen. Only a few films hit the top 5 of my horrors; and this film takes the # 1 spot on my list.
