Fans of Pink Panther, Naked Gun, or Get Smart will surely enjoy this farce, which won one Cesar and was nominated for another four. <br /> <br /> Jean Dujardin is an agent of OSS 117, a man who does not know the key if he hits his head. It also reflects the colonialist attitudes characteristic of the West. <br /> <br /> All the Russian spies, Nazis and Muslim radicals around him are just as stupid, but there is Larmia (Berenice Bejo) and Princess (Aure Atika) to keep things interesting. <br /> <br /> OSS 117’s strange ability to pick up languages, play musical instruments when he first takes them, and to sing like a native, is all the more impressive than Bond’s tricks. but he is still stupid.
