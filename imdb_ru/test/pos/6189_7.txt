The sleeping cell is trying to swim on both sides of the basin (terrorism / patriotic American Muslims), and this is not very good. <br /> <br /> I put off watching this show for a long time because I had it. I felt that it would be too predictable, but after a year in the netflix queue, I finally moved it to the fore. <br /> <br /> The series tells how a Muslim undercover works for the FBI in an attempt to infiltrate a terrorist cell operating in the United States. The secret agent in the show is actually a Muslim, so we see his conflict / resolution between his patriotism and his religious beliefs. Personally, I would prefer to watch a drama about an American muslin family living in the United States, but it is doubtful that an American TV channel (cable or network) will ever produce something that shows Muslims in a flattering light. <br /> <I’m not a Muslim, but I have many Muslim friends, and I can honestly say that none of them is a terrorist and they all love America. <br /> <br /> Sleeper Cell is close to eliminating Muslim stereotypes, but it also focuses on the worst Muslim stereotypes. In the first episode, we see “honor killing”, which is a very bad image of Islam, but in the third episode, we see a very respected moderate Muslim teaching the viewer that real jihad is actually a personal struggle that is not meant to incite to violence towards others. <br /> <br /> If the main character of the show was only a moderate Muslim scholar. <br /> <br /> Americans need to learn more about Islam, Sleeper Cell helps a little, but it does not give the American audience what it really needs to know. <br /> <br /> However, the action in this show is great, and the drama is extremely exciting. If only they had made this Islam show in America without terrorism, that would be first class.
