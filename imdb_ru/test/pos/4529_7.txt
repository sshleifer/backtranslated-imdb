This is the thirteenth film "Falcon". Tom Conway has not lost his humor and style and shows no signs of fatigue. The film has a very nice story, with lots of red herring, suspects and ladies. Madget Meredith is a good girl in history, she plays her adequately, but in no way case sets fire to the screen. Mirna Dell is a bad girl, and she has a brilliant stone face with agate eyes, and you are just waiting for her to kill as many people as possible in order to cheer yourself up. Edward Brophy returned as Goldie's assistant, but an unexpected surprise, his manic over-action ceased, and he was actually in control. This is a good tribute to the directorial skill of William A. Burke, who made so many westerns that he was probably not ready to accept any nonsense from a Brooklyn dummy. As a result, for the first time, perhaps in his career, Brophy was muffled enough to add something to the film, rather than trying out the viewer's patience with the annoying behavior of a backward but unmanaged six-year-old child. Everything is going very well and very interesting.
