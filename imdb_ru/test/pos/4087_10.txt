Like some people here, I loved / loved the Stingers! In Norway, he went on the air much later. This also means that we are in episode 176. (yes, that's right) I must say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'll die on the day we reach episode # 192. Stingers can be on the show (except for Grey's Anatomy), which I really watch! The actors are awesome! Especially Hasinta Stapleton! Personally, I think that she is one of the best with us! I know he is not the same as SUP-famous, but she is really a great actress! Stingers makes me want to be a cop! I like it! <br /> <br /> PS: Do you know if you can buy episodes?
