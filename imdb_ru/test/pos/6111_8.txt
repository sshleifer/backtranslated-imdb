The “pink flamingos” were revolutionary for their time, and even today they are still difficult to look at. Not that I don't enjoy the film, it's fun; but it's very disgusting, and John Waters pushes the envelope as far as it can. The story concerns Babs Johnson (Devine), she is the dirtiest woman ever. She lives in a trailer with her son Crackers and her daughter, Cotton. Not to mention the overweight Edie, who is obsessed with eggs and sleeps in the crib. Then there are Connie and Raymond Marble, two dirty perverts who envy Babs. They are eager to surpass her, being the dirtiest man in the world. This means that their gatekeeper infiltrates abducted women and sells children to lesbian couples, publicly disperses people, and even sends Babs kaki by mail. Babs resists to prove that she is the most insane man alive. This includes even incest, killing and eating dog crap and other sick sexual acts. This is a film for the whole family. (well, depending on where you live?) See Pink Flamingos, but don't forget about your bar-bag. For more perverted, weird sex and bodily functions, see also Sweet Movie.
