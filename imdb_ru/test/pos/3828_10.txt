I just thought I would add one more observation here. Although there are several visual implications in this episode about the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Joman Janice Rand; there is a special, physically tender moment towards the end. When the Enterprise moves backward at an extraordinary speed, trying to outrun, perhaps the deadly Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps fearing that their life is about to end, is looking for comfort, laying her head on Jimâ€™s sympathetic shoulder, watching the approaching tool of their impending doom on the main viewer. I thought it was cute (and Janice, of course, gorgeous!). <br /> <br /> (PS Guf: - Several times, when the Phasors are allegedly launched, the film shows the launch of photon torpedoes)
