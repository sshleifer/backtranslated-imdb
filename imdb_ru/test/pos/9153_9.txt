And there is nothing wrong with that! I wholeheartedly approve of the comments of Boblipton and the Snow Leopard. <br /> <br /> I am very glad that this film is available on American DVD - I only saw it once - I convinced Goethe Institute here in London to show it in their Conrad Feidt season a few years ago - and wait a long time again. <br /> <br /> Barrymore is great when he's busy, like in this film, perhaps because of the injection of a famous German actor like foil. And Weidt is such a wonderful scene thief (doesn't he pick at one place?) original films linking Dr. Jekyll to the 20th Century, the Grand Hotel or Midnight; and “Doctor Caligari's Cabinet” or “Disciple of Prague” with “Spy in Bladk”, “Smuggling” and “Casablanca”. <br /> <br /> Look!
