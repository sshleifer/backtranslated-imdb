I caught this film as one of five to five dollar deals at a local video store, and it was a most pleasant surprise. This is a collection of four interrelated stories built around four children who have just had a car accident and are waiting for someone to pick them up. They tell each other these stories to kill time, and sometimes they are struck by flashing lights and funny sounds that all converge in the end of O. Henry, which makes me happy. A real discovery. The blood (and a lot), the chest and the beasts round it all up quite nicely ... Jasinda Barrett is worth one price for the entrance. This keeper, says Jim Bob, check. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, “Pumpkinhead” was also one of our five options, and IMDB recommends it to anyone who loves “Tales on a fire”. I will follow as soon as I have the opportunity to sit down and watch it. Joyeux Samhain!
