“Half empty” is a funny musical about an eternal optimist, in this case a self-help book writer who goes to Germany by mistake, thinking that he is popular there. Instead of adoring the public, he finds himself alone in the world of exhausted misanthropists, including a woman who should be his publicist. His attempts to make friends in scenes, which are mostly improvised, lead to one great meeting after another, when he insults nihilistic musicians, rude gangsters, etc. heart and her mind - but his own world view is shocked when his hero, a much more popular self-taught writer, turns out to be not quite what he seems. The action is interspersed with several musical numbers. <br /> <br /> We saw this at the DeadCenter Film Festival in Oklahoma City and were amazed. This is really fun, inspired little indie production. You can argue about some technical things (for example, about lighting, which is a bit dark), but the piece is quite funny and inspired, so it doesn't bother you much. If Voltaire wrote “Candide” today, the character would be the author of self-help.
