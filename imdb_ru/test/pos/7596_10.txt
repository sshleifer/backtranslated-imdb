it does not matter whether Drew or Lily are absolute babies, but there are many girls who are so cute and hot, but they seem so boring. This film is not an Oscar type of film, but there is at least a good point of view about what life is like for young people or for “real” people. It made us laugh and learn to accept others as they really are. this film represents the real world and what really matters.
