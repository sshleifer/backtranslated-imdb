I don’t really like "police" movies, but this one is supposedly classic, and when I found it cheap, I bought it and put it on the shelf, only to finally see it yesterday, and I liked it! Now you can have New York, but as a place for a movie like this, it's perfect in the winter months. Roy Shader is a member of an elite police group called “Seven Ups”, in which 5 people participate who are fighting off crime undercover. At the opening of the scene, they return a shoe box full of money from an antique shop, distracting the scammers with the bull in the china shop. But this is only the beginning. Looks like there are two guys posing as policemen who kidnap mafia and keep them for ransom. Richard Lynch turned out to be one of these bags, and he is just as creepy as ever. When one of the Seven Oops, who pretends to be a limousine driver at a funeral, breaks the shelter, they beat him and put him in the trunk of a car, which then leads to one of the most exciting chases I've ever seen. It is surprising, however, how easy it is to move in New York for chase scenes, but still it is rather surprising because Scheider follows two captors through, I suppose, the Bronx, and then onto the highway, and then, eventually, the car Scheider stops with a shriek. in one of the most heartbreaking finals of the scene of persecution I've ever seen. In any case, since the policeman eventually dies, Scheider and his people are under suspicion, because the police commissioner knows so little about their actions that he wonders if they want to kidnap the bandits, so of course this kind of thinking you need to nip in the bud and shader inexorably get to the bottom of things. Overall a decent cop action / drama, not exactly my thing, but I liked this one. Look for Joe Spinella (Maniac) in a small role. 7 out of 10.
