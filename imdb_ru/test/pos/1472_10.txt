Well, when I rented it a few years ago, I had the worst expectations. Yes, the acting is not great, and the picture itself looks outdated, but when I was sitting there, a strange thing happened. I liked it. The action is great and there are several scenes that make you jump. Brion James, possibly one of the greatest B-class actors alongside Bruce Campbell, is great as ever. The story is also not bad. Now I’m not in a hurry and buying it, but you won’t waste your time, at least watching this good b-class post-apocalyptic western.
