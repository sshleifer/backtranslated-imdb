The cinema does not take itself seriously, and if you follow his example, you will have a lot of fun (if you do not mind, your killings are really bloodshed, and your horror is surmounted by excess cheese)! <br /> <br /> This film winks at every horror fan, and then shows them the finger. He knows that it sucks, and because it is undoubtedly the best in the “Child’s Play” series. <br /> <br /> He plays the role of “stupid humor” so well that you do more than just laugh at him, but with that. And believe me, all the time when you laugh, it laughs back. <br /> <br />
