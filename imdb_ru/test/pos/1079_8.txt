I saw it at the London Film Festival last night, apparently in a shorter version. James McNally's resume on the content of the film is very good. Nossiter very dexterously mixes his research into the wine business with the broader issues of globalization, homogenization, the influence of the media, the power of capital and the need for diversity. <br /> <br /> The film is shot with it. kept DV, which some might have found a conspirator, but who did allow Nossiter to take people by surprise in some cases, which probably would not have been possible with more conventional equipment. <br /> <br /> Despite the sprawling look of the film, editing is very sharp, not only gives us a parade of dogs in the world, but also cuts the comments of a number of respondents with somewhat contradictory visual images and gives others enough rope to hang themselves. To some extent this caused the recent work of Michael Moore (although Nossiter operates more subtly), but the film’s roots probably go to Marcel Ofuls’s “Sadness and Pity”, both in the film’s construction and in the appearance "Salt of the earth" French peasants like stars. De Montille Pere et Fils attended the LFF screening and answered questions after. We all really need a little mess - Hubert's Bravo! <br /> <br /> In general, an excellent film, in which there are consequences that go far beyond winemaking and help us create ourselves as people and organize our world.
