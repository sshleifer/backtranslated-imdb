I first watched this film many years ago with my daughter, who is now 13 years old and who fell in love with a vampire. we both thought it was the best movie, then watched sub 11, sub 111, and now I found that there is a sub 1v, which I can't wait to put on my fangs, and also there is a fifth in the pipeline. if no one saw the movies. these are the best of the best. I think this is a thousand oscar desserver. I could watch them from morning till night. I would like him to have the same nails as the girls. I love it as all the storylines go on from movie to movie. these ant movies about vampires are better. I would like to live in a life that performs in films. all my dreams will come true
