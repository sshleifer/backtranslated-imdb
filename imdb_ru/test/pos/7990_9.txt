As a child I grew up with a short TV series from the 60s (and no, I'm not that old, a prisoner of war!). However, when director Tim Burton presented his new vision on a silver screen, I just immediately lit it and never refused to prefer his stories compared to many recent additions (“Batman Begins” and “The Dark Knight”), which worried. Even if they are going to go for a much more reasonable approach and want to continue studying the psyche of Bruce Wayne / Batman? but honestly, I don't think that there is anything that can be used. I wanted crazy fun with a dark streak, and in my eyes, this is what Burton brought to me, which is why I can watch them again and again. <br /> <br /> After the surprise of the audience with the "Batman" of 1989, thanks to the tasteless gothic artistic direction and Jack Nicholson, the performance without prisoners in the camp, but the crazy joker. Burton will be back in 3 years for the sequel and while my favorite movie is about Batman; "Batman is back." Camp, but well done. That is true to being even more expansive, loud, dreary and nihilistic and having two villainous opponents for the price of one. Enter the grotesque Penguin (with a magnificent exit for Danny DeVito on a limb) and a delightful catwoman (energetic Michelle Pfeiffer, who fits the costume nicely), suitable to spoil Gotham's party. Again Batman (aptly thoughtful Michael Keaton is equally commendable and looks quite impressive in this bat costume - look at his eyes) plays a second violin with the bad guys, but I always preferred this sober interpretation of Batman, who gave him an ominously grim mystic but also wear psychological complexity that never felt the need to force feed. And his succession with Bruce Wayne was also well served. Illustratively, the atmospheric direction of Burton opens with his sleek gothic style that engraves the world of carnival comics, permeated with a magnificent range of characters and bright costumes. The capricious narrative (in what is probably a little longer) is more symbolic in its progression, rather showing pieces of its spontaneously exciting and extravagant scenery and sharply imprinted artistic direction covered with dark shades and gray-blue neon lighting. Winter background Magnetic-free camera work flies away, and Danny Elfman's impressive spacious score balances playfulness and gloomy touches with a very hypnotic effect. The remaining performances can be overshadowed, but Christopher Walken bites his teeth into the ingenious glass role of the two-faced businessman Max Shrek. Pat Hingle has returned, but he has little to do, since Commissioner James Gordon and Michael Gough are as amazing as Alfred. With solid support from Michael Murphy, Andrew Brynyarsky, Vincent Schiavelli, Doug Jones and Peter Rubens also play cameos.
