The Closer She Get ... is a tricky documentary about the death of a man I really knew. This allows you to look at the private moments of the family involved in the most difficult time of their lives. Parents, as a rule, support the work of their children, in this case the topic of the documentary film goes beyond. She was ready to share her death experience as an act of love for her son. This is the most touching work of art, weaving together the serious, serene and easy side of life for this family. This is a story that can make you laugh, but also cry, because it touches the problems that we all have to face. I highly recommend this documentary to those who are not afraid of crying and are ready to solve the problem of mortality in the most human way. This movie will touch you.
