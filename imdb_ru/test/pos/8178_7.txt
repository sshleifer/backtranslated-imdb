The pace of the film is heavy in parts, but if you can tune in to its languid speed and long silence, then this is a satisfactory part of court intrigue. The story of the first emperor of China, his childhood, beloved and personal value of power. The film is very atmospheric, extremely well-mannered and polite court ceremony and ritual contrasts with the sudden brutal violence. Filmed in such a way that causes shade and cold spaces. Scenes of battles are rare and short, the focus is on the battle inside the person on what to do and justify the ends of the means. The path of the emperor from the idealistic peacemaker to the ruthless tyrant aims to be subtle, but gives little background or a convincing understanding of the Emperor's motivation, his actions and goals really do not change everywhere, only Gun Li's attitude towards him changes. The most interesting performances are “Hong Li” and the title assassin, when they overestimate, when to fight, when to retreat, when to kill. The most expensive film ever made in China at the time, “The Emperor and the Assassin” does not rely on hysterical emotions or big battles, but rather on the gloomy atmosphere of threat and inevitability. Gong Li fans will be surprised to learn that she is as stunningly beautiful as before and shows an understated performance.
