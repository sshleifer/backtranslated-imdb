My sister, dad and I are really into D & D, and one evening we were watching Netflix looking for a movie to watch this one appear. We thought we would try, and I almost died of laughter. Writing and acting in this film is just awesome! Witty characters, great teamwork and fun moments kept us in stitches all the time. I love this film! This may not make much sense for those who do not know about Dungeons & Dragons, but, nevertheless, this is a good movie. This only suggests that the success of films does not need an astronomical budget and famous actors / actresses. Check it out if you want a good, clean comedy.
