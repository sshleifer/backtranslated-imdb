If you go to the cinema to have fun, have fun, to fill your time, do not miss the opportunity to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If you go to the cinema to appreciate the depths of human feelings, the feelings of real people, to explore the personality traits, if you go to the cinema to absorb a great photo, be sure to put this movie very high on your list preferably first. This experience is deeply useful, forcing an intelligent viewer to reflect on the meaning of life itself. With Mar Adentro, Alejandro Amenabar surpassed the best he has done to date, and even redeemed some of the deviations in his earlier films, which dismissed the Hollywood targeting slightly. This does not apply to this visual poem superimposed on the music: Hollywood could never be compared with the effect of this tingling human and humane story. <br /> <br /> In no way should Mar Adentro be interpreted as an apology for euthanasia; This story, based on the real life of the Galician fisherman Ramon Sampedro, is a cry of the whole soul about life and love, the achievement of human compassion, understanding of emotions. Sampedro was an intelligent and intelligent man who, after an accident while diving off the rocks of the Galician coast in his youth, was doomed to live in bed for the next 27 years. “Condenado a vivir” (2001) (television) was the first version of this man’s life, which I have already commented. Nevertheless, Amenabar surprisingly succeeded in portraying this man with his constant enigmatic smile and witty sense of humor equally clear and clever. <br /> <br /> And Javier Bardem stood up on this occasion, having met a difficult head - complete with a Galician accent, creating a spectacular, exciting, exciting performance, so that the actor and the fisherman merge into the same person on the screen. Here, really, is an occasion to take off your hat and quietly mutter the “introductory part”. In his assignment, Bardem plays a great cast, especially Belen Rueda, Lola Duenas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo (Los Lunes al Sol) (see) And Clara Segura, Galician and Catalan accents, which play a prominent role. <br /> <br /> Amenabar creates wonderful dialogues, as these six rotate one-on-one or in groups with excellent chemistry, demonstrating that this young Chilean director from Spain is an artist who knows who he is and how to get its results; his global concept of the film includes his own music, interspersed with plays by Beethoven and Puccini on the Sampedro player. <br /> <br /> Looking at Mar Adentro, I compared it to this film a couple of times with Stephen Daldry and his masterpiece Watch. I mean how the dialogues work with tension and passion, and that is a thorough sense of time in every scene. <br /> <br /> Javier Aguirresaroba’s photo, as usual, is gorgeous. As I mentioned elsewhere on IMDb, he doesn’t just shoot events and scenes - he even catches the feelings and atmosphere of the moment, deftly catches views, light and shadows, so his work behind the camera is just another player in history. Gorgeous artist. <br /> <br /> “Mar Adentro” is another attraction in the history of Spanish cinema, one of the best five or six works of art created here over the past 25 years. This film puts itself alongside such cinematographic works as “El Sur” (see), “Los Santos Inocentes” (see), “El Abuelo” (see), “Lengue de las Mariposas” (see), "Las Ratas" (qv), "Los Que Aman" (qv), and I think I should add "Te Doy Mis Ojos" (qv). <br /> <br /> A wonderfully planned story of a real man and those who loved him around his bed: do not miss.
