Although the premise of the film involves a great "coincidence", all the actors do a decent job and look great, turning history into reality. I found myself cheering on the characters played by Mary Tyler Moore and Christina Lahti, sympathizing with both and wishing them to reconcile. Sam Waterston and Ted Danson are also good at their roles, coping well with stereotypical relationships with friends. While the story tends to jump in time, sometimes leaving the audience perhaps a little hungry because of the missing details, it still flows and avoids real confusion. This interesting storyline has all the elements for a good "throwing chicks."
