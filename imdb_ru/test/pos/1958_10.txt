I hope the writer, director, editor and composer (and let's not forget the producer) read it ... because their work was really incredible in this film. Let me start by saying that I am in no way associated with this film. I'm just an ordinary guy who was a fan of this film for about 12 years and saw him about 8 times. <br /> <br /> Every second of this film is touching. Every scene is classic. The game is real. The film is honest. You can treat these characters as people, not as actors. <br /> <br /> This story tells about three murderers at different stages of their lives. The story is carefully thought out, and each story is intertwined and intertwined, which ends with a message that makes us think about the values ​​of good and evil that each of us carries in ourselves. <br /> <br /> Crispen Glover, Daniel Robak, Dennis Hopper and Joshua John Miller (aged 12) give absolutely stunning, real performances. I have seen this film about 8 or more times, and I am still so absorbed in their performances that I forget that I am watching a movie. It's so great. Great job to everyone who worked on this. Great job. <br /> <br /> Music also blends and pursues. With a chosen cast, elaborate editing and tempo, mood and tone, and even a theme, the director made some of the best decisions for a film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This movie is real. This is honest. This is a real movie that I will never forget. You may not be in the subject line, but this is something you cannot ignore. Ultimately, people are people ... and everyone can relate to that. I recommend this movie to lovers of drama, suspense and horror on almost any other movie.
