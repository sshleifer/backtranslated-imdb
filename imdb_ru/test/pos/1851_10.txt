I love this film! It has everything! Bonnie Hunt did a fantastic job writing, shooting and filming this film. David Duchovny is just hot. and Minnie Driver is as sweet as ever. Combine all this talent with David Allen Greer, Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Joel Richardson and Jim Belushi - you have an Oscar-worthy film I'm surprised they didn't get one. if you haven't seen it, rent a DVD, watch it once, and then leave the director's comment ... Bonnie Hunt is awesome!
