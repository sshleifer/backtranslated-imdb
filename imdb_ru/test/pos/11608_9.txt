Choker Bali was shown on (Washington) DC Filmfest on April 15, 2005. The director, Rituparno Gosh, was there to give a brief introduction and answer questions afterwards. <br /> <br /> As always, Aishwarya did a fantastic job. I can understand those who believe that it should be more aggressive or more severe, but will it really be realistic in 1904? Perhaps, perhaps; Realistically, I'm not sure. I think her interpretation was correct, although there could of course be other ways to do it. <br /> <br /> I hate to use this word, but it was the most "inaccessible" of Indian films that I have ever seen. I know quite a lot of Indian history, Hindu religion, etc., But the level of detail here was much higher than me. Obviously, you would understand the film better if you were intimately familiar with Hinduism and its customs, especially. how were they with. 1904 I missed a lot - one of them was that the mother-in-law wanted Binodini in the house to be a kind of counterbalance to her daughter-in-law Ashalata. <br /> * Spoilers * Ghosh said a few things that explained the film much better for me. First, the original Bengali version was more than 20 minutes longer. So what's left? Apparently there are three main points: the initial stretch where Binodini (Aishwarya) leaves E. Bengal to Calcutta. According to the director, various heroes oppose Bengali against Bengali, and then create some political comments. Of course, all this is lost in the Hindi version, and, of course, for a non-Indian like me, in any case it would not matter - but the situation with the Bengali language would surely have a meaning. Then there was a segment in which Binodini wrote a poem - a sign of her independence, and so on. Finally, one more thing about jewelry. Therefore, although some people think it was too long, I think the original, longer version would be clearer. <br /> <br /> Female hair was apparently another sign (again Gosh) - her mother-in-law had short hair (short hair for Hindu widows), her sister — also widows — had longer hair ( more modern!), and, of course, Binodini / Aishwarya had very long hair up to the waist (giving up widowhood status). <br /> <br /> The ending really shook me - suddenly Binodini, who never had a political thought, writes a political manifesto? Wow Ghosh explained that he was in Locarno, at the film festival, when the subtitles were done. Subtitles use the word “country” in Binodini’s letter. Ghosh said that a more appropriate word would be (I forgot his exact word) something like “I” or “independence” - she talked about her liberation and “finding herself”, and not about Bengal, India and the British, So why does Binodini just disappear the day after Bhari finds again? Obviously, because during her time in the Ganges she realizes that she does not need a man — any man — to define / complete her. She might just be herself. Therefore, she rejects Behari, whom she abandoned for several months (?), And simply leaves. Of course, I'm not sure how she will buy her next meal, but that is another matter. <br /> <br /> The red handkerchief (again Ghosh), which she buys, is a “revolution” as well as a “passion”. I'm not 100% sure why she puts a handkerchief on a dying woman, but maybe she rejects passion / revolution? The binoculars that Binodini uses throughout the entire film (for watching Mahendra and Ashalaty, boats on the Ganges, etc.). She is a voyeur to see the life she aspires to, but cannot. At the end (I missed it!) She leaves the binoculars on the table with the letter, showing that they are no longer needed - she leaves to lead her own life. <br /> <br /> Finally At the beginning of Tagore's quotation, it was said that he apologized for the final ... Obviously, Tagore wrote this as a series, luring his readers with the widow's sexual bits. But in the end he sold himself to conservatism and made Binodini kneel at the feet of Mahendra and Behari, asking for their forgiveness. One of his students (?) Wrote to Tagore, taking him on a mission to sell him, and Tagore apologized for the ending. In the film, of course, Ghosh goes in a different direction.
