The best thing to say about the movie “Traffic” is that he drew attention to the excellent British miniseries “Traffic”. As noted by many, the current film suffers from the plot's truncation in order to adapt to the short attention span of moviegoers and the waiting time of movie theater owners, who measure the success of the movie by overpriced food sales. <br /> <br /> I first recorded this mini-series in 1990, when it was shown on Public Television, and watched it many times. The entire series of documentary style has a strong element of tragedy and doom about it, as all the characters move towards their possible fate. The strongest of these three stories is that the Pakistani family was forced to come to the city to save their body and soul after the army burned the poppy crop in a step-by-step demonstration of power that was worn for the benefit of Western politicians. Family rickshaws look like family rickshaws. In the end, the farmer finds a job, but he jeopardizes his pride and honesty. <br /> <br /> The Pakistani segment of the film is particularly relevant today, when there is a struggle against al Qaeda supporters, and gives some insight into the support of such movements among the poor of Pakistan and Afghanistan, who rarely receive money coming into these countries. . The film emphasizes that farmers see hardly 25% of the aid that should encourage them to grow other crops. <br /> <br /> With the inability of Americans to see anything other than black and white, - Good guys against bad guys - it's interesting to see a different look, where there is no black and white, only shades of gray. <br /> <br /> A possible spoiler ahead. The only problem I encountered in this story was that instead of everything going on, as they did before, as it would be in real life, being a fantastic piece, they had to wrap it so that “bad guys "got what they had to. Besides that, it was a wonderful job that we see too rarely. The cast was outstanding, and the German and Pakistani locations helped to give the film a “different” look (what change did it make when it saw the Germans as something different than the villains in the film of World War II).
