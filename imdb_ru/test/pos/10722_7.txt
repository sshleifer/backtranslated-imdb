After Midnight Cowboy, I was on the lookout for films with Dustin Hoffman and basically did not disappoint. Since Kramer vs. Kramer, I have been on the lookout for films with Meryl Streep and mostly have not been disappointed. She gave an excellent performance, truly one of her best, in Sophie's Decision, and I put her in Out of Africa. The fact that these two actors came together more than 20 years ago for Kramer vs. Kramer was definitely a very good idea: the result was an excellent character drama with a theme that is still very relevant in modern society. <br /> <br /> With a divorce everyone has a pretty bad time, although children seem to suffer the most ?????? .. Beautifully crafted by Robert Benton in some original production, representing some memorable scenes: even the corridor takes on the character and must be included in the cast! As for the breakfast scene with Billy (Justin Henry), just great. How can you make an eight-year-old act? Benton did it, and, of course, with Hoffman, there seemed to be good electricity: the result was certainly attractive, attractive and convincing. The performance of Justin Henry should be among the best 5 or 6 children's performances of all time. Best of all, again, was naturalness, there was no inflection, so often these days. <br /> <br /> This film reappeared on a small screen last night, although I had this in my video collection for many years: it's still worth watching and paying attention to everything. About 7Â½ out of 10.
