I initially saw this film when I worked as a musician in a musical theater in a summer warehouse. If you have ever worked in a theater — especially in a summer theater theater — you will really like this film. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are moments of really bad writing in the film, but in general This is a great tribute to the theater and why people love it.
