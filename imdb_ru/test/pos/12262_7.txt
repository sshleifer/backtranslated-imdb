"Broadcast News" directed by James L. Brooks ("Terms of Tenderness", "How Good"), and they have a great lineup, including William Hurt, Albert Brooks and Holly Hunter. Everyone performs well, but they are all too unpleasant to really care for them. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the film are really brilliant, such as the prologue and short scenes with Jack Nicholson. The main reason why it does not work is a film in which the characters are having fun, and not amusing things happening to them. <br /> <br /> You may consider it nothing more than a drama, but often too stupid to be successful there. However, the script is worth a look. Of course, not for everyone. <br /> <br /> 7.0 out of 10
