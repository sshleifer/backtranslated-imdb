It would seem that a film based on the life of the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima would be a difficult, if not impossible task. However, Paul Schrader really made the film “about” Mishima, who is both gorgeous and complex. Although this is not a literal biography, Schröder and his screenwriter Leonard Scharder (his brother) took several incidents from their lives, including his suicide and the one created, which can best be described as random tables, visually rare and amazing. Mishima’s homosexuality is almost absent, due to legal threats from his widow, but despite this, the film is still stunning, and one of the best films I saw in 1985. I should also mention the important contribution of Philip Glass, who made the bill, which adds additional texture to the film, and surpasses the one he made for Kundun Scorsese. Also noteworthy is John Bailey’s excellent clear and colorful cinematography and the magnificent designs and costumes of Eiko Ishioka, who continued to shoot memorable costumes for Dracula Coppola, for which she received an honored Oscar. I hope this movie will be available soon on DVD.
