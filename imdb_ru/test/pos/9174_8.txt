Hitch is a frivolous comedy that will delight you with great performances. Will Smith turns into a believable performance as a cloak-doctor and dagger, which must remain invisible in order to protect his clients and his profession. Smith was excellent, never joking too much. <br /> <br /> The best part of acting is an actor (I don’t know the name) playing this accountant who fell in love with this woman who is out of his league. This actor did a great job on character development, listening to Smith’s instructions, but in the end, it’s impossible not to be who he really is. <br /> <br /> And in the end, this is the main message of this film. Be the one you love, and you will be fine. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Will Smith meets this attractive lady, and Dr. Date tries his own medicine as he slowly falls in love with it. woman. I don't know her name, but she was pretty good too. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was an amazing, lightweight film that is definitely worth seeing.
