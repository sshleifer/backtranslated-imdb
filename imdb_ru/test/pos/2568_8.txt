I am amazed and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not understand the meaning of the Black Snake Moan. This is not about black / white relations or old / young relations, although I think that director Craig Brewer intentionally added both elements to change imaginary taboos. This is not about sexual abuse or sexual addiction, although Christina Ricci's character, Rey, is typical of them. This is not about folk religion in the black community, although religion plays a big role. This is not a love story, although in the end not one, but two happy couples. And this, of course, is not about the south, where "everything is hotter", although it is located in the south and is undoubtedly hot; holy smoke, even the authors of the keywords did not understand. <br /> <br /> “Black Serpent Moan” - the parable of the Mississippian delta blues; who feels them, who writes them, who plays them, what they play about, how it treats them. <br /> <br /> The film producers sat down with a clean slate and asked: “Well, if we were going to help people understand what the blues really is, what would it look like? “So they set it up in the rural south. Then they come up with two characters: one whose wife left him to live with her best friend, the other who goes to war, and his cruelly offended girl sleeps with everyone in the city. Then we add a humble, worldly being who was slightly touched by folk religion (they know that Jesus wants their lives, and although they respect Him, they know they cannot give Him that), some violence between men and women, and much, much more paired sexual images in Number - ready to go up? - A black man in a sleeveless T-shirt, holding a semi-naked white girl in captivity at the end of a 40-pound chain. , spank clips of blues Son House from both ends and Voila - you have a modern parable about what the blues is all about. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a small dilemma. Rey (Ricci) is destroyed by uncontrollable lust and is healed by the home religion of Lazarus (Jackson) and his perseverance (and do not forget about the chain). But then we are shown the restored Rey, cheerfully dancing to the end of the blues. Is this an expression of a restored, healthy life force or just the same crappy behavior that destroyed it in the first place? Brewer wants this in both directions, but the blues is actually about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I guess he would say that the blues gives a healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without releasing as well. I have doubts. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson is not playing for the first time so well that we forget that we are looking at Samuel L. Jackson; man is incredibly good. He even chooses some of his own tunes in the film, and his play is genuine, dirty and hot. Christina Ricci is also usually not so good. Of course, half of her work is performed by the Costume, which was not, and her tight figure, but it is a wonderful combination of cynical lust, rebellion and vulnerability; Bravo to her, she arrived. I was impressed by the preacher from the country, John Cotran, Jr. I had to check the database to make sure that he is a professional actor, and not the real minister of the country. <br /> <br /> Parents should know what they will get if their children bring it home. The language is quite far from the charts, the first half hour is full of graphic sex, and women are exposed to dozens of violations during the film (Lazar means good and decent, but, frankly, chains a woman to the radiator?) if you have teenagers, they will lick the screen halfway through the movie. I do not recommend this for children of any age. For adults only, please. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the “Black Snake Moan” is informative and accurate regarding blues, folk religion and sexual abuse and tells a story that is redemptive in many respects. It is unorthodox, but worth it. And, my God, the sound track is hot.
