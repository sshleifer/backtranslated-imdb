I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites are Unforgiven and Tombstone. Although I really liked this movie! That was great! The plot was well made, and it was a funny movie. Everyone who participated in this film did a great job! I even think that it somehow knocked out both films. Well, not really the Unforgiven, because it was an excellent film that these two can't compare to in the end. I really think it knocked out Tombstone. Both had their strengths. For example, they both had excellent well-known actors, very good subjects and very good shooting. But Posse, in my opinion, defeated Tombstone in four ways. First, the characters were more unique in Posse. The music was better in Posse. The idea was original in Posse, unlike Wyatt Earp. And the biggest difference is the sequence of actions! Oh my gosh Posse was a western with really good action sequences. I mean really good! The action was fast paced. Like modern daytime shooting. The action also had big budget blasts! Fistfights were pretty good too. Mario Van Pebbles was great in this movie! I suggest to buy this great movie!
