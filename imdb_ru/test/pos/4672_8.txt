The film is really good, it does not use violence or sex, etc., to sell itself like other films, but simply uses a really decent plot (based on the original by Michael Kane) and some great actors to make a funny, action-packed movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. One thing that made me enjoy this movie even more was that he had some actors that I really like, such as Edward Norton (whom I last saw at the 26th hour, which I also liked) , Jason Statham (transporter, who also enjoyed it) and Seth Green, whom I consider excellent, his role as roommate Sean Fanning, called "The Napster", is funny, and his hacking skills play a big role in the main robbery, which is focused around a big traffic jam in os Angeles. Car chases are really decent, and the high-tech equipment used by thieves is interesting and very impressive. I didn’t see the original, so I can’t compare it, but I really liked it, and I highly recommend this film to everyone, this is not the film in which you need a particular genre, it will suit everyone I felt good after this film, he had a really good ending, and on the whole it was really interesting to watch. I give it 8/10. Go watch it!
