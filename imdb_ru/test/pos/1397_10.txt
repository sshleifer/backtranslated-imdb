Euro Horror Movies - Portland Video Movie Madness has a whole section dedicated to this genre - they can't afford to miss the shabby “Sliz Martino” “L'isola degli uomini pesce” (called “Screamers” in the United States) . Here is a low value: some of the shipwreck survivors landed on an uncharted Caribbean island in 1891. The landowner, scientist (Joseph Cotten) and his daughter (Barbara Bach) live on the island. Of course, it turns out that a landowner forces a scientist to create a race of fishermen. And while the fishermen remain calm, as long as they can drink their potion, otherwise they become vile. <br /> <br /> This film is a mixture of genres: euro-horror, nonsense, voodoo, and perhaps a little “Dr. Moreau's Island”. But in most cases this is an excuse for violators to gut fish; you gotta love it! I would not be surprised if the Euro-horror genre gave Quentin Tarantino some of his ideas for "Grindhouse". After all, European horror directors have no doubt what they show. This is something that you will definitely like. <br /> <br /> So Joseph Kotten is the only cast from Alfred Hitchcock’s film (I mean “The Shadow of Doubt”) who later starred with his future wife and former Audrey Hepburn (under which I have Mela Ferrera) in the Italian horror film. What we see in life ...
