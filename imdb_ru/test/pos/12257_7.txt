Good drama / comedy, with two good performances by Hunter & Hurt, but Albert Brooks steals every scene he is in. With a great script, this film takes off and gives everyone a chance to show their acting talent. And although Joan Cusack is not in this much, but she has one, if not the funniest scene in the film. The highlight of the film for me was the speech of Albert Brooks about the devil. The only drawback is that in some places it goes a little slower. And I was completely interested in the role of Brooks, not Hunter or Hert. I give it 7 out of 10.
