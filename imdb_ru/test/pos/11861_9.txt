Well, maybe this film is not a revolution. But this is a very good entertainment, and this is the variation of Liv Tyler "Alice Silverstone" "Stupid" or "Cameron Diaz" "There is something about Mary." <br /> <br /> Liv plays a femme fatale who just wants to have her home and all kinds of material comfort in her. And she does everything to get this ... even a crime. Many crimes. And she throws every guy who doesn't work together to get these things. In addition, she does not really mind that there are several other lovers next to her current boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is even funnier if you know that Liv is actually zodiac cancer - and cancer is reported to be very domestic. So the character Liv played here is in fact a cancer parody! <br /> <br /> I was alone in the movie when I watched this movie. It was quite comfortable, because I could laugh as loudly as I wanted all the time - but it was also strange, as if no one really was interested in this film? <br /> <br /> I liked it very much. The game was between very good and excellent, especially the main actors, where brilliantly. Where there are enough jokes, a lot of black and good dialogues. <br /> <br /> This is a trash movie, and it is full of black humor. If you like these movies, try this one!
