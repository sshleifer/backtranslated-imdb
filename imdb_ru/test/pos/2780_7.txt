I foresee many students who are now signing up for an exchange of students for Barcelona, ​​and am disappointed when they lack such an exciting time. <br /> <br /> The film was enjoyable. Of course, it's always nice to see Audrey Tatu. <br /> <br /> However, I have a very serious problem with part of the film. The lesbian roommate tells Xavier that women like physical domination (with which I disagree), and shows him some exciting move that is guaranteed to get a woman. Then Xavier tries to grab the butt of a shy married friend - who starts saying “no, no,” “I'm married, I'm married,” but then somehow gives way to a fight for the ass ?? Suddenly she moans "yes, yes," and they go for it on the benches in the park Guell. I found it really very offensive. In addition, it is very stereotypical. How often have we seen scenes when a woman says no, but obviously this does not mean? No means no. Capturing cigarette butts / physical domination is not going to do it right. It simply fully supported the stereotypical rape myths. <br /> <br /> I wasn’t even sure how to read the next scene, where he gloats a lesbian about how it works and how next time he will simply demand “Suck it, whore” (or something kind of). Was he really thinking about forcing himself towards a woman without respecting her feelings, was this the way? <br /> <br /> This section really messed up my movie.
