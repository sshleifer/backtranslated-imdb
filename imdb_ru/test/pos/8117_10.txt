I saw this film at the Boston International Women's Film Festival last night, and was saddened to hear Ms. Trochet tell us (in her questions and answers after the show) that she does not expect to see too much American distribution, because of her perseverance about the inclusion of all the so-called "gay content." It was a fantastically entertaining comedy, and it just seems to me that American audiences will like it as much as “Full Monty”, so it is really regrettable and rather funny that a few shots of the two boys kissing keep it far from the main theaters. The wonderful cast, the awesome script and, of course, the direction of Rose Troche make this film one of the funniest I've ever seen.
