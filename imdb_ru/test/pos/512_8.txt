Wesley Snipes perfectly plays out as Blade, half man, half vampire, known as a day wanderer. He has all his strengths, and his only weakness is bloodlust. Since he teamed up with Whistler (Chris Christopherson), he tracked down vampires who have lived among us undetected for centuries, but the almighty lord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with people (Food, as he calls them) and he plans to wake up the god of blood and take control of the world. <br /> <br /> This film is well shot, written and directed; providing the viewer with an exciting journey from start to finish. Blade, filled with a magnificent sequence of battles and a pleasant dialogue, of course, more action than horror, but it definitely delivers. <br /> <br /> 8/10
