China Syndrome could not be released at a more appropriate time: twelve days after its release, the infamous error occurred on Three Mile Island. But even if this (and / or Chernobyl) never happened, this film remains an important look at what may happen due to improper management of nuclear facilities. Jack Lemmon performs a five-star performance as a leader trying to expose the cover-up at his nuclear power plant when Jane Fonda plays a reporter trying to investigate, and Michael Douglas plays her operator. <br /> <br /> I don’t know I don’t know if the current threat of the China Syndrome act is more alarming, but in any case, this is definitely a movie everyone should see. <br /> <br /> I hope that those who, for many years promoting nuclear power, watched this film just so that they could know that their views and ideals completely disappeared.
