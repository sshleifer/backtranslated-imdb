This is a gem. Like a movie, four films - the expected quality is really delivered. Filmed with a great style that reminded me of some of Errol Morris's films, well-organized and simply exciting. It is long, but terrible to such an extent that it is painful. We know that something bad happened (you can guess from the lack of human participation in the interview), but we have to see it, a bit like a car accident in slow motion. The story covers the most conceivable aspects and, unlike some documentaries, did not try not to show the dark sides of the stories, as well as to tell about the guilt of people left behind him, wondering why they did not stop him in time. It took me a few hours to get out of the melancholy that gripped me after watching this very well-made documentary.
