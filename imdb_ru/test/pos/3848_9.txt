Aristocats is really quite charming, and his rating is too low for IMDb. The songs are not as memorable as in the Book of the Jungle, but they were not at all bad. The animation is really beautiful, the best sequence is the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. I think this is the most relaxing Disney animation, and as another reviewer rightly said, who doesn't like cats? Another remarkable example was O'Malley, who looked into the eyes of the Duchess, because their romance was so believable, though not obvious. But it worked very well and the script was really funny, especially the fights between kittens. They remind me of me, my brother, and 3 sisters who are constantly fighting. My favorite scene was the pursuit of Edgar with two dogs, who always fought for who was the leader. The talents of the voice were admirable, especially Phil Harris, whom I learned from The Jungle Book, and Eva Gabor, from the Rescuers. Supporting characters, namely Scat Cat, were also well made. In conclusion, a really nice movie that is definitely undervalued. 8.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
