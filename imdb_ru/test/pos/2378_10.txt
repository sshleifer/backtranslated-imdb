Four unhappy women leave the dreary London to spend enchanted April in a castle on the coast of Italy. <br /> <br /> Roman Elizabeth von Arnim comes to life in this charming little film that perfectly demonstrates the merits of a literate script and ensemble. the acting. All elements are combined to create a film that, although almost forgotten now, still evokes a sense of appreciation for the appropriate resolution of the plot. <br /> <br /> Each of the actresses perfectly justifies itself. Ann Harding is a freedom-loving wife who dreams of "wisteria and tranquility" away from foggy London. Catherine Alexander plays the quiet housewife, wanting the elegant responsibility of being the mistress in the castle. Jane Baxter is a beautiful young noblewoman who temporarily escaped from a crowd of male fans. Jesse Ralph steals every scene she is in, like an old woman, wanting to be alone with her memories of the past. <br /> <br /> The men in this story are also well played. As the husband of Miss Harding, Frank Morgan plays a rather complex role as a researcher for a mouse person who experiences an alarming personality change when he becomes a successful writer. Reginald Owen, as the spouse of Miss Alexander, is surprisingly pompous as a person well prepared for giving birth in England (his cheerful attempt to take an English bath in an Italian bath was made even more fun with the help of Charles Judels and Raphael Ottiano when the servantâ€™s tortured castle). Finally, Ralph Forbes, one of the best forgotten actors of the decade, is happily eccentric as the carefree master of the ladies. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers will recognize the uncredited Ethel Griffis, who plays the owner of the Hampstead Housewives Club.
