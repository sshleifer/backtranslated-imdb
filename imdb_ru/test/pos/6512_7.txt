I do not understand why this film has such a low rating. It totally deserves more! Of course, this is completely ridiculous, but it should be so. Do not expect transcendental cinema from a film about beauty contestants on a Caribbean island! What you should expect is a huge deception of almost all relevant sci-fi, science fiction and blockbusters in cinematic history, and even links to other spoofers. Everything is completely exaggerated, and sometimes completely unnecessary, but this is what makes this film stand out. If you like parodies and you like, say, Leslie Nielsen or Mike Myers, you'll like it. I'm sure I did!
