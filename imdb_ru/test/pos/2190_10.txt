Visit the story of Sweeney Todd ... The strangest, most disgusting, but the most wonderful Broadway musical. It is frightening, fun and moves at the same time through Sondheimâ€™s most memorable and incredible scores and sharp speeches. George Hearn is incomparable in the lead role, bringing a strong voice and a dead (without puns) imitation of the legendary demon hairdresser, while Angela Lansbury provides comic relief as she merrily grinds his victims into meat pies. If you just allow yourself to enjoy it, Sweeney Todd is a real pleasure.
