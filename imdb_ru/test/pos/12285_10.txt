It is clear that the value of this film far exceeds the cost with which the format is implied (mini-dv). In fact, the director embraces the format and so skillfully introduces it into the storyline that I forgot the fact that I did not see the typical 35 mm film. He has a major attraction for indie films such as The Clerks and the works of Robert Rodriguez, combined with a fantastic new look at the genre of romantic comedy. "This is not a movie" - this is an honest movie with an honest image, and this is a great story. There is not a single point in this film where I felt that the scene could (or should) have been omitted. On the contrary, the director shoots amazing performances from truly gifted actors and does so in extremely constrained circumstances. From the page to the screen this film is a worthy and actual story that falls on many levels (creative, technical or otherwise). I highly recommend this for anyone who loves cinema or those who are looking for a little charm in a different, devoid of charm means.
