As a rule, I'm a comedic guy. I shot it in a video store under a comedy and thought: “Albert Brooks! Cool! ”And rented it. It looked like a romantic comedy, and I remembered that I hated them and had a full understanding of the hatred of this film. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Although this is a romantic comedy, amazing leading and supporting actors (Brooks, Hunter, Cusack and Nicholson) participate in it, and everything works well inside of them. The script sounds believable and not forced, as it can happen on a news station that you watch at night. It takes your emotions and makes you enjoy Hunter and Brooks and hate Hert, which makes the final a bit unpleasant and fruitless, but it shows that you don’t need a happy ending to finish the movie, you just need a truthful end that everyone got. Not everyone's life ends well, and this is evident from Broadcast News. People may not like the finale, because this is not your typical happy ending associated with romantic comedies ... but it works, it is real, and it is a genius. Broadcast News is a classic of its time and a beautiful romantic film with “Casablanca”. Well, maybe not so high, but this is the only other novel I can remember, which I like. <br /> <br /> Broadcast News: 9/10.
