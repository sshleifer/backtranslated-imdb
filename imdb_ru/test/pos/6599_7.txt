This is a pretty good documentary. I am not a skateboarder, I do not particularly like skateboarding or skateboarding culture. But somehow at about two o'clock this film interested me in this topic. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't call it the most intriguing film of all time, but for some reason, when these guys talked about how they started their skateboard clubs and skated in those empty pools of Southern California, it was interesting to me. <br /> <br /> I also have to add that the music in this film was also pretty good. I donâ€™t sit down to hear more 70s rock bands, but that seemed appropriate for what they were talking about.
