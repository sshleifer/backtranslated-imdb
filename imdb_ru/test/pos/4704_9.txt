This is really a documentary about the exciting character, her views on life and her extended family. The filmmakers spent three years recording his sister Helen at her house halfway, and she managed to collect so much wonderful material that you can't help but feel that you know Helen's sister and her "boys." There are 21 recovering drug addicts in the house, each of whom has a story almost as thrilling as sister Helen. The final scenes are especially exciting and emotional. <br /> <br /> The history of marriage, dependence and loss of his sister Helen reveals a very complex character, whose tough love is always funny, touching and charming. <br /> <br /> The film is striking because it tells its story in the form of an amazing piece of life episodes, which turn into a story that is almost as clear as if each scene were scripted and played by the best. The honesty (and obvious dishonesty) of “customers” is very appealing when you learn about their fears and watch them try to grow. <br /> <br /> You will never forget Sister Helen, Robert, Moe, or poor Ashish (spelling?).
