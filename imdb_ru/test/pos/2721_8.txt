After Mrs. and Mr. Ayer, this is another very good Aparna Sen movie (mostly in English). In an earlier film, she looked at the modern political environment and its influence on people. In this film, this is the influence of a mentally handicapped family member and his influence on the family. As a parallel subtheme, she considers the philosophical concept of "reality". This is a movie that makes you think after watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Mithi, the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, daughter of Aparna Sen), suffers from schizophrenia, which is dominated by the dominant older sister Anjali. (Shabana Azmi). Mithee after her marriage with Jojo and separation from him believes that she is still with JOJO and her five children at 15 Park Avenue in Kolkotta (there is no such address in Kolkotta - it seems there is one in New York), and she is intense in her faith. It is almost like intense religious faith. In the end, what is reality? In one scene, she says to Anjali: “If I tell you that you are not a professor, just imagine that you are a professor.” The open final reflects this reality. In the alleged search for her home on Mitya Park Avenue is lost. The penultimate scene is that Mitya looks at a group of five playing children, and she looks at them with the joy of returning to her family, and then she is lost. About this concept of reality, I recall another film of the fifties called “Harry” with James Stewart. The main character believes that a large rabbit (?) By the name of Harry is always with him, and he always talks to him. In the end, even the doctor thinks that maybe there is Harry. What is reality is what the protagonist believes, or what others believe, that Shabhna Azmi dominates in the film, with her great playing as a strong older sister with a low flow of frustration. Konkan Saint Sharma gives equally decent performance as a schizophrenic. <br /> <br /> Yet the film is not as dense as Mrs. and Mr. Ayer. There seem to be some loose ends. And perhaps there are too many characters. Those who want a closed final may not appreciate the open final here. But the finale comes to the theme of the film. <br /> <br /> Another good movie Aparana sen.
