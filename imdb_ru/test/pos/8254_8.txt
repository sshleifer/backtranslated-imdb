I provided location services for this film every Sunday when we shot in Berkeley Square in London. David Niven, a gentleman, fully enjoyed this role, unfortunately, to be the last. we had a moment of panic when the cargo of a chest with a fake Krugerrand (cast for the film ...) descended into a storm sewer. <br /> <br /> Imagine a mad team opening all the drains to recover every last one. If you know and love London, you will like this comedic joke - also begins Richard Jordan, who, unfortunately, died from a brain tumor. Good movie, great team, great cast. look for the current stars of the coronation street, and then play the mass scenes or additional events. Ivanâ€™s car dealership and retailers were shot in West London, Chizwick, the entire shopping parade and the American used car were dressed overnight, the car is still there, as are the shops. The restaurant suddenly turned into a funeral home. If you see a movie in the lists, try to see it! By the way, secretary Sally Harrison was married to designer Tony Curtis. <br /> <br /> April 2007 I thought I would add a few additional comments about the places: <br /> <br /> Pub: Next to Berkeley Square. The cottage Elke Sommers: on the back road, next to the Twickenham film studio. Ivans used car section: along Chiswick High Street and all shops near the roundabout. Workshops (re-equipment of armored vans) Plant at a roundabout opposite the prison of the Fullers brewery (see Workshops above). Telephone box, see Cottage Elke Sommers (it was a wooden studio box used in many films, look for a ground level lighting cable and wooden hinges on the Door !!! Honeywells computer room near the Olympic cemetery - Chizvik - Tomb near the border on common land Bank areas, emptiness and strength: Twickenham Studios <br /> <br /> And just add David Niven, sometime gentleman, joked and mixed with the team, extras and so on ... Niven dined at the Connaught hotel, but joined team for coffee!
