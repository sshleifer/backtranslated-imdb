The theme of the film is sharp and very real. It happened. You can discuss some of the artistic freedom, taken by the director and screenwriter. The subject matter is what makes a movie ticked - nothing more. I saw the film for the first time after the real Phulan was shot dead in New Delhi and served as an elected member of parliament in India for several years. By the way, she was not the first untouchable elected to parliament, according to some reviewers. The so-called "untouchables" were elected to the Indian parliament for decades in reserved constituencies. <br /> <br /> Although Shehar Kapoor, as a director, is a hero for many of India, because he shot commercially acceptable international films - “The Queen of the Bandits” and “Elizabeth” (and a tolerable children's film called “Mr. India”, which was adopted by the average Indian audience) - and even received an Oscar nomination for Elizabeth, I do not put him on the highest level film director from India. He fails in every department as a director, except perhaps for the fact that he manages to get some above-average from his actors. Subtlety, refinement, charm is not easy to find in his films - melodramas fill them. <br /> <br /> His idea to use Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s vocal reproduction in the early parts of the film was perhaps his only major achievement on the invisible Bandit Queen soundtrack. And then, perhaps, the creaking of doors during a gang rape. The rest of the film looked like a spaghetti western with sex and violence, with the exception of the great music that is associated with them. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good live Indian filmmaker who makes realistic cinema of international quality - you should not watch Shekhar Kapoor films; these are the later works of three Indian cinematographers Ador Gopalakrishnan, Mrinal Sen and Girish Karnad and, of course, “Umrao Jean” Muzaffar Ali. Unfortunately, none of these directors had the financial support that Kapoor had to provide them and their films with an international audience. For example, Sen’s Oka oorie katha, made in Telugu, or Sadgati by Satyajit Ray, based on Munshi Prem Chand’s Kafan, are more complete than films for an intellectual viewer telling about the state of untouchables in India. Sen should not have resorted to graphic sex and violence, but simply offered them. Of course, Sen's nugget did not make headlines, while Kapoor’s efforts pinned them. <br /> <br /> To the honor of Kapoor, he is artistic and used his limited talent and modest resources in the Mumbai film industry to bring his products out of the house. audience. For this effort, I applaud Kapoor. But "The Gangster Queen" will remain an excellent subject, waiting for an experienced director to deal with it.
