"The Couch Trip" by Michael Richie is a surprisingly anarchic comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist. It is so subtle and vicious that you begin to understand what a burning satire it is. This is also the best film by Dana Akraroyd, made in a particularly good year for him (1988). First, the "Great Street Tourism", and now this. <br /> <br /> The stars of Akoyroyd are John Burns, a professional con man who pretends to be insane to escape from prison. Now the silly comedy will be just about that. But "The Couch Trip" uses this as a springboard for everything else. Beverly Hills psychiatrist George Maitlin (Charles Grodin, slightly funny here) suffered a nervous breakdown, and a replacement was chosen: Lawrence Baird, who turned out to be a psychiatrist of Akroyd! You can pretty much guess what happens, but the great thing about The Couch Trip is not what happens, but how it is done. <br /> <br /> “The Couch Trip” gives Dana Akroyd the best role he ever had. His John Burns is one of the truly original comic works in film history. Unholy liners and physical humor are part of it, but what makes it special is that Aroyroyd makes Burns an attractive character. We cheer for him and love him very much for 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> But Aroyd is not alone here. He gets strong support from other great comic actors. Walter Mattau joins in the fun as a minister cheater who learns Burns’s secret and makes noble blackmail. Charles Grodin "slowly burns" his way to the other great comic role of the burned psychiatrist. Grodin was one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. It is criminal, they did not use it more often. Richard Romanus perfects the lawyer Grodin on slimball to perfection. <br /> <br /> “The Couch Trip” is one of many films shot by the now defunct Orion Pictures Corporation, which are currently not visible. MGM has spent a fortune buying the Orion library, but has not earned it yet. “The Couch Trip” combines “Dressed to kill,” “Blow Out,” and countless others in collecting dust that rot in the store. Shame on MGM for their inaction. We hope that with the new leadership "The Couch Trip" will find an audience and respect it. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
