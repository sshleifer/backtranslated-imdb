It is now clear that the true golden age of American cinema was from the mid-60s until the release of Star Wars. Before that, there was too much Hes limited by the Code. In Star Wars, the green light was lit for most films aimed at children and morons, and this practice continues to this day. In Seventeen, to tell the truth, there are a couple of battered dialogues: “We can do it in a simple way, or we can make it the hard way” - this is one thing, but I’m damned if I can find something else wrong with that. (In fact, this line may not even have been outdated when this film was shot.) SEVEN-UPS shows everything that was right with the best films of the golden age: poor dialogue, realistic game, real places (winter in the mud) New York never looked better / worse), propulsive stories and, yes, the best car chase ever shot. Bill Hickman is the driver that Scheider is chasing (you recognize him by Bullitt), and the chase structure is quite similar to that of McQueen, but I prefer the Shader's face intensity, cardiac pacing, stunning close-ups of schoolchildren and a crushing conclusion. (This VW mistake, accelerating to 2 miles per hour, always bothers me in the pursuit of Bullitt.) Don Ellis’s sharp, sharp score sets the perfect mood. Seven UPS: joyless, gloomy, action-oriented, adults. This is a film that could not be made today; There is no trick for the kids or a ridiculous ending. Thank you, Philip D'Antoni, Roy Shader and Tony Lo Bianco: as long as they watch police films, SEVEN-UPS and his brothers from the 1970s (for example, FRENCH CONNECTION) will set the standards.
