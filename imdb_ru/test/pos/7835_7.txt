Let's face it, this is 7 out of 10, not on a normal scale, but from the poor scale of a movie. This is the film that you specifically made when you intentionally walk, knowing that this is a terrible fake that everyone else avoids. <br /> <br /> I came up with one promise from the film that there would be snakes on the train, and that would deliver! <br /> <br /> The blood itself is really good, and the characters play stunning roles. Come on, everything is there: from locomotive-stricken locomotives to teenage girls selling drugs, even an electrical engineer who puts on his pimp! You can see naked breasts, explosions, snakes, blood and the main Mexican running around, healing his girlfriend, hitting his pipe and blowing smoke in her face !! As I have already mentioned, like many others, the distribution of films is not entirely successful, but, nevertheless, respectable. <br /> <br /> Similar films preserve our group tradition to unite, and all together play a bucks or two to watch such masterpieces. There can be no better time spent together to enjoy a good bad movie. <br /> <br /> He could have learned one or another of such good films as Alien Lock-down or Boa vs Python, but these are big shoes that need to be filled. <br /> <br /> Solid 7 out of 10.
