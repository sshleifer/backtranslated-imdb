One cast tells you that it will be one step higher than a typical Italian western. Veteran actors Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy team up with Alex Cord, who at the time seemed on the verge of fame. The result was an extraordinary and depressing film, which, nevertheless, will satisfy those who are looking for in the Western world more than just a shootout. Particularly interesting here is the character played by Alex Kord. It can be expected that the “hero” in these westerns will be silent and introspective, but “Clay McCord” is an extreme example, and, oddly enough, he often shines in a passive, even weak position. Much has been done because he is afraid of falling victim to epilepsy attacks that have immobilized his father, and in these moments of helplessness he is either at the mercy of those who wish to harm him or those who want to help him. To underline his passivity, Clay McCord - don't you like that name? - often shines stripped to the waist, as if he were just an attractive toy, exhibited at the show. There is even a strong masochistic stripe in his character, most obvious when it is used by enemies as a punching bag, and then hung on the wrists and left hanging over the middle of the street. He not only often cannot protect himself, but McCord is equally ineffective in protecting others. Almost everyone who helps him is killed. <br /> <br /> Although “a minute for prayer, a second for death” is far from complete success, it has a depth and tone that set it apart and make it linger in memory. It is also a good showcase for Alex Korda, whose career tended to decline after this point after several promising years in the mid-1960s. He must have been about 36 years old when he was shooting this - in his physical bloom - and the scene of his hanging down on his wrists, bare-chested and sweaty, is a memorable fragment of the cinematographic “Beefsteak”.
