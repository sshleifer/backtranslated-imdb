I saw this film in his short film at the Art House cinema in 69 year. I was so funny that I literally spent part of the film on the floor, laughing so hard that I fell off my seat. Looking back years later, I thought Melvin Van Peebles did it. When I mentioned this to my friend, he said that his friend, Downey Sr., played almost all the non-actor roles in the film: director, screenwriter, producer, etc. He, of course, was right, but my memory was wrong except that it was one of the funniest movies ever made. The “Arab” part was especially priceless.
