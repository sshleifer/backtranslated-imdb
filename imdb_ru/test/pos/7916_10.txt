Alexander Nevsky is considered to be a cinematic masterpiece. However, he is very old. People decide not to mention it and talk about great battles and great music. The sound effects could then be good, but, apart from the premonitory organ, all sounds can be legible. Maybe film fans will shoot me, but I'm sure that the modern viewer of Alexander Nevsky will agree that blatant propaganda and terrible music distract from the film. I gave this movie 10/10, because it is undoubtedly a masterpiece. It does have its big bits however. The costumes of the Teutonic Knights are excellent, and the battle scenes are pretty good for the time. This, however, is a masterpiece showing its age.
