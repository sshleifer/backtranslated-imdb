Perhaps this is somehow related to the fact that I saw this film in the midst of my life, when I really tried to understand where I was going and what I needed to make myself happy, but this film really spoke to me. Jane is an ordinary woman: although she has so much positive, she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life. She is strong and intelligent, but she was deceived due to an accident and has revealed her potential and is living a life of second choice. She is looking for new challenges and happiness, desperately trying to fill a hole in her heart. Dreyya Weber - exquisite Jane. Traveling with her, we feel the depth of her despair, the torture of her despair and, ultimately, the strength of her conviction. Beautiful Addi Yungmy is also very good at film and is an asset to the production. Allison Maki is a scene hijacker, like a cheeky character with an immaculate time. I highly recommend this film; Although it is low budget, it has a large budget for writing and production. PS - great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women. Women will love history and characters, but there is something for men here. :)
