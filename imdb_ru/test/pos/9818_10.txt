Ettore Skola's masterpiece of this epic of the heart deserves a much wider audience. This is a worthy successor to the classics of rizorgimento, such as Vensonti Senso and Il Gattopardo, as well as Roselini Vanina, Vanini. The 19th century is a truly fruitful source for Italian filmmakers. Period settings and attributes are beautifully implemented here, but the story is eternal and can happen in any period. What is intriguing in this story is that the hero is trapped in a claustrophobia, in which he turns out to be an energetically pursued object of desire, and he is completely powerless to get out of alarming circumstances. Beautiful and calm Giorgio (Girudo) is upset by his inability to visit his charming but frivolous married mistress (Antonelli) and falls victim to the dangerous passion of the in love Fosca (D'Obichi), the ugly and painful daughter of his stern commander (Girotti). The resulting flour and the subsequent tragedy that this unlikely couple is exposed to make them understandable, pitiful and extremely sympathetic to the audience. The star performance of Bernard Girado captivates and will leave an indelible impression. Do not miss.
