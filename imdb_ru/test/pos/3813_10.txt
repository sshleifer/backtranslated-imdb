Obviously, previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this is done quite well. <br /> <br /> This is cool cute, clever and dark. This story brings back memories of the types of girls I was in love with when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> Besides, I want to watch some other Nadi films, a lot of comments on YouTube about how hot it is. in this video. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is some influence of Burton, but I would not say that this Brad is trying to wreck him. <br /> <br /> He just jumps and adds his talents to a genre that I can appreciate. I like what he does, and he does it well, said Nuff!
