A child actor certainly deserves a lot of respect. It was a rather weak field for the Best Picture this year. I think Apocalypse Now should have taken it, but the Academy probably felt that it was too cruel and strange, plus Vietnam was still too fresh. I usually donâ€™t compliment the directors, but I really liked it a bit with the elevator doors. Rating: B
