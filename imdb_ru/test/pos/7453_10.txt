Graphics: brilliant, obviously. The most awesome things were definitely NOT given away in trailers. The battle sequences move very quickly, but after watching a few of them, your eyes should get used to it, and it will not seem so confusing. The cloud has a wide range of swords, and I would like everything to move a little slower so that we can see them, because each of them was incredibly detailed. Oh, and we'll finally see exactly how you can equip Matter ... <br /> <br /> Music: great too. I was a little nervous because (of what I saw), Nobuo is not the best at writing music to go along with the action (remember the Steal the Tiny Bronco sequence?), But it’s gorgeous and perfect. I'm glad I pre-ordered OST. They changed the lyrics to One Winged Angel, so you can't sing along if you know the lyrics of Carmina Burana. <br /> <br /> Story: the first half of the film is about things and introduces everyone. in a rather complicated tapestry, but the second half consists almost entirely of sequences of battles, when all the players are in place. I would not call this a weak plot, but it is far from being so confused as the plot of the game. I think that this is an attempt to avoid an eclipse of the game, and I think that this is good ... the film is in itself, and should not try to outperform the original in terms of pure plot. <Br /> <br /> I confess that I was hoping that this film would bring FF7 to a wider circle of people, but this is NOT a mainstream film. I was going to give him only nine stars, simply because he didn’t even try to explain something to newcomers ... Marlene (at least I think it was Marlene ... sounds the same as she) gives a bit of background at the beginning, but it is more refreshing than an accelerated course. But then I realized that for me this film is 10/10, so why should I take my glasses off just because other people won't like it either ... if you played the game or at least fleetingly know it, you should see this movie. But you don't need me to tell you that. If you are not familiar with him, go out and buy him, sit there for twenty hours and beat him, and then watch the movie ... although even without any background, he is still amazingly beautiful. You simply do not get any internal links ... which make up 50% of the film (that is, everything that is NOT a battle sequence).
