This is a short film "Laurel and Hardy" with some wonderful and funny moments, but in general the film is too much based on only one comic premise. <br /> <br /> The funny premise on which this film basically rests is very simple; Stan Laurel without pants. Laurel plays a Scottish naive young man who arrives in America to the fullest. For some reason, he is in the spotlight because of this, and his uncle, played by Oliver Hardy, thinks because of this, that it is time to put some trousers on Philip. <br /> <br /> His humor is well executed, but the main premise also becomes a bit tedious after a while. Although the film definitely still has its comic great moments, it is also at the same time far from the best of the many comedian Laurel & Hardy shorts that still exist. The film is simply too simple to be considered one of the greatest, although it is definitely the most well executed of all, for the most part. <br /> <br /> Very good, pure fun, just nothing special or memorable. <Br /> <br /> 7/10
