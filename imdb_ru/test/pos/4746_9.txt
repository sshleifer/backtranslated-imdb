Roy Shader is not Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood, but who then? “Seven” is one of the best police films, even today, and is second only to McQueen’s TV series “Bullitt” and “Dirty Harry”, which is a good company. There are three things that seem to make a good movie about a policeman: a believable script with a great acting game, great car chase scenes, and some heavy action movies. This film has all three, and the car chase scene is better than in Dirty Harry. The shader plays the head of a group of cops to sentence the bad guys in New York to seven years or more; hence the name of the seven. In general, not quite until “Dirty Harry” or “Bullitt”, but much better than all the police films made after “Dirty Harry”. 9/10.
