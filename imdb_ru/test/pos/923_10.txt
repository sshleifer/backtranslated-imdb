Well, every scene is so beautifully presented. Never before have I seen such a film that matters in almost every scene. <br /> <br /> Well, when I watched this movie, I remembered watching Amilya. Amily is also like a movie with lots of fun and fantasy. These films are based on a single storyline. But both are perfectly flawless and able to create their own world. <br /> <br /> Red can make people think about destiny and deja vu. And I still think about it. <br /> <br /> The story is wonderful, and the ending is a little funny. I was laughing at the end of the scene. It's funny how these three films “Red, White and Blue” are related. <br /> <br /> In general, a great work of art. Work wizard. <br /> <br /> 10/10
