When the movie started, I thought it was stupid. The first ten minutes were really boring. After a slow start and some tricks of the soap opera, I liked that. The plot was different from everything I've ever seen. Now it was horror? Not really. This should not have been categorized as horror, otherwise producers would have to put more money into the film to make it scary. As it was, creatures where only there for a short time. I can only assume that it was because of the money. <br /> <br /> The good thing was that the film was very interesting. This caused my interest (after the start) and made me think about creatures from another dimension. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that this was the first film for the director, but there were some bright moments. By the end I got hooked. It is a pity that Hollywood has not invested more money in it.
