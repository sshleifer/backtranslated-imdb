Three children of ten, born at the same time during a solar eclipse, begin to slyly kill everyone who offends them. <br /> <br /> While the films about killer children were not entirely new during this twisted 80s killer, the theme of kids as killers works great for this film. Bloody Birthday really delivers a bit of cold and anxiety, and at the same time he manages to become a competent killer thriller with some strange qualities. It fluctuates the fine line between the gentle and the creepy, but it remains interesting throughout with an interesting plot. There are several strong scenes of murder, as well as a little nudity, to establish this as a complete temptation of guilt. <br /> <br /> The cast does a pretty good job. Young stars Elizabeth Hoy and KS Martel put on several threatening performances, while rising star Julie Brown makes a striptease in front of an unforgettable murder scene. Veteran star Susan Strasberg plays the role of a teacher, and Jos√© Ferrer looks like a cameo. <br /> <br /> Around this original slasher is not bad, although admittedly it is not perfect, but worth seeing. for fans of the genre. <br /> <br /> *** outside ****
