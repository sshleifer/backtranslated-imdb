When I first saw this film, I wanted to love it for many reasons, but I just did not. It seemed a bit boring. But I had a tiny question about what I saw at the beginning of the film, so I watched it again ?? and then finally it clicked for me. At first I watched the movie, knowing the “unexpected ending”, and although I definitely would not recommend spoiling the ending for you, I still fully enjoyed most of the movie and found many seemingly minor events that everyone unravels to tell ominous scheme. <br /> <br /> I don’t think everyone will like this film or even enjoy it. If you like any of the actors, you will like this movie, because the acting is quite strong, and they all get a lot of screen time. If you like riddles (namely Hitchcock), you will love this movie. If you like independent or psychological films, you will love this movie. It really worked for me at all these levels. If you do not like actors, mysterious scenes or psychological elements, you may not like this movie. But this is your loss. Personally, I was just a little annoyed by the accents. Nice try, Alan Rickman, in the American dialect, but that didn’t improve the scene in Die Hard. (An amazing voice compensates for a strange accent.) The mixed accent in the film was a little strange, but it was not so distracting that it became difficult or especially annoying. Also, changing the camera from scene to scene was obvious and could disturb some people, but I actually think it added to the scenes (or the scene — I can really only remember one scene where the change was much different, but it worked ). <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, watch it at least twice. The second time you see this, I hope you understand how complex the plot really is. Every time I watch this movie (it's less than an hour and a half, so multiple views are not complicated), I seem to notice something else in it and ask myself: “Why did it just happen?” Or “Was it intentional? " I like movies that make me think. This one does. So just look. Twice.
