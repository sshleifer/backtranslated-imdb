Two college buddies - one boring nerd, the other - rude and sloppy - go on a journey around the country. On the way, they encounter a vicious vehicle similar to an army tank combined with a monster truck who is trying to knock down their car. They avoid him, but only drive a mysterious and dangerous driver, when one of them finds a leak in the upper hatch at the bus stop for a rest. Later they pick up a sexy hitchhiker who ultimately gets involved in their life-threatening situation. “MONSTER MAN” is an extremely exciting horror comedy that has both pleasant and pleasant moments. The two main characters and their constant altercations are fun to watch for everyone on their own, and the end takes a TCM-like turn, which was very well done. Absolutely worth checking out.
