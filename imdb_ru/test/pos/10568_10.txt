The chemistry between Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy was incredible. They were completely convincing and truly enjoyable in their roles. Imelda Staunton brilliantly played Mrs. Saxby. Although she was a vile opportunist, she somehow managed to make you sympathize with her. Rupert Evans played a gentleman with a slimy ball with pure charm and dexterity. He was stealing the scene. The story itself was very unique, as was the way it was told. Victorian England with two leading lesbians was intriguing and delightful. There were some fantastic and unexpected turns that really helped the viewers dive into the story. An excellent cast and excellent story made this film excellent.
