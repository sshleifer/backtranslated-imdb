What a wonderful film, made even more by the fact that my wife and I stumbled upon it so casually, watching a TV channel one fine frosty day in North Texas. Kathy Bates, at her best, heads up the cast with very normal and human characters in one of the most wonderful good mood films we have ever seen. Why this film was not given the attention it deserved in 2002 is difficult to understand. Why it was head and shoulders above so many boring pieces of garbage, released with more pomp and attention, is clearly visible in the preview. It is obvious that we, as a general public, are forcefully fed with what was considered powerful and influential as “great and beautiful,” while true pearls, such as Unconditional Love, can shine through all these contenders in a really nice movie. Rent or buy this movie ..... you will not regret it!
