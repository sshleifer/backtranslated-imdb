My friend gives me these 3 huge boxes. “These are laser discs from the Flash Gordon series,” he says. “I will have giant coasters,” I say. But not so. This is serial rock. (But I had to whine and moan almost everyone I knew to find a laser disc player for them). <br /> <br /> There are really few things in this series: there are people-lions, people-hawks, people-sharks, humans, and I suppose you would call them Mongo-men. Sets and costumes combine Greek, Roman, Oriental, Egyptian, and even armor, like English knights. Stunning costumes. And partly it was a riot. Those terrible tights in shorts over them that Zarkov wore are beyond description. And the guys on stage in the oven seem to be wearing boxers. <br /> <br /> It's funny that they renamed the octopus the octopus, the orangutan the orangapoid and the tiger the tiger. There is even a dragon (Godzilla-like creature that threatens Flash a couple of times before being killed). <br /> <br /> Do you like Invisible Man? Did it cover you? Do you like sword fights, wrestling (both animals and men), fist fights? A lot for every taste. We have an underwater city, a heavenly city, a city on top of a mountain, and many secret passages and caves. <br /> <br /> Hockey effect? Huge amounts. The heavenly city is supported by radium furnaces, which are sunk like ancient steamboats. Rocket ships are “driven” by fireworks and have constant backstrokes and / or buzz. You can see a lot of wires holding things (for example, food, when Flash was invisible and, of course, rockets). There are clouds in space, but there is not one around the Earth as viewed from Mongo. "Giant" lizards appear for long. Fighting sea creatures allegedly threatened by Flash & co. on the way to the shark-male underwater city. "Gadgets" in the laboratory of Dr. Zarkov infuriated me. And they seem to be the same no matter what laboratory he works in (he worked in Ming and Vultan's lab). <br /> <br /> Yes, we have a romance. Everybody wants Dale; Min, Vultan, Flash. But at least one person wanted Princess Aura (Prince Baron), not the one she would have preferred. In fact, it seems that many of the plots are about intrigue on the part of Princess Aura to try to win Flash. <br /> <br /> Man, I think the characters are awesome. This fat horse laughing King Vultan was cheerful. The way he ruled these wings was pure artistry. And min! What can I say about Min? He was perfect. They were supposed to have it for the emperor in Star Wars. Ming should be my favorite character in this series. Princess Aura was also a pretty little character. And she made it beautiful. I think she's a better actress than Dale Arden by and large. Even the dastardly high priest played a special role. Zarkov was a good, but not the most powerful character - and he always stood in the background during the fighting scenes with Dale. We now turn to Flash: Flash, of course, was a strong point, a leader, a hero — and he did it well. Crabbe is a good actor, and this role is perfect for him. <br /> <br /> After watching, I think I know where George Lucas got the basic idea for Starwars. Look, you will understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> If you ever thought about watching an old series (or any other series for that matter), this should be your first choice. The only reason I didn’t give it 10 was a few holes in the history that could be easily corrected, the way in which the giant lizards seemed to be just there, and a couple of weak characters (the king of male sharks and the king of lions).
