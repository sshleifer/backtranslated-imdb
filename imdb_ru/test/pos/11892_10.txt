We just finished showing El Padrino in Australia. The phenomenal part of the film. We look forward to seeing many more films from Mr. Chap in the future. It was great to see such a well-composed film with such tension and history that should remain an instant classic. Watching a film with excellent quality really underlines Chapa’s serious potential and his talented skill as a writer, actor, director and director. Chapa struck many with his triumphant performance in the film “blood in blood,” and now he has proved to everyone who saw his work his potential to become a recognized critic and director with genuine artistic control. With his lead role as Kilo Vazquez, being the perfect combination between Milo Velk from Blood in the Blood and Al Pacino from Scarface, the film will work wonders for us here in Australia.
