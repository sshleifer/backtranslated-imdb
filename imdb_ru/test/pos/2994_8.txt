The first love. Teenage love. We all experienced it, even if it was not as sweet as that of the main characters. “Friends” can be considered an adaptation of the classic “Blue Lagoon”, born in 1949, and its remakes since 1980 (most popular with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with young Milla Jovovich). While “Blue Lagoon” sends two young lovers to an uninhabited island, without regard to civilization, “Friends” go the opposite way, and this will probably sound much more plausible and be a more complex film with a modern audience. Paul and Michel, who for various reasons turned away from the family and the adult world to live together in a small cottage in the south of France. Having each other and innocence in childhood, their friendship gradually turns into something more when they struggle to sustain themselves in this sweet story of coming of age. This film is still controversial to this day, as the actors are teenagers, and they definitely watch the age specified in the film (15 and 14 1/2). The film contains a hint of child abuse, nudity, images of teen sex and teen pregnancy. But the real contradiction is not the subject matter, but the fact that the love of Paul and Michel is presented as a natural and healthy relationship. While this worked perfectly for lovers at other times and on a desert island, their presence in the modern environment poses some very complex moral problems. Laws prohibiting sexual relations between minors by mutual consent are in effect in almost all countries, and the lack of sex education in adolescents is considered as one of the reasons for the increase in unwanted teenage pregnancy and abortion. There is a film like this only child pornography or a slap in the face to make us face our own hypocrisy, about modern society, not pleasing teen parents and laws that clearly go against human nature and hormonal development, but which are necessary to prevent child abuse. ? Is hormonal development parallel to emotional growth? These are not easy questions, and most of us will be uncomfortable with them. As an art piece, this film is truly a forgotten and coarse pearl. The scenario progresses with utmost simplicity, although with some degree of sympathy, but never makes any blows to announce its message, although by today's standards it is somewhat slow. The photo is beautiful and it has scenes of beautiful beauty. The actions of the two main characters range from truly awful in some scenes to surprisingly innocent and trustworthy in others. Pop music, unlike most of the productions in our time, is used with taste, and sometimes the lyrics speak the thoughts of the main characters. In general, this is a delightful thing, even if moral values ​​do not match your own.
