This film is on my list of the top 20 comedies. This is a truly unique film. For a reviewer who said, “I must have missed something,” you are right. You are missing something. If you do not have that sense of humor that this film requires, this is one. But don't give it a bad review, because you think it's “crazy”, but not meant for that. Loony is a good description of who he intends to be and what he is doing well. I laughed at this movie much more often and much more intensely than in most other funny movies. <br /> <br /> Michael Almereida uncovered the best in his line-up in this first big film for which he was nominated for the Independent Spirit award for best first role. Crispin Glover, as usual, is absolutely brilliant in some completely inexplicable way, and some of his funniest lines have ever been told in this film. Glover is undoubtedly the best comic actor working now. Harry Dean Stanton puts on a great comic show. William Burroughs is incredible in a small role. Dylan McDermott was perfectly played, and Lois Chiles is absolutely gorgeous. <br /> <br /> All of the above is completely amusing in its own way, but this is one of Crispin’s best performances — where he performed at River Edge and Willard. If you're a Crispin Glover fan, but somehow you missed this movie, you need to stop everything you are doing and see it right away. <br /> <br /> But first, do not forget to relax, and maybe a beer or something. This is a great movie, but it is very unusual, and I recommend recommending it to him or invent a suitable stupid mood before watching it.
