Amazing, Striking, Brilliant, Excellent. These are the four adjectives that are supported in my head when I begin to describe the "Running Kite". Adaptation of the book by Khaled Hosseini has already captured many minds, in fact there are rumors that he himself burst into tears after watching the premiere. Before I begin, I have to say that I read the book before I saw the expanded run of the "Running Serpent." So my opinion and views may be slightly biased. <br /> <br /> First, let me say that although, in my opinion, the book was better than the final product of the film, it is by no means a bad adaptation. I mean a two-hour film that received a well-deserved response. In the last twenty-odd minutes, everything seems a little fast, but, in addition, it has succeeded in what the book has done. He captures the minds and imagination of millions of people around the world. The magic woven by Khaled Hosseini to give us a sense of repentance of joy, sadness, pain, loyalty, is shrewd in this adaptation. Especially in the very first scene, when young Hassan says: “If you tell me there is dirt, I will go. But I know that you do not ask me about it. " Such a touching line must win the hearts of many. Two young actors were great, absolutely great. Especially the boy who played the innocent, but loyal Hassan, the boy who refuses to throw the kite he caught because he promised his best friend that he would bring it to him only to be insulted by big hooligans who beat him and used him sexually and then being condemned by his best friend like a coward. The whole act is so touching that it can't help getting wet. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is well located, except for the last moment. The point is when Amir learns about his true relationship with Hassan and reads Hassan first and last, not him when he started crying in tears, feeling helpless, lonely and repentant, which seemed a bit in a hurry and feeling that Amir was behind the facade. In the book, Khaled Hosseini devoted about 10–12 pages to describe Amir’s state of mind in this position. But it made up for him in the penultimate segment of the film, when Amir stands up for the boy Hassan, his nephew Sohrab before his commander in-law. The final was well-deserved, and I am sure that it will be appreciated. I felt the torch being passed down from generation to generation. <br /> <br /> Turning to the technical aspects. First of all, acting. Just one word is excellent. From beginning to end, young Hassan and Amir, their father, his friend Rahim Khan. Everyone was great, especially young Hassan. Secondly, the direction was awesome, combined with brilliant camera work. The background score was also impressive. From the very beginning to the end of the loan, and I especially liked the one when Amir in the Pakistani mosque in the Western and Islamic confluence made it special. <br /> <br /> In general, this is certainly one of the best films, and this is a long-awaited break in all those Iran-inspired films that we showed this year. 9/10 !!!
