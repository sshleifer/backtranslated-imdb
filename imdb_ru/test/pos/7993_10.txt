I have enjoyed this film since I was a kid, and I still do. I also loved Batman forever then, but the real difference is that this film is not dated when I grew up. I noticed several scenes in this film that made no sense: “Hmm ... the crowd is angry. Hello! Where did they get these tomatoes from? Then I thought: “who cares? In any case, this film is not 100% serious! <br /> <br /> The original Tim Burton Batman was great too, but in some places he was a little funny and I didn’t like all the actors. This film has improved almost all aspects with a wonderful cast, more gothic style and without the participation of the prince. <br /> <br /> Currently, many fans of Christopher Nolan’s films don’t like that Burton claims that Nolan’s films are more serious and therefore more loyal to comics. I do not think this is completely true: - There has never been an adaptation of the original concept of Batman, who was a vengeful killer with a weapon. -Batman took on different forms over the years, looking at his own stupidity in the 60s (and a bit with Batman and Robin). The director is free to choose which Batman he will portray if he is good. <br /> <br /> My opinion: Batman doesn’t have to be serious. This is a man in a rubber suit with pointed ears. Burton managed to create the perfect balance between stupidity and darkness surrounding the whole idea. <br /> <br /> I just recently watched Nolan movies, and I love them too (especially The Dark Knight). There is something in this movie that interests me more. Nolan’s goal was to give the character much more depth, while he looked for explanations in almost all aspects of Batman. This is too much for me, I'm a big fan of a more abstract version of Batman. Burton movies are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I’ve come to the conclusion that you shouldn’t compare Nolan to Burton films. They are just different, and you decide which one you like best. I respect both directors.
