My wife and I watched this movie once in 1989 and enjoyed it so much. We wanted to see him again. It was so touching that I called it a "tear man." The mystery about which Billings was sent a report is actually not at all a mystery. Corners !! It seems that when He turned around, something happened to him, everything was fine, and I think it was a little scarecrow for George, considering that he did not understand what He was in. It simply suggests that even composure can change with the right attitude around. If we could all treat each other the same way, the world would be better. To date, we searched for a copy on the network, and now I finally have a connection with it, as soon as I can find a copy. to buy i'm going to grab it.
