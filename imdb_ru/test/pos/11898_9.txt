I just want to say that this movie was excellent. <br /> <br /> I loved him from the very beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> The acting was great. The director did an amazing job and I would like to see her again. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tilly played very well, the guy who interpreted his father (Manny) was another great actor, but I can't remember his name. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for El Padrino II. <br /> <br /> Damien Chapa looks so good, and I think he is one of the most talented actors out there. There are many Latin American actors who do an excellent job, as shown in this movie! <br /> <br /> Rent it !!! Rent it !!! Rent it !!!
