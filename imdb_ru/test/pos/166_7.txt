A story about three eclipses (perhaps even Indigo, ha) of children starting their love of murder. Yes, and people who are "hot" in their path. <br /> <br /> The bloody birthday, a rather mediocre title for the film, was a pleasant surprise. I did not in any way expect a film that was dedicated to the bloodthirsty psychopathic children. And I can say that this is also one of the best films that I have seen with children as villains. By the end of the film, I seriously wanted these children to die horribly. <br /> <br /> This is a really solid 80s horror film, but how these children get away with all this chaos, and murder is something that you can't help but think about. Even the slightest investigation will easily reveal these murders as murderers. But it seems there are only a couple of policemen in the city, well, by the end, only one, and he looked like a fool, so I suppose they could get away with it. Haha, yes, and I am a Chinese jet pilot. <br /> <br /> However, this film brought some angry children who were more than interesting, a lot of premarital sex and a decent amount of trash. I'm not kidding! If you are not satisfied with the star title, throw it out of your head and take a picture. This is a highly recommended and misunderstood 80s horror movie.
