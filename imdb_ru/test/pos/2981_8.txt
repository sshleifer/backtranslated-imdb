My girlfriend and I saw this film when it was originally released. The controversy surrounding the initial release (teen nude, physical intimacy, and unmarried pregnancy) were topics that never touched our view of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michel, and experienced many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to be drawn into a simplified (at times) game and trivial (at times) emotional twists. This film spoke to us in a way that an adult love story could never be. I still remember how I sat in the cinema with my girlfriend and held her hand while she cried during the tragic final scenes.
