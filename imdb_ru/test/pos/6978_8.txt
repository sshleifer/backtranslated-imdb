Early Coppola with a sublime composition that most people have never seen (sorry). Wonderful things happen in this movie - Shirley Knight's best performance (underrated actress), trip in the late 1960s, James Caan is very restrained and touching, Robert Duval in the role he was born to play (sharp, lonely, motorcycle-cop) and touching scenario with F. Coppola behind the wheel. <br /> <br /> If this was done five years later by someone NEVER, it would be a big blow (so much time). In any case, I recommend this to all people who do not need cosmic explosions and bad mother-in-law jokes or a billion-dollar budget to sit for a few hours and see the unfolding story. Give it a chance if you can find it!
