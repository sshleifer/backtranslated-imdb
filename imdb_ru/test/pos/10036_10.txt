Now it looks more like this! One of the best movies I've ever seen! Despite the fact that it turned out very good in all aspects, this film was shot solely for the fact that it was not too historically accurate. Loosen up! There are many historical films that were forgiven for not being too historically accurate, and many of them didnâ€™t even come close to how ambitious, how interesting and fascinating this film was! Now this is what the movie ticket is about! You will get exactly what you want from the genre of this film, and all skeptics are those with anti-Flynn syndrome. This conservative root syndrome is very closely related to anti-Elvis, anti-Ali, anti-Clinton, anti-Kennedy syndromes, usually caused by the fear of charming people who have unconventional beliefs. If the viewer of this film is unbiased and able to separate politics from art, you will find this film not only one of the best classic works, but also one of the best films of all time. I rate his second best western ever, right b Wayne "Cowboys" ........
