I would like to know if sometime in the future "The Outsiders" (Australian TV series) will be on DVD? And is there music (Title Subject) available on CD? <br /> <br /> There was only one series of 13 episodes of this drama, and in total it should have continued in at least three or even four episodes. <Br /> <br /> The young German actor in this series also starred in a German TV series called the Black Forest Clinic, which was broadcast here in the UK, with an English dialogue superimposed on lip sync. <br /> <br /> I look forward to any comments from the TV industry staff on the above issues, thank you in advance.
