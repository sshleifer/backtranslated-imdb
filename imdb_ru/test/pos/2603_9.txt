Four road signs say: “If you are looking for fun ... You don’t need a reason ... All you need is a gun ... This is the season of rabbits!” <br /> <br /> In the forest we see hundreds of “Rabbit Season” signs placed on every tree. We see more and more signs pointing exactly at the Bugs Bunny hole. Who puts all these signs? Duffy Duck! <br /> <br /> Duffy puts the last subscription on tiptoe and tells us viewers: “I’m terribly unsporting, I know. But what the fuck - I need to have fun! This is really the duck season. "<br /> <br /> From this point on, we see Elmer Fadd with a gun in his hand ..... and the semantic war between Bugs and Duffy, in which the Bugs win every time. Fortunately, only in cartoons can we see as someone shot a shotgun five times in the head, and keep moving on!
