This is an Australian TV series. This is a classic. Stories and actors are excellent. Who can forget that Picker and his gramophone or Chet were ambushed? This is a cult television. Australian actors in the series were the best in their time and had immortality in “Outsiders”. What can I say about the eternal adventure. The music and the song are fantastic. The final credits start with a wheel spin, then Keir sleeping, and then a long shot just can't get much better than that. All 13 episodes are equally convincing in depicting the Australian myth, and I think this is what is in this series. It does not matter that the two main characters were from abroad, I think this is the key to the series and why it’s good.
