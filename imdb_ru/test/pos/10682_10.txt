Jerry Anderson's first foray into a major movie, which benefits from the incredible performance of the FX model and Barry Gray's excellent musical score. Analog computers from roll-to-reel back in 2069 (I suppose Anderson really wanted a safe date in 100 years!) Is a scream, like the fashion for gurus jackets, but you can easily blame 2001 for the same violations, but nobody could foresee some things as they turn out. This film became the springboard for the UFO series the following year, and in fact not only the same people from Forex participated in it, but also the producers and many of the actors. The future of the “alternative history” more than anything else - the Apollo-type rocket used at launch always seems to be a different planet than the Earth. Given the conspiracy of "alternative land", one would assume that this was the feeling they wanted. We end with an ending that poses more questions than answers. This is because the “other earth” exists, every movement, event and thing is repeated, as it happens in both worlds. Because of what is given, and the sun between them, two versions of the same person (in this case, Glenn Ross, an astronaut) will never meet. A complete catastrophe has discovered the planet in the first place, when it is likely to remain in secret forever. <br /> <br /> Filmed mainly in Portugal with an FX job in England, every fan of Jerry Anderson needs it. I have a DVD with nude images, released a few years ago, but now it is not printed, but there is hope that Universal will release it again, perhaps with additional materials and even with Jerry Anderson’s commentary.
