Dan Daily gives a sincere and colorful performance in the role of the great Dizzy Dean. His treatment of the character is very true to life and reflects the scent of Dean’s background and limited education. The film, of course, talks about how Dizzy Deans became famous, and about his sudden journey to the side with an injury that he decided to ignore, unfortunately. His wife is beautifully portrayed by Joanna Dru, who gives a very mundane quality to a woman who loved and supported a baseball player who so quickly rose to "dizzying heights." The image of Dizzy's later career as a sports caster is honest and unshakable, reflecting his problems associated with his poor education and his colorful language both on air and outside of him. Dizzy was a true character, and Daily breathed life into his story with remarkable skill. If you liked this movie, I recommend the comedy “The Kid from the Left Field” (1953), in which the “Daily” plays a baseball player who was worshiped by his little son (Billy Chapin). Every day, he puts the ball back to the player in a completely satisfactory manner. I wholeheartedly recommend Pride of St. Louis baseball fans everywhere.
