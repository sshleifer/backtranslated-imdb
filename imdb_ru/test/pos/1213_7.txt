Wrestlemania 6 is entertaining Restlemania, if not entirely successful. Ultimate Challenge, of course, costs one price for entry, but again, as in many early mania, there is too much filler between them. The crowd attacks almost everything, and, as always, gives us a reliable team of announcements from Gorilla & The Body. The face-to-face match as the main event for WrestleMania was absolutely unheard of at the time, it only made things much more intense. <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> Coco B. Weir / W Frankie vs. “Model” Rick Martel. For a three minute match, it's as good as it turns out. I wish it was a little longer, but what I got was damn good. Martel wins with the Boston crab. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Tag Team Championship. Destruction vs. Colossal Connection | C | / W Bobby Hian. Huge pop for demolition. The match itself is pretty boring, I often had problems with paying attention. Andre really did little, so in a sense it was more like 2 on 1. There are solid talents involved, and it is a shame that they could not achieve a better result. Demolition wins those titles, with there a patten maneuver from above. Crowd blowing roof for finish. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Earthquake / W Jimmy Hart. Against Hercules, I got what I expected, a standard boring match with a filler, when an Earthquake does its job. I'm not really a fan, so it didn't interest me much. Quake wins with his splash to sit down. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Brut Beefcake vs Mr.Pefect / W The Genius. Deafening pop for bruti. A really good match, unfortunately, there is not enough time for further development. It really kept my interest, and remains one of my favorites on the map. Beefcake wins with a slingshot at the post, much to the approval of the crowd. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper vs the bad news Brown. Huge pop for Piper. Nothing but a boring fight that doesn't know who she wants to be. Some funny tricks from The Hot Rod, but no more. It is noteworthy that Roddy paints himself half black and calls himself "Hot Scott" <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> The Hart Foundation Against the Bolsheviks. Record, but besides this, there is nothing to see. Hearts wins with Hart Attacks. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> Barbarian / Bobby Hinan. Against Tito Santana. Average for the time that he has, but, nevertheless, watchable. The crowd was quite dead for this, except for the intervention of Hinan. Jessie's funny breaks about Tito's food are more interesting than the match itself. The barbarian wins with an unsightly, flying clothesline on top. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> A mixed combination of tags. Dusty and Sapphire / W Elizabeth. Against Macho King and Sherry. I can add that this is very popular for Dusty, and even more for Elizabeth, which looks absolutely amazing. I thought everything was fine. At least it was alive, if not so great. I'm not a Dusty fan. Dusty and Sapphire win when She turns Sherry. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Orient Express / Fuji. Against the rockers. Surprisingly, the crowd is quite anemic for this. Decent, no doubt, but with these guys it should have been better. Constant focus with Fuji, it seems to distract from the match. Express wins due to when Janetti is nailed with salt. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Jim Duggan vs. Dino Bravo / W Earthquake and Jimmy Hart. Duggan, like an idiot, pulls out an American flag in Canada. Duggan also gets strong buts for it, but it can also be related to the Canadian heritage of Bravo. Darn match, I don't care, Duggan, but that's not why it sucks. Too short at the end to really make a difference. Duggan wins when he hits Bravo in the back, two to four. Duggan offended by his troubles. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> A million dollar championship. Ted Dibias | C | / W Virgil. Against Jake Roberts / W Damien. A few slow places, but when everything was said and done, I had a good time. Two full fighters, who gave it all, resulted in a spectacular match. The crowd visibly gets Annecy during his parts, though, making a wave. Dibiase wins the score. Jake laughs last, giving some of his money to the joy of the crowd. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Big Boss vs Akim / Slick. Good pop for the bossman. Too routine and too short to really mean something, after all. Akeem was a trick I never loved. Bossman wins with his punch. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Rhythm & Blues segment was almost unsuccessful. The crowd was not in this <br /> <br /> Rick Rude / Bobby Heenan. Against Jimmy Snook. For the main match before the main event it was not so bad. If he had time to go further, it would be great, for sure. Rude wins, with Rude Awakening. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Title for the title. Ultimate Warrior | IC Champ | Against Hulk Hogan | WWF Champion | It's all about the atmosphere of the crowd and the reaction of the split crowd, for the most part. The warrior got pretty decent popularity, but, in my opinion, it was a little out of ecstasy. Hogan outshines him completely with his own. This is one of the best matches in Wrestlemania history. With two people who are not really known for wrestling there, they managed to create an amazing match that was talked about for ages. I have seen this many times, and my level of respect is growing for each of them, for their efforts, given that I am not a fan of either. Even stubborn fanatics who yearn for pure struggle cannot quarrel over this! Warrior wins with his surge. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Total. Wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining article, if not to say anything special. This is a memorable event, venue and audience, but not one of the best, if you ask me. Nevertheless, I like it, and I give my recommendations to my colleagues in wrestling. <br /> <br /> 7/10
