There were many people who tried to make a film that was identical to the story, The Heart of Darkness. Some films are based on Heart of Darkness, for example, Apocalypse Now. In 1993, Nicholas Horn made a film that looked exactly like a book. The heart of the darkness of the film is almost exactly identical to the book. This movie is full of action and adventure. The Heart of Darkness talks about the journey of a sailor named Marlowe, who sails along the Congo River to meet with the super-powerful ivory merchant, Mr. Kurz. <br /> <br /> The Heart of Darkness film has the same beginning. and staging as a book. It takes place on a boat on the River Thames, and Marlowe tells this story to four other men on a boat called Nellie. The entire film is a reminder of Marlowe’s journey to Mr. Kurtz on the Congo River. Marlowe works for a Belgian company that sells ivory along the Congo River. He talks about his account in the Company's office and about all the cards he saw in the office. <br /> <br /> Marlowe is sent by boat to Africa. He arrives at the Central Station, where he receives orders from the general manager. The CEO tells Marlow about Mr. Kurtz and what Marlow will do. Soon Marlow learns that the general manager does not like Kurtz, because he is afraid that Kurtz will replace him. Marlow has been waiting for months at Central Station because his ship was wrecked and is being repaired. Marlow sees ill-treatment and enslavement in Africa from the Central Station. When the ship was finally repaired, Marlowe, another African character named Mfumu, and the other crew members sailed on the steamer Marlowe to Mr. Kurtz. <br /> <br /> Along the Congo River, they attack African descendants. As the Marlow team is attacked by African aborigines, they end up shooting and killing Mfum. When Marlow finally arrives at the Kurtz station, he meets a Russian who explains the power and glory of Kurtz. Then Marlowe is led to Kurtz’s house. There he sees a lot of maps and paintings that Kurtz wrote. Finally, Kurtz enters the room and starts telling Marlowe about everything he did in Africa and tells about his mistress. Soon Marlow learns that Kurtz is mad with force, because Africans greet him like a god. Marlowe is angry at the cruelty and enslavement he sees in Africa. After Marlowe finally meets Kurtz, Kurtz begins to die. While Kurtz was on his deathbed, he called Marlowe to his room. Kurtz’s life begins to flicker before his eyes, and his last words were “Horror, horror.” When Marlow returns to Europe to see Kurtz's fiancé, Marlow tells her that Kurtz’s last words were her name to hide the darkness in Kurtz’s life. <br /> <br /> The heart of darkness was well turned and turned into an adventure film. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because it is full of action and secrets. From time to time the film is slow, but in general it is really interesting. Heart of Darkness will really expand your horizons and teach you how to interpret different scenes.
