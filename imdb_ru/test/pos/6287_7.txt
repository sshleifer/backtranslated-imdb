I watched a few films about Pauly Shore, but this is the only film I liked. Of course, it helps that he is much less annoying than usual, perhaps even a little cute. The rest of the cast does an excellent job, especially undervalued by Karl Gugino. The film itself is mostly a harmless and silly comedy, and although few of the jokes are particularly funny, the whole movie is quite interesting.
