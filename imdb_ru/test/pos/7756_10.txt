From the very beginning you will not be able to look away and do not want to. “Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya” (Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu) is one of the most spectacular anime I have seen in a long time. If you can look away from insane, and sometimes perverse humor, it is easy to find a brilliantly constructed and skillfully executed work. <br /> <br /> Part of the brilliance is due to the fact that the episodes are not in chronological order. order, so you may not understand at first some of the things they are talking about, but during the course of the series you will find yourself saying: “Oh, that's what they meant!” Despite the fact that this may confuse some, after watching the show, it will be difficult for you to find an argument against telling the story this way. <br /> <br /> After all attention is focused on the characters. The title character, Haruhi Suzumiya, of course, is one of the most eccentric heroines of any anime. Her opening speech to the class, in which she states that “she is not interested in normal people” and is looking for “espers, aliens and time travelers”, is absolutely strange, but she is so attractive. <br /> <br /> Then there is Kyon, the "normal" guy who is dragged into the madness surrounding Suzumiya-san. He is a storyteller, and his quick thinking always makes the scene much more interesting. He is caught among the various factions trying to influence Haruhi Suzumiya, and the other three characters are representatives of these factions; ironically, these are the very creatures that Haruhi is looking for, and yet they cannot reveal themselves to her. <br /> <br /> First, Yuki Nagato, a quiet girl who turned out to be the only member of the school literary club. as well as a representative of Integration Thought; she is mostly an alien, although her best description is a computer program in the human body. Her purely non-emotional reactions make her comically cool and always make you think that there is something more than it seems at first glance. In addition, there is Mikuru Asahina, a time traveler, who turns out to be an incredibly sweet, serious figure and object to Suzumiya’s plans for advertising her club, SOS Brigade, to the whole world. The end result is that Suzumiya does things to her, bordering on sexual harassment, forcing her to put on a fetish uniform. The last character is Koizumi Itsuki, a timid and eternally optimistic philosopher who turns out to be Haruhi's esper, although he can use his abilities only in certain conditions. <br /> <br /> The end result of all these characters is comedy, unlike any other, it is coarse, and deep, and always brilliant. You do not trust me? Watch the first episode, their "student film". You will understand what I mean.
