If you consider yourself a fan of horror films, most likely you have seen the Ring of Hideo Nakata and Dark Water. They are great, and Ring is moving smoothly to Hollywood (maybe Dark Water will be adapted soon too?). While the Ring is almost 100% pure heart beating and breaking nerves, the story of two sisters is both a breakdown and a twisting of the mind. <br /> <br /> Along with the Other, I consider this Korean film to be a brilliant and clever ending to a horror film. The only drawback of this film is that some people consider its first 20 minutes rather slow. This is typical of Korean and Japanese films. I believe that this is carefully planned, and not slowly, I think that this is a “calm moment before the storm”. With a detailed representation of the characters, the imho viewer will be more closely associated with the character, one of the strongest moments of Korean and Japanese films. <br /> <br /> Like Ring, the story of two sisters did not overdo it. Rather, they allow our mind to do the frightening work itself. Thus, it is more frightening and terribly stylish at the same time. I would not be surprised if Hollywood remakes this film after “Ring” and “Brudzh” / “Ju-On” ended (by the way, this film is not very good, I estimate it at 5.5). Do not miss!
