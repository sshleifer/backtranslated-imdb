Although it is a bit moving away from the book, you can't dislike atmospheric music and surroundings. <br /> <br /> The scenes in Bata are exactly what they should be. Although, if you watched it as many times as I did, you noticed that background people are the same in every scene, but besides this, I like the scene in which they are in the Hot Tubs, but are there really men and women who bathed like this? ? You could see all the men sitting around outside, making fun of women. It also seemed strange that they were all wearing hats, but perhaps it was a style at the time. The ballroom scenes were very good, the dances and outfits looked beautiful. I especially liked Katherine's dress in the first ball scene. <br /> <br /> Northanger Abbey looked quite impressive, but I liked the scenes from Bath more. <br /> <br /> Schlesinger gives good, but not exceptional performance, as Katherine Morland. Googie Withers gives better performance, like Mrs. Allen, which I feel. <br /> <br /> Damn Peter Firth, like Mr. Tilney, he just says a bunch of garbage and is not a clergyman what he should be, it's hard to think he was in love with Catherine, but at the same time the book never made that impression . <br /> <br /> Hardy plays pretty good with General Tilney, and Stuart also plays the role of Isabella pretty well. Ingrid Lacey did not give a good performance, like Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, he gives the impression of a lustful and lustful person, perhaps not the character depicted in the book, but I really like it. <br /> <br /> I can handle the scenes cut from the book's adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added, it usually annoys me. Marquise! I hate her. She is not part of the story of Northanger and is not her passionate boy. <br /> <br /> Some scenarios are unusual. When Catherine asks Elinor Tilney about her mother’s death, she asks, “I suppose you saw the body? How did it come about? ”What a folly to say! Calm answer Elinor is also stupid. <br /> <br /> In any case, please tell me whether you agree with me or not
