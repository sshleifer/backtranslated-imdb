This is my favorite movie ever! <br /> <br /> I remember this when I was younger, and since then I have fallen in love with him. I used to shoot it so often in this video store where it was carried, and when we moved I could not find it anywhere, so I was going to return to this distant store so that I could watch the movie again! br /> <br /> Finally I found it for sale, bought and watched over and over again .... great movie! <br /> <br /> Since then it was my very first DVD, which I, after I received my DVD player ... Good, good, I received them at the same time, the quality on DVD is much better , I could not believe it! You should see this!
