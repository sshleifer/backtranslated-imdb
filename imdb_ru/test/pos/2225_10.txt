Reading the user comments, I get as much pleasure as watching a movie! It seems that this is a classic film “I Love It” or “I Hate”. And I have to say that I am not only on the side “I love it”, I am going to say that this is my FAVORITE film EVER! Thank God, I found this first. Almost impossible to find, about ten years ago I was lucky enough to record it on the UHF channel in the late evening. Of course, my sympathy for Sellers can make me a little biased, but I can't understand how someone with a black ball, a dry sense of humor (like me) cannot fall in love with this film. The plot is great (but maybe, as the previous poster said, maybe the reason why this is not a well-known film ... upset the medical field?) ...) ... but this is what made this film so wonderful ... it is a complete bad taste), and destroys humor. I can proudly say that I watched this film at least 20 times and remembered every line. This film is a genius!
