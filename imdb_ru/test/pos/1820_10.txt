This is the essence of the early eighties! Shopping centers, credit card machines, food, punk hair color, soundtrack ... I'm in love with this movie. This sweet, intelligent film Romeo and Juliet is instantly addictive. <br /> <br /> Martha Coolidge is one of my favorite directors. She really hires her actors, such as John Hughes and Stephen Soderberg, so see “The Joy of Sex and Real Genius” The soundtracks for Valley Girl are great. If you can find a copy of the movie, buy it! It is out of print and very hard to find.
