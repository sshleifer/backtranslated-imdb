I wonder why I have not heard of this movie before. This is a really great comedy (I would say a farce, but it’s played too well, and I wouldn’t want to belittle its quality). The study of the comedic character about the experiences of middle-age crises, inequality for gays who cannot recognize their long-standing alliances, and the general differences between people who cannot fit into society that unite Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett with a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should make another movie together. Modi (Meredith Eaton), an anxious, cruel and outrageous sister-in-law, a truly remarkable character. If you liked the movies "Tales of the City", you would have liked this eccentric.
