This film brilliantly conveys the atmosphere of D & D. During the viewing, I could not help but notice how brightly the characters reminded me of themselves and my game friends to the extent that they acted just like us. Including quarrels, fights, internal jokes, driving DM crazy. EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> It has everything. The jokes that made me cry, the battle scenes, which, even when shot in low budget, seemed to me incredibly amazing. The story is pretty simple and not surprising, but it doesnâ€™t matter, because the best part of the film is to see how the characters react and interact with each other and with non-player characters. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you play D & D or any similar RPG, I cannot emphasize this, SEE THIS FILM, he perfectly captured the spirit of D & D.
