This is not a story. This is a bunch of psychic needles reaching for your subconscious. If you wait for the story, you will be bored. But if you give yourself to this, you will find yourself in his dream world in 10 minutes. Unclear, but disturbing images of pain and torture in the desert landscape leave room for your own fantasies. A strange soundtrack that gives you a sense of isolation, visual echoes of Christ's crucifixion, pulsating light and deep dark shadows, all reach your subconscious to fill this space of the mind. I found myself shivering and could not escape in front of my television. It was like a dream with wide eyes. A strange nightmare, an unsuccessful journey, a religious experience ... he deeply touched me and left me alive. It freed my mind and gave me one of those rare experiences of loss of identity and fusion with the world of archetypes. A bit of freedom for the soul. However, violent freedom ... Not a good film, but very strong and unforgettable. Literally in my text there are no spoilers. For me, the great surprise of this film was its incredible intensity, and the description of this can be understood as a spoiler. The less you learn about this movie, the better.
