I just watched it again on BBC 4. This is not Jane Austen's best novel, but the film is a sensible interpretation. I suspect that the Assembly Rooms in Bath would be more crowded than shown; perhaps they could not afford the extras. In addition, why is everyone silent so that the dancing couple can hear the conversation? I have never heard anything that anyone told me when I was dancing, and I suspect that it would be the same in the 18th and 19th centuries in Bath. <br /> <br /> I can not believe the US / Canada Reviews; they completely miss the ironic element that is present throughout the film. "Gothic" scenes are presented quite cleverly, but you have to read them correctly. I'm sure Jane A would be a bit surprised by these reviews. The proposal does not mean anything, does anyone else think that Peter Firth looks more like Colin Baker (former Doctor Who) or, on the contrary, the older they get?
