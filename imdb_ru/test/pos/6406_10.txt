Key West, for too short a time, was a "TV reception" for my family. I would stay at Red Lobster and take a tray of parties for the night he was. The irony of the situation was that at that time I was working for the Fox branch, and everyone at the station was outraged that they did not resume the show. Everyone in this cast was excellent. Fisher Stevens ... great. Who could not help identifying himself with the "ordinary man" who dreams of becoming a writer in Key West? Jennifer Tilly was always great (and she is one of the players in Texas Hold'em). You can still find a pilot episode on YouTube. It is a pity that they will not send a hurricane. This episode alone was to win the Amy and the rest of the cast.
