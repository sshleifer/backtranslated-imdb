This satire is just very, very dead, and no one has spared. But even though there is a lot of laughter in this film as part of the stupid story and the grotesque imitation of Hitler (here slyly renamed Hinkel and speaking in ridiculous pseudo-Germanic language), the general tone is rather sad stories. And the actors don't even exaggerate so much, I suppose. One of the greatest movies of all time should be the final speech of a Jewish hairdresser, if everything could end this way. This is not even a character says more, this is Chaplin saying what he really wanted to say. If you ignore the technical aspects, the film does not look outdated or outdated, it actually moves at a pretty good pace. And the sharp humor that we see everywhere in this work will never die, the only thing that doesnâ€™t bother me is a farce, but it only comes with an era, I suppose. This is an incredibly brash, stern look at fascism, so heavy after all these years.
