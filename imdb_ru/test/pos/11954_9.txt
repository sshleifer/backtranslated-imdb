The 80s comedies (especially with John Cusack) are awesome. Almost all of this is a cool and instant classic, and this film is no exception. Many hints of other films (for example, Godzilla and Jaws) throughout the film, which is so funny that you will laugh for hours. Some may complain that the film is sometimes a bit trite, but hey, it was the 80s, and things were always a bit silly. Add a young Demi Moore and an even louder Bob Kota, and you will have a funny fan. If you have not seen this, you better soon !!!!!!
