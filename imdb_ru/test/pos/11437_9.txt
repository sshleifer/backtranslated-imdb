This is a nice movie. This is very realistic for the “wonderful world of music” where I was and did it. This shows the human element in each character and the realism that no one is perfect. These amateur musicians were not such bad players. Cliveon Little's character, Marshall Tucker, played very well. Marshall himself was not holy. Here he gets paid for his work, and he gives these guys trouble about everything that happens in the van on the way there. You do not bite the hands that feed you. I find it hard to believe that a player with jazz experience that he has, claims that he does not know any Dixieland melodies. He has a great sense of predicting chord changes in melodies that he does not know. Not often, but not by chance. At the end of the film, he conveys a truthful and harsh message when he says to the clarinetist: "This is not religion, devotion is not enough." At this level he is right, although I think that the clarinetist could have done this task. He practiced his ass, and vocal accompaniment is not so difficult to read. Very nice movie.
