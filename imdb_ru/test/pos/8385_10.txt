... "Inglorious," because our local theater decided to show the name on its tent, minus the second word. This is an awesome movie. <br /> <br /> Feel free to recommend this film to everyone except the overly squeamish. May they never know what they are missing. <br /> <br /> I did not dare to give him ten stars due to my experience with previous Tarantino films. In any case, except for Guide Dogs, they improved due to additional observation. <br /> <br /> Therefore, although I gave him ten stars, I did it reluctantly. I have nowhere to go. <br /> <br /> Yes, Christoph Waltz is a Nazi whom we all thought was the worst. He is a cultured, sophisticated, courteous and most sadistic person, one of those who can make a glass of milk a threat and who suddenly puts out his cigarette with a strudel, rubbing it into whipped cream, as if he was rubbing his heel into a victim. <br /> <br /> To understand Tarantino’s films, you only need to have a sense of dialogue, color and tempo. The colors are as bright as necessary, and even brighter if necessary. In the French farmhouse of the first scene, they are muffled and dark, but excessively so. Outside the window the bright sun shines, but in one room of the house everything is flooded with shadows and black. <br /> <br /> This is a great place to interrogate the Waltz, like the “Jewish Hunter” SS man, who chats his French farmer over the chasm revealing what he cannot open many times, then pulls him back with obscene lines of friendship and understanding. <br /> <br /> The second sadistic German, well played by Augustus Diehl, later functions as an important actor in the final turn of the plot. Nazi Major Diehl, who loves German accents, is almost as good as Waltz .... almost. <br /> <br /> Cinema lessons will learn a lot from this movie. They must look with love at an excellent pace. Tarantino knows how long you can draw a scene, creating tension in Hitchcock’s style, and then just at the point of breaking, suddenly coming to a resolution. <br /> <br /> For color, look for the final shot at the French Theater, where its secretly Jewish owner arranges a surprise for the Nazi sovereign leadership. <br /> <br /> We see her performed by Melanie Laurent, waiting for the hated German dignitaries to come to the preview of the film the latest masterpiece of the German film, a propaganda film about the German hero and his dubious achievements. <br /> <br /> Laurent is framed on the balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the magnificent theater, her red lips and low-cut dress everywhere reflecting the intensity of her designs on her guests. This is the only picture that would be worth the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there are many more such images, even more scenes with exquisite dialogue and uncertainty. <br /> <br /> In short, see this. I am sure you will see it again and again.
