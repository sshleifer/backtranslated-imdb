I started watching it very intensely, because I heard a lot of different things about it. I read somewhere that it was a drama about child abuse and I rated PG-13 for violence. Another critic said it was a fantastic and nostalgic adventure for children (and I thought it was also for children). Well, now I have seen it so many times and still do not know which category to put it in. Sometimes it is very funny, but terribly sad and sad in the next moment. Because of good relationships and adventures, I would like to recommend this movie to everyone I know, but I am afraid that the gloomy atmosphere is not suitable for children. Because of the wonderful performances and magic of the film, I have yet to say it: watch it, especially the children! The last thing I have to say is that I hate the screenwriter for letting poor Bobby never see his family again after escaping from the King (who never even returned to terrorize the remaining Mary and Mikey). It’s very good for this film not to have a perfect happy ending when everyone is happy - and I didn’t expect it - but this decision left me very, very sad!
