Begins a series of films (which I hope will follow every weekend) films that came out in childhood ?? in this case, the one that I managed to catch just now. It was clearly intended as the last word on the subject, which was basically humbled to the level of hokum over the years; However, in his uncompromising pursuit of a serious approach (the exact measure of which is that the main character is never mentioned by the name that he had known all this time all over the world!), the filmmakers rather lost track of the fact that the thing was intended first of all as entertainment! Therefore, we get a clearly balanced view of events. with more attention to a thorough reconstruction of the period, than to the creation of a functional thematic environment for his mythical jungle hero! However, Christopher Lambert rose to fame ?? how did another debutant, Andy McDowell, play his love interest (named Jane, of course) ?? with the main role with which he copes quite adequately in these circumstances. However, Ralph Richardson (to whom the film is dedicated, this is his swan song) steals every scene in which he plays Tarzan's natural grandfather, who, despite obvious attachment to his long-lost family, cannot bring himself to forget the tradition in an attempt to understand his predicament; in fact, it is much more convenient for the hero to communicate with primates (even managing to save his adoptive “father” from captivity after returning home). Otherwise, the film is very good to watch (with the cinema of Stanley Kubrick, the usual John Olcott, no less), with a corresponding grand score and wonderful makeup effects (Rick Baker) ?? and, although essentially disappointing as a walk in Tarzana, it nevertheless retains significant value as a prestigious picture of its time.
