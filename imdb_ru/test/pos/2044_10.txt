I love this film ...! I have seen it 1000 times on a DVD and I cannot say enough about it. It has everything, comedy, stunning action and incredible stunts. Samuel Jackson steals the show here. I do not think that there is no moment that he is in this, he is not funny! "Everyone knows that when you make a guess, you make yourself ass and perseverance" !! F / x are great! The bridge / truck explosion is incredible, although the sound is not that great! When Samuel drives out of the truck, the sound turns off a little, I think, and what he says is priceless !!! For those of you who own it on DVD, put the audio in French !!! That's cool !!! Even emotional moments are good when the bad guy discovers that Sam / Charlieâ€™s daughter is gorgeous ... This is a great movie that no action movie fan can do without ... I also recommend Thug Island ... Besides the negative advertising, it's kicks !!!!
