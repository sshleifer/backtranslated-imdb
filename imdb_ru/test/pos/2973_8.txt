I also saw this movie when it first came out. At that time I was a teenager and saw it with my girlfriend, who later became my wife. I remember that the film made me feel that you could beat all the odds. Cinematography was very well done, if my memory serves me right. The guy was a little bit, but the character of the girl was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic, and it could have been a first time introduction with my girlfriend. Since then, I have not seen this film, and I wander, why he went into the background. I would like to see it again to see if it was as good as I remember. The sound track of Elton John was superb.
