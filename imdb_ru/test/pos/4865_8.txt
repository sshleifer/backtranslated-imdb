Do you know the concept of "guilty pleasures"? Yes, you have, like you admit that you watched — and enjoyed — the gunies, the galactic star of battle AFTER they reached Earth, on the show, the angels Charlie, Starsky and Hutch, the 1950s Superman version, or Godzilla films. <br /> <Here is the ultimate guilt in pleasures. In combination with the jack of all trades for Raimi’s eventful hours, this half-hour slot machine quickly unfolds, it’s easy to follow, and funny, boring children are loaded into it. <br /> <br /> The man who brought us the evil dead, zenu, the hercules and the adventures of the district of Briko Jr. does it again with this update of 2000, the Charlie angels. we have Charlie (voice), an unknown creature with knowledge and time to find people who need help, Bosley (mouser), a man-gadget, and three gorgeous kids who kick ** for life. <br /> <br /> and oh, what a life!
