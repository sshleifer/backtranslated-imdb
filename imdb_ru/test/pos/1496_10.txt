Mr. Bean was very funny, I liked it, every episode was really funny, Rowan Atkinson was perfect for this role, he looks funny, and his expression was funny !!! <br /> <br /> The series was so successful that in 1997 they even made a film “Mr. Bean”, which, by the way, was quite funny !! <br /> <br /> It's funny to see all the adventures and situations in which he falls, this series was probably a classic, and from time to time I still watch the episode. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean In my book, it’s worth being aware of, the fans of the original comedy should check it out.
