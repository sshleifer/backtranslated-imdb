I have no idea what the budget for this film was, but whatever it was, they made it work! I have seen films that spend 100 times more (someone Pearl Harbor?) And suck 200 times worse. This film has it all. David "Makin 'It" Naughton is starring as Adam, the average college student who is stuck in a game called "The Great AllNighter", managed by Leon! This guy is cool! "Genius", which is nothing better than to come up with an elaborate game that can be played by a bunch of people. But he doesn't just choose his friends. He has a team of athletes, nerds, fat people, ordinary children and, of course, the Flaunder team, who are the “bad guys.” There is no black and white in this film. There are many shades of gray. Adam is not an altruistic hero who has no flaws. He treats Alex P. as shit. And the Flounder is what it is because of the pressure from its father and the shaky belly. Jocks are dirty, but just like everyone else! This movie is awesome! A scene in a PBR factory? Classic! “Johnny's Obesity Baby?” Can you write a better clue? This stuff is golden jerry! GOLD! Maybe I'm from a different generation, but I love movies that seem far-fetched, but still have roots in reality. It never happened ... but it could. Eeee E-Gypt .... EEEE .... Easter Bunny .... Easter Parade! Oh, and watch the young Paul Rubens still working on this character Peepee. PS This is Devra Clinger WAS / HOT! She must have been one bad actress to stop working in Hollywood. SEE THIS MOVIE!
