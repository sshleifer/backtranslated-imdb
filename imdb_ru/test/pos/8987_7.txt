This film begins as a T'n'A film in college, but becomes rather ugly after the main character's sister was raped by a biker gang driving a van. He has a pretty good pace, and James Van Patten does a good job with this movie about Cannon writing off taxes. It was the first film I ever saw on Parkway Drive, here in Toronto. The main feature was the "City of the Alphabet", and the "Young Warriors" were added. From the 2 films “Young Warriors” were much more exciting and memorable. This will be a great addition to any collection.
