If the legendary masterpiece of Monte Hellman of the early 70s "Blacktop with two lanes" was made more like a harsh, trimmed, violently taut and simple thoughtful piece of mood, decorated with this distinctly mean, not rude, rough Very rough and torn off Australian maho mentality, crowned with a generous drop of harsh, desperate, hopeless, or in the end, punk nihilism, it will undoubtedly be very similar to this terribly bleak and atmospheric knockout. br /> <br /> A good guy, factory worker Mike (attractively scruffy Terry Serio), faces a mocking, wear-out shade of fascist race car driver Fox (totally hated by Richard Moir) when he steals an attractive Fox model, Julie (beautiful Deborah Conway) further away From him. Mike and Fox begin to compete in more and more deadly races, in which the stakes get higher and higher with each successive fight, and finally the especially throbbing “all or nothing” race, which allows only one real winner, becomes the culmination. Mike, assisted by his agitated but faithful Italian mechanical friend Tony (superbly smooth turn from Vangelis Mourikis) and trained by a 50s-style rebel blind (amazingly composed by Max Cullen with maximum coolness) reputation, affection of his old lady, money and, most importantly, for the opportunity to overthrow haughty Fox from his gloating, angry throw. Directed with the utmost seriousness and intensity by John Clark, written with a laconic and impeccable perfection of Barry Tomblim, with Peter Crosby's cheerful, creeping synthesizer score and David Gribble's unadorned spare cinematography, this truly gloomy subject of the early 80s presents the concept of racing cars as a fun alternative alternative life, but also an all-consuming obsession and reason for living (this is the only thing most of the film’s heroes are really passionate about) perceptive and unblinking eyes. Complete with a heartbreaking, depressing finale and a mercilessly grim central message about the bitter price paid to be the main dog, this is a fascinating depiction of dead-end existence levels as an extraordinary cinematic achievement.
