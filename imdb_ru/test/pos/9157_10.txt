Hey, you're not alone! I remember Nichols! I was only 17 years old when it was turned on. I remember James Garner was one of the coolest actors, and Nichols was such a wonderful show. I could not believe that it was in such a short time, I wish I could remember the last episode, I probably did not see him ... then there was no vcr, so when he was on it, you saw it, and if he missed the episode, he was gone forever, unless he returned for summer reruns. In any case, it would be great if it were released on DVD, but I donâ€™t think that many people even knew about it. What a disgrace. <br /> <br /> A few years later, Garner achieved great success with the Rockford Files, and he took with him his friend Stuart Margolin from Nichols to play his girlfriend Angel.
