I have just witnessed a film that was supposed to be a second-year feed for CAN YOUR lifelong ... but believe the Irish to be nothing but saccharin. Everything except the screams “This is a message about what is really important in life,” but the performance was very similar to “Let's see what we get away with here.” <br /> <br /> It’s starring two fantastic actors - James McAvoy (as Rory) and Stephen Robertson (as Michael). While Rory is offered as an almost saint - not to mention language and attitude, he is the “life force” in this work and could easily be unbearable in his ultimately “caring” attitude - McAvoy keeps him sharp enough to keep it from being too sweet. But the revelation is Stephen Robertson in the role of Michael. Since Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie "... Gilbert Grape" has not captured anyone so badly that I began to believe that he really was an actor with cerebral palsy. And his eyes ... Oh my God, he can separate you from them. <br /> <br /> This film, paraphrasing Rory, is pretty damn awesome. Go look. Take a box with Kleenex and enjoy every well-deserved tear ... and laugh.
