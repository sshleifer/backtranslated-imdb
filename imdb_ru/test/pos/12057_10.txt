So many times, Bollywood tried to remake Hollywood hits, only to produce total failures. Fortunately, Yasha Chopra’s “Sleep with the Enemy” interpretation is an extremely stylish and well-made film. <br /> <br /> Shah Rukh Khan is obsessed with Juhi Chawla (which looks very good here!). When he realizes that Juhi has a fiancé in Sunny Deol, he stops at nothing to make sure she becomes his. <br /> <br /> Every shot of this film is a pleasure to watch. Be it Shah Rukh, praising his trademark "I love you, To ... to ... to ... Kiran!" or pleasant, soft scenes between Sunny and Juhi (which are perfect for each other), you don’t have to leave food in boredom. <br /> <br /> Every song on the soundtrack is pleasant to the ear, especially Jaad Teri Nazar and Tu Mera Samne. As I said, Juhi looks like a goddess in this film. Darr may not be the best SRK movie (this honor goes to Baazigar), but he is definitely considered one of his most impeccable performances! Sunny is fine. He already starred in similar roles, but he is good. <br /> <br /> In general, Darr - g ... g ... g ... excellent! ;)
