First, I'm a big fan of Buddy Holly. I grew up knowing who he was, and I knew all about that fatal plane ride that put out three incredibly bright lights, like that. But I never really listened to his music. Yes, I heard a lot about it, yes, but until I sat down with the intention to extract something from it, I really came to see the real Buddy Holly. And let me tell you that my world has changed because of it. <br /> <br /> Because of this adoration of such an incredible person, I bought The Buddy Holly Story without even seeing it before. I'm breaking on my views on this film. Perhaps this is because Buddy feels so alive for me that I just could not see Gary Busey in this role. I admit that he did a great job, but his singing sounded so forced. It seemed to me that he knew that he was not at all like Buddy himself and therefore used too much energy to try a similar sound. In some parts of the film he succeeded. But others ... oh. <br /> <br /> The film lasted for several years, but I feel that with the image of this period of time you could cope much better. It was difficult for me to discern at what point in the life of Buddy certain events occurred. I also had a serious problem with some historical inaccuracies. I think the worst was the image of the crickets. I understand how their real names could not be used and how, for simplicity, there were only two of them in the film ... and maybe it was good. Because the background vocals of the film were terrible, and I didn’t like the way they were portrayed as an obstacle to Buddy’s career. Something else that really had no meaning for the film, but annoyed me, was Gary Busey's teeth. They have exhausted me! Buddy Holly had much better teeth. I don't know why I noticed this ... but I did. <br /> <br /> I’ll finish this review with what I thought was the best part of the film: Buddy’s last gig. His last phone call to Maria, the speech of Big Bopper, takes him and Richie Walesa to the stage, after which the frame ends. It even struck me, and I feel that it effectively shows the audience how at some point Buddy Holly was so alive and energetic, and that his flame went out in an instant. I think it was a wonderful way to portray this terrible tragedy. <br /> <br /> A good movie, despite the obvious problems .. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Some obvious flaws, you can use some work ... but not bad.
