This is not your typical Indian movie. There is a great sense of humanity here, and the characters are quite realistic. There is great dynamism in interpersonal relationships, and among many characters there is a feeling of guilt, grief, passion, and passivity. Seeing this, one can feel the heavy burden of 5,000-year-old layers and layers of the history of social existence of one of the most ancient civilizations. The last scene, where the elephant went to the countryside, was an excellent footnote for such an ancient civilization, and yet human relationships still persist and develop. I saw it on DVD, two interviews with the director and the main actress are very interesting. I was surprised to learn that the film is not very good (or not shown) in India (... but perhaps not too surprised). The artistic legacy of rural societies is gradually lost, and its legacy is not captured by the younger generations, since some of the old musicians in the film no longer live today. Great movie.
