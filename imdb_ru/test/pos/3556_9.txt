I almost did not see "Hi-De-Hi!". I think it was a title that pushed me. In those days of the publication of The Times in Welsh, only the titles of some broadcasts were printed, without transmitting pieces of information about what they really were about. “Hi de Hi! Offered me a bad quiz organized by Leslie Crowther, or, even worse, meaningless imports from the US. But I managed to catch a later episode, and I was surprised to find that Jimmy Perry and David Croft wrote it. <br /> <br /> As was the case with “Father’s Army” and “This is not a half-hot mom.” Perry based it on personal experience, in this case he spent in Butlins camp. Before in the 60s cheap airfare appeared over the years, these camps sprang up along the British coastlines, providing entertainment for families his class and earning millions for their owners. <br /> <br /> (Interestingly, I worked in one of these camps in the 80s as a chef - Barry Island, South Wales - known to everyone as “Land of Steps” for reasons that I will not go into!) Install at the end ”the 50s began with university academician Jeffrey Fairbrother (Simon Cadell) taking over as manager entertainment in Maplin - a job for which he was poorly prepared. It included standing comics Ted Bovis (Paul Shane), his buddy Spike (Jeffrey Holland), poor Punch and Judy Mr. Patridge (Leslie Dwyer), snobist ball dancers Barry (Barry Howard) and Yvonne Stewart-Hargreaves) Diane Holland and unforgettable Gladys Pugh (Ruth Madoc), who craved Fairbroot at every opportunity. Effervescent Sue Pollard stole the show, although he was cleaner than Peggy Ollerenshou, whose driving ambitions were to be the “Yellow Cloak” (worn by all important employees). Many sexy girls also took these coats, in particular, “Silvia” Nikki Kelly and “Betty” Ricky Howard. We have never seen Joe Maplin, the owner. He communicated with his staff in the form of illiterate messages that poor Jeffrey was forced to read aloud. “Hi-de-Hi!” This was a greeting of the guests, who usually met with the same insane “Ho-de-ho!”. <br /> <br /> One of the fans was the late Sir Fred Pontin, who told Perry and Croft that he had learned most of the characters from real life. <br /> <br /> I always thought Bovis was the most convincing one. as well as the most tragic, like Archie Rice, he was a comedian whose big break never came, turned into insane banal jokes to entertain drunken nightly spectators. He took advantage of his position to indulge in several benefits, and in one memorable episode, Fairbroth's patience was cut off, and he voiced it: “False, Ted! All lies! <br /> <br /> As with any other Perry / Croft series, the actors were excellent, especially Cadell and Shane. The ghostly “Gladys” Ruth Madok got on my nerves (no wonder Ann Robinson hates the Welsh!), But the misanthropic “Mr. Patridge” Leslie Dwyer and “jockey” Fred Callie Felix Bowness were more than compensated. <br /> <br /> The visual gag that everyone remembers is the drunken Mr. Patridge, noticing a pantomime horse riding along the beach. Looking at the bottle of whiskey in his hand, he decides to stick with it and instead throws out the banana he ate! <br /> <br /> With a frothy mix of nostalgia from the 50s and bold jokes, Hi-De'Hi became a big hit for BBC-1 in the 80s, which led to a significant increase in the number of orders for Butlins and Pontins. However, when Cadell left to return to the theater, everything went downhill. I have never accepted his replacement, squadron commander Clive Dempster (David Griffin). Worse, Leslie Dwyer’s death robbed a show of one of her best characters. Kenneth Connor was invited to replace him as "Uncle Sammy." <br /> <br /> Periodic settings sometimes caused problems; in one episode, Sylvia and Betty had to dive into the pool to save Peggy, who for some reason was dressed like a shark. The show costumes they wore were not suitable for that era. Still, they looked great in them, so who was complaining? In another case, Ted sang that Tom Jones hit 'Delilah' to tourists. It was not compiled (by the way, by Les Reed and Barry Mason) until 1968. <br /> <br /> Maplins closed its doors in 1988, and the last shot was Peggy (now the Yellow Coat) alone in the camp. jumping into the air and shouting (what else?) "Hi-De-Hi!". <br /> <br /> I don’t rate it as highly as other Perry and Croft shows, but its popularity is undeniable. It was probably one of the last British sitcoms that aroused tremendous public love, mainly because there were nice characters in it in a recognizable setting. Good night, vacationers!
