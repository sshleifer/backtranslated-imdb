As a person who usually despises Ali J, Indahouse Ali J was absolutely brilliant. When I watched it, I was hysterical. Yes, it is sexist, rude and extremely rude, and I loved it. Since in some comedies there is only one or two funny scenes, this film was just ridiculous. I have never seen such an original comedy like Ali G Indahouse. For the comedy starring Ali G, it would be worthy of 8 out of 10. Absolutely brilliant.
