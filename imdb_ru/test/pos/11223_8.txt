At first glance, a film like "Northfork", a city that should be flooded in 1955, and a group of 6 characters who are sent to evacuate the remaining citizens, may be a regular film. As soon as we soon meet the remaining priest, who will take care of the sick child, the greedy owner of the land, we will be able to prepare a simple story that everyone could easily digest. However, when you first become acquainted with this film, you notice an amazing wide open cinematography and a scene in which there is no wall in the church hall, which opens onto pastures, and a picturesque view of the mountains with cattle grazing. It soon becomes clear that after this scene and the presentation of some urban dwellers, that this is not an ordinary film or an ordinary story, this is something very special and unique. <br /> <br /> At first glance, this is not the case. as is clear, but the cinema and the landscape witnessed by the viewer are stunning, and the characters who inhabit this small, soon vanished area are simply amazing. This is something that can either bring you closer to this qwerky film, or you are bored to sit there and wait for something to happen. <br /> <br /> Films, deep spiritual and dreaming, give a slow and methodical approach. Iâ€™m sure this will tire some viewers, but if you are patient with this and see a bigger picture, the film will be an excellent witness. <br /> <br /> rating 8 out of 10
