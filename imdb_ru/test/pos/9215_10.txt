Worst movie ever ?? BIG !!! This is one of the best animated films I've ever seen! All the great characters in the animated series Rainbow Brite participate in it. Very safe for small children, and the colors attract their attention like no other! There is an evil princess trying to steal the diamond planet of the Spectrum, which, in turn, will lead to the cessation of all life on Earth. It tells the story of how Rainbow Bright and her new friend Chris can stop the princess's evil plot and bring life and color back to Earth. This is proof that children can make a difference! Rainbow Bright will live forever.
