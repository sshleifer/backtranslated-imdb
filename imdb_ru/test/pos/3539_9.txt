After reading another comment about this great TV drama, I felt the need to balance the situation a bit. If you like murder, be it a signature and a series, and your police are British, and they scream a lot, and blood is bloody and religious, then it pushes every button. Not quite enough to put a cry into the sparse heights of Sweeney, but otherwise highly appreciated. Ken Stott is great as a “cop on the edge,” and guest stars are also well-played, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Featured. (In response to previous comments, although I agree that the “red” did not “normally” drive away from the blow and run away, he had just witnessed how his brother was arrested for the murder, and I am quite sure that he does not see boy's movements.)
