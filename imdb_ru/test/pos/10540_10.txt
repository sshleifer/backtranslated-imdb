(This review contains a huge spoiler, but I donâ€™t know how to explain how cool it is without giving it away). I saw Pinocchio's Revenge a while ago. <br /> <br /> Now you might think that this is just a robbery of a child's game. Indeed, there are similarities. <br /> <br /> However, Chucky was an obsessive doll that works independently of the child. It is possible that Pinocchio is obsessed with a demon, cursed or something like that. however, the puppet itself is virtually inanimate. KID is crazy, and KID is killing people! Everyone, including the viewers, the survivors and the Kid himself, thinks that this is a doll. But this is a KID. <br /> <br /> Nude is almost a pity, because otherwise I could tell everyone, because this is a really interesting horror movie.
