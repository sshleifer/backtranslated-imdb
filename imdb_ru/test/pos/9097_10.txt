Just go see this movie. It includes everything amazing in rock and roll, the band came up with some great songs (Classico, Pick of Destiny, Master Exploder, etc.). All this with Teancous D's Humor makes this movie the best in history. <br /> <br /> Cameos look great from behind, with Meat Loaf and Dio singing for JB. Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins are great, I really like the character of Tim Robbins. You will also find out who Satan really is! Music and Musical links are fun and Amazing. Playin songs are great songs from The Who, Dio and others just complement it. Personally, I didnâ€™t think that the band would be able to beat the awesome D songs, but they did it with songs like Classico and Master Exploder. Seriously cool music. <br /> <br /> Just look, it is required for anyone who loves rock!
