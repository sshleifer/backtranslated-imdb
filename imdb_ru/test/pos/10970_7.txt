1959 was a milestone in the world of cinema. Several great directors of the classical era produced classics that limited career, which was considered one of the best. Only views on the names are instructive: "Hitchcock North to the North-West", "How Hot It Is" by Billy Wilder, Rio Bravo of Howard Hawks, and Imitation of Life by Douglas Sirk. Add a couple from last year, Orson Welles's “Touch of Evil,” Hitch's Vertigo and Nick's Wind through the Everglades, and you get a pretty good generalization of what was possible in the classic Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> At the same time, two films appeared that hint at a completely new way of making films. One of them was “The Breath of Jean-Luc Godard”, the other - “The Shadows of John Cassavetes”. These two films had some common features, mostly an improvised non-star game, portable cameras, low budgets and some youthful, jazz debauchery. However, in certain respects, they could not be further apart. Godard still believed in the director as a style arbiter. He knew more about cinema than most Hollywood producers, and Breath was filled with the iconography of a classic crime movie. Cassavetis, on the other hand, was an actor and refugee from the theatrical scene of New York. His first film shows him a little impressed with the movie, and a big supporter of the actors. Godard’s film constantly mentions his own invention, while the Shadows aspire to a particular kind of naturalism. <br /> <br /> He does not achieve this, mainly because naturalism is a myth, especially in the movies. But it sounds powerful, kinetically, but sounds like cool jazz on the score, of course, the main inspiration for the style of filmmaking shown here. This ultimately does not hold together, mainly because the actors of Cassavetes here are amateur beatniks, where the style of Cassavetes requires strong, creative actors. His later work with Gina Rowlands, Ben Gazarra and Peter Falk blows it out of the water. Due to the technical inexperience of the director, some parts of the dialogue should have been reduced later, which is detrimental to the freshness of improvisation. Nevertheless, it is interesting to observe, both in beautiful moments (for example, the scene where Leila Goldoni talks about her disappointment because of the loss of virginity), and to watch how an innovative artist finds her way.
