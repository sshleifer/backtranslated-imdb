Just watched it then. It's damn cool. The fights are fantastic, and the magic is really cool! It's completely like a video game piecemeal, with some awesome melee fights. <br /> <br /> This film is for fans: "For those who once loved this world and spent time with his friends, get together again and dedicate your time ..." Besides this sinister discovery, the story was not it's very difficult to follow and I have never played the game Final Fantasy. I think it's worth being familiar with role-playing games in general; Knowing the genre helps to understand it better. Although I think that if you pay attention and accept what throws in you film, it's pretty easy to understand. There are a lot of things that are not clearly explained, and if you demand that this is the case, you You’ll be confused and annoyed. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie is just the same as getting into the middle of some great saga and you need to put together as many puzzles as possible. I like this approach; you fall into secret and the confusion that all the characters are experiencing. But, as I said, just accept. If the strange red-headed lion who speaks gets up and starts kicking his ass and taking names, and the other characters just say he is an old friend, take it and move farther; You do not need a biographical film-retrospective film or an all-consuming story. You are here an observer of something that goes beyond your experience and incomprehensibility. <br /> <br /> So: fantastic graphics and animation, excellent voice acting, cool music in the style of video games, history and characters, and perhaps some of the coolest battles you will see after a while. It’s worth seeing, and while it’s for fans, it’s perfectly accessible to people like me who have never played games.
