Well, I will allow you that some of the scientific works in The Double (or Journey to the Far Side of the Sun) are a kind of deception. The idea of ​​the existence of a whole planet goes unnoticed (because we cannot see it on the other side of our Sun) does not stand up at all - any Astronomy student 101 knows that another planet the size of Earth will cause gravitational perturbations in the movements of other planets. In the end, this is how astronomers came to the conclusion that Pluto existed, and that is how they regularly find comets, asteroids and satellites. <br /> <br /> And the idea that the mirror image of the Earth somehow evolved almost perfectly parallel to our Earth, right up to English-speaking scientists and human analogues for every person born on our Earth ... which takes things out of the fiction of "hard science" to the territory of the Twilight Zone. This is not necessarily bad, but it requires a serious suspension of critical thinking in order to accept and enjoy. <br /> <br /> But, man, this movie knocked me down when I was a teenager. I was still used to pretty funny sci-fi movies when the hero won at the end - even “2001” could be interpreted as an “optimistic” ending. <br /> <br /> But in this case: Tinnes tried to dock with his orbiter so that he could return to his Earth, only to bounce off his dock (Something about “polarity does not change, because its“ double "Did not do the same. Apparently, the Tinnes" twin "decided that he was happy in his new home.) The Tinnes ship started to descend back to the launch site of CounterEarth, and I was sure that in some way Bring the damaged ship to land safely, and try again, armed with new information that wills for him and his supporters succeed. In the end, he was a hero, and in the end he always won. <br /> <br /> Instead, Tinnes was unable to retain control of the damaged ship, and the subsequent fall of the ship to the launch site was so terrible and destructive that it killed everyone (except the main project manager) and destroyed all the records of the project and existence of Thinnes . Tinnes never returned home, and he died uselessly, his secrets were never revealed. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the Planet of the Apes series, I have never seen such a sad and depressing finale, and it was always remembered - especially the fierce devastation of the crash scene at the beginning of the movement (you knew that the spacecraft would NEVER fly again !) and the one at the very end. <br /> <br /> I would love to watch this movie again and see how well it has endured these years.
