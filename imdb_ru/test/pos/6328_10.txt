A fun romp full of silly, if not cruel jokes. Not the best of movies, but definitely worth seeing. David Niven and Stuart Granger are their ordinary charming personalities, especially Granger as a delightful and resourceful gentleman. Ava Gardner, as always, is wonderful, with such a delightful character that is absolutely irresistible. The storyline is typical, but full of humorous surprises, especially in relation to the unconventional relationship between Granger, Gardner and Niven.
