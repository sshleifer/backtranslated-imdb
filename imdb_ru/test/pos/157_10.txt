I will not bore you with a brief overview; most likely you already know them. And I hope you are already familiar with the work of Park Chan-Wook. <br /> <br /> I STRONGLY disagree with some other commentators, saying that "The Park has not gone away from the trilogy of revenge blah blah blah." Because you know what? He has!!! Let's start with the fact that the trilogy of revenge differed from each other in style, how can you even compare the gloom and subtlety of "Sympathy For Mr Vengeance" with the frantic and extravagance of Oldboy? Pak Chan-Wook has an incredible style, but his films do not all share the same style! This was true and remains true with the release of Thirst. <br /> <br /> “Thirst” is an incredible picture, literally EVERYTHING you want in a movie. Stunning violence, the taste of blood, great humor, incredible excitement and even very realistic sex scenes. The story is so crazy that you would never guess what will happen next. I'm so glad to say that Park is back in great shape with this fantastic dark comic story about vampires. See as soon as possible!
