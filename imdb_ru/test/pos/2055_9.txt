There is a serious scene in this movie. A scene that allows you to understand that his film will not bring many cheap hits. This happens at a crowded railway station, and the main characters are ambushed by assassins with automatic weapons. They take a break and just go under a barrage of shots. The main hall of the station is now filled with the corpses of innocent people caught in crossfire. Some would call it too sad and / or dismal to put in what should be a pleasant fighter. I call it honesty. Most militants lean toward the “safe side” of demonstrating violence and plot elements. Basically, this means that, despite the massive exchanges of fire, innocent people, as a rule, do not die, or, at least, we do not see their death. Violence is just the good guys against the bad guys, mostly the dying bad guys. A little common sense clearly shows that this is absurd. <br /> <br /> Renny Harlin showed a hint of this in his first (and, unfortunately, the only) hit Die Hard 2. The villains intentionally smashed a plane full of people to understand their point of view. The scene was also removed from the backup scene with a cargo plane, when only a few people came on board, but eventually a darker and possibly more realistic scenario was used. However, in order to conform to the spirit of the first film, Die Hard 2 was basically a “funny action movie”. Here this dark and more convincing edge is common. Violence is bloody. Some liners are fun, but with a certain style that more reflects natural human sarcasm than clichéd films at key points in the action. The plot is also filled with more malicious intent than most militants. The villain is not just a swindler of revenge or a mad seizure of power. This is less funny, but also frightening. From recent films, the Bourne trilogy almost got to the scene with a less defiant than usual action movie style, but this film appeared in 1996 and 7 years before Bourne Identity with Matt Damon made it to the big screen. > <br /> Another interesting aspect is that the main character is actually a heroine. And this is long before the version of the movie "Tomb Raider" became a hit. Moreover, this heroine sincerely looks as if she could kill John McClain, and then take his still lit cigarette. This film marks the second role of the heroine in the genre of militants Gina Davis, and she did not succeed. While Angelina Jolie acts in the "Tomb Raider" years later and earns a hit. The reasons behind me. Fully. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film is not completely dark. There are many outrageous and exciting scenery that can only be seen in the action movie. The climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely fascinating demonstration of film technology, in which more than one law of physics makes a convenient breakthrough. Thus, there is a formula, but it is an anti-formula for the everyday Hollywood action movie formula. --- 9/10 <br /> <br /> BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence, profanity
