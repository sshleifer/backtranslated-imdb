Cheezy? Yeah. Bad shot? Still would. Zero budget? They proudly declare this on their posters. Brilliant anyway (or because of this)? Of course. <br /> <br /> In this film, everything that was classic in the horror genre for teens of the 80s is glorified (and ridiculed): characters without depth, fitting into a stereotypical movie they never run away from; adolescents trying to survive the killing with some mysterious force that they disturbed by doing something stupid in their teens; totally gratuitous nudity; the impossible amount of blood coming from the victims; slow moving zombies; great cues ... and our hero even wears Michael Jackson's jacket! <br /> <br /> This is not a total parody like in the movie “Scary Movies”, but rather a film — a tribute to the lost innocence of the horror films of the 80s ... when being scared and detached can be funny, stupid, sexy and stupid have a good time!
