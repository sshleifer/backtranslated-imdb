Dead spots and surface posters with pictures "Out of Africa" ​​almost buried any interest that I could have towards Isak Dinesen. So when my brother bought me the “Babette's Feast” and, knowing that it was based on the story of Dinesen, I didn’t quite catch up with the VCR. But as soon as the titles rolled, it became clear that this was no ordinary movie. Jutland (where it is installed) is not Africa; cold fog, which is collected in the camera images, does not invite. Cold, unapproachable sea; heavy gray clouds; pale, icy green rocks - translate into difficulties that are shown on the faces over which director Gabriel Axel draws a curtain. Kraggist is Bodil Kier, like Philip; Among the many advantages of this film, the most memorable is the face. This is similar to the map that lies before us the cherished miracle of the apostleship of her father, the minister; like a labyrinth of long-missed fjords, where the complications of perseverance and adherence to its congregation are like sparkling linings. <br /> <br /> I understand that Dinesen’s point is that the world inexplicably reaches out for Christian devotion, when Philip is rejected by her only serious fiancé (because he fears that he will never comply with the rules and severity of her small religious clique), and he returns to find her mistress, whom he considers the greatest chef on the continent. I believe this is also her point of view, that Christ responds to the doubts and regrets of those who refuse worldly success (Philippe's sister Martin rejects attempts to visit the baritone (Jean-Philippe Lafont, whose gaiety creates the sublime contrast to the rarity of the spirit that surrounds his discovery )) to turn it into an opera star; the title character leaves France and an enviable reputation, and seeks refuge as a servant of two spinster sisters) to pursue artistic triumphs only for God and the witnesses closest to Him. But it is Axel who weaves the severity of the lives of these people with the richness of Martina’s voice and the Babette Hersant table and produces an effect of magnificence that you never expect from a movie about sacrifice, faith and religious conviction. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes this film from other religious films is its cunning humor. “Babette's Feast”, that is, the banquet itself - the posthumous celebration of the minister’s 100th anniversary - is a perfectly organized clash of feelings that delivers comic moments to an ensemble of actors who have no analogues in their subtlety. It is this clever comedy that enriches solemn feelings at closing. Together they do something pious cinema, rarely do. They leave the believer with quivering hope and unexpectedly determined and humiliated.
