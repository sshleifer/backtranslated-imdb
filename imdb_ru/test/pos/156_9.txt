From the director Oldboy comes this slippery film about vampires. Kang-ho Song plays the role of a priest who accidentally turns into a vampire after being cured of a deadly, mysterious virus. His vampirism and priesthood are rather contradictory, but he can survive by robbing a blood bank in a hospital and unconscious patients who may not object to some pumped blood. Because of his supposedly miraculous survival, he enters the life of the Ha-Kyun Shin family. She has cancer, and his mother believes that Sun can cure him. Unfortunately, Sung's vampirism raises his level of lust to such an extent that he cannot help falling in love with Sheen's young wife, OK-Win Kim. Kim is very interested in the world of vampirism, and both become lovers. The film from there goes in strange directions, which, I think, need to be tested on yourself. What really should be mentioned is Chan-wook Park Cinema mastery. My God, I rarely saw such a masterful visual artist at the height of his abilities. The main drawback of the film is that it is a bit rambling, especially at the beginning. The park is interested in telling its stories, mainly in visual images, which can sometimes be difficult to understand. But when it works, man, it flies. The film is also perversely funny. The final sequence, easily one of the best in a decade, is both heartbreaking and delightfully funny. OK-Win Kim should become a world star after this film. She gives one of the best performances of the year.
