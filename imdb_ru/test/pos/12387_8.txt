I suppose this film is not your typical Spanish thriller, as it is based on a true story that happened abroad. The film is based on the real story of Frenchman Jean-Claude Roman, and the real case is much more scary and scary than the movie. In the real story of Mr. Romande, the family did not escape, after long years of lying, he decided to do this by killing his wife, two children, parents and a dog, and although he tried to commit suicide, it seems he didn’t try very hard how he survived . I watched a movie with people who sat next to me and told me that in real life this would never happen, if all these lies go unnoticed, I laughed while reading a book about Mr. Romand and knew that this had happened. I like José Coronado in this film, he offered us a good performance, like the rest of the crew.
