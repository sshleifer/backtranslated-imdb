When I was younger, I saw the end of HAIR on TV. I just watched the last 5 minutes of the movie. And I was really impressed by this. I got goose pimples, and I told myself that I HAVE to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> And I did, and have to say: this movie is awesome. The songs are great, the actors are very good, and the message ... The message of this film is one of the most important: "Make love, not war." This film is a true masterpiece. So far this is my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> The last song is one of the saddest and happiest I've ever listened to. I almost felt like I was joining the crowd. All I have to say is: “GIVE A SUN OF THE SUN, GIVE A LIGHT OF THE SUN”
