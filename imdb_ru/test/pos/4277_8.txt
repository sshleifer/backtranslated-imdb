My husband and I watched it last night ... It was wonderful ... This time he made a mistake by guessing the early ending. It progressed very quickly and the action was excellent .. I adore Tom Wilkinson anyway. As far as I understand, he never made a bad film. The above description of his action strikes a nail on the head ... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque scenery is awesome. We have just finished watching the entire series “Main Suspect”, and I am convinced that the British have a way to capture the audience. There is no doubt that I would recommend this film to anyone who wants a few hours of thorough entertainment.
