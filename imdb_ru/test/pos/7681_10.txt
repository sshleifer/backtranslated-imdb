Of course, the Gershwin family understands that this is one of Americaâ€™s greatest operas. You have thousands of fans of this opera, awaiting its release on DVD. Please do not be so stubborn, give us a break. Think of the joy and surprise that you can bring to the hungry public for quality music by releasing this wonderful GEM. Do not wait until the film is beyond repair. The cast is first class, the music is just awesome, we need beautiful music in the modern world. It can never be shot again with such a magnificent composition again. With today's home theater systems, great sound systems and the need for great music, I implore the Gershwin family to reconsider and release this amazing movie. Thank you very much
