This may be the most intense film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Actually, it is so nervous that I could not watch it again after watching two years ago, but I will, since I have a DVD. There were several scenes that are almost impossible to see ... so if you have problems and need to “run away” for an hour and a half, this film will distract you from everything else. <br /> <br /> Russian actress Marina Zudina did an excellent job only with a facial expression, which she had to do because her character is dumb here. She plays a cute and helpful makeup artist for a dirty director. After the day's shooting is over and Billy is about to leave, she hears something. She looks into the room where they were filming, and discovers that they are now filming a “snuff film” and are actually killing someone. Billy's eavesdropping is discovered, and she runs after her life, as killers are looking for her in this large warehouse-type building. <br /> <br /> There are two extended scenes in which our heroine runs after her life, they will dress you. I described the first one above. The second climatic scene continues for too long and is not as good as the first. In fact, the film should have been cut a bit, but overall, because it holds our attention so well, it served its purpose as an entertainment.
