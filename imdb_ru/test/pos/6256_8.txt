Well, it wasn’t the best horror movie I’ve ever seen in my life. Despite the fact that the budget is lower, the film is pretty good. Monsters are unique and believable. Damn it, they are even a little scary in the scenes where they show that they briefly wreak havoc in this poor family. Although, when you finally see the monsters completely, do you really think: “Damn it !? These tiny little things are haunting them?! ”The only part that really bothered me was when * sniffing * they killed the kitten! Not a cat, noooo, why? Seriously, if you are looking for cruel violence and blood, this is not a movie for you. Hire The Hills Have Eyes or something. If you have small children, I would not advise looking at it with them; would probably give them nightmares about the trolls in their room.
