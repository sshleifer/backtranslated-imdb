After repeatedly talking about how brilliantly so many episodes of Colombo are, it's time to honor the episode with the maximum points. Etude In Black is not 100 percent perfect, but certainly more than 90 percent ... maybe 96 or 97! <br /> <br /> Last week I reviewed Just Married and compared it to Meet the Parents. Well, here is one of the parents, Blythe Danner, in a much earlier role as the wife of the famous orchestra conductor Alex Benedict, who was played by the legend of John Cassavetis. Alex had an affair with Jennifer Wells, a girl from an orchestra (suspected, this is not his first novel). She is blackmailing Alex to leave his wife, but since his wife’s mother holds wallets for the orchestra, Alex doesn’t think it will be such a smart step to ruin his career and marriage in one night. Instead, he harbors a plot to get out of the concert hall before the performance and kill his young lover, making him look like suicide. <br /> <br /> Enter Colombo and guess what? It takes him about two seconds to realize that killing is more likely than suicide. Colombo did not take long to link Alex with the victim, and soon he will follow him wherever he goes. Despite the fact that Colombo is sure that Alex is his man, it actually takes a lot of time and a few false traces (none of which Colombo swallows) before he has vital evidence. <br /> <br /> On the way there are some first-class additional characters, ranging from the premature young neighbor, Jennifer Wells, and the English mechanic, who sounds like he will feel right at home on Coronation Street, to a lumbering brass player who almost ready for murder (He also saw Jennifer Wells, a busy girl!). And there is even a short cameo from Commandant Lassard from the films of the Police Academy. As in the case of Leslie Nielsen in Lady In Waiting, he cannot be taken seriously (I bet you think about what he said on the podium, right?!) <br /> <br /> But this is Blythe Danner, John Cassavetes and Peter Falk, who steal the show here. Blythe is absolutely divine, like Mrs. Benedict. From the moment she notices that Alex dials the number of Jennifer Wells from memory, she is deeply concerned about exactly what their relationship was. This is a masterful presentation, as she struggles to trust Alex, despite the fact that her intuition tells her something very, very wrong. Colombo does not help, interrupting her game of tennis to ask her audacious questions about Alex’s relationship with his orchestra members. <br /> <br /> Regarding John Cassavetes, unfortunately, he did not repeat appears as Colombo's villains, because he could be there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the greatest characters of the show. But this presentation is superb! This is another person who falls into the category of “strongly irritated,” loses his patience with Colombo, and not befriended him and did not indulge him. Despite this, when the game finally ends, he reluctantly recognizes Colombo's genius. <br /> <br /> Well, this is a really, really fantastic show. He loses a couple of very small points because of his rather a hammering look at classical music, as emphasized by many of the posters here, but none of them has anything to do with the logic of the story or the characteristics. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting! <br /> <br /> Finally, if you haven’t come across it, there is an absolutely amazing clip of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on the Dick Cavetta show from the early 70s. I am fully convinced that Steve Coogan watched this video and founded Alan Partridge on it. Everything in the video reminds “I know that I know you”, from a brief introduction to Cavetta’s complete humiliation by his guests. Even the orchestra takes part in the game, playing circus music, while Falk, Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzar fool around and make fun of the host. <br /> <br /> This may not be entirely appropriate in this review, but the Cavetta Clip show provides a good understanding of the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetis. From the quality of "Etude In Black" you can see how well the couple worked together!
