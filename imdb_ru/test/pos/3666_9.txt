The film is by no means perfect, but despite this, looking at it is very fun and funny. I am the first to agree that Victor Fox is not very attractive, and his music and style are rather stupid. I also agree that the film has some strange distractions, and some scenes do not work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you like it, who cares? Every movie should make sense? Every movie should be perfect? Not. A person can go crazy, recognizing that he likes this film. Again what? He has attractive characters, he is well shot, acting is mostly good, it never becomes disfigured or dramatic, it is fancy. See how many people love, I dream of Ginny. It's perfect? Gosh no! And although it is something completely different, I say, check it out, and you will be in a good mood after you see it.
