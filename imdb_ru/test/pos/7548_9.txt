So, Udo Kier earned nine bucks and free food for it, so this is a victory in itself. <br /> <br /> More importantly, this film tells a very interesting story about a group of lifeguards who are confronted with a broken Demeter. I must warn you, I jump through this review very quickly, so fasten. First thing first. Kulio plays a guy named 187. 187 likes drugs. 187 finds a bunch of boxes on board and ... now I don’t know anything about the future, but maybe they are bringing drugs into the boxes. Not Gunna say it was the craziest thing in this movie. Later, the vampire emerges from a coffin filled with mist, and then the real fun begins. First, although there is the word Dracula in this film, it is not really in this film. I have a theory though. Suddenly, you see the rescue team’s ship leaving without them. My theory is that Dracula was on board with his retarded brother Orlok. Dracula told Orlock he would be back. Damn Dracula came out of this film before they saw him, when he left Orlok to play the vampire for about six minutes, during which he was in the film. The best part of this film, and for those of you who have seen it, you know that I’ll say Gann, this is after the year 187 is recruited, whatever. He has this huge monologue about ejaculation on different parts of Erika Eliyak's body and ... other super cool things. Kulio, seriously, you are the best thing ever. <br /> <br /> Other things happen in this movie. It's like Casper Van Dien gets some work. Orlok cries a lot and loses his hand, and then we kind of lose his mark FOR THE REST OF THE FILM. And thank God, really. We learn that Erica’s character is a police bot. When the film comes to an end, we discover that the ship is on its way to the sun. A police bot and another surviving character are doomed. Instead of avoiding certain death, Erika's police bot shows that she is also a whore, and they decide to topple each other and die. Before they die in the sun, they die for no reason, yes, right ... their ship exploded for no real reason. <br /> <br /> This movie received a terrific rating for one reason, Culio. My God, if they gave academic awards to black rappers, he would get them first. The only reason he didn’t get the perfect ten was because there wasn’t a drop of nudity. Now I know what you are thinking, how you can judge a movie by whether women show their products or not. Well just. A film like this pretty much requires it. This is part of the process. Mountain, blood, monsters, nudity, blood, the end of the film, the final shock at the end. This is a formula. It was a bit of blood, the monster was awesome because it sucked so hard that it actually did us a favor to stay behind the scenes. It was important of him, and I respect that. Nude, not a bit in spite of a long conversation about ... well, see the above statement and as for shock / turn ... I certainly did not see the end. This is equated. <br /> <br /> I hope that Hollywood does not think that Kulio gave this film to everyone and that he has nothing left. He deserves more work. Well, before Dracula 4000, I'm leaving.
