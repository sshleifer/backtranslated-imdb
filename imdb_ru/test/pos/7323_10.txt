Columbia Pictures Short Subject has never had any illusions about making any feature films. They wanted to give exhibitors a little more for their money when booking the Columbia Picture in their cinemas. This would double for the 3 Stooges films. <br /> <br /> MEN IN BLACK (1934) was as close as all their comedy shorts, in that they received an Oscar nomination for Best Short Theme, a comedy. Although it did not win, it could well have. That was good enough, and even those who aren’t listed on the Stog dossier still seem obsessed with a loud cry "....... call Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!" It was the second entry in a long series of comedic shorts created by Stooges for producer Jules White, the head of the short story department at Columbia. Only women hate, described in his credits as "Musical novelty", preceded her in the sweatshop of Harry Cohen's "Poverty". <br /> <br /> The film begins in the office of Dr. Graves, the head of the hospital. He accepts new interns and, referring to the group, says that three of them were transferred from the medical institution because they stayed there for so long. But the good Doctor declares that he will not disclose their identity as long as they swear by all "...... for duty and humanity!" Stooges run forward, promising "... for duty and humanity!", And run out of the office, smashing window glass in the door. The game has begun. <br /> <br /> The Stooges took off and did not stop for the remaining 2 drums. Every type of gag was obvious. From broad spectacles similar to Sennett, to a pun, a dialect of humor, to the "theater of the absurd" and a surrealistic run involving an alert system that seems to take on a life of its own and has a real culprit - Trudka radio was shot at ..... he got me! " (Everything looks pretty good, honestly!) The sets used looked very authentic and, no doubt, were borrowed from Colombian features made around the same time. There are many wheelchairs, surgical beds, stekaskopov, surgical scalpels, etc., Confirming the illusion of the hospital. <br /> <br /> The true strength of MEN IN BLACK lies in the large number of usually nameless players that we all recognize by face. Along with them, the film boasts a large number of veteran comedians who are always in good performances, often stealing the stage. People with names like Billy Gilbert, Hank Mann and Bad Jemison shine even in small pieces. <br /> <br /> Finally, we have maestro, conductor Raymond McCary, younger brother Leo McCary, who boasted about his ability to get this little film "in the bank." He skillfully kept all this in motion, from time to time playing the role of a traffic cop, which happened to all the actors, extras and backstage team moving and going beyond each other’s paths. And this does not apply to giant tandem bicycles for 3 people, horses with a swinging horse and miniature racing cars, not to mention the "giant green canaries"!
