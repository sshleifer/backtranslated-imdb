Last night I had the wonderful pleasure of watching the movie Hitch. I was stunned and amazed. Will Smith did a phenomenal job in a role with which he is not always connected. He proved once and for all that he did not need to hold a gun to become a great actor in a movie. Kevin James was also very impressive. I admit that I always liked him in King of Queens, but this role really brought him to the light, and I hope to see him on the big screen in the near future. The film was funny and amazing, and I recommend it to any guy as the best dating movie you could ever imagine. The combination of comedy, romance and drama made me feel complete. This is nothing like most “chick clicks” in the sense of tears and sadness, but by itself, and I think that both men and women can be equally liked. I encourage all couples to especially watch this movie, but even if you are not connected with someone, you can get some great ideas from Hitch. <br /> <br /> TWO WAYS OF THE BIG BIG !!!
