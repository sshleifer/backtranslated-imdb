This is exactly what Australian television and Australian politics needs, people with a sense of humor !!! Good on ABC to support these guys. The show is based on a pair of Australian guys who know how to remove mickey from politicians or other people in the spotlight. Boys use Sydney as their main base for sensation in society. Watch for Crazy Wharehouse Guy or Mr Ten Questions. The guys who perform these actions are the same guys who submitted to CNNN. If you like CNNNN and Glasshouse, you'll love this show. I am still interested to know which tricks are real and which are purely acting, because the guys did some dubious actions ...
