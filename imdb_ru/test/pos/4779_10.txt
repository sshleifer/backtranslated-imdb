Mickey Mouse is 75 years old. It was created by Walt Disney, the famous creator, producer, director, etc. I love Disney movies, because watching cartoons is very fun. In general, Walt Disney, I think, is the king of creations, everyone should love these creations and films of Walt Disney. Thanks to Walt for all the classic characters you made.
