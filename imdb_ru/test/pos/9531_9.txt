This weekend, “Railway Children” was shown again on TV, and I forgot how good it was. <br /> <br /> If I have criticism, then sometimes the episodic structure looks too clear, and the narrative is a little flow from sequence to sequence. However, the charm and beauty of the film are such that it means little. <br /> <br /> I will not return to the comments of others, except to add my vote for the final scene on the platform as possible, the only most emotional scene in the history of British cinema: being a cynical old bastard passing through the middle age rather quickly, I also find that I can not even think about this moment without being struck by a serious case “I have something in my eyes. "In fact, it's not just something in my eye, it moves around me too, with that beautiful happy pain that we sometimes feel. <br /> <br /> And Jenny Agutter was very beautiful in this film, standing with one foot in childhood and adolescence in femininity, and she brings to her the qualities that a girl should grow too fast. <br /> <br /> Plus quick praise to Bernard Cribbins. Recognized mainly as a light actor, he deftly created Perkov great humanity.
