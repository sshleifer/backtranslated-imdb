The Four Seasons Merchant is not at all what I would call a happy film, or even a film that hit me so much that he praised him to heaven (there are other Fassbinder films for this, for example, Veronica Voss and the underestimated Satan) . Brew). But this is certainly no less fascinating experiment in studying those in society that you, me and others we know, may know or don’t want to know. I believe that in the early 70s in Germany, one of the generations emerging from World War II had the stigma of living, but they tried their best to get by. This is a stigma that spreads throughout the film, and in many cases in Fassbinder’s work as a whole, but especially because at Four Seasons he looks at the middle class and at a special married couple — the distant, depressed, angry Hans. The fruit seller and his long-suffering wife are nothing more than a desire for realism disguised as a melodrama. If Cassavetis was a crazy German, he could have made this film, maybe just like a lark. <br /> <br /> The story sounds simple enough, when Hans' booze gets out of control, he beats his wife (this scene is one of the most difficult, perhaps in any film, the way Fassbinder’s camera lingers to no avail, because the wife remains helpless, and their daughter tries to stop him in madness), and then she is ready to leave him. When he stands in the room, her family holds him back, she calls for a divorce, and he gets a heart attack right there. He is recovering, his business suddenly begins to flourish with some help from good (or not so good) employees - and yet this only continues his longing for another woman and his despair in general. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is in this simplicity that Fassbinder tries and in most cases succeeds in achieving a mood of fear, a tense atmosphere in the kitchen, in the bedroom or on the street, which can be cut with a knife and bleed. The weakest part of all this is acting ... at least that was my initial impression. Hans, played by Hirschmüller, can be stilted, only with the slightest movements on his face and eyes, and for a while it seems that he is not a very good actor. The actress who plays his wife Irm Hermann and her sister (Fassbinder Hanna Shigulla) feels better, but only because they are given to do more traditionally, for example, to cry or look worried. It takes some time to adapt to what, in essence, is the emptiness in his boyfriend Hans, something from his own psychological torment or self-pity that permeate him and those around him who just want to gain some a sense of normality especially after Hans succeeds. <br /> <br /> In the “Four Seasons Merchant,” not everything merged together, but this was enough for me to recommend it to those who are looking for another piece of life than you could use with more modern American films. The world of Fassbinder here is a battle between the melodrama he loves in the movies and the cruel, crushing feeling of humanism that he feels personally and invests in the characters with whom, one way or another, we somehow identify ourselves. Is Epps a family you know about? Or could you be them? Who will say This is a methodical investigation of the tragic emptiness in the human spirit, and all its goals have been achieved.
