It surprises me that production companies will sue for reproductions that they will not supply. I have been looking for this film on DVD for a long time, and VHS - for years. You can get all kinds of movies online ... old movies, new movies ... but all of this is meant for a specific group. This film is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Perhaps, if enough people write, the copyright holder will receive a hint. It's time for this to happen. Yes, this is the date, but also the Wizard of Oz. It doesn't seem like it should be that hard. So for now, Iâ€™ll see these illegal copies in the search engines, like many others.
