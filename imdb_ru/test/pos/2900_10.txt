I bet I watch this film 4 or 5 times a year, and I will do it more often, now that the magnates Hollivire have found it necessary to burn it on DVD, because this is Classic with a capital "C"! This film is timeless! How can people pay $ 10.00 now to see Junk coming out of Hollyweird, with films like “Egyptian”; TEN COMMANDMENTS; BEN HUR; CAPTAIN NEWMAN MD on tape; DVD; and cable movie channels; I could go on forever, but this film is so big, and for the relatively unknown, Edmund Purdom wears a film like Atlas Bore the World. The story is beautiful, the acting is great, and the graphics at the end are so powerful that you sit in your place for a few minutes, just trying to let the words sink! Really movie knockout. I would give it 15 stars if they allowed me! They no longer make them like that, But they should !!!!!
