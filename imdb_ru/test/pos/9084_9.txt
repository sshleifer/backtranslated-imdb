A film that shows the awkwardness of modern men and women in life when they are faced with death. We are beyond simple religious belief in the afterlife, and even more so in any hell or paradise. Religion declared dead. And yet, more than ever, people are obsessed with death, especially since we can push it away for a long time. Moreover, the scientific and technological development of our societies makes us believe that we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. It was quite typical for the end of the 20th century. Today everything is changing, especially when the President of the United States, Barack Obama himself, in a public speech to journalists, talks about his search for truth and qualifies this truth as, of course, relative, because it is more a search than a final end, goal or achievement. The film shows the end of the good old metaphysical thinking, which began to turn into an obsessive idea of ​​the truth, an obsessive concept that the truth was unique and irreversibly attainable. Postmodernism has not yet reached Hollywood, although today it seems to have reached the White House. Therefore, some young doctors and medical students decide to go to their death and return. Technically it is possible, but the result is not surprising. It restores the old feelings of guilt and frustration that were buried unconscious. One of them is connected with the father-drug addict of Vietnam veterans who commits suicide, the other with a boy who was stoned by some others, including mortal, another one with a young black girl who became a victim of racism, sexism and hatred, if not fear of its shyness. It's so naive that you can cry with shame for these young people who are highly qualified and act like children who cry because of bottles of fruit juice. The film is interesting though, but in something completely different. The setting, shooting, and every single detail or processing of any detail is baroque, pathological, decadent, in the style of “Death in Venice” or Greenway, or some other works of art associated with friendship with the main enemy, who is death. Of course, this does not save the film, but at least makes it worthy of attention. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques CULARDO, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University of Versailles, Saint Quentin-en-Yvelines, CEGID
