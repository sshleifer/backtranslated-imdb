“Puppet Master Only With Terrible Roles” Yun-ki Zhong was the latest Korean horror film I had the pleasure of watching. This film, called “Inhyeongsa” in Asia, immediately struck me when I saw it reviewed online, with images that made me think of Puppet Master, Childs Play and other toys / doll-based horror films in the past. But for some reason I didn’t think .. “Boy, it will be tasteless,” I thought it would be creepy and fun. Horrible horror almost worked. <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly, but I like it, so everything was fine. The bill, almost as I found with Acacia, was beautiful and very much reminded me of the classic horrors of the past. I will not give much, but the story in this film was strong, and I highly recommend it to any fan of Asian HORROR. This is not extreme, it should not be taken seriously, but it is really good.
