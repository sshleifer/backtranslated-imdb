I saw the beginning of the Muppet film, but only half. Because I only looked at Mrs. Kelly’s friend’s house. The songs were the best, and the dolls were so fun. They will find out that if they believe in the end of the rainbow, anyone can do it, no matter how small it is, no matter how green it is (what was included in the trailer). <br /> <br /> Kermit is my favorite main character (which means that he describes the main character), like other dolls. Mel Brooks was awesome when playing professor Max Krassman. The scene where Miss Piggy saves Kermit by doing kung fu with these guys. It was so cool. <br /> <br /> The Muppet Film is Jim Henson's best movie with the most fun characters, and people will cherish his successful film.
