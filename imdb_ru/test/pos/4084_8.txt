I thought the film was good, but I like to read the real story behind the films “based on the real story.” Does anyone know the names and locations of the real characters on whom the movie is based? I did a complete search on the Internet and cannot find any information on this case. All I get is information about the film and the fact that it is based on a “real story.” It is hard for me to believe that the judge will change his sentence immediately in the courtroom, even after such a sincere speech by his brother (magnificent John Corbett), but overall the story was very exciting. In any case, if someone knows a real “true story,” I would appreciate it if you shared it!
