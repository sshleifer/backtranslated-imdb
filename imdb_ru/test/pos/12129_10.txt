"Let me ask you another question" Ha! how great soon .. this film was brilliantly fantastic acting, a great script. The only reason nobody noticed is that because of the low budget, everyone will agree with me that this is a cult, just like Donnie Brasco, which again shows young Joe Peski as a gangster, this film keeps up with cults. he had several sopranos, and in pursuit of good ideas, he got an idea of ​​the soprano when he watched this, and Scorsese found Joe Sands while watching, which proves that it should be great, I'm right or I'm wrong, but ? I have to admit that they showed one brilliant scene where they threw peanuts at the camp pianist "Stop with Frigg's Peanuts".
