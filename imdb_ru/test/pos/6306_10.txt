I have seen this movie so many times, it’s so good. Maybe because I can relate to the lifestyle of Tittas, and there is a reason. Not everyone will find this to taste. Also my Italian improves after every viewing. Am i sad case Thank you Mr. Sorrentino. I look forward to your next movie. Although I have not seen the movie in the cinema, I have a DVD, and I would advise to buy it. The extra feature alone is worth its price. The time the director spends making a film is very rarely appreciated, the extra DVD content gives an excellent idea of ​​making the film. As for the history of the film, I am biased. I am delighted with this with all my friends, but, as I have already said, I am very strong towards the main character, who is a loner in a situation that he does not choose himself. , The Sicilian Mafia uses Titta to launder its money in a Swiss bank. He is indebted to them for costing them millions of dollars back in a stock market transaction that went wrong. Love Kills.
