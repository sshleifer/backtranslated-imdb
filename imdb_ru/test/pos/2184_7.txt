This TV show of the classic musical "Sweeney Todd" does not make a staged production, but still very exciting. <br /> <br /> First, the most enjoyable aspect of this version is the staged design, which sounds from a multidisciplinary system. Install a striking hatch. Then the setting is excellent, right down to the cut. <br /> <br /> The main drawback here is in the speeches that people give. Oh, they are believable, everything is in order - but it is rather offensive when no one seems to hit their cues in a song that is as fast-paced as, say, “Kiss Me”. In fact, the actress who plays Johanna is not only not in tempo, but also a little out of sorts. And Angela Lansbury's slightly overdone Cockney accent is a bit annoying. And one more thing - what exactly is so bad in the performance of Judge Turpin "Johanna", that it is prohibited in the American theater, but not in the hymn of the cannibal "The Little Priest"? <br /> <br /> Otherwise these are great products. It is very nice to see how people do what they love - and I don’t even talk about "meat pie with a twist."
