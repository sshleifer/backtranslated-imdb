The return of Batman is more gothic and gloomier than his predecessor, and I like it very much. In addition, the landscape is darker, and the whole situation is sad along with the heartbreaking music written by such a talented Danny Elfman. <br /> <br /> However, I didn’t like the idea of ​​making Penguin a monster, unlike comics, where he is human. Even if he looks like a monster, he shows well that he has human dignity, and I was very sorry for him when he saw the gravestones of his late parents. But in fact, he was in fact a dangerous villain, and he needed to be stopped. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton performed a “tour de force”, returning as the Dark Knight, and this time he is as strong as the original Batman. It is easy to understand why he is sometimes called Batman in public ... <br /> <br /> In addition, Michelle Pfeiffer is so sexy and fits well with her role, and she truly played the role of the villainous female criminal. dressed like a cat. Indeed, the actors did all the masterful work with The Return of Batman, which made him a successful film. <br /> <br /> If you liked Batman, watch his stunning sequel, because he is very worthy of all the evil heroes of the Dark Knight. lovers. <br /> <br /> Steve Bailjaron
