This film promises a lot, but gives little. The main problem is connected with the inclusion of the character Charlotte Gainsburg in this film. In no case did immigrants from Sicily need a red-haired Anglo - the cinema might need it, but new citizens, of course, did not need it. In my opinion, the decision to include it destroys the continuity of the film. This is of particular concern, as it seems that it demeans not only the characters of the film, but also the history of immigration. The immigrants themselves were heroic figures, quite capable of doing without the need to satisfy what I believe was a veiled way of the “burden of the white man.” Interestingly, someone will shoot a film about Irish immigrants, in which the main character will be a Sicilian woman? The “Left Elbow” index considers seven aspects of filming, performances, dialogue, artistic skill, film continuity, plot and character development - ranging from 10 points for excellent, 5 to medium and 1 for help. The continuity of the film and the speed of the plot are low 1. The continuity mentioned above is further aggravated by a surreal ending. Doesn't a film of such important historical significance deserve more than a conclusion reminiscent of Marc Chagall? The plot is quite simple, until it gets entangled in too much time in the old country, too little time on the ship and too much emphasis on the ending. Acting skills and character development are average because all the characters are fixed throughout the film, and the inclusion of the Anglo-Saxon language, which is spoken in perfect English, practically turns the film into a satire. Where is Groucho when you need him? Production kits, dialogues and artistry are very good, each is rated at 10. The kits in Sicily, on the ship and on Ellis Island are as good as you can find. The dialogue is marvelous, and the ethical singing is superb. I agree with Scorsese that it is pleasant to listen to the Sicilian dialect. Note that immigrants talk about "America" ​​and not about the "United States" - the ideal versus political reality. There are many good art scenes with dreams of America, rainy gold coins and giant vegetables among the best. The average index of the left elbow is 5.25, rising to 7.0, when it is equated to the IMDb scale. It seems that another concept permeates the experience of Ellis Island: the disasters of immigration passes were exhausting; later, in 2006, all that was needed was to pay the owner of the coyote or boat and sneak into the county in the dark of night, without question! The film is worth seeing, but what he sees is problematic.
