Giant Robot was the most popular Japanese TV show ever seen on Indian television. It was focused on children, and for the first time in our life we ​​saw a robot. <br /> <br /> Many Indian children must have even seen the car for the first time outside of school textbooks. <br /> <br /> The series also showed a child in an adult organization fighting evil. Undoubtedly, many of us who saw Giant Robot in our childhood yearn for our own robots and look at our computers in the same way as a temporary stop mechanism. <br /> <br /> This show also depicts perfect adults (meaning Jerry, girlfriend Johnny, and leader of the unicorn Azuma). We began to respect Japan’s progress and still see Japan as an ideal Asian country. <br /> <br /> By the way, there were no satellite channels in India at that time, and the state-owned broadcaster did not show most of the Disney cartoons. I suppose that this is exactly how children's TV shows, such as the giant robot, have been appreciated. Currently, there are Pokemon, etc., But they are not as exciting or attractive as a giant robot.
