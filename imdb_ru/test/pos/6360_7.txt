"The Couch Trip" is one of those stupid comedies they released in the 80s. In this case, Dan Aykroyd plays a mental patient who is a psychiatrist, and he goes to Beverly Hills to replace Charles Grodin. Much of the filmâ€™s humor stems from their satirical glance at Beverly Hills and the empty life of the people there (a woman struggles for power with her handmaid). <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you just watch to have a good time. Do not expect any religious experience. But you are most likely to laugh at how people from Beverly Hills flaunt their wealth. Also starring Walter Mattau, Donna Dixon, Arieh Gross and Victoria Jackson (from "UHF").
