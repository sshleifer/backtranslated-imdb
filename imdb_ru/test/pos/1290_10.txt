Christopher Nolan’s first feature film struck critics who saw him when he first came out. Filmed with a microbudget of $ 6,000, this is a student film with a real class. The film is shot in black and white, and it represents people who you think are friends of Nolan's appearance in the film. This does not mean that they are bad actors, because they are pretty good. You could see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Howe appearing in other projects, but, unfortunately, they haven't been there since it was done 6 years ago. <br /> <br /> Thriller Nolan, like Memento, does not play chronologically, he changes the scene around just like reading. The letter is fantastic. This is a great cool thriller, but because of the displacement of the temporal order of the film, it becomes even more interesting. I thought that the last ten minutes, in particular, when everything became clear, were excellent. <br /> <br /> For a movie with such a small budget and no recognizable names at all, this is so good. It surpasses most of what Hollywood studios offer, and Nolan after three films (this “Excellent souvenir” and “Not quite good, but still great insomnia”) secured the most exciting new talent of late. I can't wait for Batman. <br /> <br /> This movie is short and cute, and, of course, a great watch. It is very professional, and the turns are fantastic and absolutely amazing. I also thought that David Julian's rating was also excellent, very atmospheric and had a cold quality. He continued to compose other Nolan films. <br /> <br /> In general, I would recommend this, I'm going to get all the Nolan films. This is a low cost gem. ***** <br /> <br />
