Based on a true story. . <br /> <br /> The purpose of this film is to illustrate that with the help of quite normal events, a seemingly “worthy” mother can be drawn into heroin addiction. <br /> <br /> *** spoiler *** Some scenes are pretty inaccurate, while others almost make you want to "fix" yourself. <br /> <br /> A computer technician / graphic artist, a woman with a good relationship with her young teenager, turns into an addiction to a work colleague who is “cheerful” (someone who can accept + enjoy it from time -) Then develops into a dependency, which ultimately leads to the fact that it interrupts the "street" dealers after losing contact with its regular dealer. br /> <br /> Scenes that show that she comes down and "gets sick" are often VERY real - especially the first real "night sweat." Prior to all these events, she started a relationship with a boy who, as it turned out, lost his wife to a bottle, and insists that he has an internal radar to avoid such women. Some kind of radar! However, after some late turns and strange behavior, the guy challenges her about "what's going on." His radar starts to get more information and demands that she empty her bag; she hits the roof and crashes. <br /> <br /> Because of the beautiful and open relationship that she had developed before this tragedy, he was the first to “find” some real evidence in her bag; Then he inspects the hose for its “hiding place” - obviously, its sensitivity is related to school lessons on drug use - and when he finds a large cache in the bathroom, he drops it! NOT A HAPPY WOMAN when she takes her next bath and she "disappears." <br /> <br /> The kid holds one back and lays it on the table for food - then she goes to further denial - recognizes this and says that there is no worse than dope. <br /> <br /> A child does everything right, calls his friends and, as a rule, puts her in a position in which she must come "clean" - if you forgive the pun. <br /> <br /> The film introduces the viewer to rather difficult situations when danger is not far off. <br /> <br /> She is even helped by a professional organization, and she makes a cold turkey — you’ll have to watch a movie to see what happens next. ,,,
