This is one of the few films of this type that I watched and which I liked. While Clint Eastwood is on its own, shared history works well, even within Washington, DC. <br /> <br /> Topic: the killer is watching the president, and only one person can save him. <br /> <br /> It is not easy to make a film that is popular with viewers these days, with the participation of this arena. This film is successful on several levels. Eastwood is his usual underrated hero who wants to save the president since the days of Kennedy. He succeeds in this role, as does his rank, Ren√© Rousseau (FBI agent). In general, he is well done and tense with additional stars for Malkovich. 9/10.
