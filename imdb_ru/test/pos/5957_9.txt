I just saw this movie last night, and I must say that I loved every minute. If you take in the spirit of parodies of Bond Esq. Films, itâ€™s really better. The real comedy in the film is a blatant disregard for political correctness. Misogyny, cultural insensitivity and almost ridiculous machismo films of this genre are used for a great comic effect. He also calls for illogical and formulaic elements to the task: the OSS 117 agent constantly insanely quickly studies complex things (such as Arabic and how to play the traditional instrument), while losing some pathetically obvious clues. Some lines from the movie made me laugh for several hours after the movie was finished ... and I must say that I learned some ... interesting ... French vocabulary that would probably irritate professors if i use In general, I think this film is excellent. Very funny and the first film I've ever seen that truly parodies all aspects of a spy movie.
