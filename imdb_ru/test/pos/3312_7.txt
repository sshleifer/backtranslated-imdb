Although this film is outdated, it is definitely worth seeing. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when he opened up, and it changed my life ... I just had to live in New York. It has great initial shots of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis singing "Romance is still ... the best of all ...", which compete with those of West Side Story. The world's first REAL Supermodel, Susie Parker (sorry for this, Janice D.), is playing rather unnaturally, but this is amazing! He also offers some insight into the American mores of the late 1950s — our obsession with sex (and repression) of sex (in the workplace, no less!), Romance and marriage before women's freedom. It represents the era in which New York was at its best, and Joan Crawford’s super-bitchy performance was just icing on the cake.
