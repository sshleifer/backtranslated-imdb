Quite obviously, many of your nights were spent alone. If you watched the 5 minutes of the show itself instead of watching ads, you would see one of the greatest television shows in Canadian history. It is a pity that you would watch it alone. Probably the reason you hate it ... no game. The keys to the VIP are funny, light and funny. The guys are going to eat this show. I have a tense game, and I can't wait to get on this show. The chicks were HOOOOOT, and the clubs kicked their ass. I will look every week. It makes me wonder why such great shows as this one are not made. Now it is clear that talent in Canada is capable of producing high-quality American television.
