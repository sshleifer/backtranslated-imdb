Despite everything said about the subject and the contradictions that surrounded him, please do not forget what I consider the most important part of the film: the obvious struggle of everyone to maintain their pride in their ordeals. Regardless of whether a self-styled male braggadosio, a sexual awakening, or even life itself, is involved in every person.
