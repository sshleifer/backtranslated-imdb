If you could award 10+ .... it would be one movie that I would choose. <br /> <br /> I remember shooting this movie on TV many, many years ago, and, fortunately, I was prepared enough to make this video. Now my video copy is getting old, the video technology is outdated, and I'm starting to worry that maybe I won't be able to enjoy the pleasures of this film for much longer. <br /> <br /> Like a wildlife movie, this is superb. Like a film about the relationship between man and nature, it surpasses everything that was shown before or after. How can the film industry allow such a classic to go unnoticed and forgotten? If there is such a thing as a lobby group to push for the re-release of this film, count me and send me the details immediately. <br /> <br /> I suggest that mint should be made anyone can republish it in today's market.
