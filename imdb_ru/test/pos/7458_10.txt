For some reason I always liked animated ducks: Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, Daffy Duck, Donald Duck. Although none of them are as insane as Dackman. Initially, the broadcast between 1994 and 1997 lasted a total of 70 episodes, but it could go on forever without becoming stale. <br /> <br /> The title character is a disorderly, uncompromising, sloppy, and largely the worst living person in the world. World. He is a private detective, widower, peeping tom, alcoholic, sex maniac, murderer, (fill in the form). You name it, Duckman did it. But who can blame him for being so weak-minded when the world in which he / we live is so insane, outrageous and just pointless? Eric Tiberius Dackman (voiced by manic Jason Alexander) could carry the whole show himself, but when he is surrounded by a bunch of eccentric characters supporting you, you just know that trouble just waits for an explosion at every opportunity. My favorite should be Willibald Feivel Kornfed (or simply Pig Kornfed), an incredibly imperturbable assistant to Dackman, who would seem to be talented and highly qualified in everything and constantly forgets about his partnerâ€™s infinity of vices and incompetence. <br /> <br /> a typical conspiracy will include some strange case when it inevitably fails or revolves around its extremely dysfunctional family, although from time to time the sworn enemy of the King Chicken (Tim Curry) Dakman, a kind of professor Moriarty in the form of a bird, bears some kind of devilish scheme of revenge for bullying in high school. <br /> <br /> Since I was a teenager, it was my favorite animated show, better than The Simpsons, Family Guy, and even King of the Hill. Nothing will ever surpass it. There has never been and never will be anything like Duckman. The level of satire, observant humor and writing is so harsh that it is lethal, and the animation is done in this unique style of Klaski / Chupo (anyone who has seen Rougrats will understand) This is a wonderful, very creative and wild world, and all this with the nuristic feeling of the 1940s. <br /> <br /> This particular bird is never too much.
