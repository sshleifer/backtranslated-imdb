Howard (Kevin Kline) teaches English at a high school in the small city of Indiana. Finally he marries Emily (Joan Cusack), much to the delight of her parents. The city is also buzzing because one of his, Cameron (Matt Dillon) was nominated for an acting Oscar. Everyone, including Howard and Emily, watches the Academy Awards on TV, as Cameron is declared the winner! In his welcome speech, Cameron announces that he was able to fulfill his role as a military gay, in part thanks to the lessons he received from a gay teacher that he had in high school. You guessed it, Howard! But Howard never “quit”; in fact, he thinks he's straight! With the whole city and media representatives waiting and watching the events, Howard and Emily go ahead and get married? Or is Howard really gay and realizes that he cannot complete the ceremony? This is a wonderful, funny and humane film about gays and their situations. As a man who did not understand, he was gay, Kline is excellent and touching. The rest of the cast is equally good, with Cusack Stitch as a mixed bridegroom, and Dillon, Bob Newhart, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck and others are on hand to please the audience. The costumes are very good, and the setting in the beautiful heart of Indiana is beautiful. In addition, the script, direction and staging are very, very good. But an insightful, humorous and thoughtful look at homosexuals is undoubtedly the best asset of the film. For those who will be offended by a gay movie, yes, just skip this one. But for anyone who wants to laugh heartily and at the same time better understand the situation with gays, this is definitely the best movie.
