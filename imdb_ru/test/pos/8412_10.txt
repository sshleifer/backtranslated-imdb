I did not read the Scarlett book, and when I watched this mini-series, I really liked it, and I thought that it should not be compared with GWTW. The story may differ from the book, but who cares about its film. Even in credits it is based on a book, it is not a book. The film is clearly underestimated because of the reviews that other people write, but cannot even correctly write the names of the main characters. <br /> <br /> Scarlett's acting, in my opinion, was excellent. Joan Wally and Timothy Dalton were excellent. They took the characters and gave them a touch. Now that other people pass by, they compare them to the great Vivian Lee and Clark Gable. They obviously made fiction, but the main roles in this film are completely different people who have their own acting techniques, and they should not be crushed by what they say. If you wanted some actors to succeed, then you should have made the film, I’m sure that other actors would not have done as well as those who brought them to these roles. The supporting cast stood out for its grandeur, and Jean Smart steals scenes that pour into her with his comedy genius. <br /> <br /> The places in the film were very beautiful, and it was just great to see Scarlett go to all those places in the film, how she causes trouble and other things. Also the scene in which Scarlett talks to her father’s grave was very dramatic, and since then I thought there are two GREAT actresses who brought Scarlett O'Hara to her senses. Not only Vivian Lee, but also Joanne Wally. <br /> <br /> The film and the book may differ, but you don’t have to take to heart that this is a continuation of one of the best films ever made, otherwise you will think that it should be like Gone With the Wind and you will not like this movie. But this is an underrated classic, unlike GWTW, of its own film. Also keep in mind that "Tomorrow is another day" ...
