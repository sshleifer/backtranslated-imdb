It was a terrific movie with incredibly realistic flight scenes! I saw it several times, and it always held my attention. I myself am a big fan of the Air Force and I love to watch any film where I can see the flight of the F-16. If you like Top Gun, then I guarantee that you will enjoy this movie. With the exception of a few soft expletives, this is a great movie for the whole family. He has a great plot and there is no boring moment throughout the film. Every second is filled with action and keeps you on the edge of your place, waiting for what comes next. So once again, I STRONGLY recommend this movie !!!
