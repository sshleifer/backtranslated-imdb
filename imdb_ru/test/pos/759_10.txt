I had to get this movie, since it did not come to where I live. I waited patiently, and it was worth the wait. I totally fell in love with this movie. You could see the chemistry between Walters and Grint, as they also worked together on the Harry Potter films. The woman who plays his powerful, righteous mother really convinced me that I was right, and how hypocritical she is, I think she does an excellent job playing a role. I would just like us to see a sex scene or even more. LOL, but of course we just have to use our imagination to understand how this happened. (giggles) I totally thought that the film was worth the wait, and if you want to watch a good movie. Hire this movie. I have to say that Rupert really did a great job, and it's nice to see him starring in films outside of Harry Potter, although I totally love him as Ron Weasley. The whole cast has done a great job, and I hope that Rupert continues to act outside of Harry Potter to expand his skills!
