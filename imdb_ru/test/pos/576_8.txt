I give it 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic. It is also directed by the legendary sasquat hunter Robert W. Morgan, who also plays the role of Jarvis in the film. Listening to a recent blogtalkradio show called AARF show (Robert Morgan is co-host), he says that since he has become such a cult classic and succeeds in film conferences and the like, there are plans to possibly continue he said that two of the original stars have signed up, and he hopes to get some more. Robert is a good man, and I hope that is good. He dedicated more than 50 years of tireless work as a Sassquatch researcher (which is also one of my interests) and author. Watch his paranormal show and maybe look for Blood Stalkers II in the near future.
