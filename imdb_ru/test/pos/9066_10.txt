Saw it at the Newport Beach Film Festival the other day. The film is really exceptional. The crowd with which I went, everyone liked. Fun, sharp and great acting. I'm tired of tried and true Hollywood novels, who can tell? David Krumholz (Max) is really amazing, as a loyal and true fan of ultra-screw Grace (Natasha Lonn, who is also superb). When Max falls in love with Grace, we believe in it. What for? Because love at first sight is crazy, and we are dealing with two lost, and maybe not such crazy souls. Jullmo Diaz as Hector and Rosanna Arquette as the asexual / sexual neurotic, both Max and Grace's room mates, should also be noted before going on a trip to Sheboygen, Wisconsin, and finding themselves. Do not miss this, this is something special! Postscript Soundtrack under the guidance of Kevin Hearn (celebrity Bare Naked Ladies) is really very cool.
