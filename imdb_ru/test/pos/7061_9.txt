Watching this movie always reminds me of how I remember summer, God! so long ago the whole “overnight” scene, from a canoe rally to the end of the trip, is priceless, and Tripper’s story about a killer maniac is an urban legend straight from my youth. A very interesting film, made many times better by the terrible sequels that followed.
