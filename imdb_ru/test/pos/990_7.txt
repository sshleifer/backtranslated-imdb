Although I am very familiar with the poet Dylan Thomas, I do not know anything about his life. Whatever his life, and especially his marriage, I would suggest that “The Land of Love” (based on the novel) manipulates things a little, but if you are not a historian or a poet who cares. <br /> <br /> The film is less about Thomas and more focused on the two most important women in his life. One is his wife Catherine, and the other is Vera, which was his first love. One romantic night on the beach for young people is what they both tried to leave behind, but they can't, now that they have grown up, they are good friends. I forgot to mention that this happens during a war. Vera is engaged to captain Will Killing, who becomes pregnant and goes to war. While he is gone, Vera again begins to fall in love with Thomas, and Catherine fell out of love with him. She also carries the child of another man. The situation becomes even more emotionally complex when Captain Killig returns <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is a very soapy opera story, and it takes shape in a fabulously slow style, perhaps with one too large sequence of juicy dialogue. But all is not lost. For non-Hollywood productions, I think Edge of Love is as stylish a picture as possible. This is certainly more voluminous and clever than about 90% of modern romances, Hollywood production or not. This is partly due to what happens during the war, which causes an emotional conflict that seems more convincing and less artificial, a bit like the Atonement. This one shows acting and cinematography equal in talent to Joe Wright’s nominee nominee, but it needs more sustained stimulation and progression. Everything is good at the beginning and at the end, but in the middle part you can check your concentration, if only you are not deeply and deeply rooted in history. <br /> <br /> I doubt that “The Edge of Love” will have such an impact on the viewer, but this is a good movie to test. it might even make a good movie the dates of the night, believing that it is much smarter than the chicken clicks that guys have to endure today.
