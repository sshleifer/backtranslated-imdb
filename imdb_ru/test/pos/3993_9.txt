Not surprisingly, this film was made by me at the time when it was. I studied the early beauty and tragedy of the life of the Chosun dynasty in Seoponye and delightfully studied the famous Korean folktale in Chunhian, which included the last two films. What is most surprising is that Chi Hwa Seon, his 2002 proposal, is not presented in the pansory style of those two previous films. <br /> <br /> However, an experienced hand passed me. Together we explore the life of a real person: an artist of the late nineteenth century, the Joseon Dynasty, who rides on the edge of modernity, but who is not noble and who, because of this, causes a sensation in modern Korean society with its fame and its public and artistic expression of contempt for the old the Korean nobility and its contempt for potential Japanese ruling colonies. The artist Chang Syun Up, popularly known as “O Vaughn” (superbly performed by Choi Min Sik, the famous star of the already legendary “Old Boy” Pak Chan Wook), is becoming more influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film. A modern Korean audience will support such a hero, despite the fact, or perhaps because he was so ostracized at the time. I have a sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in the story remains intact. I am a master in capturing the past features of his country, and in this film he almost surpasses himself. As expected in the movie “I”, the cinema is breathtaking, the editing is accurate, the plot is central. <br /> <br /> Plots are set against Sung Up, family ties are checked and broken, allegedly scandalous behavior occurs (and sometimes really) to bring down the person who “painted the fire”. But despite all the difficulties of my detailed, but sometimes confusing story about the life of the Son of Ap, the Son of Ap has somehow managed to survive. He becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy the famous Chinese paintings after only one glance. Art dealers and agents then besiege it and try to make money on "Oh, won." In other words, lines of people are starting to form that want to take advantage of the real Seung Up, an artistic star. But he refuses to manipulate. His mind in preventing massive hordes and imperial lackeys impresses the audience, if not the cast. <br /> <br /> What does Seung Up think? He has powerful emotions and opinions about painting, such as the aesthetic belief that pictures are living beings and are never truly finished. He despises those who try to turn art into profit. And he doesn’t care about politicians who use their power to bring artistic beauty around them, and then throw away the artist as a traitor. But he also believes that painting plays an important role in future shocks. Horrible scenes involving foreign invaders from France and Japan are presented. I am a subscription historical epic motif, and its influence in the world remains in a prominent place in this multimillion epic. <br /> <br /> The main character causes more grief for himself and those who care about him when he refuses to draw. This is when the story acquires a completely new meaning, which is not only political, but also social. I deal with issues laudably realistic. <br /> <br /> He, O Vaughn, becomes the figure of Jesus. People believe that he is capable of creative miracles, and the government believes that he needs his artistic support, but the main character remains extremely independent and contemptuous of what others want him to do or have been. In the end, both the government and the people attacked Seung Up as they did right from the Bible. His holiness becomes man; his humanity is not accepted; he dies for the sins of ordinary people, art historians, politicians, pursuing him (or runs away from them). <br /> <br /> But he died? As with most of my films, the question remains. In that case, did the Son of Ap become an immortal hermit? The film does not resolve this issue; it simply represents a possible end for a real man, Chung Sean Up or O Won. Death is not depicted, because death is not known. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to find fault with this film, but I have become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in his culture that when he does this, it is no longer surprising. As usual for my films, cinematography, editing and writing are all supreme. This is a well-developed film, filled with an incredible ability to tell stories. Of course, he can be the best in this thanks to the ancient Korean musical art Pansori. Nevertheless, the film contains fragments of this remarkable artistic form, and at the end the audience feels as if they have become involved in a great, inexpressible story. And they have it, because it is, for sure, I am a gift.
