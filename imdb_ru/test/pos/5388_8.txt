I may be different from many people on this board, but I like to watch Mind Of Mencia. The reason I like Mind Of Mencia is because the moderator is not afraid to express his opinion or use stereotypes. Carlos Mencia does what we all do with our friends, but we don’t want to admit, and then some. <br /> <br /> Mencia jokes with no problems about any race, religion, gender or orientation. While he gets a lot of noise for this, it is a breath of fresh air in these politically correct times. Mencia doesn’t care if he offends anyone, but he’s not racist and even joking about his race. <br /> <br /> A typical format of Mensia’s Mind is as follows: there will be an open parody of a person’s fun or a recent event. Then Mencia comes out and gets up for 5 or 6 minutes, where he talks about various problems. The show then has 2 separate parodies divided by advertising. In these scenes, Mencia does different things, for example, she makes fun of people, makes a funny presentation of her personal opinion, or simply parodies people, events or movies. At the end of the show, Mencia comes out for a minute with one final parody or something else to say. <br /> <br /> People criticize Mencia for using stereotypes and say that his statements are excessively offensive. Carlos only does what everyone else thinks about certain races, but is afraid to say. As for insulting Mencia, he speaks only with his mind. I find nothing wrong with that. <br /> <br /> The show is not perfect. A parody may not be the best, and sometimes Mencia crosses the line in his jokes. For the most part, however, this is a show in which the comedian says what's on his mind, no matter what the consequences are and what he represents on a humorous question. Therefore, if you are not afraid to laugh at stereotypes and see someone express their opinions and often say what you want to say, then watch Mind Of Mencia. However, if you are easily offended, you should not watch this show, because you will be offended or worse, but you can even laugh.
