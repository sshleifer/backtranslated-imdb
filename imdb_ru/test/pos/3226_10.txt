This show is my favorite. This show is smart, interesting and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is beautiful in the role of Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines as beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore, and Keiko Ajena is Rory's one-of-a-kind best friend, Lane Kim. I like the witty dialogue, this is what makes it unique in the show. Kelly Bishop is great as Emily Gilmore, and Edward Herrman is like Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is happy because Luke Danes and the band are one of a kind. The community, Miss Patty, Babette, Mrs. Kim, Taylor Daws, Kirk and others always laugh loudly, funny, bizarre and interesting, which always highlights bright like-minded people. This show has changed so much over the years that it will never become old. Gilmore Girls is an original and clever show that makes you watch. That's how good it is. I put this show at a rating of 10/10.
