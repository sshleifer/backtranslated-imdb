What can be said about this movie? This movie is just great. A real feast for the eyes. Just as the game set the standard for role-playing 3D games 7 years ago, this film sets the standard for future CG films. Many of you have seen trailers and amazing details in every frame, and let me tell you that this film does not disappoint. In fact, you can see the fibers in the vest of the Cloud Sweater. <br /> <br /> The music is also very good. The film contains several reorganized video game tracks that fans will surely recognize and appreciate. <br /> <br /> The filmâ€™s main weakness is its history. This is not really a bad story, but this story is intended exclusively for people who played video games. For the first time, viewers may sometimes feel lost or overlook the significance of certain events. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to everyone, even if you have never played this game, because we have a special film. Watch it and enjoy the wonderful show.
