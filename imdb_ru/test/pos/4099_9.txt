Indeed, this film should be released on DVD. I just got a bootleg copy of what I thought was a studio movie, and I was very pleased !!! It was on my list of films to have simply because of the actors. Three of my PEOPLE, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both were in Romeo and Juliet, as well as in John Gilgud. sorry for the bad spelling was there, so alone I thought that for the small amount I spend, it will be fine. The boy was right. I'm not going to disclose any of this, you may already know the story, but I will just say if you can get a copy in ANY format ... Do it! JPC
