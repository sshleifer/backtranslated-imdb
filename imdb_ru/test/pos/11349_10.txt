The most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of the film, not beautiful main actors. This is not their outstanding acting and amazing chemistry. <br /> <br /> For me, this is an erroneous scene of the entire film. Settings, lighting, props ... all this adds a mood of love between the main characters. Inhaling the smoke from Cho's cigarette tells us about his state of mind, the constantly changing close Lizhen cheongsams reflect the limitations in making decisions, the ruins of Angkor Wat are associated with a deterioration in the relationship between the two leads. /> <br /> The excellent use of the mis-en-scene gives the film exactly the feeling that is needed to clarify the complex nature of the characters' relationships. The film leaves the audience barren desire for more.
