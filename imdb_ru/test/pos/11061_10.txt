I first saw this film when I was in elementary school, back in the 1960s. I was fascinated by the character Ingrid Bergman, and this was my acquaintance with the French Quarter of New Orleans. The first part of the film is the best, since it returns to take revenge on the wife and daughter of her father (her mother was expelled in disgrace). During this time, she meets the wonderful Clint Maron, played by Gary Cooper. The chemistry between them is great. The second half of the film takes place in Saratoga, New York (Saratoga from the title), and I never get as much pleasure from this as in New Orleans, but it is still very good. I give this film ten - partly because of nostalgia, but mostly because itâ€™s just a damn good movie, and the characters besides Bergman and Cooper are equally wonderful (Flora Robson is close to stealing scenes from Bergman). Previously, it was periodically shown on television, but rarely, if ever, it would be nice if one of the classic film stations took it into service and included it in their programming cycles.
