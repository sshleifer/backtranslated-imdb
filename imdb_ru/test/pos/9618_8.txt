Five fingers of death: although the previous epics of the martial arts "Show" showed the influence of the genre of the American cowboy, none of them paid him such an open tribute as this, especially on the battlefield scene in the saloon. And although the films "Brothers Show" borrowed from the genre of the Japanese Chambara (sword fighting) before, none of them did it so successfully as this one. I believe that this is due to the fact that the director came from Korea and thus brought a non-Chinese perspective into such borrowings, which undoubtedly raises some interesting questions about culture; but in any case, this film presented real innovations in technology and technology in Hong Kong action films. For the first time in Hong Kong, the camera gained access to the entire set, which meant pictures from different points of view, for example, a low-angle snapshot showing the ceiling of the room (the original American innovation of which is usually credited to John Ford), or a long shot angle, which allowed to visualize a large plot of land, or frontal tracking shot. <br /> <br /> It is true that this was not the first hand-to-hand shot. combat film with a real cinematic plot, which remains the "Chinese boxer" Wang Yu; but on the commercial level Shaw Bros. were right in choosing “Five Fingers” as their first major release for the West, because, one might say, it was the “least Chinese” of their militants, that is, the least dependent on purely Chinese theatrical traditions. Although it did not make any impression on American critics at the time (who ruined the picture everywhere), it was not lost to the American audience, especially among African Americans, whose culture has always been - by necessity - an eclectic blanket of borrowed elements and innovation. In “Five Fingers”, they were given the opportunity to uncover the essence of the story: a serious young man was forced to make additional efforts to overcome social barriers and betrayal in order to acknowledge his merit. This seems to be a universal problem for modernity, but each culture has its own way of expression and solution; Five Fingers represented him as many Americans could treat him as well as the Chinese. <br /> <br /> So now the film has only historical value? Of course not. First, this problem has not disappeared. Secondly, some innovations make most of the film today as fresh as in the first release. Also, the action is well delivered, and the actions, although a bit too serious, are clear. The film may be too long, but the story does cover a lot of questions. And there are amazing scenery, such as the confrontation of the salon, the struggle on the way to the competition, a strange double final. <br /> <br /> definitely looks better on a theater screen, but still impressive for home viewing: recommended.
