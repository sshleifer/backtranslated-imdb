I saw this film at the Rotterdam Film Festival and was pleasantly surprised. The photo is so stylish and beautiful, and the story is not an ordinary film about the mafia, in fact, this storyline is mostly in the background. It is rather a personal journey of a middle-aged man who has fallen into the trap of existence for which he was forced to live. The actor, Tony Servillo, is great, he surpasses this "quiet man." The girl, Olivia Magnani, the granddaughter of the Italian actress Anna Magnani and corresponds to the family name. <br /> <br /> If you expect your typical Italian film, where everyone shouts at each other in a large family, this is not your movie. You are no ordinary cliche, and it is definitely worth seeing.
