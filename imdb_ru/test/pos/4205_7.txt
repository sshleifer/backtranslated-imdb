The early Dead End Kids films (before they were renamed "Bowery Boys") were very interesting and well-made films from Warner Brothers. Despite the fact that they were rather formulaic, they still had excellent writing, acting and a good exposure to time. DON'T confuse them with cheap Monogram Pictures Bowery Boys films - despite the presence of Hantz Hall and Leo Gorsy, these films were a few steps lower than the early quality films. <br /> <br /> The film begins with cool guy John Garfield, who won the light boxing championship. Unfortunately, shortly thereafter he is intoxicated and accused of murder, which he did not actually commit. The problem is that he was so loaded that he was not sure that he had not killed this man, so he runs away and lives the life of a tramp. In the end, he meets the brave Mei Robson and the Dead End Kids - and also with the lady you just know will eventually become his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Where the rest of the film goes, that's not all surprising, but because of the quality of the film, it doesn't matter. Garfield and Children are at their best, and this film will surely please everyone except the most demanding viewers.
