Although there were some aspects of this film that, in my opinion, were underdeveloped, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are great in their lead roles. The main premise of the film is that both of them were as a result of broken marriages when they met. Both are also seeking healing. Suddenly, they discover that they can help heal each other. There were some aspects in the film that I would like to see more - where simple flashes simply suggested topics that my mind had to fill in the gaps, such as apologies to the dead widower and how Adrienne leaves the feeling Paul, and soon after, felt good. The possibility of an incredible love scene was missed when it was just assumed that they were going to make love with the approaching hurricane. But in the end, the film left me feeling deeply grateful for the relationship that exists between my wife and me. And there were moments that touched me to tears. So, I have to say it's worth a look.
