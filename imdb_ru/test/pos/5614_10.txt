As you can see from a few comments posted here, mine may well be the last one you’ll see, unless there is a big DVD release or TCM doesn’t play it again! - This is a kind of film "Our Gang" with a bunch of different children. MGM, of course, was a music studio - if the musicians, dancers and singers were not on the contract, they were in touch. Heifetz was one of the most expensive ..... it makes him for a small charity work !!! The pay he received in that era was unheard of. In another musical film with the Mexican pianist José Iturbi, there were about 100 children playing some simple melody on 100 pianos ... so those skeptics who think that small children are not musical are mistaken: I was alone. <br /> <br /> As everyone writes, “Frankie Smith” is a good American name - (Jean Reynolds) was a bad but good child who was dragged away from the street by music school owners. Can you believe that Walter Brennan (“Prof. Lawson”) from all these western films was a man running a school? Joel McCree (“Peter McCarthy”) and Andrea Leeds (“Ann Lawson”) were big stars in “They Must Have Music”, with many well-known extras (many of whom became stars in their own rights). As noted by others, almost all the children in the orchestra (in fact, The Meremblum Symphony from Los Angeles) have achieved great success in their lives, both musicians (for studios) and in other areas of activity. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, today there are not so many youth orchestras - a sad mistake. Parents with children at school are usually so busy trying to keep their heads above the water, and many do not even know what happens to children at school. Musical training can be expensive, and almost EVERYONE would prefer to have a football team ..... <br /> <br /> This is the cheapest Yasha Heifz concert you’ve ever heard in this movie. .... in those days a quarter. His game is great, even if he looks like he would prefer to be elsewhere ... without emotion. Under contract, any Yo-Yo Ma concert is so joyous that it makes you want to run and buy a cello ..... this guy is having a good time .... like the kids on the street at a concert when they cheat Heifaz to play his school. <br /> <br /> All the orchestral numbers played "kids" and they sound easy. I like this type of film - their stories are so simple that you don’t need two days to figure out whether you liked the movie or understood it at all. We need new films like this - we can do nothing but to inspire young children to play other instruments besides guitars ....... Bravo!
