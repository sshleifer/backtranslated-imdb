When I saw the trailer for this film, I said out loud to anyone, in particular, "this film is going to blow up." I also said this about the MATRIX and see what happened there. Now I am not a box office guru, but usually I have a pretty good idea of ​​what will be good and what is really bad. In this case, I was blinded by my complete and total apathy towards David Duchovny. Let me tell you differently: I do not like him as a person (from what I read about him in interviews, he is incredibly similar to pre-Madonna, and he is full of himself, given that all he did is X -Files) or as an actor. PLAYING GOD was a really bad movie, but he left, thinking that for some reason he deserves a lot of money on the big screen. But I am happy to say that, although these things may still be true about a person, “Returning to Me” is amazing and his heart is in the right place. Bonnie Hunt wrote a beautiful story, and she told it with class and grace. This is one of the most romantic films I've ever seen, and although it may seem a bit sad and offensive in its premise, give it a shot and you will hook it. <br /> <br /> It must have been said (and it hurts me so much) that the reason why this film works so well is in the plot and cast. Spirituality and Driver here are so beautiful and believable that I honestly wanted to cry with them. There is one particularly strong scene when Dukhovni returns home after his wife dies, and he falls to the floor of his house. As always, the family dog ​​looks at the door, waiting for his wife to enter. She does not do this, and his shirt collar is still stained with blood, Rob (Duchovni) tells him that she will never return home. Then he calls the dog to him, and they seem to cry together. The dog makes a small moan, and then Rob cries. And this is one of the most realistic moments of pain I have ever seen in any character in any movie. You can feel his pain, and at that moment I forgot that I was watching an actor who I don’t like at all, and I felt that I was looking at someone I know, but this is a loss to my beloved. This is a powerful stuff. <br /> <br /> Another strength of the film is the cast. Bonnie Hunt has combined the ethnic mix of Irish and Italian characters that have a common connection. They live in a pub called O'Reilley's Italian Pub. This is a delightful name in itself. And they are heading the diagonal scale of the colliding cultures, Carol O'Connor and Robert Loggia. These are two proud old men who love their homeland, but love their granddaughter and niece (I think so), respectively. And this is the character played by Minnie Driver. This script is ripe for comedy, and Hunt does not miss anything here. <br /> <br /> Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi also share some funny moments when a middle-aged couple and Belushi get the highest points because he graciously accepts humility and brags about his big stomach for laughing. Since his family consists of three or four children, he and his wife have very little time to spend quality time. And again, the Hunt handles it with perfect elegance. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful story about how to find true love, find out how lucky you are, that you have true love, the power of friendship and family. “Return to me” is a wonderful novel, and although I still don’t have much admiration for David Duchovny, I have to admit that he was perfect in this role, and I could not imagine anyone else playing his character. He was sensitive and believable, and the film was good thanks to him, not only because of him, but he certainly added taste. <br /> <br /> If you are a lover of a good novel and want a good cry, then this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10 I’ll see everything Bonnie Hunt puts in the director’s chair with her.
