Rainbow Bright and the star Stealer are not for people who were born before 1980 or after 1989. Most of these people will not appreciate the great things that cartoons of the 80s. The fact that Rainbow Bright was filmed in a movie causes many of us to feel guilty when he recalled watching the show as a child. Of course, most of the dialogue is quite funny and stupid, and the plot is not meaningless, but nevertheless it is a very cool movie.
