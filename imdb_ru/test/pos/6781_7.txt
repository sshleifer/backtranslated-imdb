Found a copy in the sale of this old classic. I played DOSBOS on a Vista machine without any problems. This is graphically highly dated, but what do you expect from a 12-year game! The game is a game hybrid FPS / Adventure. This is what I call pseudo 3D, you can't look up or down, just rotate 360 ​​(think Wolf3D). Gameplay can be tricky due to a very limited supply of health pots and a bit of an average interface (Tip: press I), but on the whole it is bearable. <br /> <br /> One of the main strengths of the game is the mood. There the game makes heavy use of full-motion video, and while the b-class game and the plot are very fluid, the game as a whole feels really creepy. It also helps you ask the “good guys” questions. Do they really help, or are they just waiting to stab you in the back? Another important selling point is the duration of the game. There are 18 chapters in memory that vary in play time from 10 minutes to potentially hours. My first performance took me a week with a serious time devotion. <br /> <br /> With the date, yes, but if you missed it a few years ago and can find it for $ 5, take a look. Cheaper than a movie, and more fun than most movies.
