This is a cult film for many reasons. First, because of the phenomenal success as a musical on Broadway and in London, and then as a musical film. The film is close to the play, and some of the play’s provocations are no longer provocative twelve years later. The discourse against the Vietnam War is no longer a protest song against the war itself, but a strong song that demonstrates how young people managed to overthrow the political establishment in the late 60s. Miloš Forman plays with some situations in the late 1970s, such as narrow justice, self-centered umbilical righteousness of the rich or small, who have one level of power more than the impotent. He also plays heavily with the racial element and sexual ambiguity that he builds all the time. The film remains pleasant and thoughtful. And, of course, remembering those years when we had the privilege, and it was not a chance to live them, is an incredible thrill. On November 11, 1969, Nixon ordered a massive celebration of the 1918 truce, which became an order for teachers of all levels to conduct their students to the celebration and march, thus supporting the invasion of Cambodia, which was in full swing. And some dare to teach the lessons of democracy to foreign countries. I also remember a long campaign for Nixon’s impeachment in 1973-1974, which will ultimately lead to his resignation and sworn in by Gerald Ford, the first vice president and, ultimately, the US president, who were not elected because the vice-president of the Senate after Spiro Agnew had to resign in order to stand trial, convicted and sentenced for embezzlement. Of course, this makes us think about today, when in 2000 the US president was elected not by the people, but by the Supreme Court, or a war that was rejected by millions of people all over the world from the very beginning and even before it began. better judgment of the United Nations and the three permanent members of the Security Council. And some speak of a new world order based on the respect of others. The modern Western man seems to have some problems with understanding that the world is changing and has already been widely and wisely changed. Modern Westerners seem to be out of sync and need special evening classes to understand that democracy wants the majority in the world to be the majority, and the West is far from that majority, and that if the Soviet bloc could understand that the market economy is it is not capitalism, but the fact that a market economy can be either socialist or capitalist, the Berlin Wall would fall, but vice versa, and that China learned this lesson surprisingly well and is at the foot of the wall, which they have to climb, to know that their socialist market economy should lead to political democracy, but they will, just as Vietnam was able to re-establish itself after thirty years of aggressive military aggression and prejudice. In other words, hair is an ideal food for thought. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques CULARDO, University Paris Dauphin, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne and University Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines
