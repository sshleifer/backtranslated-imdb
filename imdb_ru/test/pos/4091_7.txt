The film is great. Acting, cinematography, directing and music fascinate. It seems to me that the reason why many put the film for a low rating is their loyalty to the original version of 1937 with Ronald Coleman in the lead role. This film is not in vain! - spawned an incredible level of commitment. From talking to people who saw the original when it first came out, I think it was something like the first Star Wars film in our time. I saw this. It was and wonderful. But this does not mean that this version is also not worthy. From the first scene you are captured in the 1973 version. The noise and noise are fantastic, especially in the sense that they prepare you for peace in Shangri-La. And Bert Baharach's music is beautiful. So - by all means enjoy the 1937 version. But don't let this distract you from the pleasure of this version of 1973 more than the fact that you allowed King Kong of 1935 to destroy this year's Peter Jackson.
