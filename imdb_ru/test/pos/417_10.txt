He is not your usual taxi driver. <br /> <br /> These guys have problems. With his wife, with his son, the priest, with all his tariffs, with his former partner and above all by himself. And most importantly, they just throw us all into it. Therefore, we must continue to follow to learn more about his past. <br /> <br /> The idea may not be original, but David Morse does that. I think this is a great show, and I hope that people are gaining popularity by the end of the season. <br /> <br /> SEE THIS SHOW !!!!!!!!!
