Where to start, I like a scary snow monster named Jack Frost. The whole concept works well for me, we thought he would come back, and he was. Changing local to a tropical resort works. See old friends and meet new characters. Scott MacDonald does an excellent job with the role of Jack Frost, you can tell when the actor plays the villain merrily, you can see it or in this case hear it in the play. Yes, Jack Frost 2 - the long-awaited sequel, which is better than the first. I have one complaint, little Jacks or Jacklings, as I call them. They looked like puppets. I think they could do a better job with Jackling, my mouth could open wider, but CGI was good, and overall the whole movie is worth watching again and again. If you like JACK FROST, then you will love this sequel. No questions or debates, 9 BIG STARS.
