There are a lot of movies on DVD now, but the producers have forgotten some headlines that are important to many moviegoers. The Egyptian, along with El Sid and other favorites of the widescreen era, had big budget epics. Many people from my generation learn a lot about the history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas (for the first time I heard from them a very cheap adventure film with Charlton Heston, The Inca Treasures), the same thing happened to me, Egypt or Rome saw a lot of “bad” epics that era. a lot of production values, excellent use of color (De Luxe color was more brigitish and sharp than the usual Technicolor), maybe the cast was wrong, but in any case, the film really helped us give an idea of ​​life in ancient Egypt and was In a sense a motor to go and buy a novel, my Mika Waltari, one of the best, if not the best historical novel ever published. In addition, Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann were excellent results. I saw this film many times when I was a boy, it was not a big box office hit, which Fox studios wanted after the huge hit Robe, in CinemaScope, and Stereo was a wonderful smash spectacle. I have a version of Lasser Disc.m. The only way to see this is in the wdisescreen format. I hope to come soon.
