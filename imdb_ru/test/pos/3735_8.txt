Being a mom of middle age, I really appreciated the romance between adults, which is intertwined in many problems that affect us. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane beautifully portrays Adrienne and the victim and conflict, through which the mother passes, wanting to do what is suitable for her children, but at the same time live a happy life. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Richard Gere, but he always does a good job with a guy who is a bit of a jerk, but learns something about himself. <br /> <br /> Criticism of their romance as unreal is hardly justified compared to most other romantic films. When Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman fall in love, driving around Australia, barely talking between them, itâ€™s considered a high romance. We get a lot more here with Rodanthe. She buys him. He frees her. It is beautiful. <br /> <br /> The intimacy they create by sharing their deepest insecurity envelops fans with passion. How long it takes does not matter. Perhaps the film was too thin in terms of the fact that it was the letters that they shared over the next year that deepened their relationship - again another real way to get to know a person in real life. <br /> <br /> No matter how much I liked the plot and the themes, the dialogue was not consistent in quality. Some lines sounded so believable, while others were embarrassingly banal and flat. <br /> <br /> I also liked the relationship with teenage daughter Adrienne and her best friend, which reminded us that there are many types of love, not just romantic love. <br /> <br /> This is not a carefree romantic comedy, more a romantic drama. He has a very relaxed pace, which some may find too slow. <br /> <br /> Beach House - a fabulous work of art. Look for a snag bench on the porch in the first pan over the house - very beautiful. I also enjoyed the music and landscapes, which together created the effect of the location as the third protagonist. It was this place away from their ordinary lives that allowed them to see themselves and each other in a different light. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to appreciate these themes and are set up for a good cry. Get out of Kleenex and enjoy this movie.
