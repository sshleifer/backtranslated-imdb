This film touched me more than I expected, and I was completely ready to cry. The acting basically carried this film with superb performances by Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger, as well as cast. These actors portrayed characters so strongly human that they stayed with me the rest of the night, and it was hard for me to shake this military drama. The costumes and cinematography were also magical, but they themselves were not addicted. They did not focus, but added the full effect. “Cold Mountain” will never be my favorite movie, as this title will always belong to the “English patient”, but it is among the top five. The story itself was well designed and remained rather unpredictable. I did not catch myself guessing on which line would follow. Heartbreaking story about humanity and war. In fact, this film was so real that it was barely noticeable that it happened in the 19th century. It seemed to apply to all times.
