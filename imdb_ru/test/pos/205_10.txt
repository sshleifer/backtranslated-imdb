I would like to tell you a few things before watching this movie. If at one time or another you thought you had seen good work with the camera, be prepared to be surprised at this film. Recall that this film was shot in 1957 in Russia, but the technique used here is probably something that we saw much later in the western world ... about 20 years later. The level of emotion in the film varies quite strongly: happiness-love-war-despair-joy, but in the end you are left with something completely unique: the joy of seeing one masterpiece of filmmaking. Young directors of our time should study more such films, and perhaps they can create something like that ... although I think that such films are very difficult to find ... If you have seen "I am Cuba" "Then this film is very you would have liked, but if not, be prepared for a unique experience. Russian directors have something in common: a very small budget, excellent actors and the joy of creating art ... and yes, they are able to create more masterpieces than the entire Western world combined. I'm not a big fan of Russia, in fact, I hate everything that is communist, but shooting films in this part of the world creates feelings that are difficult to describe. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it. <br />
