I would recommend this film to anyone looking for a relaxing, fun, thought-provoking film. The absence of sex, vulgarity and violence made for the most pleasant evening. I especially liked the scene in Buffalo, but this is probably because I live not far from there. Despite this, this film could be made in any city; This is a topic that is so important here. I'm just grateful that Manna of Heaven fell on us. Try it ... you will like it!
