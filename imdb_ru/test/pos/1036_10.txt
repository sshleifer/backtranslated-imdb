Absolutely the best I've ever seen on TV. It was interesting and informative. The reason I found this site is to try to figure out how I can see it again. <br /> <br /> In light of the current understanding of the story, we must sympathize with General Leslie Groves, who was responsible for the nuts and bolts of the launch of the Manhattan Project. Most likely, he was not so paranoid about security, as many have thought in the past. <br /> <br /> Casting for real people depicted in the photo was outstanding. This was the first time I saw Sam Waterston as an actor. With the exception of height, he was very similar to Robert Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> The early scene in which Oppenheimer leads the class of graduate students was especially intriguing to me.
