Another nice entry in the Doctor Crime series [# 4/10], with an atmospheric, almost noisy black and white photograph and some magnificent Spanish-American backgrounds and decorations. And even more non-standard storyline! <br /> <br /> A man who looked like the insane killer of his first two wives was found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner. The criminal Doctor is on the spot (ostensibly as a guest) to immediately and meekly announce this murder, and therefore we present a rather strange set of people to think about, because one of them did the deed. Was it the foamy brother of the deceased first wife, third wife and rich widow Hilary Brooke, the dancing brother and vampire sisters, an energetic young man, an eccentric cabinet maker Lloyd Corrigan, borrowed from Boston Black, an indispensable butler or chances for Jerome Cowan? Police inspector Emory Parnell had to do away with the job, but Warner Baxter, like Ordway, was as cool as ever, he understood everything. One of the stupidities listed on IMDb is incorrect: breaking into the murder room, Ordway says: "Right through the center of the forehead," and Cowan replies: "He did not miss this time." Favorite places: Baxter and Cowan travel through club sandwiches and beer at a nightclub to make up for an interrupted dinner; The scene where Bragaâ€™s resting place seems to roar. The plot sometimes seems a bit tortuous, and the way in which all this is explained is perhaps more worthy of the Monogram, but keeping it in the air as supernatural will not help either! <br /> <br /> Worth watching, if you already like the genre, you will not be disappointed, if you really do not like the genre.
