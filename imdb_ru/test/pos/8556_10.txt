I have seen this film, maybe 100 times, never tired of it. I saw this film for the first time when I was 7 years old, and since then it has left a trace in my memory. This is a charming love story that brings out the sun in most people, even in the darkest of times. I think this is a film that should definitely be seen, and one of the best in the history of Anthony Quinn. I just want the TV channels to send this movie more often. It inspired me in a good way and will do the same with many others. If I wanted to meet the actor, it would be Anthony Quinn. On silver screens will never be like him. Too bad Anthony Quinn was still alive. God bless his soul.
