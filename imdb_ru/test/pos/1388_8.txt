The inscription on the screen tells us that this is the "Caribbean Sea, May 1891." A small lifeboat drifting aimlessly into the sea, there are six prisoners from a shipwrecked prison ship and ship's doctor lieutenant Claude de Ross (Claudio Cassinelli). Night, a strange current takes the boat to a strange, unnamed and unexplored island. The boat gets into some rocks and is torn apart. One of the prisoners was killed by something resembling a slimy mutant creature fish. The next morning, Claude wakes up, being washed on the beach. He finds a pool of white boiling water and one of the prisoners who died next to him. Claude warns another survivor José (Franco Iavarone) not to drink water, as this will kill him. They both end up with other surviving prisoners, Peter (Roberto Posse), Francois (Francesco Mazzéry) and Skip (Giuseppe Castellano). Francois wanders by himself to try to catch an animal for food, he finds and kills a large waterbird. But in turn, he was killed by one of the fishermen. Claude, Jose, Peter and Skip continue to explore the island, explaining the death of Francois some kind of animal attack. Shortly after Skip is killed when he is pierced with a spike at the bottom of the pit. Now there are only Claude, Jose and Peter. They stumble upon a graveyard with many empty graves and signs of recent black magic rituals. Claude notices a snake on a nearby stone, a shot is suddenly heard, and the snake's head explodes. A woman on a horse named Amanda Marvin (Barbara Bach) is the rescuer of Claude. She tells them to leave the island immediately, because he belongs to Edmund Rackham (Richard Johnson), and he does not like visitors. Claude, Jose and Peter decide to continue, no matter what, eventually finding Rackham’s big house in which they are invited to stay. That night Peter goes after Amanda and tries to rape her in a swamp, Peter quickly becomes food for fishermen. And a voodoo priestess named Shakira (Beryl Cunningham), who lives with Rackham, performs a black magic ritual involving cutting a chicken throat in a cemetery. The next day, Claude and Jose decide to leave the island, because they are very uncomfortable because of Rackham, and he thinks he is lying to them. Jose rides a horse and is lost. Amanda saved Claude from one of the fishermen, and he was again told to leave. Claude wants to confront Rackham again. Rackham says that he has a scientist and Amanda’s father named Professor Ernest Marvin (Joseph Cotten), whom he must keep alive. Rackham says that the longer Ernest is alive, the greater the chances of his own survival. Rackham tells Claude his plan. Rackham found the lost city of Atlantis at a depth of over 2000 feet. He uses fish people as a means of reaching the lost treasures of Atlantis and needs Amanda and her father to control them. He claims that human fish are descendants of the original inhabitants of Atlantis. Rackham offers Claude a share of the treasure if he helps him survive Ernest. Later, Claude recalls the name of Ernest Marvin as a scientist who was convicted of experiments on the transplantation of animal organs into humans. Finding Ernest's secret laboratory, he discovered that Rackham had lied to him, and fish people are not descendants, their genetically modified people have actually become amphibious creatures as a result of Ernest's grotesque experiments! Rackham is finally fed up with Claude, and he decides to put an end to his interference, sticking it into a large reservoir and slowly filling it with water as the island volcano begins to erupt and spread lava around the world. Rackham wants to leave the island with its treasures and Amanda. Can Claude avoid almost certain death in order to save Amanda and leave the island before the erupting volcano tears it apart? Directed by Sergio Martino I really liked this film, which mixed different genres. Script Sergio Donati fast, interesting and interesting. The plot is revealed little by little, which made me interested in watching it. At the moment I have to say that I saw the original version, not the one with the added scenes for its release in the USA by Roger Corman. Barbara Bach was an extremely attractive leading lady, but I hated the way she was introduced when shooting the head of a snake, I thought it was more than unpleasant. Richard Johnson makes a great villain, and Claudio Cassinelli is a pleasant hero. The fishermen themselves look a bit fake when the camera lingers on them for too long, but their look is cool and I have seen worse. Some of the miniature effects also look a bit poor, but overall I saw much worse again. There is no real blood, violence or nudity in this, but it really did not bother me. Giancarlo Ferrando's photography and Massimo Antonello Geleng's production design combine to create a very beautiful film. Historical costumes, props and decorations, such as the Rackham House and Ernest's lab with old scientific equipment. The lush green settings of the jungle also add to the visual grandeur of the show. I really liked this film, and I was entertained throughout its work. I'm not sure who I would recommend it to, since it combines different genres, I think someone who might like something a little different and generally well done. If you can find a copy, try it, I'm glad I found it.
