Being recognized as a slasher addict means that very rarely do I get the opportunity to watch a lot of movies with a big budget and worthy prizes. In addition to the successful box office of James Mangold draw personality; Since the Creek trilogy has once again returned Wes Craven’s name to the Hollywood map, there has not been a single big name. That's why Mark Malone The Last Stop ?? mysterious thriller with a frank slasher, instantly intrigued me. With a decent mix of Adam Beach and Jürgen Prochnow, and an intriguing soundtrack that even finds a place for a rose garden Lynn Anderson, I have to admit that the first signs were very positive for this claustrophobic function. As far as I know, there have ever been only three other snow slashers, unless, of course, you think that “Demons are Obsessed” are suitable for this category. The first piece and a cube on the ice was the blade of Satan, dried to the bones, and then the cheese feast of Lisa Loring, who was Blizzard of Blood, and the pleasant Shredder followed fourteen years later. <br /> <br /> During an extreme blizzard, state soldier Jason (Adam Beach) fights through the snow to get to a remote lodge in the mountains of Colorado. His task is to inform the guests that the road is closed, and they must stay at least one more night until the road is cleared of dangerous conditions. This news does not go against a suspicious bunch, which includes two troubled brothers (Callum Keith Renny and Peter Fleming), a truck driver who really does not want to hang around (William S. Taylor), an abnormal pair of lovers (Winston Rekert and Amy Adamson) and Jason's former girlfriend Nancy (Rose McGowan). The motel owners (Jurgen Prochnow and P. Lynn Johnson) are also not happy with the news, but they offer rooms to stranded guests and try to calm the tense situation. Things get worse when Jason finds a disfigured body and a bag full of stolen money, lying in the snow behind the cafe. Just like the head from the riddle of Agatha Christie, the guests begin to die at the hands of the assailant in a mask, who seems to be intending to get the money back. With so many smart characters to choose from and the inability to leave the crime scene, Jason must try to stop the maniac before he kills again ?? <br /> <br /> A good riddle needs at least a handful of suspicious suspects, each of whom has a reliable motive, a remote location from which no one can escape, and a clever protagonist who will help solve the clues. Fortunately, The Last Stop provides each of these important ingredients in a thriller that has equal moments of brilliance and utter nonsense. The film starts off wonderfully when dubious personalities collide in a claustrophobic environment that manages to maintain tension throughout the execution time. Malone maintains heightened levels of interest, since each character reveals his own reasons for attracting some suspicion, and, frankly, a significant turn is not one that you easily guess. I actually watched the film again to see if I could catch any hints I missed for the first time. Unfortunately, when it turns out that the maniac is an excessive psycho, the sorcerers, like the bad guy from the comics, “Last Stop” loses a huge amount of trust. Fortunately, all is not lost when an unexpected and brilliantly organized plot twist saves the final film. <br /> <br /> Similarities can be identified with excellent identity, since these two graphs are almost interchangeable. The efforts of James Mangold must be the best of the two, mainly due to the stellar invoicing of John Cusack and the always reliable Ray Liotta. With this in mind, although Adam Beach does quite a good job in the lead, while Juergen Prokhnov, Amy Adamson and brilliant Callum Keith Renny add some credible support. In this role, Rose McGowan acts just as discreetly as he probably did day after day, and Winston Rekert began fantastically before fully plunging into the climax of the film. If you are a devoted slasher fan who watches these bloody murders, you will be disappointed. A psychopath wearing a balaclava appears only once, and the rest of the killings are committed off-screen. But, as I said earlier, Malone's directorial talent means that uncertainty is never too far from a boil, and you can forgive a few shortcomings, because the positive is almost a triumph. <br /> <br /> Last stop is noteworthy. Slasher addicts and movie lovers. Yes, there are a few negatives, but in general it is a good example of the emergence of Hollywood talent. If you liked the identity, then of course, try it ??
