For many years, I was very interested in the life of this teenager, who left such a deep, indelible mark on the world. My passion is also generated by fear, as it could happen again. <br /> <br /> And in subsequent years, I am afraid, “it” continues to happen around us and, of course, “it” was happening long before Ann. “This,” of course, is whether a so-called civilized society can get involved on its own or in an innocent country / race / continent and kill people in cold blood on unconvincing excuses? I leave this question there. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the documentary there is a statement about leader Adolf Hitler that one deep fact about Hitler, which is never mentioned, is that he was democratically elected and all the atrocities committed were committed as a result of obedient poodle press and propaganda propaganda, played out again and again for the obedient population. <br /> <br /> One of the atrocities was Anne Frank, who stabbed the death camp, thanks to the miracle of the survival of her diary. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branna does a wonderful job of commenting and interviewing, he has this rare gift for minimizing his own personality, which allows subjects to speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> Many new facts and people, never before surveyed, come to life in painstaking research, which I will not go into here, since they immeasurably add to the reality and painful sadness of the film. /> <br /> Glenn Close reads diary entries and her voice is perfect for this role; she brings naivety and freshness to the role. <br /> <br /> Elder childhood friends of Anne undergo lengthy interviews, and her last days before her death are recorded well and become witnesses along with her energetic and mischievous personality. <br /> <br /> This is not to be missed. Beautiful and respectful film about the rare Anne. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
