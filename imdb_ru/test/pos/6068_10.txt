The ENGLISH PATIENT has not only everything (a doomed novel, a tragic war, great characters), but everything is the same as in any other film. This is a fascinating story told through the memories of the amazing performances of all the participants, great visual effects, characters that we care about, and the most enthusiastic love story ever told. Cinematic landmark, the best film of 1996 and one of the best of the 1990s.
