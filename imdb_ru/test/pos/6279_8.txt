It looks like something I've never seen before. It made me puzzle all the time, I do not think there was one scene through which I did not laugh. We are talking about a girl from a southern country who goes to a big city in college. At school, she supports the RA through the hall. When she realizes that he has no family for Thanksgiving, she invites him to go home with her. Rabekka, her family and her serious boyfriend are all having dinner one night, and Becca understands what her boyfriend is going to do ... I suggest. She calls Kraal to do something, so he gets up and shouts something like ... Sorry, buddy, but you're too late. I already asked Becca to marry me a couple of weeks ago at school, and she said yes. It all turns into chaos. Please see this classic, it's worth it ... I swear.
