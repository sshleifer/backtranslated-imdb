I went to see this movie on the book's signature in Lexington, Kai last night. After a wonderful night, which consisted of a few short words with Mr. Bruce Campbell (you have to say all this, not just Bruce or Mr. Campbell; D), friends signing books and a QnA session with our beloved Death killer, the light went out. <br /> <br /> In order not to spoil anything, I will not go into details ... but I liked the movie! Mr. Bruce Campbell did a wonderful job retaining the classic b-movie atmosphere. The characters were classic 'b' characters, the place was refreshing (which movies you know are based in Bulgaria?), And the atmosphere was almost original and fun! On top of that, the humor, which is shared throughout the film, made the audience laugh most of the film. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not as attractive to people as some, it is a beacon of fun and laughter in the season (as Mr. Bruce Campbell said) "b-movie", which are listed as "a-movie" ( Bewitched, Dukes of Hazard, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?!).
