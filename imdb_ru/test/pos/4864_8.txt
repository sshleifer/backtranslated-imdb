I took a DVD on 1 ?? discount, not having a clue what it is (but at this price I can not resist ..) In short: I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> So much that I did some research. On the German DVD (part 2 of series 3), the episodes were combined into two 85-minute parts and failed. Here are my results based on the list of Wikipedia episodes: <br /> <br /> “Judgment Day” - “In my boots + voice” (final episode). <br /> <br /> “War of Machines” is Hel and Flood (1, 2) + Eavesdropper + Juggernaut Down. <br /> <br /> Well what can I say. Girls in underwear, of course, are interesting for older men. I have never watched Charlie's Angels so much, so I cannot compare, but the more I looked, the less I looked out for bikini tops and their fillings. Instead, the characters (and m and f) became more interesting. I can imagine that feminists are also having fun with it. In general, maybe a guilty pleasure, but it was a pleasure: ^)
