The film begins with a meeting of the board of directors in a large advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board just because itâ€™s black and the agency needs a token on the board. Swope ignores the meeting, reads Jet magazine at the big table, and everyone ignores Swope ... Suddenly, the CEO grunts on the spot. No time wasted. The janitor is called to pull out the corpse, and the Board immediately and unceremoniously decides on the choice of a new CEO. And as the votes are counted one by one, the tension rises, and then finally ends in a fun ironic climax of the vote, which gives the viewer a delicious meal with logical consequences to enjoy the rest of the film. If you have ever talked to some silly TV commercial, you will love this movie. It is a pity that in the world, it seems, there are no real Putney Svops.
