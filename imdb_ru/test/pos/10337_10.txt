When I was in the 7th grade (as far back as 1977), I was asked to read the novel on which it was based, as part of my English classes. I remember being very moved by this and excited when the television version came out a year later. <br /> <br /> Kristy McNichol was a popular television actress when this film was shot and she was already playing a daughter in a dysfunctional family on the hit hit of the TV series “Family.” It was clear that she had the range and ability to cope with this part. I recall that at times she was a bit "tough", but in general she copes well with her work. She tolerates the film. <br /> <br /> Esther Roll is great because she seems to be the only one in the family who really cares about her. Barbara Barry, as a somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother, is as good as young Robin Lively (who will eventually appear in the role of black widow Lana Milford in Twin Peaks) as a cute younger sister who seems to be the center of attention parental affection. Bruce Davidson also accordingly attracts as a German soldier with a title. <br /> <br /> The best performance, however, belongs to Michael Konstantin. He is really powerful and deserves more recognition than he received at that time. The bitterness and coldness that he expresses makes the scenes in which he seems to be difficult to observe, but makes it easier to understand the quiet despair of the rejected daughter. Konstantin gives everyone the correct intensity and seems to understand the basic psychological motives well. <br /> <br /> The film differs from the book only by small differences. It’s wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it will be released again on video or DVD. <br /> <br />
