... there was a "News Broadcast", and that was good. This one just gets up and sounds like a barbaric yelping in a way that resonates two decades later. <br /> <br /> There are moments - especially with regard to the pretty score - when this film becomes too eightieth or too Insomnia in Seattle. Fortunately, they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> One third of social satire, one third of the romantic comedy, one third of the drama, which is based on three imperfect but charming people, she is intelligent and touching almost impossible to laugh. Holly Hunter in particular may never have been so fun to watch in a comedic role. (And yes, I include in this assessment “Raising Arizona”, its other stellar line-up from that era.) <br /> <br /> Legitimate classics.
