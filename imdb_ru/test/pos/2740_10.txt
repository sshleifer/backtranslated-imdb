My dad had this movie 8 mm. I liked it when he pulled out a projector, stuck a sheet to the wall and played Gerald McBoing Boeing. The thought of a child who communicated through sounds fascinated me. <br /> <br /> Nine years ago, my son was diagnosed with autism. Doctors will ask me questions about my son, such as "How does he communicate with you?" I replied: "Have you ever seen a cartoon, Gerald McBoing Boeing?" as my son sees his world. <br /> <br /> I recently talked to a digital translation specialist who pointed out most personal 8 mm films that didnâ€™t sound until the mid-1970s. I guess I was lucky that I experienced the views and sounds of Gerald Mac Boeing Boeing in 1972.
