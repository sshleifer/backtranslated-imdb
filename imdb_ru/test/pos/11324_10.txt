I just wanted to say that when I was little, my favorite TV show that day was the night heat. I loved the characters and the plot of the show. I thought it was a great show and I still do to this day. I like to watch replays, and I'm a big fan. I love how the characters play against each other. I always went to bed late to watch my favorite show with my mother, who was also a big fan. Now I can enjoy watching my show again and listening to a thematic song. I thought it was a cool song for the show. My favorite characters were Scott Highlands and Jeff Wincott. I liked to watch these pretty guys kill the bad guys.
