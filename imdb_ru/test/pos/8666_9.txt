Where the hell is Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly? Heaven? Hell? Parallel universe? When an annoying person leaves the subway platform and meets the oncoming train, his next conscious moment happens on the bus; riding alone, the newest arrival, in the dead hell, where all suicides are committed. Dressed as he was during his sudden departure from the bodily biosphere, he meets an official person who processes and transports an annoying person from the barren plain to the city, if working with eyeballs is a dead call for the kind of urban landscapes he once inhabited, if memory serves him. Andreas retains the appearance of a sleepwalker in trance, a person alienated from people and objects, struggling to find his attitude; at home, more precisely, his assigned apartment; or at work, where an annoying man is randomly appointed as an accountant for an independent contractor. Havard (Johannes Yoner), his boss, tells him: “You will get used to it”, which, as we suspect, in this world, besides the old world, covers something more than just numbers. <br /> <br /> If life is meaningless, as the French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Satre said, the same can be said about death. The subculture of office life can be a paradise for one person, but for us it looks like hell in the context in which Den Brysomme Mannen works. Working in the afterlife, in essence, means working for the rest of your life. Social contact between Andreas's office mates can take place normally in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates aloofness in the viewer, since he / she now recognizes the hard work of white-collar workers performed by white-collar workers who kill their insignificant chatter and assigned tasks that they perform throughout the day, for example, auto-tones, seem to be irrational every day in their self-evident absurdity. To see everyday life reproduced in the speculative light, “Den Breeze Mannen” turns normal human interaction into a ruthless comedy, because everyday life turns into a view that transforms the meaning of the word “alienation” of Karl Marx, because here men and women in the office “do “Identifying with their work, like the actors in the play who are conspiring to make their imagination seem real. But the annoying person never fully participates in the facade. He always knows about cracks. <br /> <br /> From a wooden bench, Andreas watches the jumper, who plunges into the iron fence, while people during their lunch breaks pass by, remaining indifferent to his outgoing guts. which create red splashes on a clean sidewalk. Andreas is faced with the same impartiality from his colleagues after he deliberately cut off his own finger in the hope that he will feel pain at the shredder. He is not This is just another sensation, in addition to the opportunity to feel the taste and smell that is lost to the annoying person. This inability to be comforted by simple pleasures reinforces the need of an annoying person in love, when simple pleasures compensate for his loneliness in the physical world. At the dinner hosted by his boss, Andreas meets Ann Britt (Petonella Barker). They did it. He goes her home. She invites him to enter. They become a couple. He moves. However, when they have sex, it’s not good either for Andreas or for Anna, who seem to enjoy more interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another sensation that is unattainable in this world, but love matters for an annoying man, so he tries again with Ingeborg (Birjet Lagen), the girl from work. Den Brysomme mannen destroys love, representing its foundation as a series of gestures requiring performances from both men and women. When Ingeborg doesn’t have the same tender feelings for Andreas to leave Ann Britt for her after his hyper-Germanic gesture, this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about a prosaic, but strange city with open determination, and offers multiple interpretations. <br /> <br /> Wounded by Ingeborg’s apathy to his declaration of love for her, an annoying man wanders through the same subway station, stands on the same platform, stares at the same couple, aggressively disassembles and jumps, This time he cannot die. How can you die when you're already dead? Striking repeatedly by train after train, Andreas' face turns into ground beef; his body is bent in corners, previously seen only in art. When an annoying person realizes that love and death are beyond his reach, he is looking for a person from the club who wanted to say that he does not speak in this city of the walking dead. That is: death, not life, does not matter. <br /> <br /> Understanding the mystery behind Andreas's whereabouts leads to the narration, and, to the credit of the director, this riddle is satisfactorily solved in a scene that resembles Spike Jones’s “Being John Malkovich” to cross another world, like a newborn baby, which resembles a portal to Malkovich's brain, through which Craig Schwartz instructs people to crawl. Andreas' attempt to overcome the big gulf is a seductive paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally divided by a wall, this vulnerable boundary acts as the perfect embodiment of the atheistic belief that “paradise is a place on earth”. But at the same time, paradise is proved by the reality of hell; the place where Andreas goes after the expulsion from his destination city.
