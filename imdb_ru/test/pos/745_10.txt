... but you probably saw it, otherwise you wouldn't be here. It is so unclear that you probably stumbled upon it, like me, because this little-known gem does not hear a word. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, you know how the storyline will evolve, but see how our innocent Red-haired nurse puts the puzzle pieces together - this is quality entertainment. Most horror films bombard the audience with graphic images of torture, but “Don't Look in the Basement” reproduces them subtly, which creates excellent tension.

Sweet and home nurse Charlotte gets a job at a sanatorium, but she is horrified when she finds out that the head doctor who hired her was in a terrible accident, and now she obeys a mysterious doctor who, as we all know, is not a doctor at all. , Waiting is built through the disentanglement of events by Charlotte with the help of many patients, but which patient can Charlotte trust?

I like Re-Animator and Evil Dead, but they play more for the crowd HORROR-COMEDY. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (Quite handicraft on horror standards, but the film has a decent drop of blood. The first scene is classic, no other horror movie starts better, and the end also has its own blood share . <br /> <br /> Nudity: $$$$ (Seeking to fall in love with Allison (Betty) Chandler) spends a lot of time naked, trying to seduce half of the men in the sanatorium. Betty Chandler is knocked out, and I'm shocked that this is her only merit in the film). <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $$ $$ (The story is well developed, despite the fact that there is a lot of run in Hollywood. The script is able to build uncertainty and can never put poor Charlotte in a dangerous situation). <br /> <br /> Acts: $$$$ (Betty Chandler does the best work here in the role of Allison, capturing dementia with naivety in ethereal form. The judge was also magnificent, weighing the facts before he decided, while Rosie X . olotik as Charlotte gives a real idea that you will feel for its character.
