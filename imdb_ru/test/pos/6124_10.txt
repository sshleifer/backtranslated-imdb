Do you know the saying "Curiosity killed the cat"? Well, I heard so much about this film, from a magazine that called it one of the most shocking films of all time, my 1001 films that you should see before dying, my sister, who watched it at the film festival, and I love the show 70- x on vh1. I just needed to watch this movie, since it was called the roughest movie of all time, and, well, after watching this movie last night, I must say that it really corresponded to its name. My God, this film was so strange! I thought I really saw all of this with some of the most painful films and TV shows I've seen, some things that I think will always feel like shock. <br /> <br /> Babs Johnson, who is also Divine, was named the dirtiest man of the living, and a jealous couple named Marble fights for this title. They want to take away the Divine and be called the dirtiest couple alive, kidnapping women, raping them, infiltrating them and selling their children to lesbian couples. But it seems that the Divine and her family are good ... I don’t know, it seems, retains the title, having sex with chickens, synchronizing the buttocks, eating dog feces, stuffing meat in their skirts, incest, and it just gets coarser and rougher. <br /> <br /> Pink Flamingo acted terribly, horribly made, and, well, just terrible. Is the reason I’m going to give a 10 point score because you can rate this movie? I always appreciate, so I just think, what the hell? Because of the rudeness of this film, you have to pay tribute to John Waters, who would have thought about this film after 35 years? For the cast and crew who worked on this film, you guys are just nasty! <br /> <br /> 10/10
