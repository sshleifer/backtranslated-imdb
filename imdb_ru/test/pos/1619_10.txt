This is a low-budget movie about monsters filmed in a movie from Brett (“Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell”) ... and he gives what I expect from such a production: light-hearted (albeit stupid) dialogue, some cute actresses have many creatures to stop moving. That's why I gave the film 10 out of 10 - because it provides what I expected to deliver ... and a bit more: Brett is not scrupulous when it comes to presenting his critters on the screen. He throws a lot of mistakes in his lineup for the final. And, in any case, I LOVE to stop the movement of monsters, which, compared to CGI-critics in films with a large budget, seem so funny to watch.
