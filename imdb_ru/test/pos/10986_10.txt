Two things can happen when an ensemble is put together. Either you leave the theater, asking: “Why?” Or you get “Manna from Paradise”, a delightful comedy from Burton sisters, whose mother not only inspired, but also the script itself. Ursula Burton plays Teresa, a nun whose girlfriend and family have always believed that Gd had touched her. When money falls from the sky, the clan uses young Teresa's belief that money was a gift from heaven to fulfill all their dreams. Years pass, and we find that Teresa has returned home to her native Buffalo. She comes to understand that this gift must be redeemed and brought together his friends and family (Oscar laureates Shirley Jones, Louise Fletcher and Cloris Lichman) to return the debt before Easter. Money has long been spent, and all the characters are in financial difficulties. Shirley Jones and Frank Gorshin, a husband and wife team that teaches all the important lessons in life, how to dress for winter in Buffalo and my personal favorite, "they expect you to take verware" when you visit a restaurant. The audience can only hope that , if Teresa achieves her goal that someone will not run away with money. The film teaches us that it’s not dreams, but we ourselves fulfill our dreams and the dreams of others. Each action has a result not only for you, but also for the community around you. When we look in the mirror, we see ourselves as we want MANNA FROM HEAVEN may be answering the question of how others can see the image that we would like to reflect. Burtons did an excellent job directing the cast to break out of their shells and create new and inventive characters. Low-budget Indy proves that not cash, but real talent will cause the greatest laughter. Wendy Malik (US president of Just Shoot Me) gives a special flavor to this already talented cast.
