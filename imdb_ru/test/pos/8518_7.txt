1983 was the "Battle of the Bonds". In the same year, both Roger Moore and Sean Connery starred in two separate films about James Bond, the first one (“Octopus”) was filmed by the “official” Bond movie makers, and the last one (“Never Say Never”) was filmed “unofficially ”A group led by Kevin McClory, who owned the rights to the film in Thunderball. Surprisingly enough, the “unofficial” film is better, despite the obvious flaw and the fact that “Never Say Never” is a remake of Thunderbol. <br /> <br /> “Never say never” is distinguished by the sporting best actors ever gathered for the Bond movie. It all starts with Sean Connery returning to the Bond play for the first time since 1971 in Diamonds Forever. Connery may be older than he was then, but he looks better than Diamonds forever. The “Never Say Never” bond is Dr. Smooth No's smooth and dangerous shark or “From Russia with Love”, only a few years older. Connery put one airliner and the dialogue is as dead as before. The only flaw in Connery's age is his believability, especially when it comes to the ladies of the film. Let's face it, even though Connery is in excellent physical shape, he looks just as strange as Moore when he sleeps with women half his age. However, despite this plausibility problem, “Never Say Never” again shows Connery in one of his best performances of Bond and a definite improvement in his two previous performances of Bond. <br /> <br /> Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of his early film roles. Bassinger plays the role with great confidence for the relative newcomer, and she makes the character believable. Bassinger confronts his colleagues, and they have considerable chemistry. In fact, she may well outshine her smuggler "Thunderbol" performed by Claudine Ozher. <br /> <br /> Then there is the villain Maximilian Largo, played by Klaus Maria Brandauer. Largo from Brandauer is all that a villain from a James Bond movie should be: courteous, charming, wicked and, above all, believable. Brandauer makes the role realistic and decides not to fall into the trap that many other villains of Bond fell into, having overcome the upper hand. Brandauer plays Largo with a silent threat and charisma unprecedented in many opponents. 007. <br /> <br /> The excellent cast also extends to the supporting cast. Barbara Carrera makes a beautiful minion in Fatima Blush, and the screen appears when she appears. Max Von Sydow is as good as Blofeld, although his appearance looks more like a cameo. Rowan Atkinson appears as Bond's awkward touch that makes some of the best scenes in the film. At the same time, the main point in the cast belongs to Edward Fox's M MI6 employees, who strongly contrast with Bernard Lee, Pamela Salem, who makes affine Moneypenny and icing on the cake a wonderful Q Alex Mac Coven. he has a couple of misfires, although in the form of Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter and Gavin O'Herlihih as Jack Petachi, who seem to lack confidence in their roles. Otherwise, this film is one of the best actors ever collected for a Bond movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to the great cast, there are several other important ingredients in the film. From the initial episode in Central America to the Battle of the Bushes and underwater episodes and motorcycle races, this is a movie in which the action episodes are not only great, but also serve the plot for the most part. The film also shows good special effects in terms of cruise missile models, explosions and all that we expect from a Bond movie. Irwin Kershner, then still beginning to appear in “The Empire Strikes Back,” brings into the film a harsh sense of direction, especially in such episodes as the substation of nuclear warheads and the subsequent theft of cruise missiles. <br /> <br /> Yet this film is far from perfect. Never say never again is one of the oldest Bond films in which computer video games of the 1980s are widely used. While the technology dates any movie after a while, the great dependence on this film, especially in hijacking of the cruise missiles and the Domination sequence, makes the film look incredibly dated about a quarter of a century after its release. The script also suffers from predictability due to the fact that this is a remake of Thunderball. <br /> <br /> However, for its predictability, the “Never say never” scenario is pretty good. The script demonstrates good dialogue scenes, not a single lurch worthy of one liner (how many scenes from the Roger Moore era can you say about it?), Some humorous situations, but at the same time watchable and tense for the most part. As soon as you look back in time at the fact that this is a remake, there are many good things in the script of the film. <br /> <br /> In fact, music is the biggest weakness of the film. Due to the “unofficial” status of the film, the James Bond theme cannot be used. It said that it could show with the right composer that Bond's score without it might work. Unfortunately, the assessment of Michael Legrand is far from adequate. Legrand's rating is completely out of place in a Bond movie, and there is only one or two places where it really works. Worse, the film is also burdened with one of the worst title series ever awarded to the James Bond film. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it is very outdated, somewhat predictable and has a bad score, “Never Say Never” is still a good Bond movie. With one of the best shots of any Bond movie, good action sequences, good special effects, good leadership and some terrific dialogues, this film proves that the “unofficial” is not a bad thing. In fact, it is better than Octopussy and the winner of the Battle of Bonds.
