It is very difficult to find new information about JFK Jr. And there was very little in this beautiful film, but it was nice to watch. The casting was very good, and the script, although similar to a documentary, was also good. My only complaint was that it was not long enough. Perhaps a two-part film could tell us more about his “pre-George” days and his relationship with his mother, sister, and other relatives. Some materials from Richard Blow's book “American Son” could significantly improve the film. WTBS is welcome for making such an entertaining movie.
