A year after her triumphant first feature film, “My Name Is Barbra,” Barbra Streisand teamed up with her film crew to create this special release of CBS-TV in revolutionary color. First broadcast in March 1966, Color Me Barbra follows a format similar to its predecessor - three segments, the first two with unique concepts. The first takes place in the halls outside the clocks of the Philadelphia Museum of Fine Arts, where, dressed as an old maid, she wanders through the galleries and becomes part of the work through the song. In different guises, Streisand expresses different moods: from the comedy joke “Minute Waltz” to the melodrama “Non C'est Rien” in Modigliani’s painting to the crazy hipster style “Gotta Move” set for abstract art. My favorite moment in the special edition is when it turns into the dead bell of Queen Nefertiti, performing the obsessive rendition of Rogers and Hart's “Where or When”. <br /> <br /> Opening with another comic monologue, full of stupid non-sequiturs, this time in French, the second segment returned to the studio for a vibrant circus potpourri where she talks to animals, including his beloved poodle Sadie. She finds a suitable context for "Sam, you made your pants too long" with a lot of penguins and ridiculously compare your profile with an anteater with "We have so much in common." As in the first special edition, the program ends with an exciting solo concert where she sings several chestnuts: “Wherever I hang my hat, at home”, “Where am I going?” And “Starting here, starting now” among them. Also included is a brief introduction, which she shot in 1986, ironically dressed in all white, when a special video was first released on VHS. Matching the locale and song is even more effective than in its first special release, and the 23-year-old Streisand is in great shape.
