There are some pretty shocking scenes and scenes in this film, considering that it was shot in 1971. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood, Geraldine Page and Elizabeth Hartman do an excellent job in the film, as are all the actors. /> <br /> The film takes place during the civil war. The film begins with a wounded Yankee soldier, Johnny, portrayed by Clint Eastwood, providing shelter and assistance at a women's academy in the south. <br /> <br /> The principal, Miss Farnsworth (Geraldine Page), one teacher — Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman), and a small group of sexually mature girls — were without a man, perhaps for too long. <Br /> <br /> Although their commitment lies with the Confederation, their emotions and physical needs definitely lead them in the opposite direction. Johnny immediately uses his male charms to try to lure women to their side - and keep them from passing it on to patrols. <br /> <br /> However, feelings previously inflamed by incestuous behavior, an adulterous father, cruel rape and teenage inexperience combined with jealousy - turn everything upside down with some unexpected consequences for both Johnny and the school residents. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
