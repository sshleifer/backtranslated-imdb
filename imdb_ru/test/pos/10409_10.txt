Anyone familiar with horror movies knows that most of them are not at all scary. Some people like griefs with low-quality storylines and character development. I personally like horror films, which tell about the atmosphere and interesting concepts (for example, “The Tale of Two Sisters”, “Cairo”, etc.). Whatever the horror movie that you personally like, only a few really scare you. Nora is one of them. <br /> <br /> This is a documentary film which means that the entire film is a compilation of video clips linked by a legend of a demonic creature named Kagutaba. It is assumed that the journalist shot his own footage by interviewing people associated with the demonic rituals associated with Kagutaba, and then collected footage from other sources that are related to his research. The result is a relentlessly frightening experience that seems very real and very disturbing, despite the fact that the story itself is fake. <br /> <br /> Some people compare Norah with the Blair Witch Project, but the only similarity is the documentary style. One obvious difference between the films is that Nora scares the viewer by linking events to each other using different sources. For example, a journalist records the appearance of a house, which he explores, and sees something strange on the porch. Later in the film, a clip from a home video of another character represents the same strange occurrence. The memory of the viewer connects two incidents, and the chill begins to descend the spine. Another example is a television show with a child psychic who correctly answers every question except one. In fact, her answer is so wrong that the viewer may wonder what the filmmakers thought. Later, however, this incorrect answer is associated with an extremely alarming event. This is really smart filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Another difference between Nora and Blair Whitch is that Nora gives not one, but two very long finals, the second of which is placed a minute after the start of the rental. and is the single greatest scary scene in horror movie history. I do not say such things lightly. It absolutely struck me wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Other aspects of filmmaking are well done. The legend and ritual background of Kagutaby are very interesting, and most of the actors did a good job. The only excellent performance comes from a guy who still needs to be crazy, so this is expected. The cinematography is deliberately harsh, because all frames must be videos taken with video cameras. Japanese films are not known for their special effects, but the effects used here were amazing. In some cases, they create an otherworldly feeling (for example, static noise or the first final), but in other cases they are frighteningly realistic (for example, the second final). <br /> <br /> When all is said and done, Norah becomes the scariest film I've ever seen. I would go so far as to say that there is no film that would give such horror from beginning to end, as Nora does. Take a look now.
