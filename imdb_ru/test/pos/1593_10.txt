Death in Venice is a film that I need to watch every ten years. It is always different, because I am always at a different stage of life. <br /> <br /> The film tells about art, beauty, longing, death. Some scenes are painfully slow, others are just annoying, especially if you've seen them before. And yet I would not want to miss a single frame. The music repeats, the main theme of the adagietto from the fifth Mahler is used again and again. And yet I would not want to miss a single note. When the last image disappears, the last note dies, I'm numb and exhausted. <br /> <br /> This film is a monument to filmmaking. As with most really good movies, on Saturday night the crowd should stay away from it. And this is just the best movie ever.
