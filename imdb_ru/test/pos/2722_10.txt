Aparna Sen has indeed come a long way from “36 Chowringhee Lane” to “15 Park Avenue”. If the first goes down in history as a pure movement of a debutant, the latter will definitely highlight a special place as a “mature” film. Until you see 15 Park Avenue, you cannot imagine that you are feeling excited and moving at the same time. Thrilled to see the inventiveness and dexterity of the director in depicting serious difficult situations, and touched by the sensitivity reflected throughout the film. This is not a film that just makes you feel that the life of the schizophrenic should be difficult, but it makes you ask a much deeper question about the reality that you see and believe in. Sen did a brilliant job highlighting this supreme fact of our existence, that we all, one way or another, are trying to live in an imaginary world, trying to pursue mirages called happiness, peace, satisfaction. Along with the depiction of the delusional mind, Sen's magic revealed many small nuances of human relationships, as they withstand stress and tension. The fact that sometimes we all lose peace of mind, fail, make wrong decisions, are persecuted by guilt, behave selfishly, etc., the Senator catches him with extreme agility. She showed a cruel dilemma that Shabane had to face all her life having to choose between a schizophrenic sister and a normal life with her husband and children for herself. And in the process of always being close to her sister, always being a strong personality, giving support, making judgments and so on, she unknowingly turned off the oxygen that her sister needed to blossom. Is it not a very harsh truth that sometimes, trying to do something for someone better, we stifle their assertiveness and ultimately damage their self-esteem? Of course, the actions of Konkon and Shabana deserve laurels, as always, because if the ingredients were not so good, the dish could not be so unusual. Aparna Sen again made a masterpiece of the film for those who yearn for some “food for thought”. Bravo!
