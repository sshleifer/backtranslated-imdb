OK. Finally, a horror movie that is well done. As soon as I heard the music, I realized that some efforts had been made to create what I consider almost a masterpiece of good horror. Zombies, whores, booze, graves and more. A great cast, well-functioning, well-directed, well-written â€” there was hardly a flaw. Even American actors with the Irish-English accent really coped. I thought the actor Larry Fessenden looked familiar to me. It was that missing tooth. Finally, I realized that this guy was leading in the movie "The Habit" about vampires in New York. I thought he was excellent in this role. Now I wonder if he is American or not. His accent was so convincing in I Sell that I thought he grew up on an emerald island and not in the USA. Well, obviously, he was born and raised in New York. Great actor - really made his role in this film. Nothing compares to a horror film that occurred in Europe in the early 19th century (like old Hammer films). I urge everyone who wants to have a great time, watch this well-created film.
