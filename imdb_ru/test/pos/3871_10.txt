Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in! I love to watch it !! I was 10 years old (1979) when I first saw him. I look forward to everyone and everything in which he will play. I hope one day I can see him in person. he is very hypnotic and mysterious, and this voice is commanding and strong! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely amazing !!!! In my opinion, he is the greatest actor I've ever seen! I adored him in “Dracula” (along with many other girls), in “God created a woman”, “House D”, “Jason and the Argonauts” and many others. I thought he was a genius !!!!!! can't wait to see him in "good night and good luck"
