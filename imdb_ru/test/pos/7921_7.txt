This is one of those films where you have to put aside some of its obvious flaws (the result of the date and place of its production) and emphasize the positive. In many ways, this is truly a great movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the parody in a one-line resume, but the most serious drawback for an English speaker like me was terrible subtitles. The imprint I saw in 1982 was the Soviet subtitle Export Movie, which consistently used an inverted grammar, apparently to create the impression of a 13th-century speech. The real effect of this nonsense is to make it difficult to keep track of the subtitles, which means that you spend less time viewing images. Considering that cinematic images are a big force of this film, this is a real problem. <br /> <br /> Other IMDBs have written extensively about the Stalinist propaganda elements of this film (in case the viewer does not notice them for themselves). They also wrote a lot about the battle on the ice scene, which, in my opinion, is excellent. <br /> <br /> Love interest almost lacks subtlety, and, nevertheless, strange ... almost completely lacking charm. But it is good to shrivel from time to time. <br /> <br /> I was familiar with Prokofievâ€™s music for this film long before I watched the movie. Images and music perfectly complement each other. And these are images that will be remembered for a long time. Bergman obviously learned a lot from these images - images of his medieval works (for example, The Seventh Seal, The Virgin Spring) were based and strengthened Eisenstein's ideas. This film was shot in 1938 in the USSR. In this context, it is a masterpiece, although flawed. <br /> <br /> For the modern viewer, I suggest you go with the flow and enjoy the many treats on the show.
