What's wrong with you people? John Dahl? From "Shuler" and "Unforgettable"? Whimsical LLP? Knocking Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman for having fun playing against the type? Did someone like the Gingerbread Man? <br /> <br /> I rented it without knowing anything about it, and found that the video was as elegant as possible. Never hurt, well thought out, funny, scary. I disagree with the skeptics, clearly. I thought that the story itself was unremarkable, but the great cast, which most likely means that the director paid attention, raised it to super cool status. Good sound design (much more appreciated in surround sound, but I'm not bragging). And yes, I'm a girl, so maybe she has a small female bias (the guys in the gang are pretty standing). In general, 9 and cordial RECOMMEND.
