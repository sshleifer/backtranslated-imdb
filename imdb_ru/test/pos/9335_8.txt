It may be a bit creaky now, and it certainly can never have the influence that once had, but it is still an exciting reminder of what Michael Jackson could have done sometime. Looking back now, for the first time since his outstanding fame, I was struck by not horrible attributes - strange but funny, and Vincent Price never sounded so sincere, unattractive (so?) Threateningly - than his absorption of a horror film, allowing Jackson for genre make-up give us a boldly revealing portrait of male sexuality. <br /> <br /> Because THRILLER is not really about horror, but horror is not really about horror: this is about the eternal theme, the sexual awakening of a young woman. The film begins in the cinema, where the girl Jackson does not like the images and aggressive gender response. Of course, she's on a date, and the movie scares her less than what she knows her boyfriend will expect. <br /> <br /> The main images of the film that they watch, the atmosphere of the group all suggest socially determined expectations. This makes her not only think about the body with disgust - hence all the decaying ghouls; the loss of her virginity is regarded as a kind of death - but the sexual rite concerns not only her boyfriend, but also her peers, her society, so his visualization is a violation of the gang. <br /> <br /> This is a great worrying thing, the best that director Landis has ever done. Jackson, the most popular artist on the planet, still wanted to show that the still image of the star contained many people, and not all of them are encouraging. The song itself was surprisingly well-kept: eerie, persistent bass rhythms, unusually obscene lyrics, wonderful disco ecstasies of the 70s, sounding in the refrain, destroying timelessness, revealing the milk desire behind fear.
