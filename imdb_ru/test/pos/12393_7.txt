It is generally accepted that Marcel Carne’s films of 1936–1946 are masterpieces, and it is considered polite to say that everyone else is mediocrity. This is an unfair opinion: at least the last two eras are most watchable: the best post-war work, and "les tricheurs" (cheats). <br /> <br /> A strange evolution from the Prevert Golden Hour to "les tricheurs": in "les enfants du paradis", "quai des brumes" "or" le jour se lève, "true love is torn by villains. In" Les Tricheurs "True love no longer exists: we are dealing with a group of young people who do not believe in anything, falling in love with it would be inappropriate for these young people. Adults are not at all villains: Mika's brother and mother are kind people, but she is not in their power In any case, very few adults appear. <br /> <br /> For two hours, the heroes do not stop playing, dancing, listening to jazz records (music that has not vuchala) part of bourgeois culture) and drunkenness. When two of them find that they care about each other, it will be too late. <br /> <br /> The cast is pretty good, Laurent Terziev is an existentialist cynic, and Andrea Parisi is rich the child stands out. On the other hand, Pascal Petit and mainly Jacques Charieu (who married Brigitte Bardot in the same year as Les Tricheurs) do not have the ambiguity that their parts ask for. too cute and nice to be believable. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, les tricheurs was nouvelle vague! You know that the priests of this film school (such as Godard) thought about Karna, this is a really good joke. But this disappointment that you feel throughout the entire film really bothers you.
