Elegant documentary - <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie ... if you are a selfish know-it-all who studies physics. This much less than one percent (a small part) of the population may find that this show simply tells them what they have already learned and already know. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie! - If you are one of the overwhelming majority of people who belong to more than 99% of the population that does not study or already has in-depth knowledge of such theories of physics as relativity theory, quantum, string and M-theory. br /> <br /> What a brilliant documentary. Starting with some useful historical background, you will step by step elegantly walk into the Universe of pure magic - and measurements beyond its borders. I have always appreciated mathematics. This film can easily give you an idea of ​​what exquisitely beautiful language math is, without making you feel as if you are going to fail. <br /> <br /> The show is repeated from time to time, since the original format was a mini-series divided into three shows. Therefore, it makes sense to politely remind us of the principles being represented. I found this extremely useful, as it constantly reminded me of the multitude of questions and possible answers that make up this amazing tapestry of our very existence. <br /> <br /> We are all (and all around us) - vibrational energy with a natural tendency to harmony. This film can blow your mind, or at least help you realize that the universe is much larger than what we see around (even with the Hubble telescope), and much smaller than the protons and neutrons in atoms that we learned about school. M-theory has many great quantities of "opportunity." <br /> <br /> It just seemed appropriate that all this elegance, by its very nature, should break out (as acknowledged by many eminent scientists representing) from the field. science and in the field of philosophy. <br /> <br /> You don’t have to be religious to feel that this film has brought you one step closer to God. <br /> <br /> Bravo Brian Green, Well done indeed. <br /> <br /> P.S. If you are interested in feeling even more comfortable and feeling at home in your place in the Universe and would like to get a deeper understanding of the “possibilities” that quantum mechanics can bring in conjunction with spirituality (of all things), then I I highly recommend that you also watch “What a sleeper!? - down the rabbit hole. Yes, I know that they make some stupid mistakes, assuming that the shaman may not see the boat if he has not seen her before (my eyes process the reflections very well - I see things every day that I have never seen before) and cells The brain is the body cells that do not actually divide. But if you can overcome these little obstacles and put aside things that you don’t like, and become attached to what you are doing, there’s something to please in this film. <br /> <br /> Then watch “The Secret” (2006 documentary on the Law of Attraction - search by IMDb title "tt0846789"). This information can change your life deeply - forever. If you search deeper, you may even find that the Universe speaks to us with thought (if you listen), and some - and this is really incredible. There is a modern day of Jesus / Muhammad / Buddha (those who, as history suggests, communicated with non-physical) are alive today, and she lives in Texas. I know some of you know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> I do not consider myself religious by any traditional definitions, but I have never felt more at home or as comfortable in the Universe as it is now.
