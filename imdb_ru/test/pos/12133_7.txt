I saw the version of this in the 4 Mafia DVD compilation released by Brentwood, and I have to admit that it was a good movie. The quality was a little worse for clothes, but it was a well-played and realistic drama involving the low-level gangsters of New Jersey. The sands once again though, have become a show!
