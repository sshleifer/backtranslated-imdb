This is NOT a Snow White, Cinderella or Bambi masterpiece, but it's a very sweet, pleasant, romantic, well-made Disney animation feature. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are lessons here. for kids and some very suitable cheeks for toddlers, but there are plenty for adults too. <br /> <br /> Although this is partly a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still contains some elements that belong exclusively to AristoCats. O'Malley is a “tramp” and Dutches is a “lady,” but Dutches has a few kittens and they all try to get home. <br /> <br /> Phil Harris is our cat O'Malley. You can recognize his voice because he also introduced the voice of Bear Balu in the Book of the Jungle and Little John at Robin Hood of Disney. Eva Gabor transmits her silky sweet voice to Dutches. <br /> <br /> Directed by Wolfgang Raiterman, director or working on each Disney animated film, which is worth mentioning before his death in 1985. <br /> <br /> This is one of my all-time favorite Disney animated films, and it belongs to any Disney collection. A special edition for 2 discs will be released this summer (2007). <br /> <br /> This is 8.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
