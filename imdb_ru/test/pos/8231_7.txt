This is a modest, unassuming traditional Western with a formal story about opposition between ranchers and farmers around the city of Liberal, Kansas. The story is essentially ordinary and includes a number of classic Western conflicts. There is a farmer against a herdsman; there is a clash between cultivated land and “civilized” tendencies, on the one hand, and ideas of wilderness / frontier, on the other, and ultimately this is the juxtaposition of two value systems — democratic and social values, opposed to coarse individualism. /> <br /> Randolph Scott plays legendary attorney Beth Masterton, who travels to Liberal on the orders of a land agent (Robert Ryan) to help him deal with the bad guys who are drunk, herdsmen fights. Two men quarrel, but reunite to cope with problematic elements in the city. <br /> <br /> The script is a cliché, but the action goes along with the energy by director Ray Enright, and there are serious performances all and. In addition to the stormy performances of men, there is a comic relief provided by George Gabby Hayes, an oily villain, pleasantly played by Steve Brodie, and Maggie Meredith's attractive contribution as the main and proper Orientalist who is looked after by Ryan and Ann Jeffries as a salon singer. Award for originality, this is a good strong entertainment for Western lovers
