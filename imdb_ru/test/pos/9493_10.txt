I just reviewed a few episodes of this series on very bad VHS tapes, which I recorded the series. I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> Ramona is based on the children's books of Beverly Cleary and follows the adventures of the title eight-year (Sarah Polley). She has fun with friends and family and gets in trouble, like many eight-year-olds. All ten episodes are pretty good. Mystery Meal gives me away as a vegan, but it's fun to see parents trying to get their kids to eat cow's tongue! And any episode in which Godzilla against Smog is mentioned twice cannot be bad. I like Ramona's Bad Day even more. Despite the fact that Ramona is experiencing a difficult day, she is upset, but she imagines that she is taking revenge on the uncle of her friend Howe (before the Psi factor Barclay Hope) who always teases her. "Beautiful day" is also good. <br /> <br /> Lori Chodos plays Bezusa, Ramona’s sister. I swear, I saw her elsewhere, but IMDb doesn’t list anything except this show. Unfortunately, this series is not on DVD. Why is every shit show these days done on DVD, besides what I really would like to buy? Injustice, if ever there was one!
