“Two Hands” is a very pleasant offender from Australia, who ultimately succeeds due to the fact that the film easily combines tense dramatic moments with very funny characters and situations to give the film the right balance and feeling. The comedy of the film takes place naturally, and the laughter was not thought out to the smallest detail and not too thought out. It's really very funny, because every character in the film is excellent, and that every actor / actress recognizes and can relate to Australian humor. They portray it very well and very realistic. Of course, the fantastic script of the writer / director Gregor Jordan helps them a lot. I read another review of this film by an American who saw him, and he subjected him to harsh criticism, passing him off as a clone of Pulp Fiction. I think it's just rubbish. This film is not trying to be fiction, the feeling and style of each of these excellent films are exactly the opposite. Not wanting to appear superior or arrogant, I think to fully understand this film; humor, sincerity, characters, etc. You must be an Australian, or at least understand a culture that the other guy obviously had no clue about. Some Americans, whose reviews of some non-American films, seem ignorant (and have difficulty understanding) of everything that is not an American product. This is a real shame because it is a really great movie. The love story between the protagonist and the girl is also very realistic, sincere and cute. I am very proud that this film is in my collection. 4.5 out of 5.
