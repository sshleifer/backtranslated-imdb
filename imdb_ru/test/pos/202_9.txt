In Moscow, a young couple Veronika (T. Samoilova) and Boris (Alexey Batalov) are very fond of each other. During World War II, Boris voluntarily joined the army and went to the front one day before Veronika’s birthday, and they have no opportunity to say goodbye to each other. Waiting for news from Boris Veronica, Boris's cousin (A. Shvorin) will rape him, and they marry each other. However, Veronica does not forget Boris and continues to wait for him. <br /> <br /> “Cranes are flying” is an impressive and heartbreaking romance during the war. The direction is excellent and uses ellipses along history, including in the metropolitan scene, when Veronica is raped by Mark. Camera work is awesome, with complex planes and angles, and a long journey. Veronica's scenes in the middle of the tanks or at the train station with many defendants are amazing. Great cinematography is emphasized by the recovered DVD image. T. Samoilova has an extremely beautiful face, a touching and sensitive performance. The last scene is another great example of an anti-war film. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Quando Voam as Cegonhas” (“When storks fly”)
