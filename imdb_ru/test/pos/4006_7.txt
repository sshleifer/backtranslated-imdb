I can't hate the show. When the old (and better) technical television had to hit the bricks, the channel was reformatted and new shows entered. “Attack of the show” is a replacement for “Screensavers”, with 3 co-owners at the beginning. These were Kevin Rose, Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane. Brendan Moran also became co-host, but mostly he did pre-recorded plays for the show. Kevin Rose decided to leave the show, and in the end, there was a contest to see who would be the third owner, but this did not work out for some reason. <br /> <br /> In the end (I just found out about this very IMDb bulletin board) Sarah Lane and Brendan Moran went further because (hey, this is what I read) they got married. It was a big secret for me! Now there is a new female co-host, not too hot (my opinion) Olivia Mann. She hides something in those tops that she wears, and Sarah Lane had a perfect body, and she was not afraid to show it. <br /> <br /> AHEM! Excuse me. <br /> <br /> Attack Show is dedicated to everything that young people want to know. This music, movies, comics, the Internet and television. This is what's great in the show. If you do not want to search online or spend time watching MTV, you can get everything you want on AOTS. Some of the segments and bits they make are fun. They have regular guests and members who work in the industry, as well as guests who range from minor internet stars to real big names. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the hosts are not such jerks as I would like to be, I still found the “Attack of the Show” to be interesting, even with its latest lineup.
