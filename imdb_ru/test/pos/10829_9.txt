Director and author Jean-Pierre Rappenau was 8 years old in the spring of 1940, when the Third Republic of France fell apart within a few weeks. It was a time, he says, when "all the adults were a little crazy." With production and love, he and the production staff recreated this world in a film where all the characters are essentially fictional. The structure, a classic farce, is ideal for a period, since many lines of the plot penetrate and intersect only in order to gather into a logical, satisfactory conclusion. The plot for this story is Frederick, played by the brilliant newcomer Gregory Dranger, who is fully prepared to play against Ajani, Depardieu and Ledoyen. The real strength of the film is in its supporting actions. M. Rappeno portrayed the film exquisitely with actors who offered ideas for both action and dialogue, and who know and prove that the character can be fully realized with just two short sentences of dialogue. Bon Voyage, although not as influential as Renoirâ€™s Rules of the Game, deserves to be his companion. Although it requires a large amount of audience, it returns a lot. One of its requirements is tolerance for a certain shyness and wrong direction in relation to the genre we are seeing: criminal melodrama, no, spy thriller, ah, romantic comedy. I recommend it to fellow film fans. Just make sure they discover that this is a romantic comedy.
