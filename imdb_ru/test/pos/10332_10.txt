This film is an educational material for my English lesson, but its depth and meaning impressed me. As we carefully study all the facts and characters of this film, his interesting story about love, hate, war and prejudice. Highly recommended! <br /> <br /> History: a girl named wealthy Jew Patty Bergen meets an escaped prisoner of war, then she hides him in her playhouse in her huge gardens, and when they get to know each other, they begin to see the qualities of others and earn love each other. Patty's father despises her and treats her like dirt. Anton (POW) is almost covered up to protect her, but Patty manages to stop him before anyone sees him.
