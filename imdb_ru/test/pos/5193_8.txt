When I went to college and studied Western history, the views on World War II are very disappointing and completely wrong. The Second World War was the most visible and bloody affair in world history. Although the Axis powers committed many crimes against humanity, which still remains a true opinion, and the right people forget that not every German soldier wanted to exterminate the Jewish population, not every Japanese soldier waving a samurai sword and performed kamikaze missions, and every Italian soldier was a fascist . Most of these soldiers for the Axis powers were normal people like you, and I got into a terrible conflict and just fought for the country I loved. <br /> <br /> The battle of Stalingrad was perhaps the most deadly battle. in world history with more than 1,500,000 casualties suffered during the battle. The film "Stalingrad" tells about the German platoon and its commander, Lieutenant von Witzland, when they cross over to the Eastern Front to fight against the Soviets at Stalingrad. Von Witzland acts as a kind of protagonist with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. All of them are normal people and seem to be completely unaware of what is happening in Germany and Poland. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the course of the battle. The film as a whole is very dull when it comes to portraying battle and soldier life during a battle. We are shown numerous horrific battles and intense violence outside the battles (including the sequence of execution). In general, battles are the earliest examples that I know of, which depict the loss of limbs and, in general, the consequences of death and violence. Much of the inspiration for saving the rank-and-file combat ranks of Private Ryan seems to have come from this film. <br /> <br /> The film does not set out to make German completely innocent of all that is in the film. Several high-ranking army officers are depicted in the usual form of evil for most people. Most of the soldiers are just normal people who often talk about the house. The film quickly makes it clear that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most of the country and the army completely forgot that the genocide had taken place. The film makes it clear that the soldiers in the German army simply fought for a cause that they really did not understand, and most of all wanted to just go home and not freeze at negative temperatures in Russia. <br /> <br /> The film really shows how hellish war, especially World War II. Scenes of battle will strike you with their coarse realism, and this story is fairly easy to follow, as you simply follow the platoon during the battle. As with most war movies, do not expect much happiness after watching. This will leave you in a slightly depressed mood, simply by seeing the lives of most of the soldiers on the Eastern Front. Not recommended for children. <br /> <br /> 4/5 stars
