I saw this movie when I was very young, living in Houston, Texas. I really liked this film, and I wrote Gene Peters in Hollywood, and I told her how I liked to see her in this film. She sent me an autographed photo. This film was shot by Jacques Turner, as well as starring Gene Peters. They are also stars of Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget and Herbert Marshall. It was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes. Gene Peters was married to Howard Hughes. She also starred in "Viva Zapata" with Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn, who received an Oscar for his role as Zapata's brother (Marlon Brando starred as Zapata) (1952). And she also starred in the movie "Captain of Castile" (1947) with Tyrone Power. Since then, I have tried to find a place where it is available, but so far I have not achieved success. Does anyone have any suggestions on where I can find and buy this film? This comment contains spoilers, I do not know about it.
