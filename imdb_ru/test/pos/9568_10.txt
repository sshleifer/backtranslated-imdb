This must be the funniest movie I've ever seen. Chritopher Guest is really talented. He has a gift of humor. I almost died of laughter. In fact, when I saw it in cinemas, I thought about leaving, because the film was so stupid. But it is stupid in a good way. This is ridiculous silly. And this is a really good combination. You will laugh from start to finish. <br /> <br /> This mokumentary film is followed by many characters who compete at the dog show at the Kennel Club. Starring Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, John Michael Higgens, Michael McKean, Larry Miller, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Coolidge and many others. <br /> <br /> This is a really funny movie that makes everyone laugh. Someone born without a personality would laugh at this movie. It is presented in widescreen mode to give the image you are viewing an actual documentary, and this is probably what adds to the fun. BEST IN SHOW: 5/5.
