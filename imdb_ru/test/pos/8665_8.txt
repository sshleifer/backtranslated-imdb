It would seem that we should recognize the Scandinavian cinema not just the movement "Dogma-1995", created by the Danes many years ago. Den Brysomme Mannen, or The Bothersome Man in English, is a surreal and deeply thought film, but very interesting and rich in content both on the surface and below the surface. Like one film, this is a terrible comedy about society and relationships in the postmodern world in which we live; a world that, judging by The Brossome Man, has reached the regions of Norway and the like. But along with this sense of black comedy, it would seem that the film goes deeper a bit and raises questions, at least for me, about the metaphorical religious spaces and our human instinct, which wants to reveal the truth among so much material in our world that it is possible it seems alien. <br /> <br /> In truth, it was a fantastic introduction to modern Norwegian cinema. The film falls into this category of European art cannon with its deep themes and ambiguous atmosphere, while maintaining an open finale and not so much a narration as a sequence of events that can mean one thing or another. So many times we have seen films that use the script that The Bothersome Man accepts, and so many times it has turned into an almost predictable routine revolving around a detective story, a story of stalking, or something like that, but this film allows you to set it up and situation to act as a simple background for his main character, named Andreas (Fausa Aurvaag), to explore who he is; where it is located, and what are actually possible riddles behind this place. <br /> <br /> I say that the hero arrived at the place without prior memory or what happened before. I will jump right in and say that, in my opinion, he is dead and was sent to some purgatory, like all the inhabitants of the city. Everything in the city with which Andreas communicates is of the same age; the same mentality and the same attitude, which allows me to assume that most of them are victims of their own suicide and were sent to purgatory, devoid of any emotions, feelings, skin color or, most importantly, pain. <br /> <br /> When we see Andreas for the first time, he gets off the bus, which he later discovers, strange in his abilities, and approaches the gas station in the middle of the countryside. He is untidy and with a huge beard, but soon he will be on the contrary, dressed in a suit and tie; A clean-shaven face and his own home, full of new work, in which the film makes one of the best transformative changes between rural and urban that I have ever seen. But a new job, like a new city, is not easy; You can take breaks whenever you want; bosses are extraordinarily kind, and it seems that there is no emotion or reaction to something. These ideas are best shown at the cinema when Andreas, still a relative newcomer to the city, cries and is clearly influenced by the film being shown, but everyone else is looking in stone. There is also an initial example where one person jumped out of a window and stuck into several thorns, but everyone goes without fuss. <br /> <br /> In confirmation of my idea that everyone is already dead and the city plays as a kind of purgatory, death and harm are impossible in general. There is a particularly unpleasant scene with an electronic paper guillotine and someone's thumb, but everyone’s reaction to this event is a stony face, and in an hour it grows. Similarly, a suicide attempt involving trains doesn’t lead to anything later, and instead we get a point of view on what it is like to drag pipe tracks with invulnerability on your side. The city acts as a barrier, a painless society in which the masochistic need for self-harm is impossible; a place in which sexual relations can occur and break in the same way, but both in the absence of emotions and in the absence of passion; a place where people can commit suicide, but it's really impossible to die. The city accepts these forces because the damage has already been done in “real life”, and therefore the film says that you cannot kill yourself twice, in reality you cannot feel pain or emotions in the afterlife of purgatory. <br /> <br /> But the best part of the movie is the one that sneaks up on you. Judging by the final five minutes of the film and an additional storyline that reveals some kind of music that came from another person’s home, it would seem that there is a fine line between the spaces that the film dictates as “heaven” and “hell”. Can we see these places very, very briefly ?? so briefly that they consist of one shot. “Heaven” is a colorful kitchen with music and children playing: it offers life, hope, emotions and happiness, while hell is a snowy nowhere that gives you peace of mind due to hopeless growth and a terrible cut-off point. The introduction of these two places at the very end of the film unexpectedly informs you about the reality of Andreas and Co. came across: purgatory and everything that came with him, the afterlife was simply not ready for Andreas and his free-thinking adventurous mind ?? and see where thinkers end up.
