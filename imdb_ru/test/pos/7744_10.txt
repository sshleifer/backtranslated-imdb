“The Tempest” is a somewhat condescending, bumpy, discursive film. But as Lord Byron, another visitor to Greece, protested against his friend John Murray about his equally condescending and discursive Don Juan: “It can be wasteful, but isn't it life, isn't it?” <Br /> <br /> Links to Shakespeare's Storm may seem, according to another commentator, a bit dubious. But watch the movie again after rereading The Tempest, and they will seem much closer to you. What makes this film erroneous is its uneasy mixture of simple regular narration and sudden harsh seeming improvisation, especially between Cassavetis and Rowland. But to be honest, these scenes are the most wonderful and exciting in the film, although they are the most difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> The music of this film, written by Stuz Yamashta, is also overlooked. Especially beautiful is the beautiful little piece played to accompany the afternoon siesta, when people, animals and, apparently, the whole island are crumbling to ward off the hottest part of the day. This is a sublime moment, reflecting the best aspect of this film and the only thing that makes it somewhat unified, the fact that (except for extensive memories and the very end) is the story of one day on the island, from awakening tonight. <br /> <br /> In general, I'd rather watch this movie a hundred times than I once would have seen some kind of pompous Hollywood piece of shit. And in fact, I probably watched it dozens of times. In most cases, I see something that I missed before. <br /> <br /> (Confession: I'm biased. This was the second film I took to show my wife the Greek-American goddess.) <br /> <br /> Trivia notes on this film: <br /> <br /> - It was the first film by Molly Ringwald, as well as Sam Robards; <br /> <br /> - In fact, it was not filmed on the island, but in Gytheon, the southern tip of the remote Peninsula of Mani, the Peloponnese of Greece; <br /> <br /> - (by today's standards) primitive special effects were made by Bran Ferren, who later became the head of Disney Imagineering, and until now was an adviser to the US intelligence community; <br /> <br /> - Paul Mazursky, the director, chose the title of his recent autobiography “Show Me the Magic” from the Storm script.
