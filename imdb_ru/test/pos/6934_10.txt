Just looked it up again. I wanted to show it to one of my friends, and we had a great time. That is why such films are created for the entertainment of people, and Zombie Bloodbath 2 does it for me and for everyone to whom I showed it. <br /> <br /> The story tells about a group of teenagers in a van that runs into a group of escaped convicts who captured an old farmhouse. When the scarecrow (actually a demon, I think) is alarmed, it comes to life and revives corpses from local cemeteries. This forces our heroes to flee only to the ground in the arms of two insane killers who torture some people in a grocery store in a small town. Pretty soon it will be a fight with people fighting with zombies. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie! From different formats (black and white film, video and digital cameras) to a very fast pace and great music - something always happened, and it NEVER bothers you! Of course, this is cheap, but you can say that great care and hard work was put into this film. I read other reviews, and all I can say is that these people missed the point. If you want a 35mm full moon fluff, or if you like modern things like Urban Legend, then Iâ€™ll say miss. If you like low-budget items such as Gates of Hell and Evil Dead, I say buy it now. <br /> <br /> Makeup and blood are very good, sometimes the game goes unevenly, but overall it's pretty good, and the editing is very impressive. In this film, enough to fill two more films! This is actually one of the best bi-films I've seen in recent years.
