Like some other people, I'm a Mario fan, and I liked this game. <br /> <br /> This game starts a little boring, but believe me, it's worth it. As soon as you start, your hooked up! The levels are fun and exciting. They will hook you until your mind turns to mush. I am not kidding. This game is also organized and beautifully made. <br /> <br /> To release this spoiler, I have to keep my mouth shut about the details. But please try this game! It will be worth it! <br /> <br /> History: 9.9 Action: 10.1 (This is good!) Hardness: 10 Attention Grabber: 10 Average: 10
