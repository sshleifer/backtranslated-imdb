“Babette's Feast” and “Horse's Mouth” are the two most insightful and accurate films about what it means to be a true artist. The key lines in Babette’s Feast are, as some other commentators have said, “the artist is never poor”, and two lines that go before and after him: <br /> <br /> “I managed to make them happy when I I try my best to ... In the whole world, from the heart of the artist, one long cry sounds: give me a chance to do everything possible. ” <br /> <br /> I spent nine years building an experimental multimedia musical theater in San Francisco, raising money for productions, which involved dozens of singers, actors, designers, etc., and the artists I supported, stretched every penny in their efforts to do everything possible. They were like Babette: they were desperate to get every dollar needed for their better work. Babette’s art is excellent French cooking, and for her, to demonstrate her art at its best, it costs 10,000 francs. When, after several years of political exile from France, isolated from two caring spinners on the dark Scandinavian coast, she unexpectedly receives an unexpected income of 10,000 francs, she does what every true artist does: she sees that she suddenly has a chance to do she is very good and therefore she does it. She spends all the money to do her best work as an artist. The highlight in the film is that we don’t know that she is such an artist until she actually cooks and does not serve food. Up until that time, she seemed to be just a working-class Frenchwoman who was a little bargaining with merchants and very serious (her husband and son were killed during the violence in Paris in 1871). <br /> <br /> For such an artist it is secondary that there is an audience for art that can appreciate it. That is why the author has covered this dinner in a community of people who could not understand what they are getting. Babette did not cook this food as a gift to two virgins or a religious community. Her goal was not to achieve reconciliation or a spirit of good feelings among members of a small religious sect. Indeed, she never left the kitchen to talk to any of them. After eating, she sits alone, sipping wine, not paying the slightest attention to the reaction of guests. She enjoys the fact that she finally got a chance to prove herself as an artist. <br /> <br /> That is why it is so nice and so important to the story that the general suddenly shows up - because, as Babetta instantly knows, the general will know what she put in front of him, and I will appreciate it. Indeed, in the great work of art shown to the public, there is a kind of tragedy that even one person lacks who can appreciate it. She is glad, very glad that he has come, in fact he is the only guest she mentions for the whole dinner, the only one she selects for special treatment is none of the spearsters. But she did not plan the meal, knowing that such a person would come for her. <br /> <br /> For everyone who had the opportunity to enjoy a real first-class Parisian dinner like me (my father was a naval attache in Paris in the 1980s, and I had a honeymoon in France), this dinner, and Babette's satisfaction in cooking, and the pleasure he brings to visitors, is absolutely convincing. If any art is able to fill the recipient with a sense of joy, this is good French food prepared and served in France. This film claims to transform the influence of great art on the recipients. Before dinner, members of a small religious sect quarrel, harboring old grievances. Old hymns cannot restore good communication; people ignore them, discuss them. But the general experience of sensual great art - because people can enjoy the tastes of dishes and wines, even if they have no idea that they are experiencing great art - satisfies people, instills in them a forgiving mood, reconciles them, and makes them happy, encourages them to love each other and, thus, has a divine sacred impact on the world. This is a requirement of the modern art movement - art can supplant traditional religions, making humanity more peaceful. Thus, unlike those commentators who say that this film speaks of the strength of the Christian faith, it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can heal wounds that a Christian ritual cannot. After all my years in the art world, I must say that this statement — that art brings peace, which religion cannot — is exaggerated and invalid. But this is pretty vanity, and this is the second main theme of this beautiful film. <br /> <br /> One final note: on the arrival of Babette to the house of the spinters, the French general Galliffet was named as a special name. a man who, in 1871, executed Babette’s husband and son and introduced the military rule that she had to flee. At the end of the film, when the general tells the story of a magnificent meal, which he enjoyed in Paris many years ago (until 1871), after completing some military maneuvers, it turns out that the same Halifett was his master during the meal. As the general says, the French general Galliffet rated the chefs of this food as the greatest woman, the only woman for whom he would risk his life. Of course, that woman was Babette. Thus, ironically, the same French general, who said that he honors Babette above all other women, is responsible for the fact that she expelled her from France forever.
