The first film at the Fangoria festival in Vegas and the most complex. This is not a movie for everyone. Many subsequent films used predictable classical horror formulas to tell predictable stories. This picture seemed set to do something of its own. <br /> <br /> Tom Savini showed some comic pictures in the role of the main villain. He dominated every scene he was in, turning his cloak around like a Leslie Nilson playing Dracula. It was great to hear his explanations after the film. He had such a good sense of humor about this role. <br /> <br /> I was glad that I didnâ€™t have too many preconceived opinions, because the film had many surprises. The story was funny, profane and unusual. There was a lot of love wasted on appearance. Most importantly, it was a strange advantage. Unlike many films that followed and tried to use a similar classic horror style, it was a film that used its appearance for a specific purpose. <br /> <br /> At the Fangoria festival there were a lot of films with a big budget. But no one dared to be that different.
