It was a really pleasant surprise. I woke up last night and could not sleep. Without really thinking, I turned on the TV and turned on the HBO, and this film was just beginning. Fortunately, I saw it all, and I am very happy that I did. Because this film was very good. The actors were well chosen and they did an amazingly good job. Chris Christofferson showed a solid performance, there were many essences in his lines. This film made me realize that he is a good actor. Brian Keith was a great father, as was Trey Wilson playing the Colonel (this was the last role played by Trey Wilson before his untimely death. Too bad, he was a quality actor and seemed like a good guy). Jobeth Williams did a good job as Christofferson's American wife. As for the direction, I had no idea that Franklin J. Schaffner was the director until I read the review in Leonard Maltin’s Film Guide (this was his last movie). Now I understand why this movie was so good. Schaffner also shot Patton, a truly wonderful film (I have not seen his other wonderful film, Papillon). When I watched “Welcome Home,” I told myself: “This director really knows what he is doing,” not knowing that Schaffner was in charge of this. In the Thai orphanage there is one really beautiful scene, which is enough to cause tears in his eyes. It was not only sensitive, but also very economical and tough. The efforts of Schaffner is nothing in vain. The script was one of the reasons why this film is so good. The writer does not burden the actors with too many lines. It was written very simple, but very effective. It simply shows that much can be said in a few words. This film also made me proud to be an American, and at the same time showed how beautiful ALL people are.
