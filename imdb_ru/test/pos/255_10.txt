The 08th MS team shows two encouraging romantics from different sides of the conflict. Aina, an officer of Zion, and Shirou, the new pilot of the federal forces, meet in a space battle throughout the 12 episodic series (and one “movie”), both discussing their love for each other, trying to fight the war that surrounds them. It includes the romance of Romeo and Juliet and unrivaled animation. Certainly one of the best to hit the American Beaches. Suit up!
