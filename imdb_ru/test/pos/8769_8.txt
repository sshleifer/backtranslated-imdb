Alfred Hitchcock's “Diversant” (1942) (not to be confused with another Hitchcock film, “Sabotage”, filmed in 1936 with a completely different plot) is not the greatest film “Suspension Master”. He has neither the depth of "Vertigo" (1958), nor the brooding atmosphere of "Rebecca" (1940), and, of course, does not have the emotional impact and acting talent that can be found in "Sad" (1946), but that It is acute sensations, adventures and the culmination of nail biting. Admittedly, the two leads are quite weak. It's easy to see why Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper for the role of Robert Cummings and Barbara Stanwick for the role that Priscilla Lane took. In addition, the patriotic speeches that Kumming (written by Dorothy Parker) says are poorly dated, and the meeting with the circus troupe is badly made (the beard on the bearded lady is clearly false). However, the last half hour is a preview on the edge of your place, the climax on the Statue of Liberty is very well done, and the film is a clear precursor of the film North-North-West (1959). The two villains, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd, are very good, and the beginning of the fire at the aircraft factory is an excellent sequence. This is not the best movie shot by Hitch, but it is one of the most interesting.
