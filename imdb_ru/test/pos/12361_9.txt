The last person who dies before the New Year is damned for driving the Ghost carriage for a whole year, collecting the souls of the dead. <br /> <br /> I saw a scene from this old silent Swedish horror movie on Youtube and decided to track down the entire movie. It was worth it to find him, because it was a terrific movie for the time when it was shot. It has a surprisingly eerie atmosphere. The creators of the old-time horror films really knew how to create the perfect atmosphere. Unfortunately, many of today's filmmakers do not seem to understand how important the atmosphere and the atmosphere are, and they are striving for cheap jumps. The visual effects are excellent considering the production date. If you can find a copy of this, I highly recommend giving him a watch. 9/10
