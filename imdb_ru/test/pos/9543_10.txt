As a child I avoided this film because I thought it would be boring - no fights and shootings, police, robbers, cowboys or Indians. It was definitely not a cool movie to love. So I didn’t see TRC until I was twenty, and I found it one of the most beautiful, exciting films I’ve seen. All the actors perfectly demonstrate the characteristics, and each emotion is taken from the scene behind the scenes. Shooting and directing is deceptively simple, but they seem so natural and completely immersed me in the story. My two favorite scenes are Bobby's birthday and the stage on the station platform, located near the end, directed and edited to perfection. The quality and expression of Jenny Agutter's voice when she calls: “Dad! My daddy! ” cracks emotions from the viewer. Tears in my eyes well. <br /> <br /> This adaptation is not just a film, it is a work of precious art, and also an excellent example of what all directors should be. the pursuit of creating an emotional experience.
