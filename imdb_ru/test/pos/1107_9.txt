British-born Australian assistant Alex Frain draws the attention of his strange, requiring careful reading, visually stunning Modern Love (2006). Following the steps of a person who is unable to control the radical personality changes caused by the death of a close relative, a fascinating study of human psychology is proposed. Distributed by Accent Film-Australia. <br /> <br /> John (Mark Constable), his wife Emily (Victoria Hill) and their son Edward (William Treger) arrive in a small southern town to take care of his late uncle. (Don Barker) property. While Emily and Edward check in at a local inn, John starts asking local residents about Uncle Tom’s death - some say he committed suicide, some don’t want to talk. Puzzled, John puts forward his own theory — Uncle Tom is alive and well, hiding in nearby bushes. <br /> <br /> If it were not for the casual lines of dialogue used to weaken its heavy atmospheric tone, Modern Love could have been easily mistaken for a Sokurov film. Filmed by a 16mm camera, its blurry color scheme strangely recalls the thoughts of a Russian director about human torment. It may not be by chance that it was at the Moscow International Film Festival that the premiere of the film “Modern Love” took place. <br /> <br /> If you look under this unique collage of intoxicating visual effects, you can see a slightly different picture, although Sokurov's films tend to remain painfully intimate, to the extent that they deliberately separate the main characters from the environment, eroding everything in a big splash the desired yellow director of "Modern Love", which largely nourishes the countryside of Australia. John’s gradual psychological transformation depends on this, and the more the story develops, the more it becomes obvious that nature was an integral part of Frein’s vision. <br /> <br /> In Sokurov's Second Circle, a young man returns to the Russian village to bury his late father. In the hut where the old man once lived, everything is covered with dust. He collects a few old things scattered around, and puts his father's body in a coffin. Then he says goodbye and bury him. The rest of the film is a long reflection on the collapse of the Soviet system, on loneliness and dissatisfaction, with which many were left to deal. <br /> <br /> In the “Modern Love”, ironically, love is nowhere to be seen. On the contrary, it is pain, loneliness and dissatisfaction with “modernity” that suddenly invade John’s life. Unlike the Second Circle, however, here the protagonist has the opportunity to revise his modern life. His wife and son are waiting for him, but he is leaving. Slowly but surely, the present begins to disintegrate under the weight of some tangled past. <br /> <br /> I doubt that Frain intended that Modern Love be so strikingly similar to what Sokurov did in the Second Round. Nevertheless, the tempo and, in particular, the mysterious setting, turn this film into an almost meditative experience - a complex and extremely fragile approach to the deconstruction of human psychology, which both directors have mastered to perfection. <br /> <br /> Mark Constable demonstrates top-notch performance, and John adds even more depth to his complex character. His facial expressions are outstanding. Victoria Hill and William Traeger blend perfectly with the intense visual style of their performances.
