I love a sweet soul film with a happy ending. This film can be considered dramatic, about two characters aware of true love, but the story is so touching and sweet that, in my opinion, it is romance. Of course, acting is not that great (which is why I didn't give it 10), but they do their job and they donâ€™t replay (thank God), plus they are cute, but powerful and simply charming story (some of your pansies will gasp) !!!!!! This is a great watch for a love story, but if you are homophobic, stay away! for everyone else I loved the movie, it's so sweet! I felt it was a rollback on a smaller scale ... but with a happy ending .... so enjoy it !!
