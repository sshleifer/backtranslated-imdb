In the previous comment I mentioned how much I liked this film - better the second time. I do not refuse this opinion. Strange, I can't find anyone else who liked it. <br /> <br /> My mom was going to see him, but a few friends told her, “No way.” My sister and her family saw it, and half the theater went halfway through. <br /> <br /> My wife suggests that Australians see characters as ordinary, ordinary Americans, and therefore it’s not funny. But, hey, most Americans think that all Australians are like Crocodile Dundee, so for a change it’s nice to have a shoe on the other foot.
