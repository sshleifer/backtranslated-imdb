Battleship Potemkin was said to be Charlie Chaplin's favorite. It presents a theatrical version of the rebellion that occurred in 1905, when the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against its officers of the tsarist regime. <br /> <br /> The film is a textbook of cinematic classics and a masterpiece of editing, especially in the famous sequence of “Odessa Steps” in which innocent civilians die in bloodshed; the events of the minute are drawn to five insane through actions. The film contains 1,300 individual frames, and in 1948 and 1958 was recognized as the best film ever created by a group of international critics. Battleship Potemkin is in the public domain, in some parts of the world.
