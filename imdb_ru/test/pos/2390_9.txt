Being an independent film director on Long Island and having two theatrical releases under my directorial / directorial belt, I was always told how much I can find out by watching the FRED CARPENTER, so I was lucky to have his Eddie Monroe. "as my dedication to his superb budgeting, production, casting, settings, and studio directing talents. My heart sank upon his characters, his story and was completely captivated by the end of the trick / switch that led to the film's plot! The location was surprisingly chosen and the human emotions in his characters led to a realistic connection with my connections with all the elements that Mr. Carpenter used in everything in favor of his and his film!
