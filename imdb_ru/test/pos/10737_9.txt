I think I was lucky that I watched a wonderful film with two wonderful actors. Kramer vs. Kramer was great for me because I think I can relate to him. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately my parents are divorced. Despite the fact that I was older than Billy in this film, I felt his pain and confusion. Having two parents who you think are happy and ultimately hate each other is the worst. In fact, thanks to this film, I think it made me realize that my parents are people too, and they felt as much pain as my sister. <br /> <br /> Coming back to the film, it was a good one. Yes, it is dated, and Meryl and Dustin are very young. But I would recommend it to many people, because I think most of them can relate in some way. There are funny, sad, happy and relaxing moments that fascinate these great actors. This is a good movie and deserves more confidence than 7.5. <br /> <br /> 9/10
