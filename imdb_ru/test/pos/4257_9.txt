I cannot say how many times this line made me laugh or how often I described this scene to people not familiar with this film. I saw it that year when it was released, I was 19. I do not think that there were a dozen people at the East Village Theater that evening. For years, I thought we were the only ones who saw it. It's nice to see that others find him as hysterical as I am, and see his lasting value, despite the past tense. Rent, buy or steal .... be sure to look.
