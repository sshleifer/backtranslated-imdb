Let me say from the beginning that I’m not a big fan of this kind of film, but Nightbreed has a certain admiration for me about the prospect. <br /> <br /> In ancient times, people who could live as Midianites could be called zombies, undead. And according to the fact that Clive Barker has given us certain representatives of the human race, in this Craig Sheffer is born with the potential to become part of this world. <br /> <br /> Psychiatrist David Cronenberg at first looked like a professional with a gentle upbringing. took on a fanatical mission to rid the world of the Night Breed. He tricks the police into killing Schaeffer, but Schaeffer goes to the Midian cemetery, where the Night Breed gathers and lives underground. <br /> <br /> Sheffer also left a friend, Anna Bobby, who still feels for him even after he was killed, and now she is one of the undead. She is trying by her little way to become a bridge to humanity. <br /> <br /> Clive Barker's creatures look pretty disgusting and don't particularly love people. But it is clear that if people left them alone, the Night Breed, in turn, does not worry about them. <br /> <br /> Your sympathies are definitely related to the “Night Breed”, especially after you saw a fanatic like Cronenberg and Chief Police Officer Zhloba Charles Heyda take action. <br /> <br /> Clive Barker has long been gay, and some believe that Nightbreed is a metaphor for gays. I see where this will lead, especially since many people do not even think of gays as people because they are taught this way. <br /> <br /> Nightbreed provided is quite bloody with a lot of unwarranted violence, but it also makes you think, and I like the way Clive Barker turns traditional theology upside down and makes Craig Schaeffer a kind of messiah for the creatures of the Night Breed .
