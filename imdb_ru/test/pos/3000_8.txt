The quick approach that Lewis Sayler uses with the King of the Underworld sets a deeper story while maintaining an effective execution environment. One striking example of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for a family medical couple. The public is instantly transferred from the medical office to a luxurious suite in the most prestigious hotel in the city. This development is crucial for understanding the position to which doctors were thrown. From the introduction it is said that these two people, as a rule, are satisfied with the provision of medical care to those who are less fortunate. Sharply moving from this scenario to the morally conflicting profession (personal mafia doctor), the viewer should experience this sudden turn of events. Nelsons (Kay Francis and John Eldridge) are forcibly hired by Gurney (Bogart) without objection. This stylized view that organized crime is too powerful and powerful to overcome is a standard component in every gangster picture. One aspect of this film, which raised some questions for me, ironically related to the pace of the story and the speed with which it was told. I think that character development and social identity may suffer if some aspects of the story are not fully explored. This paradox happens to be the result of personal taste, in that I think that the experience of the film can be improved through rigorous character development. However, for the purposes of this film, I must admit that the fast action contributes to a more dynamic flash of the filmâ€™s impact. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 (of ****)
