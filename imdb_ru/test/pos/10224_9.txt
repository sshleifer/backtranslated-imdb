I would like to have a category to put it in except Horror. This is simply not the case. Of course, these are terrible moments, but I don't think this is a horror movie. I will let this film be better. Million little things could be changed to make it better. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I love this movie. I often feel sad that people misunderstand the whole point of it. It was always clear to me that the meaning of this film was to say ... things are not always what they seem. Sometimes the "evil" is wrong. <br /> <br /> Barker was at the scammer I went to, and he talked a little, and then watched the movie. It was very interesting. Many things that he wanted to insert into the film could not be, and a piece of the film was cut from the film, which he considered long lost. It was a piece that helped shed light on Buna and his girlfriend, as well as on some other details. <br /> <br /> I know that some people are worried about the lack of additional information about the whole “breed” in the background. However, I always felt that this gave the film a more “real” look. I read the short story on which it was based, as well as many comics. Because of this, the film always seemed like a springboard for the whole story. A much more complicated story, which, unfortunately, never has a chance to live. <br /> <br /> Despite all the shortcomings of this film, I believe that it has a lot to offer. "Monsters" are wonderful, very creative. While the action is sometimes a bit tough, there are some very quoted lines. Whenever I watch it, I find something new. Keep your eye on Buns chest near the end. At some point, Decker stabs him and soon after Boone falls on the card table. It ends with a card attached to his chest. This card remains there even after Laurie pulls out a knife. He stays there until Boone accidentally deletes him. I like it. I thought it was a nice little thing. <br /> <br /> In essence, I want to say that ... if you are looking for a horror movie, do not watch it. If you believe that sometimes people can be more evil than we ever dreamed of. This is a movie for you. This is a film about how people destroy what they don’t understand or are not afraid of.
