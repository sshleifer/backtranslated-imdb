At the first viewing this film seems like a fairy tale about a beautiful and significantly white horse that has never been seen forgotten. However, if we look strictly in the context of this story, it means that in order to survive in America after the Civil War, it was necessary to have a horse, and not an old horse, but a really great horse. And the Eagle Wing is such a horse. But for a person to be worthy of such a horse is another matter. Who should own it? Native American or AWOL soldier? History opposes the primitivism of civilization everywhere. As other commentators have already said, it is ironic that the English director understood this fact, and then turned this simple theme into a Western one, unlike any other that you will ever see again. The film is mainly about this beast and the wild harshness of the environment and the people who cleanse its life. The photo and soundtrack are exquisite. Speech by Martin Sheen is a revelation. This film, released the same year as Shin’s other great performance in the role of Willard in Apocalypse Now, hints at his abilities, which somehow never received such freedom of action. More pity. A comparison of these two stories reveals a striking similarity between them - not least the fact that both films schedule a man’s journey into his soul to find redemption. Considering that Willard is bought out, I leave it to the viewer to decide whether Pike will be in the end. The ending is incredible in the true sense of the word and very touching; keep in mind. In general, this is an unusual film.
