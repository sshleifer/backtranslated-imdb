To some people, this film may not seem so big, but it has everything Iâ€™m looking for in a comedy. funny moments fall, accompanied by a moment or two seriously moving scenes, great actors and almost everything a good movie should look like. despite the fact that David Spade played his usual snobbish character, he turned this role into an unusual performance, which, I think, he never excelled until he got on the screen with Joe mud. Regardless of whether some people were Chris Farley fans, I saw this film when it came out, and my friends, and I still talk about it ... 11 years later. This film finally told me that Chris Farley was a real bargain. he is the best comedian I've ever seen in my life. according to some, he could be clumsy, intelligent, funny, serious, crazy, sober, and at the same time move or oppress. not the same words, but the message is all that matters. one of the real great actors of our time and one of the greatest comedies of all time. along with a good game, a good story, funny moments, serious scenes that sometimes led me to tears. This film stands on top of the horde as a film that marked the beginning of a brief reign on top of the world of comedies by the late great Chris Farley. since then no actor has captured my interests in cinema. because no actor has invested so much in his films before or since. This film is worth the time, if you did not take the time to watch it, do it the next time you make a movie.
