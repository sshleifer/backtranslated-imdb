Having been brought up in Canada, I have seen this short many times mostly on CBC. I have seen it many times, many times in my life, and each time the reactions were the same. This is a joyful, bitter-sweet, beautifully animated film that pulls you into your heart. Iâ€™m sure I have it on some VHS tape, delving around somewhere. <br /> <br /> Every child who grew up may be relevant to the situation and be willing to match your favorite idols. The scene and facial expression of the children when his mother fills the catalog of Eatons and his jumping around the room is priceless. I have not seen anyone capture this carefree mood of young people in a film as well as this little short film. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm a fan of the Montreal hubs, and that makes my assessment more special. But in the end, this is a nostalgic kind of hockey with a pond, and the memories of your family tell you that you should be grateful for what you get, even if it's not exactly what you wanted. And yes, the animation is beautiful too;) <br /> <br /> Rated 10 out of 10
