The Simpsons, of course, started off with a Christmas special, “Simpson Burning on an Open Fire,” which included basic drawings, not loud jokes, but in this episode, probably the first loud joke, and from here the show gets better better. This episode centers around Bart, who in this episode is exchanged for a test from Martin and goes to school for the very gifted, this leads to the fact that Bart corrects his friendship with his father and loses all his comrades. The episode is very humorous and shows what should have been the greatest show ever to come out. In general, fans of the series will love this episode, as it represents the character exactly the way it became 20 years later. So watch this episode in the first season package and enjoy how early Simpson did what he was meant for, making people laugh. I rate this episode 73%.
