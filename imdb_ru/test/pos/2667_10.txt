For all those who are puzzled by the length and speed of this film (“for example, why does it show spacecraft at docking for about 15 minutes?”), Here's a word you can think of: <br /> <br /> Beauty. <br /> <br /> Beauty is an underestimated concept. Of course, you will often see good photos and so on in movies. But when was the last time you saw a movie that contains beauty only for its sake? Among film lovers, there is a strange belief that everything that is not related to the plot or character should be removed. This is a depressing bullshit. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the plot of the film. The director can show the 15 minutes of the spacecraft for no reason, except that they are beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil. <br /> <br /> “2001” requires you to look differently from the way you usually watch movies. It requires you to relax. This requires that you experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complicated story or detailed description. Do not get me wrong, the plots and characters are good, but they are not all and not all. There are different kinds of film, and in order to enjoy “2001”, you have to tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, PURE beauty, free from the banal conventions of everyday films. <br /> <br /> "All art is completely useless," - Oscar Wilde.
