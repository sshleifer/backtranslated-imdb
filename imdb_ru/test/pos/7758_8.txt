At first glance, this is another high-grade anime with a lot of excuses for fan service, but more is happening. “Fan Service” is part of the plot, the main character is a tired cynic (unusual), and, most importantly, there is a clever storyline that links all the episodes together and that raises some interesting questions. Episodes are intentionally not chronological, and certainly worth watching the show again in chronological order. <br /> <br /> The series is worth a close look, because there are many random clues in it that foreshadow and explain things, plus a lot of jokes about other TV shows, anime, and more.
