SPOILERS The famous character of Edgar Rice Burroughs has adapted to the screen thousands of times until thirst is quenched, especially in the thirties and forties of Hollywood. Its creators have made Tarzan one of the most successful cinematic characters. A few years later, Hugh Hudson decided to make a more ambitious version of the ape-man, and this is a more natural, wilder, and more mundane Tarzan, which he gives out here. Hudson skillfully avoids the clich√©s that you usually give to Tarzan, such as his famous cry or his friendly pet Cheetah. We are not only far from the invented and invented character created by Hallwood, but also from the film set used for his stories. The film was partially shot in Africa (more precisely, in Cameroon). The film presents two obvious parts: the first, which takes place in the jungle, where Tarzan lives among his adoptive friends, monkeys and considers himself his lord. But he ignores his real origin. The second in England, where Tarzan opens English society. Ian Holm personifies the connection between the two parts, and Hudson avoids everything that could make the film ridiculous thanks to a clever script. Indeed, Hill learns Lambert the basic rules of behavior in order to behave properly in English society, and the result works. Moreover, in the second part, no one ever laughs at Tarzan, and he is even very much appreciated. As for the end, it is a bitter and happy ending. Happy because Tarzan returns to the jungle and again meets his adoptive close relatives. But it is also bitter, because this homecoming means that the Greystoke line will not be secured and doomed to disappear ... Christoph Lambert finds his first (and last?) Great role here. Unfortunately, he will never compare with the achievements in this film and will play in poor and soulless action films. Nevertheless, as I said earlier, a clever script, a rare quality performance, some impressive natural landscapes (both in the jungle and in an English country, and we get a great movie. This is also an excellent reread from a popular novel. So only rating barely (6/10)?
