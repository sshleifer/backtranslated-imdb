I saw this film three times, and every time I appreciate it more. I think Jordana Brewster should have received an Emmy nomination for her real and natural performance. Many of us who were in Phoebeâ€™s age at the time a story takes place will realize how real it is. For most of us, life is neither a softly luminous romantic, nor a sharply cynical pessimism. This is a blurred balance, and this film reflects this balance. It is also well designed, with so many small details. Like a film or not, judging by the unusually high demographic ratings of girls under 18, we may know that this film reveals the important truth about how young women see themselves in the world.
