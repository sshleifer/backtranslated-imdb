Strange should be able to stumble upon "Classic Risks" only by chance; It should be on any list of top noir films, including IMDb. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is as good as before; knowledge of his terrible, delicate marital status gives additional weight to his almost indifferent person and short dialogues. Belmondo's discreet performance under the firm guidance of Sote only shows how wonderful actor he could and should have been. <br /> <br /> "Classe Tous Risques" - absolutely minimalistic, dry and cold, without Melville's artistic landscape, pretty faces and trendy cars. This is almost a film noir and neorealism. A few tough words of Davos to their children, describing their life in secret from there, hold you by the throat until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The last sentence of the film - a voice over, telling about the end of Davos in no more than ten dry, gloomy words - makes you hit hard in the stomach. <br /> <br /> A real gem in the great crown of the French film noir.
