This burning drama, based on a genuine incident, concerns several ambitious African citizens who have decided to temporarily leave their families, retracting on an outgoing ship. They think that if they successfully make the trip, they can improve their lives by earning enough money in New York to send them to their families. Unfortunately for them, the vessel they choose is an old Russian freighter who was already fined for harbor in the previous port. The captain and the first mate are determined not to allow this to happen again, since their work is on the line. A group of blacks begins their agonizing journey in the cargo hold and is eventually discovered, forced to hide and killed by a ruthless comrade (an outstanding performance by Shaun Pertwee.) lost if caught. In general, an exciting film in which viewers will bite their nails and clench their teeth, wondering how such terrible events can occur in modern civilization.
