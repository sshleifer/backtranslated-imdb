The most famous film by Sergei Eisenstein really stood the test of time. The history of the rebellion on a warship in 1905 has a sense of Soviet propaganda, but it shows well the conditions that led to the uprising. The scene on the steps of Odessa must be captured in someone's mind. <br /> <br /> Okay, so Battleship Potemkin was not really the first film to use the montage, but they did a great job here. Of course, any class of film history should show this film. This is a great historical drama (although I admit that I do not know how accurate it is). 10/10 <br /> <br /> Oh, and we should have already learned that Potemkin should be transliterated as Potemkin.
