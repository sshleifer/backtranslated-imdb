I listen to Istanbul, intention, my eyes are closed: First, a light breeze And the leaves on the trees Sway gently; There, far away, the water bell bells continuously ring; I listen to Istanbul, intention, my eyes are closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, intention, my eyes are closed; Then suddenly birds fly, flocks of birds, high, with a touch and cry, While the nets are tightened on the fishing grounds, and the woman's legs begin to indulge in water. I listen to Istanbul, intent, with my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, intention, with eyes closed. The Grand Bazaar is serene and cool, the noise in the center of the Market, the courtyards of the mosque are full of pigeons. Whilst the hammers knock and knock on the docks, the spring winds smell of sweat; I listen to Istanbul, intention, my eyes are closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, intention, my eyes are closed; Still frivolous from the past, the Seaside mansion with dirty houses quickly sleeps. In the midst of the noise and hum of the southern winds, the rest, I listen to Istanbul, deliberately, with my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, intentionally, with my eyes closed. A nice girl passes along the sidewalk: four-letter words, whistles and songs, rude remarks; Something falls out of her hands. This is a rose, I guess. I listen to Istanbul, intention, my eyes are closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, intention, my eyes are closed. A bird flutters around your skirt; Is there sweat on your forehead? Or not? I know. Are your lips wet? Or not? I know. The silver moon rises behind the pines: I feel it all in the pulsations of your heart. I listen to Istanbul, intention, my eyes are closed. <br /> <br /> FOR YOU <br /> <br /> For you, my brethren, All for you, Nights for you, days for you; Daylight is for you, moonlight is for you; Leaves in the moonlight; Miracle and wisdom in the leaves, A lot of greenery in daylight, Yellow for you and pink. The feeling of the skin on the palm, warm, soft, comfortable lying; For you - all greetings And masts, believers in the harbor; The names of the days, the names of the months, the fresh paint on the rowboats â€” these are for you the legs of the postman, the hands of potter the sweat on the forehead, the bullets fired at the fronts Graves for you and gravestones, Prisons, handcuffs and death sentences for you. Everything for you. <br /> <br /> SEA NOSTALGIA <br /> <br /> Ships float according to my dreams, Roofs of ships in a color feast, and poor me, thirsting for the sea year after year, I look and cry. I remember my first look at the world Through the mussel shell, which I opened: the greenest water and the bluest sky, and the most vague piece of fish ... My blood is still salty, Where the oysters cut through my skin. What a crazy speedy dive we had on the open sea on the whitest foam! Foam does not bear malice, Like lips, Whose adultery with men Is not a shame. <br /> <br /> Ships float on our dreams Above the roofs, the ships in the color festival, And poor me, Longing for the sea year after year out. <br /> <br /> - Orhan Veli <br /> <br /> I could not say anything better than what Orhal Veli Kanik said about Istanbul. About this film, all I have is praise. A very pleasant and balanced acquaintance with the city and its music, connecting Asia, Europe and Africa at the same time.
