I admire Deepa Mehta, and this film is a masterpiece. I would recommend to buy this movie on DVD, because this is a movie that you can watch more than once. And trust me, you will still find small significant details after viewing it several times. <br /> <br /> Characters - with the possible exception of grandmothers - are all very balanced, without black and white. Even if you follow the story from the point of view of the two main characters, there is also sympathy for other characters. <br /> <br /> I think the IMDb rating for the film is too low - perhaps because of its politically controversial content.
