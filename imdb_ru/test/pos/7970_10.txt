This film is very similar to “Deadly Sentence” with Jean-Claude Van Damme, and also has some similarities with “Island of Fire” with Jackie Chan, and I also heard that there are some other very similar action films, but this film has a much better action than Death Warrant or even Island of Fire (this is true, Jackie Chan's film). Rarely, American action films have such excellent action films, although there have been many negative reviews on this film, it easily surpasses most of the militants of that time who were more successful. There were many scenes of martial art, David Bradley was fast, like Bruce Lee in this film, and it’s good that the battle scenes were much longer than in most American martial arts films. The shooting scenes were similar to the John Woo films, perhaps not so good, but still very exciting. There were also many spectacular explosions and one great chase scene. I have seen several other David Bradley films, but this one, however, is the best in terms of action. Well, this movie has some funny moments, but which movie doesn't have? The game was decent, Charles Napier was incredible, and his character was very tough. Adam Clark, who played Squid, and Yuji Okumoto, who played the main bad guy, were also very good. Other actors also acted fairly well, although acting was not so important in this type of film. If you're an action movie fan (I mean real action movie fans who can really appreciate a good action), then you should definitely see this movie.
