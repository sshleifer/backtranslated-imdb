Lucio Fulci was one of the most prolific Italian directors by the time of his death in 1996, but his career had long ago turned into a downward spiral of increasingly useless genre recordings that could hardly stand in the shadow of his earlier works. During most of the 1970s and mid-1980s, he experienced such stylistically distinctive horrors as “City of the Living Dead”, “Otherworld” and the cruel jallo “The New York Ripper”, remembered with love by such fans as himself. And although “The Cat in the Brain” falls into the era of the decline of Fulci as a director, this shocking, darkly cheerful head, which, although it is clearly inferior to the work (cropping, effects and actions below par), proves an interesting, open meditation on pop psychology and the ability film desensitize. Make no mistake: “The Cat in the Brain” is a real grief, as fragmented as the previous Fulci films, but it deserves praise for trying to become something big. In the delightful mocking touch of Fulci, he plays himself: the director during the filming of another brutal horror film that faces perverse / killer hallucinations; after visiting a psychiatrist who puts him under hypnosis, his dreams and reality begin to intersect to such an extent that the viewer cannot distinguish between them. In a recent DVD from Grindhouse Releasing, Cat is mentioned as the heir apparent to Eraserhead, and it carries the same disturbing, awkward, ridiculous quality associated with the best surrealist art.
