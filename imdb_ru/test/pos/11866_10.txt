Very funny movie. "Before" Michael Douglas is worth watching this movie, if not for any other reason. I would like him to play more roles with a low standard of living. He was awesome, like all performers. <br /> <br /> The film struck me as American Roshomon, only funnier and easier to watch, because it was in American and did not need smelly subtitles! <br /> In a funny movie in which every minute or so laughed, two of the best were with John Goodman (and not with someone from whom I am crazy) - 1. He tells the priest about as Jewel does what he likes and says: "I had to wipe the smile off my face." A visual representation shows that he is not smiling and is clearly not smiling, but probably does not know about it. 2. The scene at the end between Goodman, all wearing a Jewel suit in his police uniform, and fighting the risen Reiser, who was hunched over the table ... and they both protested against the fact that they are not gay with another character who happens on stage - thatâ€™s Honored Comedy Academy Special Prize.
