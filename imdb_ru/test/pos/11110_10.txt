Glory, I think, was the best movie I've ever seen. In a sense, it was funny and dramatic, but that's what makes the film. True, he has a few loose ends, in fact a lot, but I still think this is a terrific movie. Some funny things happen at the audition at the beginning of the movie. I think it is fun when a girl tries to play O.Yu. Simpson in The Towering Inferno and Raul / Ralph go to every art department, saying that his father was great in everyone. He says his father was dancing with the Rockets and left his shoes to Ralph. Rockets, as far as I know, are made up of women. And the taps were ordinary shoes with traffic jams on the bottom. Also the guy who read Julietâ€™s lines in Romeo and Juliet was funny. One thing that excites me in a movie is music. I have never heard anything like it !!! My favorite song is "I Sing the Body Electric", and the second one is the Fame theme itself. Irene Kara has a great voice and she is a great actress. I love how the film focuses on many ethnic groups. This showed that all people there are in the so-called "School of Performing Arts La Guardia." This film showed the triumphs and trials of many young performers, including Angelo, Doris, Bruno, Coco, Montgomery, Ralph, Leroy, Hilary and Lisa. It was hard for them all, but they did everything in their own way. This film could be added in approximately 30-45 minutes (before graduation), but this is still my favorite movie, no matter what !!!!
