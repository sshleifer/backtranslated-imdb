I did it on Turner Classic only because it was a preliminary code and sounded interesting. When I approached viewing, I noticed that the "critic" gave him a half stars on a four-star scale. I began to look with trepidation - even old films can be bad - but I quickly became interested in the story and play of Mary Astor, because business is the brain behind the success of a simple seller. Not a very good movie - too predictable - but certainly better than advertised. And I would like to see Ricardo Cortes as a man who appreciates Mary, but does not give up his rich wife. I would advise you to take a look at this just to appreciate Astor and what a long way we have come, baby.
