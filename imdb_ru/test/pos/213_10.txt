Two years after the success of “The Plane”, Jim Abrahams and Jerry and David Zucker created this brilliant comedy film featuring the great Leslie Nielsen as the simple detective “Frank Drebin”. Also in the cast were Alan North in the role of "Captain Ed Hocken", Ed Williams in the role of "Ted Olsen" and William Duell in the role of "Johnny Shu Blaine Boy". "Police squad!" shamelessly banal jokes and clever visual jokes playing in the background. Each episode ends with a fictitious freeze frame in which the characters in the frame stand still. In one of the best "freeze-frame" episodes, one of the characters poured coffee into the cup, standing still, which is why the cup overflowed! The stars of the invitees were killed in the introductory names, among which was Georg Stanford Brown, crushed by a falling safe! Despite receiving positive reviews and a lot of critical acclaim, 'Squad!' only lasted six episodes before it was canceled. This did not mean the end, although five years later the show was moved to the big screen for the first in the trilogy of the Naked Gun films.
