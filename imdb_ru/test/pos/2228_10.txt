I remember watching this movie on TV in the late or early twenties - probably HBO. I watched this with my parents, brother and several friends. Since it was about 30 years ago, I do not remember a lot of history. I remember that all of our group watched, agreed that it was the funniest film we have ever seen. When it was over, our stomachs ached from such a big laugh. My father worked in a hospital, so everything got better. <br /> <br /> Every time I see the “Party” on TV, I check if there is one. To my horror, this never happens. Although I loved the Party, I feel it is funnier. Peter Sellers was brilliant as a crooked hospital administrator. Why this has never been released on video is a mystery to me. This is a classic, but it seems that no one under the age of 35 or 40 was allowed to see it. I would buy it in a second if they ever released it on DVD.
