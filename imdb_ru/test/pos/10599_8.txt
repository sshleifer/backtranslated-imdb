I watched this film in the hope of a good laugh, but when I watched it, I didnâ€™t stop laughing for weeks, they are such bad actors, and it made this film a lot funnier to watch. (By the way, Ryan Dunn did not eat a toy car, he shoved it in the ass) Random appearances from skaters and parts of Vitos were great. Give me some Vito grapes! No, Valo, your grapes are in the store. I would not recommend anyone under the age of 13 to watch it, to be honest, they would not understand half of the jokes or what they are talking about. I love VLB and after watching this movie I could not help but buy it or the series Viva La Bam. What is the deal with this stupid comment? It should be 10 lines, what is this bullshot? I should be able to write one for as long or in this case as short as I want. I will just keep typing until they tell me that I can send it. It's just a waste of time, I expected to just say what I wanted, it was not so much, but then I was told that I should continue to invest more, and then it corrects my spelling, so that if I did not spell something is right, you understand what I mean so far. It is ridiculously long. <br /> <br /> ~ Those who live by the Sword are shot by those who do not ~
