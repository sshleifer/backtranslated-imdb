Someone wonders what it was like to make a black film in the 70s who watch this movie. Some of the dialogues in this film are so funny, that is, a summary of my presentation. Also make sure that a boom microphone appears in some scenes, as well as some of the best karate fights. Do not take this film seriously, otherwise you will be disappointed, go into it with an open mind and step into the world of one of the coolest muses in the world Dolemite !!! It is wise to edit it together, as if it had been cut with a razor, but once again this film is much larger than what you see in the film, it influenced the black community in ways that you cannot understand !!!
