A box in my video store, so I rented this one. It looked cool when the guy's face was knocked down in half, so of course I had to try. I was pleasantly surprised when I actually watched him as a fan of "Evil Dead". Swedish manufacturers were supposed to be fans, as they included many references to this masterpiece. The culprit tries to break into the house where Evil Ed edited films that ultimately drive him crazy and says “cool” when he looks at his gun in exactly the same way as Bruce Campbell when he finishes his hand with a chainsaw dead 2 ". many posters of this film are scattered around the house and office in the film. They are not just fooling the Evil Dead, as there is a gremlin-style puppet monster who curses Ed in his fridge. My personal favorite is when he stalks his wife around the house and says: “I follow you, Barbra,” that if you didn't know, this is the main line of the Barbra brothers in The Night of the Living Dead. This film has a good storyline, cool characters, funny things (Gremlin doll), scary things (doctor-demon), great effects (exploding head) and a fair amount of female nudity. I gave him only 9, because he is rather slow until Ed is crazy, but it's worth it. So, if you liked "Evil Dead 2" or any other movie I mentioned above, you should rent and watch it with friends, and when you're done, try "The Dead Dead" because I heard it looks like on this masterpiece <br /> <br />
