I liked this movie, Naruto's second feature film. I enjoyed being in the snow, a little better, though, since I found the story here a bit fragmented, since I was not sure where certain things should happen or when. However, as in the first film, this film also has a good show time - an hour and a half, plenty of time for a good, well-developed film with some really cool fights. The story begins with a ninja from the village, hidden in the sand in a battle with unknown attackers. Then Naruto, Sakura and Shikumaru hunt a ferret for what they think will be an easy task. Soon they will find out otherwise, as they are also attacked, and Naruto is separated from his friends after he fights with a strange young warrior dressed in armor. They are both injured and captured by a caravan, and shortly thereafter Naruto is invited to join this strange organization that wants to create a utopia. Of course, everything is not as it seems, and there are many fights to get around. My favorite was that Garaa fought with this strange woman who perceives him very easily, which is a big mistake. The final battle is also pretty good with Naruto and this strange man, who is better than the villain than any of those who were in the previous film.
