Before I forget, let me say that the work here is wonderful. From trash cans to a huge cruise liner, the drawings are beautifully made. If it weren’t lively, critics would praise the “direction” here because it’s really good. <br /> <br /> To the story: Sylvester is sorting garbage in the shipyards, but the cavils are small. Reflecting in the dock next to a large ship, he sees Tweety in his cage in the porthole. Tweety also notices him, and you know his first comment - the one he always does when he notices a cat. In any case, Sylvester runs up, opens the porthole and says: “Hello, breakfast!” Tweety slaps the window with a porthole in the face and says: “You, old cat, peeping!” The cat falls into the water. <br /> <br /> Fearless Sylvester quickly sneaks back aboard the ship, tiptoes into Tweety's cabin, grabs him and is ready to leave when - damn it! - At the door "grandmother" with an umbrella. Sylvester beats up because the old woman protects her bird again. But “frivolous chatter,” says Grandma, “I dropped my glasses. I don’t see anything without them. Heaven to Betsy, where these scammers. " <br /> <br /> Now Sylvestre has the upper hand ... and the normal “cat trying to catch the bird” frauds are turned on again, like grandma's glasses. Sylvester’s cleverest act was to take her glasses and draw a picture of Tweety on them, so when she woke up and put them on, she saw the bird and thought it was all right. <br /> <br /> In general, a very interesting animated short film that was very fun to watch. As you can tell from the quotes, I like the dialogue in some of these old cartoons.
