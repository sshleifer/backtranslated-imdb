I still can not believe that Starevich made this film back in 1934. Animation is just perfect, and what is surprising about this, with all the modern technologies we have, there are currently several animation studios capable of producing such a small gem as this. one. it has everything: a great story, beautiful characters (although in some cases it’s a painful beauty), special effects ... well, this is definitely not a child’s film, but it must be watched by anyone who is seriously interested in animation.
