ATTENTION: I advise everyone who has not yet seen the film not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> This film was on the shelf in the movie store, and since I saw several very common horror films there, I had really low expectations for that. Well, I put it in, and almost immediately dragged me. While watching, I plunged deeper and deeper into the story, and pretty soon I watched in full interest. This film is amazingly spectacular, and I loved every second. The story of a boat ride on a river in Australia. It seems safe enough until their boat was ambushed by a crocodile that is ready to eat. When I looked at the back of the case, I thought that this film would have crappy visual effects, like in Lake Placid 2 and many others, but when I first saw the crocodile, it looked amazingly realistic! Don't laugh when I say this because I'm serious, but this is one of the most creepy movies I've ever seen. He really knew how to increase acute tension and tension in a tense situation, I mean, think about it; You are stuck in a tree, there is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide with a hungry predator in the depths of the water below. You can't tell me that it doesn't bother you a bit. He even managed to catch a bit of a cold like when Crocodile took Adam, and Grace and Lee were confused. This is a very attractive movie. There were, maybe, 1 or 2 parts in which I was a little interested, but apart from that, I would say that this is my favorite film about the attack on animals, which I saw.
