Stefan Sondheim's “Sweeney Toddie”: “FLEET STREET DEMON BARBER” opened on Broadway on March 1, 1979 with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the lead roles. Despite the fact that he won almost every conceivable award, the box office did not meet expectations, and the original production ended with a circulation of 557 performances. Fortunately, however, the game then went on tour - and along the way was captured on film. The result was a remarkable shot of the play featuring George Hearn, who replaced Cariou, and Lansbury in close proximity to the original Broadway production. <br /> <br /> However, there is a flaw. Simply put: stage performances are not filmed very well, because a performance that works well on stage must fill the theater and, therefore, is very, very big - and when it is shot, such performances often seem slightly static, depressingly aggressive or and others. , SWEENEY TODD is no exception. The tape shows that she has the quality of “stand and sing,” and although Hearn and Lansbury seem to have modulated their actions for the camera, this does not apply to Betsy Joslin as Joanna; her incredible performance in the film sounds like an unpleasant frenzy, and her extremely operatic voice seems irrelevant when compared with the voices of all the actors. <br /> <br /> The reproduction of the stage effect on the film, however, into account, is a truly exceptional performance of a unique and terribly comic musical in the style of operetta. Lansbury is amazing - a mixture of stupidity, stupidity and insidious anger, while Hearn really owns the role of a psychotic hairdresser, whose clients "go to their graves perfectly shaven." In general, the cast is quite good, and although the film does not allow us to see quite a lot of set, it is enough for a demonstration to be impressive. And the music! Who can argue with what most consider Sondheim's best work? The story itself is extremely famous, especially in England. In 1846, Thomas Peckett Perst put together several urban myths for a short story entitled "ANIMAL IRON"; within a year or so, he was adapted to the scene as SWEENEY TODD, DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET — and, in an era that hardly knew copyright law, variations of the play soon began to play throughout England. Each of them, however, was more or less the same: Sweeney Todd, the barber, kills the people who come to him for a shave; Mrs. Lovett, his partner, bakes them into cakes and feeds them to an unsuspecting public. The Sondheim version is specifically based on the 1973 version of Christopher Bond. <br /> <br /> The story is very ambitious, with a lot of blood, falling bodies and grotesque humor; at the same time, however, the music, the lyrics and the plot of the innocent in the grip of evil open the subject to numerous lyrical charms that no one expected. Sondheim's lyrics are often ironic, but no more than here; Along the way, he interweaves a lot of evil satirical industry and capitalism, and, of course, one cannot blame the strange but Victorian elegance of his complex music. <br /> <br /> Like the "live version" with Hearn and Patti in the lead roles. LuPone, this particular film also provides us with several selections that were cut from the 2007 version of the Tim Burton film, in particular the discovery “A Visit to the Tale of Sweeney Todd,” which runs like a thread throughout the play. It is also, in my opinion, much more comical than a film that, as a rule, underestimates comedy in favor of an even bigger bloody show. In any case, if you are a fan of this story, this is a legendary Broadway show on tour, and this is a knockout. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
