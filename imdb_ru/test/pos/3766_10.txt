Coming from a generation of "addicts", I thought this movie was hilarious. It definitely gave Jekyll & Hyde modernity, so to speak. My husband and I laughed to the end. I would like to have a movie in my collection. I told my two teens about the film and they would like to see it. They are not addicted to drugs, but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the film. It’s been so long since I saw it, I can’t remember but a few things. I should have said that the funniest part was when Dr. Jekyll dozed off on his lab bench and inhaled a straw, snoring, and then sniffing the powdered medicine he invented. The funny thing I've ever seen in a movie.
