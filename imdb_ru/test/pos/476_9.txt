“My dinner with Andrew” of the 1980s with Wallace Sean and Andre Gregory is, in essence, a dialogue about the world, about how it affects and can lift the spirit. You Are Alone 2005 demonstrates how ordinary worldly events can destroy a soul. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around three main characters. Daphne, a pretty teenage student who worries about almost every decision in her life. Then there is a prostitute, or a paid escort, Britney, as self-confident as Daphne. What makes them interesting is that they have the same body, if not the same person. Part of the magic of this film takes place in one of the early scenes where Daphne is approaching the door of an old hotel room. She stops and is obviously torn from deciding whether to knock on the door or not ?? but it was Britney who slipped into the room without difficulty when the door was open. <br /> <br /> On the other side of this door is Buddy, a middle-aged man who has few, if any, personal qualities that anyone could see to find attractive. He goes so far as to confront the chosen profession of Britney as soon as she enters the room. However, we soon learn that Buddy is Daphne's closest neighbor, and for many years she watched her grow from a little girl to a girl. This complicates things for the audience. Is Buddy just a worried neighbor or does he want something else? <br /> <br /> If Buddy wants sex, then here he is. Britney loves sex. Her definitions may be Clinton, but this does not diminish her enthusiasm. She prefers older men and wears a rainbow of plastic bracelets from which her clients can choose. Each color bar indicates a specific act that it will perform ?? but what kind of act is not disclosed until the group breaks her wrist and the choice is finally made. <br /> <br /> Britney monitors or encounters each encounter. Even being tied and tied, as one of her regular clients, she imagines how her hands and body are stroked by several men, and a woman in blood-red lingerie caresses her legs and pubis. Images of the film just keep on coming. <br /> <br /> The pathetic life of Buddy is one of acceptance. He lost his wife, his dog, even his fantasies about a cute teenager next door. It is no coincidence that he lured Daphne or Britney into this number. On the wall of the plate there is a picture on which only the head of the fish remains. This is the perfect metaphor for the life of Buddy; all the good parts are finished. So, where did he bring his wife, when they were still college students, does he make his position ?? regain control of your own life, make your statement. <br /> <br /> The director of “You are alone”, Gorman Beshard, knows his craft. The main action in the hotel room serves as a solid anchor for the film, which is assisted by many mixed scenes that add size to the characters, their circumstances and conflicts. <br /> <br /> As the movie progresses, Britney asks Buddy if she should undress. He says yes, but she only undresses to her underwear. A real prostitute will probably take off all her clothes (one in five gets a profession). But tease not Buddy, and we. When the film ends, we discover that there are much deeper human emotions and motives in the game. Teasing doesn't work if he doesn't actually deliver. Britney, like "You're alone."
