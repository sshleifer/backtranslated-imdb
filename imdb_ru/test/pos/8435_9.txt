“China Syndrome” is a great thriller, and it’s not slow or boring, as some people say. The transitions from one scene to another are great, and the tension accumulated in the film will keep you on the edge of your seat for two whole hours. Jack Lemmon is great, as always, because the somewhat nervous factory operator and Jane Fonda once again succeed in bringing some real emotions to the story. You can view this film as a political statement of the time, or simply as an intelligent thriller. In any case, it is definitely worth a look.
