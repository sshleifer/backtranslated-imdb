“Saturday Noon” by Harry Langdon is often among the greatest silent comedies, at least when it comes to short stories, and therefore for some it may seem like a disappointment. Unlike some other recognized classics, such as Keaton's “Policemen” or Chaplin's “The Immigrant,” this film is in a sense a familiar, conventional situational comedy and does not offer much fun for the belly; One may even wonder whether Langdon belongs to such a sparse company. However, in my opinion, this is an absolutely charming comedy in his minor manner, and Harry is fascinating to watch. <br /> <br /> For the modern viewer who is being brought up on comedy television, the plot of “Saturday Day” can suggest “Honeymoon” or its numerous by-products: two dark guys, one of whom is married and very much in love with his wife, are trying to sneak with a couple of nice girls on a fun day; but everything goes wrong, and they have to fight with cool guys girls. Does this sound familiar? And maybe a little sad? Well, the package was already worn out when this film was shot, but other than that, nothing about Langdon was typical. He was strange, starting with what looked like a middle-aged child who was half asleep. Any Freudian who catches “Saturday Noon” will have a field day with scenes between this timid, plump baby and his strict, gently imperious mom-wife. When Harry tries to hide the money under the rug, but she catches him on the spot and makes him give him away, you swear that you are watching the interaction between a 6-year-old boy and his mom. .., and, perhaps, that is why Harry Langdon made some people sneak up, and still does. <br /> <br /> But he is a convincing figure on the screen, and it's not how he does it. For example, in this scene with coins under the rug, Harry finds coins, carefully, like a tightrope walker, puts one foot in front of the other, counting his steps until he finds the right place and his technique is hypnotic. Langdon moved like no other. Regardless of whether he makes you laugh, the guy is fascinating, it would seem, in his own world. As for the plot of his films, Harry is strangely passive and almost never moves the story forward. In the finale of “Saturday Day,” when a big fistfight takes place, partner Harry Vernon Dent is in the thick of things, but Harry is in a daze most of the time, and ends up drunk between two cars (sitting on the steps of one but ) as they race through the streets. This is a memorable image, and, as the critic Walter Kerr wrote, it perfectly perfectly captures the screen person of Langdon: he is a passive figure who somehow ends up in the center of insane action, blinking sleepily while the world passes by. It is also worth noting that Langdon and Dent, who often worked together, have a connection in this film, which assumes that Laurel and Hardy will follow the plan when they unite a year or later. Langdon's style probably influenced Stan Laurel, especially here. <br /> <br /> “Saturday Affinon” and its star are not for everyone, but the film is worth seeing and you may find that Langdon is an impression that is hard to shake.
