Should not be too critical of the second role of the director. <br /> <br /> I really like Madibaâ€™s camera work. As pointed out by Mr. Sean, he had a unique view of things. <br /> <br /> However, how is it that a 14-year-old boy takes such beautiful pictures? Remember that he did not receive any education. I don't think English is a common language in the Cape Town ghetto. Worse, Madiba looks even younger than her supposed 14-year-old. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you overcome the above-mentioned features, you can watch the movie and still enjoy it thanks to the good work of the camera.
