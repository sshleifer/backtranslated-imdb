If you have not seen this film of the late 80s about the Washington office of the network news station, then I strongly recommend it. This is a sad comment about the direction of news in this country, but he tells the story with wit. The characters are well developed, and the performance of Albert Brooks is great. He delivers all his lines with an entertaining understated comedy. I am not at all a fan of Albert Brooks, so it was a pleasant surprise. I have a friend who works as a producer at a local news station, and he advised that this is close to reality, so thank the authors and filmmakers for their research. <br /> <br /> A funny movie with a lot of insight into the world of online news. It's not as dark as another movie, which I also recommend in the same genre of “Network.”
