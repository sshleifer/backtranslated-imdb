Francois Truffaut, a young moron from "Cahiers du cinema", the main bastion of the coming so-called New Wave, gave a great show, hating this film, and even accused him of dragging French cinema into mediocrity. Translation: Truffaut, who was brutally suppressed sexually, was already jealous of how Carne could have achieved tremendous success in a story that pressed all the right buttons of her audience and actually involved her in something important with all the attributes and seduction of sensuality. In other words, where the general public and many critics saw an insightful sociological analysis, wrapped in a beautiful film, Truffaut saw "Girls at liberty." <br /> <br /> Karne, after all, had everything that New Will would lack: intelligence, refinement, humor, a great talent of the narrator, an excellent ear for dialogue, a dazzling technical brilliance, the ability to make her actors do that what he wanted and a good dose of good taste. For comparison, Truffaut is a provincial man who has nothing to say. <br /> <br /> The tragic remake of the 50s Pride and Prejudice, the French response to Rebel Without a Cause, an updated version of Children of Paradise, Les Tricheurs tells the story of disgruntled Parisian youth who lost their way in the atmosphere existentialism, sexual liberation and disrespect for traditional and religious values. Some (young) critics perceived Carne’s view on this topic as a moralizing bias of an “old man”, while I think that, on the contrary, it happened that Karne, being gay and knowing one or two things about repression, felt inexpressible sympathy young iconoclasts in his story. In addition, since this is a French film, there is no doubt that the rebellion in question is essentially sexual, which still had to be deciphered in American films such as Rebel Without a Cause and Wild. <br /> <All the young people of Carne are supremely beautiful, graceful, elegant, spontaneous and smart. They are gods and goddesses. They drive the latest Vespas and the right cars. The cut of their suits, dresses and duffle coat was the culmination of the fashion of the last century. Their haircuts are still smeared on the wall of your local hairdresser. Their body shape, which they easily achieved and maintained, still remains the modern Western ideal. They listen to the best jazz musicians. They know how to move, how to be sexy and how to make love ?? although tablets have not been invented yet. They know how to negotiate different social classes and cultures. Unfortunately, they are determined by the gang code and their own heartless rituals and live by them, excluding sentimentality and committing the sin of romantic love. The only thing wrong with them is that their elders do not talk to them, and vice versa. The incidents described in this film have long started talking in France about the immorality and nihilism of young people, at the same time making it a huge public and critical success. <br /> <br /> This film is very stylish and great, I suspect that older viewers who watched it would like to be like the people depicted in the film, and quite a lot of young directors or aspiring filmmakers such as Truffaut, have developed a bad case of jaundice, reflecting how they could never make a movie so sexy or popular like this one, although they would be very good in the long run in pursuit of nihilistic beats. On the other hand, given a certain clichéd aspect of the script (a love misunderstanding leading to emergency medical care), one can only wonder at the terribly pious and puritanical disorder that Americans would extract from the same basic scenario if they dared to tackle the Theme. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the film was shot in the same key places as the American musical “Funny Face” a year earlier. Where Hollywood saw the picturesque aspects of Rive Gauche and existentialism, Carnet restored his tragic and ironic dimension. Watch this trailer on YouTube: 19ZkKeoNjPo
