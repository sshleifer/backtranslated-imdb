Being selected during the Quinzaine des realisateurs, this year Catherine Brailat is masterfully divided into two parts of her autobiographical film, where her lead actress, Anne Pario (La Femme NIKITA, Luc Besson), perfectly embodies the role of the director of the film “Intimate Scenes”. <br /> <br /> This is a comedy of acting manners. Manufacturing? Film genre? Pornography or Exhibitionism? Sex Is Comedy - a postmodern film, the script of which is based on the film in the film. As an implosive story of a minimalist love scene, the film is built with constant solidarity of form and spirit, in which Braille continues to break and analyze taboos. Using visual codes and a specific meaning of the formula, Catherine Brailat implements her clinical analysis of sexuality as an isolated problem outside of society, to communicate through the door of the heart. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Gregoire Colen (Good Works, Nenett and Boni, Claire Denis, “The Life of Angels in a Dream,” Eric Zonka) as an actor and actress Roxana Meccid (Fat Girl, Catherine Breillat, Marie from Angel Cove , Manuel Prada), whose actors she invents, she clarifies in an interview. Breillat is watching the man in front of him, the chaste man. Then Brailat removes shame and sexual injuries, but also great hope, an alarming dimension of ecstasy, nakedness of feelings, half of exhibitionism, playing as one. In the end, the director is expected to lead the actors about their feelings, their body and their soul. So having settled, faced with the problem of the “who I am” order, the actors Braya gained inorganic vitality to merge in their work. But for being a form of incredible exorcism, for the actor, Brailat raises many questions. At the same time experiencing great suffering, the actors seem to be the ones who are looking for this loving transport as part of the eternity of their work. <br /> <br /> The art of Braille is a researcher to know how to behave in a dialogue in order to push the boundaries of intimate scenes. Make-up joining, prosthetics in erections and syndicates are not without a reminder of what pictures and scenes of Jan Steens and Rembrandt can be in a joke and daily characters on the set. While the moral categories disappear from the background “Sex is Comedy”, Breilat manages to uncover the loving imitative power of the actors in the landscape of a formidable and dramatic humanity.
