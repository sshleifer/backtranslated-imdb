Damn it, I learn pretty quickly that sometimes when you watch a movie as a child, and then again 20 years later, you get a different look - first of all because after 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - what a wonderful director he was and why the film flew. All I can say ... I really liked this film because it touched an area parallel to my life: friendship between two women throughout their lives. Could this ever exist? Well, in certain doses, yes ... and this film tells a little about ... "how." <br /> <br /> As a teenager with little life experience, I first saw it, so I focused more on the “rich” and “famous” part between them. At that time, I had no idea what the difference was, and what would happen to the two women who found it ... and how it would affect their friendship. Through their men, their careers, the decades that defined them. And I realized that one thing remained stronger than anything else ... their friendship and knowledge of each other more than anyone could. <br /> <br /> Then I got older, studied the film a bit ... and watched the film again with my best friend from high school. We understand the “rich” and “famous” perspective ... and we are still best friends ... but this film is not a cinematic masterpiece ... it can sometimes be called a little polite ... a little beyond praise (sort of Dynasty and Dallas for me ...) and, frankly, I can identify with the teddy bear scene because we share a bear, which means much more than a stuffed animal. A fun toy through our trials and tribulations with men / careers, etc., so it's not as it seems ...! As many have said, in this 1981 play it is great to see Meg Ryan, Matt Latanzzi, Deca Rambo and David Selby. This is a good movie "chick"!
