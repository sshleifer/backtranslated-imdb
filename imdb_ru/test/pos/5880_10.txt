I was amazed when I saw “The best years of our life”. The acting, screenplay and directorial skills of William Wyler (winner in the nomination “Best Director” in 1946) are “Brilliant”. <br /> <br /> This film tells about three veterans of the Great Patriotic War who return home from the war and reunite with their loved ones but they have to deal with the difficulties of returning home from the war. <br /> <br /> First man Al Stevenson (played by Fredrik March as Oscar playing the role) comes home to find his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy)) and children Peggy and Rob (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall are more mature and different than before leaving for the war. <br /> <br /> Second person Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews) must find a good job and return home to his wife, whom he was married just 20 days before his departure for the war. He begins to realize that she is not. <br /> <br /> Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell as Oscar) lost his arms in the war and must deal with Wilma's family and fiancé. (played by Katie O'Donnell) reaction to the hooks that he has in place of his hands. <br /> <br /> All these men and their families reunite in the film in various scenes. All the stories of these people are perfectly intertwined. <br /> <br /> This movie really defines the meaning of "Classic." This unforgettable drama (the winner of the best picture of 1946) is a film that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If I were asked to choose a favorite movie, it would be him! <br /> <br /> Out of 10 I would give "The best years of our life" 10. <br /> <br /> So the next time you go to the local video store, rent this film, you will not regret about it! <br /> <br NO undesirable material of a good family movie.
