I saw The Lonely Pigeon, The Dead Man’s Walk, and Laredo Streets, and now The Return to the Lonely Pigeon. If you crave more after watching The Lonely Pigeon, it will fill your belly. Great cast, great story. Definitely close second to Lonely Pigeon. I will buy this movie to add to my collection. This is the best, or at least my favorite talk by John Voight. He is Captain Call. Lou Gossett Jr., who plays Isom Pickett, is not the one I would contact, he is a bad ass from the point of view. William Peterson also does an excellent job. Rick Schroeder is back in the role of Newt with a fearful performance that reminds me of his work on the NYPD Blue. My only problem with this film (and it really picks up nits) is that I got the impression that Call wanted to be “the first person to graze cattle in Montana,” and it’s obvious that Dunnigan was already there for a while. A bit controversial, but easily overlooked when you lose yourself in a fantastic tale. I especially love the obvious growth of character Jasper Fant and Julie Johnson. I watched this movie several times and is ready for the next sequel.
