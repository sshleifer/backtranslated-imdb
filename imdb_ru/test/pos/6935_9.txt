Just finished with Zombie Bloodbath, part one, on the amazing Zombie Bloodbath trilogy DVD from CAMP Motion Pictures. Zombie Bloodbath 2: Rage Undead next. Now this left me a little puzzled because of several holes in the plot and some tangled turns, but this is the best movie on many levels. Directed by Todd Sheets really shows a significant leap in style and talent between the two films. Again, this is not for people who want glitter and Hollywood-style horror films, this is for people who like their bloody, raw and grainy zombies. As far as I can tell, the story was mainly about two robbers, who in 1945 were trying to steal from an elderly couple only to discover that this couple is a member of a cult. One guy is simply killed, and the other responsible for him is mostly made stuffed and crucified, and they stand in the nearest field, still alive but dying. Cut to this day, and the van, full of college students, breaks down near the farmhouse. At the same time, a group of convicts is escaping from a nearby prison. Both groups are in the same house. The house was the one in which elderly couples lived, and when one of the convicts knocks down an effigy and takes his jacket, it causes the effigy to wake up, and he, in turn, returns the cult members from the dead. Wow. And this is all in the first half hour. The city also has another conspiracy, where several serial killers took several workers hostage in a grocery store. It actually works, although the people locked in the house finally run away and end up in the same deli. Most of the turns work quite well, but itâ€™s obvious that the film was too complicated in some places for his own good. It all ends with a huge confrontation with the remaining heroes who find a truck with delivery or something filled with vials of bacteria that feed on meat. Of course, they throw him into the undead and cause a strong melting and explosion of several heads, and then we get a strange, thought-provoking end. First, let me say that, although it was not always easy to follow, I still had a good time with this film. It was fun, and the game was damn good for a low budget effort. It was obvious that Todd Sheets was really trying to get more attention than a typical zombie film, and he succeeded. He had better special effects than in the first film, a great pace and some cool music and visual effects, plus there is a real still-frame from INSIDE mouth when a knife is clamped through it. Care has been taken here and it shows. Weakness is in scripting and in some of the more lazy presentations. Again, I recommend listening to the track with comments. It was even better than the first, and I learned a lot. For example, to find out that some scenes were filmed on Super 8 film for effect, and the film came back destroyed from the laboratory, and they could not use it. And they had already edited the film by the time they returned the film, so some confusion is associated with several scenes that are not in the film. In addition, I learned that Todd Sheets does have a passion and love for making horror films. It shows. The film is a good example of a non-budget movie that could use another correspondence, but still shines more stylishly than most DV movies I see. Not as fun as the first movie, although technically the best movie. I really admire Sheets as one of the real innovators and pioneers in the field of DV cinema ... and this is a great addition to the Cheapo Zombie genre!
