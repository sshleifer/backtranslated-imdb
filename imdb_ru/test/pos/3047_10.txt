This film marked the beginning of my theory about films based on books: instead of following the cliché, “You read a book; Watch the movie now, if you are looking for a good book to read, try the one you liked the movie based on, because it will be 10 times better. <br /> <br /> I saw this film on its first release at the National Theater in downtown Eugene, and I liked it so much that I stayed to see it again. This is the perfect fusion of inspirational talents from one of my favorite actors, John Voight, with what became my favorite book by Pat Conroy “The Water Is Wide”. <br /> <br /> I can’t think of anything better than a film about the nobility of teaching and ironic life challenges. Two tiny notes: <br /> <br /> (1) Video suffers from panning and scanning and deserves a mailbox version. (2) The title should be restored to the name of the book, a link to one of the most touching, mysterious songs ever written
