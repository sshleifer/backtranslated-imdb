Alice enters the world of miracles ... but not of those miracles that you remember as a child. Mad Hatter, White Rabbit, Queen and others (even Tweedledee and Tweedledum) show Alice some things about her body - and other people's bodies - that can be quite remarkable. The tale of love and passion for those whom you have never seen. <br /> <br /> Christina DeBell appears in the role of Alice. I must say that by the standards of the 1970s, this may be the most attractive adult actress of her time. I believe that this is her only film before moving on to the main work, but it was pretty much the best that she could choose (my love for all things, Alice is not a secret). Even better than "Fairy Tale" (which is not really pornography, which means a lot). <br /> <br /> of the songs are cheesy, but match the theme of the film One song: "What does a girl like you do on a knight like that?" it was pretty funny, and others had similar themes. The process by the end was well planned and very well fit into Alice’s world. Logic and humor were definitely taken into account. <br /> <br /> What else can be said about such a film? All I know is that for people who are used to adult films, where it’s just a 30-second introduction to sex, this one will overload you with plot and music. But personally, I think there is something very special about this film, and I hope that it will get a good release on DVD with details, refined and special features (if possible). I see that this is a cult film.
