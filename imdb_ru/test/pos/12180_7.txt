In the Queen of the Damned, Akasha (Aliya) was more sexual and had a more demanding presence, she simply caught your attention and attention. now the film did have flaws, like the lack of an explanation for Akash's past. What I also didn’t like was that the film didn’t really explain or show more than what the relationship between Lestat and Akasha were / were like. The role of Akasha (Aliya) was, as it were, limited in the film, and she did not make it appear until the 2nd half of the film, and then, finally, her (Akasha) death came quickly. But I liked how Akasha resisted when the ancients tried to kill her, because in the book the last battle between Akasha and the Ancients was rather boring (they killed Akasha in about 2 seconds). Akasha’s head was knocked down for 1 second, and Lestat turned into the biggest punk in the world. <br /> <br /> Aliya played Akasha very well, and Stuart was perfect as Lestat, they could not choose the best Akash or Lestat.
