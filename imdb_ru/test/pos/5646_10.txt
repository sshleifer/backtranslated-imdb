My first Ichikawa in many years and the first of his war films that I saw was exciting and brutal from the very beginning. In the very first scene, the nominal hero Tamur is told that he cannot continue his part, to which he returned from the hospital. Does he have tuberculosis? but he is not sick enough for the hospital to take him, given the number of wounded that they have. But his old unit will not return him; his commander gives him a grenade and says that if he feels really hopeless to blow himself up, this is a worthy cause. <br /> <br /> Philippines, 1945, and the situation does seem hopeless for PFK Tamura and everyone else. Nobi is an odyssey from hell, or rather from hell ?? bare forests, dead rocky plains and dead and dying Japanese soldiers hoping only for the end, through peace or death. Ichikawa's film was photographed in a stunning black and white performance that emphasizes both the emptiness felt by Tamura and those with whom he meets on the road to death, and shows how all of them are really small and naked among the immense mountains and forests? â€œThis little business of people will soon end, the earth seems to be saying, but I will survive and hardly notice it. <br /> <br /> Tamura returns to the hospital, but (unsurprisingly) is rejected there and spends the rest of the film, trying to stay alive, remain a man and escape from danger. He fails to succeed in any way, slowly dying of hunger and ultimately performing rather repulsive actions. In the end, he associates with two other desperate men who have lost or survived in their squads and resorted to cannibalism, and in his weakened state before other armed people, he finds that the only way to live is to break with everything he believes. in. <br /> <br /> The Ichitawa film is as brutal, uncompromising and intense as any military film I've seen. There are moments of humor and tenderness, but they are fleeting and not remembered, such as a scene with a man on top of a mountain who practically begs Tamura to eat his flesh - a recurring black comic beat with Tamura, who exchanges his tattered shoes for the best skin of a fallen comrade ... that people will survive in order to survive ... the truth is that this is any war, all wars, all humanity, as long as we continue in the same spirit. A masterpiece that I probably will not look again for a very long time. Looked on the beautiful Criterion Collection DVD.
