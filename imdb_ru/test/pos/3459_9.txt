This is definitely one of the best films I've seen in a very long time. Top 20 of my life. I laughed more than ever since the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and I cried more than ever since I saw Notepad. If you are looking for a touching film without a sharp edge ... this is one. It is real and powerful. Look, and you will not regret. At first I refused, and I only watched it because I had to do a school project on speech disorders. But this film is much more than that. It's about life that is free and independent of how the world keeps you. We are talking about the shortcomings that each of us has that prevent us from seeing ourselves and what we are missing, but allowing everything else to get in the way.
