The story of a working girl (Ann Sautern), who has a rather thoughtless guy (Paul Kelly). This guy is so busy trying to start his own business, which again and again forgets about dating or is late. The last straw is when Sothern has a birthday, and Kelly says that he is too busy to take her to the celebration. Therefore, not wanting to just stay at home, she goes on a blind date with what is a very rich young man (Neil Hamilton). Sparks fly, but after Soterns breaks off his relationship with Kelly, it becomes obvious that the new guy Hamilton is the guy who loves them and leaves them. Itâ€™s not so difficult to predict how all this is finally decided - enough to say that in the end everything turns out just perfect. <br /> <br /> This is a very modest little movie from Columbia Pictures - with a relatively small budget, as well as second-tier stars. This is clearly "B-film", despite the fact that Mickey Rooney and Jane Darwell played small roles, since both of them have not yet become famous. This is not to say that these are bad actors or the production is bad. In fact, given the production values, this is quite an amazing film, as everything seems to work so well, despite the fact that it has a rather ordinary and somewhat predictable plot plan. This is because the actors and directors did an excellent job of telling the story. In addition, the writers did a good job on the characters and made you take care of them. The end, in particular, is really sweet, and tear ducts practically flowed through me! Because of these factors, the film earns 7 out of 10.
