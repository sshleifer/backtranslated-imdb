Ok, here's the deal. There is this American pilot who flies about doing his own business when suddenly evil, cowardly non-American fighters surpass him (these are Middle Eastern types, but suffice it to say that they do not like apple pie or Elvis Presley) who continue to shoot him down. Now this American pilot didn’t do anything wrong, but those evil non-Americans didn’t care, and before you knew it, they put him in another prison and were sentenced to death! <br /> <br /> Now, what usually happened was that the US military would have blown up a couple of neighboring cities until the pilot was released, but not this time. These evil lovers of the world were probably involved and were able to stop any punitive reprisal. As you can imagine, this does not please the family of the pilot, and the evil foreign dictator looks at him with a smug, contented look. He will make these Americans pay, yes, of course! <br /> <br /> But he did not count on Doug Masters, captured by the pilot of a 16-year-old son. You see that Doug could fly an airplane longer than he could drive (which could not be so long), and decides to fly to this evil foreign country and return his dad back. Thus, with the help of his friends, Doug and his slave, retired pilot Chappi Sinclair, Doug begins a two-person air raid on foreigners. <br /> <br /> Now you think that this plan is doomed to failure, but you are mistaken. Of course, these Middle Eastern types can be veteran veterans, but Doug has an ace up his sleeve, he listens to rock music when he flies! After shooting down a dozen or so enemy planes and exploding an oil refinery, Dag lands at the airport and takes his wounded father aboard the plane. It is clear that the evil, not so smug, the dictator is very annoyed by these antics and rises to the sky himself, trying to knock Dag down. But the young guy listens to some more rock music and takes the villain from the sky. HOORAY! <br /> <br /> After Dag and Chappi shot down 90% of their air force, foreigners send their last few aircraft in a rather unsuccessful attempt to shoot down Doug, but at the very last moment the flight of the American F16s arrives and scares them. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie enough. It was the first videotape film I brought, and until the age of twenty, I continued to hope that my father would be shot abroad so that I could save him. But he does not like to fly, so this did not happen.
