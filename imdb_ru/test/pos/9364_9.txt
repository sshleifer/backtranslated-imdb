Crossfire is one of those films of the forties, which requires a remake, if only for some other reason, perhaps it’s time to do it the way it was originally written. The story on which the film is based tells of the gay murder. But anti-Semitism was undoubtedly a hot topic in the days after World War II, when the Holocaust is on everyone's mind. <br /> <br /> In the biography of Robert Mitchum, director Edward Dmitrik, on the server “Lee”, and directly said that the film could not be made about the hate crime against gays while the Code was firmly in place . This could happen because the character of Robert Ryan is a hater of equal opportunities for everything that deviates from his social norms. <br /> <br /> Mitchum unequivocally said that he was in the film solely for the ride. Robert Young was appointed captain of the US police in Washington, DC, who is investigating the case, and although Mitchum received a second bill, he knew that from the very beginning the film would belong to Ryan. But he was a new RKO star thanks to his speeches in Joe's Story and Until the End of Time, so he was there for box office insurance. Mitchum was in the role of a sergeant and friend of the original suspect in the case, George Cooper. <br /> <br /> Crossfire is not a bastard, although we do not see a crime, it becomes clear that Montgomery is the one that kills Sam Leven, a typical Jewish seller. And for Yang and Mitchum, it becomes clear that Ryan is the guilty side almost as quickly as for the audience. It’s just a matter of getting evidence. <br /> <br /> Ryan received one of several Academy Award nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category. Despite the fact that he lost to Edmund Gwennu, the film became Ryan's breakthrough role. Similarly, Gloria Graham was assigned to a short role as a party girl in the nomination “Best Supporting Actress”, but lost to Celeste Holm due to the Gentleman Agreement. In fact, Crossfire ran into a gentlemen’s agreement and lost to Elijah Kazan for “Best Picture” and “Best Director” for Dmitry. This is the fifth nomination in the “Best Screenplay” nomination, and Crossfire was again the loser, the winner was Miracle on 34th Street. <br /> <br /> Gloria Graham also had her own problems on the set, which arose from her personal life. She had a big problem with her then-husband, Stanley Clements, who was an abusive husband. He hung around the set, causing Ed Dmitrik a lot of problems. Fortunately, Graham's role was small. In fact, the entire film was shot in the typical economic style of RKO in 20 days. <br /> <br /> Robert Young has a particularly beautiful scene with William Phipps, a young guy from Tennessee in Mitchum and his outfit Ryan, whom Ryan constantly humiliates. Young speaks most eloquently of the corrosive nature of hatred and how it influenced his family as Irish Catholics who came during the potato famine. It was one of Robert Young's best moments on screen for his entire long career. <br /> <br /> A good movie like Crossfire, it's time to transform it into a story about crimes against gay hate. Especially with the real murder of Barry Winchella over the last decade and the debate about gays in the army. <br /> <br /> This is a movie whose time has come and it’s almost gone.
