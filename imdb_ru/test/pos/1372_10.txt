I must confess that I know some of those who were implicated, I was the predecessor of the Planet, Unleased, however this was more than 10 years ago, and since then I have lost touch with them. I accidentally watched BBC Scotland News and an article about Scottish cinema, which included clips from The Planet and comments by director Mark Stirton. This prompted me to order a copy of the movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> Now about the film, the level of acting, writing, directing and sfx there with some of the best around, well, this is not “Star Wars”, but I have seen a lot of Hollywood product that is much inferior. It is very strange to watch a film that speaks of my local Northeast Scottish accent, but it soon passed. <br /> <br /> ^ Soft spoilers ^ <br /> <br /> "Planet" relies on several fantastic works; Star Wars, Alien, Black Pitch, Forbidden Planet and Predator, a handful of deep-space trading crew survive, their ships are attacked and destroyed by unknown ships, they escape to a desert desert planet, one by one they are killed by invisible attackers, the only passenger of the ship the prisoner also gets to the planet, the battle begins as the team fights to survive. <br /> <br /> Planet is a brilliant piece of sci-fi film, which of course makes, hides a limited budget, well done, Mark, Mike and everyone who participates in it, I look forward to your next work.
