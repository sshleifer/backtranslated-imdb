Absolutely acrid! Directed by Arthur Hiller and writer Paddy Chaiefsky dismantle the American hospital system using this evil comedy / drama / scum. The hospital pictured here is full of problems ... from protesting neighbors to the anger of patients to a potential serial killer at large. George S. Scott is the chief physician who, on the verge of his nervous breakdown, is associated with free soul Diana Rigg and her foolish father Barnard Hughes. Depressed and outraged, HOSPITAL contains some of the most sour dialogues imaginable (note how Scott describes his love making with Rigg). It also has a lot of great vignettes: Scott, scolding the head nurse Nancy Marchand after one of his subordinates here accidentally kills a doctor; Duffy administrator Francis Sternhagen is desperately trying to collect insurance information at a reception full of sick people; Scott receives sobering advice from a hospital psychiatrist, telling him about his woeful family life. All acting skills are first class. Scott and Rigg are dynamite, and Hughes is a real surprise. The film is a masterpiece with the script of Chayafsky, deserved by the honored Oscar (for such tough competitions as KLUTE & Sunday, BLOODY Sunday). The initial narration is priceless.
