This production was pretty good. Ordinary fabulous landscapes, interesting, bizarre characters. It was so strange that Captain Hastings, Miss Lemon and Poirot's office / residence did not appear in the original PBS / BBC puzzles. <br /> <br /> In the original series, so much happened on the office. Hastings reads the newspaper, and Poirot "trains his little gray cells." Miss Lemon rushes in whenever necessary. <br /> <br /> Poirot without captain. Hastings would have looked like Holmes without Watson ... he could certainly solve a crime, but this is not so interesting. <br /> <br /> And what is the secret of Poirot without Hastings, with his flawless manners to fall in love with some beautiful, inaccessible woman.
