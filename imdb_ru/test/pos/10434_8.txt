The Last American Virgin (1982) was one of the few juvenile comedies that I really liked. The subject and the action were much higher than the usual jokes that Hollywood felt (and still is) experiencing these days. But for some time, small studios produced films about teenagers who were not relaxed or relaxed for children. The men who pulled this production were from your friends from Cannon. <br /> <br /> Three teenagers are trying to lose their virginity while still at school. They will do anyone or anything to achieve the goal of their dreams. A sensitive member of the group (Andrew Mussun) will find the right girl, and his two best friends will take everything they can. One day, the baby finds his ideal girl (Diane Franklin). But fate will play one of their dirty tricks. His best friend approaches and knocks her down. Having knocked her down, a sensitive child helps the girl to stand up and pays for her abortion. He still feels for her and tries to win her heart. Meanwhile, his best friend very much quarreled over what makes the girl she dreams of prerogate. However, he tries his best to make her love him. Night comes when he asks her a question. But his heart is broken when he sees her dancing with her former best friend. In tears, the child leaves the party. <br /> <br /> What I liked about this film was that there were no blows in it. Instead of being filled with fake situations, it was very realistic, honest and cruel. The film is filled with funny moments and hysteria. I recommend this movie to fans of youthful comedies. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
