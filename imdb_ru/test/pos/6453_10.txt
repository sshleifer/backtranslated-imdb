I thought I witnessed every wrinkle a criminal / gangster movie could offer, but the Garrett-Marsin-Hammett combination evokes some genuine thrills and surprises here thanks to the ingeniously strong leadership of Mamuliana, the atmospheric photography of Lee Garms, plus surprisingly clear film editing and flawless special effects . A brilliant acting game also helps. Coop gives one of his most convincing performances as a secretive bootlegger, who has become a fearless haymaking (the type of character development that he had to repeat in other roles, such as Sergeant York). Miss Sydney (pictured in the center) in her first starring role also opens her eyes. Executives get great support from Paul Lucas, Winn Gibson and Stanley Fields as heavyweights, and even from Detective Robert Homans. The film was obviously realized with a huge budget, which brilliantly unfolds in its realistic, crowd-filled sets.
