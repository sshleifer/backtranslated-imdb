I just wanted to say that I really liked this film, but I also want to ask something. Does anyone know the name of the artist / song that the young boy is playing (I can't remember his name now) on my CD player? when his dad and two men come and pick up the TV and CD player ??? This song is so damn cool, although I can't understand a word of what they say ... feel free to write me the name of the artist / song at hpn_x@hotmail.com thank you in advance !! =) --------------------- repeating -------------------------- --- I just wanted to say that I really liked this movie, but I also want to ask something.
