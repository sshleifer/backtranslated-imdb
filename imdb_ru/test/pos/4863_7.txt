There are times when you don't need these deep drama series. When you do not want TV shows with heavy stories or just necessary to watch each episode to be able to hold on. There are times when you just want to watch a simple series with lots of action and cool characters. In those moments you had Cleopatra 2525. <br /> <br /> I was one of those who really enjoyed Charlieâ€™s angels. Critics said it was superficial and stupid. But the thing is, that's the point! People who could not relax and were expecting a serious film hated it. Similarly with Cleopatra 2525. This is superficial. These are stupid and unreal characters. And that's why I like it. This is not similar to other series. <br /> <br /> The first season was not very good. Cleo's character was annoying and too much. The story was a little lame, and you didn't know too many characters. But hey, they only had 20 minutes in each episode. <br /> <br /> In the last 5-6 episodes of Cleopatra 2525, they finally gave the series a full 40-minute duration. And it was here that I began to love it. The series finally began to grow in a very high-quality series. It is a pity that they had to cancel the series. Because the recent episodes of Cleopatra 2525 were actually very good. I will never forget Hel, Sarge and Cleo. Unique characters that only the creators of Xena could create!
