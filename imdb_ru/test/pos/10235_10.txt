Nightbreed is definitely my favorite movie, I shot more than one tape. Makeup is amazing, the story is beautiful. It requires several different turns and is not as deep as the story on which it is based (Kabal, Clive Barker), but to adapt the film it remains very faithful to the original material. The only problem with this film was the producerâ€™s vain attempt to turn it into a film for a teenage slasher, hence the changed ending to allow the continuation of the eyeglasses *. Obviously, someday we will get a director's abbreviation, which (I hope) will clarify this nonsense. Until then, I would advise this to anyone who loves dark horror like fantasy, and not slashers like Freddie / Jason / Michel. I really do not know what would be comparable ...
