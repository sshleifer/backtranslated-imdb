Who does not remember the Muppet film ??? <br /> <br /> Kermit the frog is now an icon of American culture. What kid doesn't attract this character? <br /> <br /> As the first Muppet film, the film was simply called “The Muppet Film”. Kermit listens to the advice of a Hollywood agent and leaves the house to respond to the announcement. On the way, he meets with a pig, a bear, chickens, a rock band and several other quality puppets. Watch dozens of episodic episodes, such as Madaleen Kahn, Steve Martians, Richard Pryor, Mel Brooks and a few others. I grew up watching this movie and I liked it.
