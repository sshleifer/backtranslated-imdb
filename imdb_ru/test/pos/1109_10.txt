I caught this film in Glenwood movie theaters on the weekend at the Kansas International Film Festival, which, as usual, provided a thoughtful and eclectic example of world cinema. <br /> <br /> I have been fond of the Australian film for many years, so I was pleased to know that this film was included, and I, of course, was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Superbly shot, firmly directed, this is a creepy story about one man and his journey into the very heart of darkness. It reminded me a bit of Lynch's “Wild Soul”, it has this strange madness, but I was attached to the film for other reasons, namely, that it represents a portrait of Australia, which ... well, very believable. <Br /> <br /> I rested several times in Land Down, once in the 1980s and again about 7 years ago with my wife. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to go into details explaining my vacation, but Director Frain seems to understand a lot of things that I find so strange and eccentric about Australia, a country that is responsible for Limbs, say, Nick Cave, on the one hand, and Steve Irwin ("The Crocodile Hunter") on the other. <br /> <br /> One small punch - I would prefer even more "unknown". Australia. Much more really. But I also understand that it takes only an hour and a half ... "Sigh". <br /> <br /> In general, this film is very, very successful.
