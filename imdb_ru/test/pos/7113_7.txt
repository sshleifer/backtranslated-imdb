This is a rather entertaining B-click in the Universal Horror series featuring Dracula, Wolf and the Monster of Frankenstein. The plot revolves around Dracula (John Carradine) and Larry Talbot, a wolf man (Lon Cheney, Jr.) visiting a revolutionary doctor separately. They both ask him if they can be cured, and the doctor is trying to find a way for everyone. Under the castle of the doctor, they find a Frankenstein monster buried in mud (this is apparently a reference to the previous film in the Frankenstein series). <br /> <br /> Of course, if everything went as planned, the film would be incredibly boring. Instead, Dracula cannot suppress his appetite, and the doctor eventually became infected with a blood transfusion by vampirism. Like poluvampir, the doctor goes mad and awakens the monster of Frankenstein. As with all Universal Horror series, the final is absolutely unsatisfactory. A beautiful woman with a hunchback, one of two assistant doctors, especially a terrible end. In addition, you just need to regret the monster of Frankenstein in this film - he wakes up for about two minutes, kills one policeman, and then another building (what is this, the fifth now?) Collapsing on him and the flame is absorbed. It is also regrettable that the great character created in The Wolfman (1941), Larry Talbot, is indeed reduced here. People underestimate this movie and Cheneyâ€™s performance in it. Here he will be justly criticized as wooden. All in all, it's a pretty funny movie in just 68 minutes. Good waste of time. 7/10.
