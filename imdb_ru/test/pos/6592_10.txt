This is an outstanding crime thriller, and with an excellent composition too. The best and most popular actors of Spanish cinema over the past couple of decades, Victoria Abril and Federico Luppi, come together in one of the best Spanish crime thrillers in the 2004-5 language. <br /> <br /> The film begins with focusing on thirty-something Ernesto (Ernesto Alterio), an elegant, attractive and clever thief who learned from his childhood friend Gitano, and more recently from Manco, an old experienced crook. Manco represents Ernesto Federico (Federico Luppi), also an elegant, but more insightful and experienced methodical thief - the best in his class. <br /> <br /> Federicoâ€™s only known weakness is Pilar (Victoria Abril), his former lover and partner. Suddenly she appears and offers an incredible robbery scheme to her former lover, a crime on a large scale, which ultimately will require the help of Ernesto, Manco and Gitano, among others. <br /> <br /> The script is full of turns and unexpected turns, especially near the end of the film. One criticism of the film, which I have heard a lot, is that by the end there are too many plot twists, but I disagree. The film captivates the audience so much that there are not so many people watching all the unexpected events. In fact, this is what makes the film outstanding. I highly recommend it.
