This is a phenomenal movie. Truly one of the best movies I've ever watched. I am a serious critic, and I need a lot to wake me up, but in this film were all the right combinations for "stirring." The passion of the actors, without replay, pain for all the characters, serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce, make this film a must-see, despite the fact that this is the 1970s. This is definitely not an “old movie,” but a classic / vintage movie. I hope that you take part in this, as I do when you consider what unstable relationships of all kinds can be, when you also think how deep the pain associated with love can be, and how the most difficult decisions will always be the most painful. , but as soon as they pain subside, but only gradually. This film certainly demonstrates that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily weak relationships, and that leaving, of course, is not synonymous with loss / lack of love. The “making” of this film certainly comes from the depths of someone’s heart and mind.
