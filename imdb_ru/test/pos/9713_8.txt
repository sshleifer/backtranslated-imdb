This film struck me - I saw only two episodes of the show, never saw the first film, but went to the preview, where Johnny Knoxville himself presented the film, telling us to "turn off our moral judgment for an hour and a half." He was right. Like a film, it would probably rate 2, given that it has a zero plot, no structure other than chance, and a very low production value. However, it is not the case. Everyone in our theater laughed and gasped all the way - not only some of the tricks were creative (see the trailer if you need to know, but they hid some of the best (or worse, depending on how you want to look at it)) some of the things they did took us by surprise. These guys do some things that don't get in your newspaper reviews (and probably can't even be published here), including a lot of things below the belt. However, almost 3/4 of the tricks are fantastically hysterical (even if they are morally condemned, but remember Knoxville), and if you're in the right mindset, watch this film hysterically. Only about 20 minutes of this film could be shown on TV, so consider yourself warned about what you are doing - some things are disgusting, but instead of pushing them away, you end up laughing at the sheer stupidity of it all, As a person who thought that the Jakass series was an over-promoted hobby with a few funny sketches and a lot of unnecessary pain, the huge amount of pleasure I experienced in this film made me realize that the lack of boundaries is the best medium for these guys to work with. It's a lot of fun and should be a great comedic solution, until the Borat film comes out. With this film you may think that you know what you are getting, but these guys are a few steps ahead of you - I guarantee that you will be surprised by the 3rd sketch. So enjoy it and don’t worry: you don’t want to play almost all your stuff at home.
