I decided to write a commentary on this amazing film, because here, on IMDb, it is mentioned that John Woo, a mediocre director who made some decent films in the pre-American years, but completely destroyed his reputation with his latest films made in American films, in plans redo it. Well, here are a few reasons why this is one of the most stupid ideas for a remake in history: the plot of the film is simple and even cliched by today's standards, but what makes the film a masterpiece is four leading, unique direction of Melville, cinema, music style. Today, no director can make such a film, it is impossible to create such an atmosphere in a film in a modern film business focused on the box office. <br /> <br /> John Woo did make a more or less decent film that Borrowed Samurai Killer had from Melville, but remember, it was made when the director was not spoiled by big budgets and expensive (in salaries), but cheap (in acting merit) actors. So I say that this is one of the greatest films ever made with another Melville film, Samurai. Watch this And even if a remake is made, try to avoid it before seeing the great original for the first time.
