At the beginning, with a careful, distant location and a sweet metallic sound, I thought about opening the stage in Once Upon a Time in the West. When he enters the city, he begins to feel like “Kitchen Stories” or “Drifting Clouds”, perhaps even “Grimm.” <br /> <br /> Then it turns out that this is more like "Joe." "Against the volcano" in the subject (not in style). And the film is played from beginning to end in the same, understated style. Allowing you to observe, perceive the steel blue-gray tones of the suites, dresses, wall colors, furniture, sheets, mirrors, cars, music, background sounds and even people's expressions. Then, towards the end, there is one frame of a completely different tone — a warm orange-yellow with soft music and a splash of the ocean, children, and laughter. <br /> <br /> But maybe the observation is too long for me, I would much better see the alternative side or what happens to the character after the final shot. Still beautifully made.
