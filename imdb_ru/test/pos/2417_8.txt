This is the fourth film from the “Karate Kid” series. However, he has nothing to do with the previous 3. the only remaining character is Mr. Mägi. this time Mr. Mägi meets the restless girl Julie Pierce (Hlary Swank, before she became famous) Having all kinds of problems, including bullying at school with a boyfriend belonging to a pseudo-military club on campus. Naturally, she is trained in how to fight. In any case, thanks to Mägi, Julie studies karate and becomes a spiritual person better, and also she teaches herself and, in the end, regains her respect. I like the unique idea that the antagonist is a woman, and as her enemy is a man. I There are also several battle scenes that are done quite well, very discreetly and with minimal violence. The fight is graphic. The ending is also nice and a bit surprising. it is predictable, but not the typical ending for this kind of film. the film has echoes of the original, especially the spiritual aspect and lessons learned. as good as the 1st mov that is, and, of course, not as good as the 2nd. This, however, is a giant leap forward compared with the unsatisfactory 3rd record. This is a very interesting film about dogs that is suitable for the whole family. 8/10
