The greatness of Ramina Bakhrani’s second trait is that, like the poet’s oeuvre, he portrays the very soul of humanity and allows it to flourish on screen. Aside from the possibilities of most other Indian films, CHOP SHOP is wise, emitting the very best of the greatest cinema of all time; we can look back at the works of Bresson and Pasolini and compare the works of Bakhrani with theirs, and yet the CHOP SHOP is fresh and relevant to modern society. Can we see the master's work here ?? a certain sense of beauty, style and content come together in a film that reminds us of what it means to be alive. Instead of focusing on the side of New York that we see so often, do we live and breathe with our young hero, Alejandro, in Willits's impoverished point ?? fascinating quasi-sub-world of our culture ?? and yet it is a very, very real place. Trying to stay afloat, Alejandro is forced to support himself and his older sister. Watch this movie and feel the feeling of pure spiritual understanding that Bahrani is leading us to ?? all with deep and concise realism.
