I was not able to completely block this film from memory, although two years have passed since I saw it. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong - I forgot the main storyline a long time ago - the relationship between Kidman and Lo, who did not make any impression on me, but I was struck by the torture scenes in the film. I cried for about two hours immediately after coming. <br /> <br /> It never occurred to me before how people in wartime can take advantage of something as pure as motherly love. We see several examples of this here - both in the scenes with Natalie Portman, and with the mother with the fingers in the fence for hiding her son at home. I was shocked by these scenes and, probably, I will never again watch the movie as a result, because the scenes are even now completely clear in my memory. Nevertheless, I am glad that I watched the film simply because it made me better understand the horrors of war and the terrible cruelty that humanity can inflict on its own. <br /> <br /> The albino blonde character has been on my list of the most evil bad guys since I watched the movie. His terrible ridicule and the absence of any human feelings for the people he tortured really hit me. At some point I wanted to get up in the cinema and kill him myself (see Movie pushed me to the brink of reason, then it occurred to me that I would only get on the big screen - which shows the strength of the film and the intensity at least). <br /> <br /> I recommend the film for its unforgettable experience not for an intertwined love story, but for the manner in which he portrays a war without needing a battlefield.
