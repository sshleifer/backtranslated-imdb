Oh, so beautiful, oh, so tearful and so heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Everything seems so superficial, so pale and meaningless in comparison. <br /> <br /> Helen's sister is not a real saint. <br /> <br /> She is a real person - flawed, rude and dull, but passionate and with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> What seemed most interesting to me was that this handful of miserable, unhappy people found meaning and laughter. <br /> <br /> What I liked the most was the way the polarity of human nature is depicted in the documentary.
