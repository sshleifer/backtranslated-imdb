Thank God for the Coen brothers. Their success brought them big budgets, but did not save them from their creativity. I was planning to watch another movie, but it was sold out, so I went to this movie. By the time it started, I forgot which movie I was there to watch. I was surprised in many ways than one. This movie is funny, but they are not joking just to laugh. The writing is great, and delivered with great skill by George Clooney (after that no one can say that he is just a pretty face) and other actors. This can be assessed on many levels, whether you remember the Odyssey or not. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that was so smart. I saw others whom I would call beautiful, intriguing, funny and charming, and they all also describe Oh Brother, but this film reminded me of the older Seinfeld episodes, where in the end all the stories came together. You may feel that their journey is building something, but you cannot say that. And the Coen brothers do not let us down, the end, of course, does not disappoint. This is amazing, and connects all loose ends neatly, without wearing a history.
