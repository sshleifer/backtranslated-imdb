A teenager looking for a pot, Joshua Miller (as Tim) throws his sister's doll into the river, while Daniel Robak (as Samson) howls and smokes a cigarette after he killed Dani Dits (as Jamie). The doll is washed off, but a naked young woman stays at the “Edge of the river” so that any passerby can see it. A group of twenty teenagers, mostly classmates of a naked corpse, is looking at a dead body. Stoners Keanu Reeves (like Matt) and Crispin Glover (like Lane) found the most decent camera. Friends are wondering what to do with their guilty, greedy, beer-killer friend. <br /> <br /> A veteran in the cast of Dennis Hopper (as Fek) constantly feeds the heads of young people. Mr Hopper once killed a woman. He lives with one of those life-sized sex dolls, with a mouth apparently ready for action. Lone Sky Leitch (like Clarissa) is a more lively doll, and she is waiting for Reeves to kiss her. Their copulation is markedly transversely with a return to open suffocation. In fact, the teenager, in her first leading role, Mrs. Leitch is the daughter of the sixties singer Donovan. Create other fancy links on your own. <br /> <br /> You can read a lot in a movie or not, depending on your mood. Some of the character backgrounds may be too thin. It is clear that the teen murderer was teased; notice its weight, attitude and nickname associated with the toilet. Some of the attitudes and motives of the characters are too vague, but the cast, of course, makes the material interesting; and directed by Tim Hunter, photographer Frederick Elms and writer Neil Jimenez are obviously experienced. <br /> <br /> ******* The Edge of the River (08/27/86) Tim Hunter ~ Keanu Reeves, Crispin Glover Dennis Hopper, Joshua Miller
