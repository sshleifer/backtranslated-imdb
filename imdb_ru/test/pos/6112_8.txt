I first got acquainted with the films of John Waters, after seeing “Women's problems” at the IFC. I was disgusted, but for some painful reason I enjoyed it. Then I picked up the Pink Flamingos DVD in the John Waters boxed set. The Babs Johnson film Dirty Man Alive, which lives in a trailer in Maryland with its obese obese egg mother and her crazy son Crackers. In the film, you will see such sore spots as sex with chickens, transvestites, people who eat feces, torture and all other types of occasional humiliation. The film features the soundtrack of 60s rock'n'roll artists. The only problem is that some parts of the film seem to stretch and can get a little boring. I found that "Women's Trouble" is a bit more fun. Nominal NC-17 for explicit sex, violence and harassment. Enjoy.
