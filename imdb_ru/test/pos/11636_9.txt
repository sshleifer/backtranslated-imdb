Good. To enjoy this quiet, short comedy, you MUST suspend distrust of the filmâ€™s main starting point. If you can not, then most likely you will have more chances to score this film much lower. Charlie Chase has a huge bite, and his wife has a big nose to have her own city code. Unknown to each other, they both saved on operations to correct these defects. Apparently, plastic and dental surgery was better in the 1920s, because none of them needed to recover from these major surgeries, and they looked just fashionable! Well, remember, I said to ignore it, right ?! Well, then you will also have to ignore the complex belief that both can meet and have no idea that the other is their spouse. Well, now that you allowed yourself to accept these two stupid prerequisites, the film was very, very good. <br /> <br /> Charlie makes her pass, and she to him. Both are shocked and excited because no one has ever found them attractive. So, because of this new vanity, they agree to a date. But they both sneak home - not wanting their spouses to know! In any case, they occur later and rather attract each other. But what about poor spouses supposedly at home? Well, they both know that the other is married, and both expect their marriages to lead to divorce, because they really want to be with each other! At the end of the film, Charlie discovers that the woman is really his wife, and he goes through a very funny sequence where he plays both the guy and the old husband - changing clothes and inserting artificial teeth when he plays the husband! This is really wild laughter - to see him bounce in the room and out of the room when he seems to be fighting with another person! You really have to see it to believe it. However, the wife sees an ad with pictures of Charlie before and after and knows what is going on. In the end, they both feel pretty stupid!
