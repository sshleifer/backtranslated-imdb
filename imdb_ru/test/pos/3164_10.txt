Totally worth checking out. I saw it on the birthday of MLK in 2006, and it struck me. Sometimes it seems that we are all trapped and doomed to repeat the past no matter how much we try to change. All we can do is keep going and talking. Just keep going. I do not want to be sad, because this is not the main thing, but maybe we need to go down before we see how much we need to work on ourselves. What happens when the best people continue to tell us, such as MLK, what should happen to get us out of our “dead end”, but we do not listen. I know that some of us are listening, but how to make the rest of the world see things as they really are? Just go on, I think. This film made me think more about all this, so I think he did what he intended to do. This is what I consider a good film, play, book, poem, speech, or something else: something that makes you think and gain strength to move in an active direction, rather than sitting stuck, bored and hopeless.
