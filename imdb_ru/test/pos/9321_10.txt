I really liked this movie. I find it very interesting for me, because I feel that he caught the romanticism of Irish-American culture at the turn of the century. There are no posts. There is no violence and no obvious sex, only useful entertainment in the style of 1947, and Dennis Morgan had the opportunity to sing some really good songs. Really good movie.
