This is really a movie that you need to watch twice. When I first saw this film, I was really involved in the story. While most of the story takes place in a hotel room, the stories that Buddy (Nick Drake, a wonderful hint) and Daphne tell, take you outside their room and into their world. Through their conversations, you feel the loneliness and pain that everyone feels. The soundtrack perfectly complements the film, dark, spectacular and intriguing. When you watch a movie a second time, you can collect all the clues you missed the first time and lead to one of the best endings I've seen in a long time. I hope to see this film, find a distributor for the DVD so that it is more affordable. Great movie, you will not be disappointed.
