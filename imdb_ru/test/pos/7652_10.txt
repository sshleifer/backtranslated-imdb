My girls 4 and 6 love this show. We stumbled upon him at the PBS station, and they always ask when he is now. It reminds them of their grandmother, who cares about them every day in the summer. This is also funny, and sometimes they can't stop talking about a particular scene. I definitely recommend this show to all young children. It is very clean and shows you to slow down and not about watching TV all day. When Nana reads the story, it happens slowly, and she talks about every page of Monet. It reminds me to slow down when I read the next book to my girls before bed and talk about the book, instead of reading it quickly, just to fall asleep.
