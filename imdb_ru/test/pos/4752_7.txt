This film is not about soda and not about French Connection. <br /> <br /> Seven Oops is a group of elite police officers who do not use tactics in accordance with the New York Police Protocol. Scheider leads the group with his troops or ordinary jokes. They monitor the local Bonfire Nostra cartel, and cases are exposed when a police officerâ€™s telegram is detected. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Richard Lynch, the most evil man in the film (Invasion: America, Little Nikita) and his partner eventually killed a policeman by accident and escaped Shaider in the coolest chase scene I've ever seen , Bullitt and French Connection are not as good as they rise from the west side to George Washington and Palisades Boulevard in New Jersey. <br /> <br /> The stunt drivers are awesome, and Lynch frees them, although he looks scared without a dangerous journey. Roy Shader almost died when his car crashed into the stubby rear of the Mack truck, tearing off the roof of his car. <br /> <br /> Everything comes to a conclusion, and you need to make sure that you follow this sequence. Fast and intense, fresh for thirty years.
