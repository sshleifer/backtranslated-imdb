Supercarrier was my favorite movie in the late 80s when it came out. My dad taped it for me, and I watched it all the time until my stepmother taped Opru on it and my heart broke. I would like to know if or where I can get this. I was looking for it. I suppose they even came out with the Supercarrier 2. He wasn't as good as the 1st, but I would like to have them all if I could find them. I don't think @ all that it was a bad movie. It was a very interesting film with a lot of action, but it contained a love story plot. The actors / actresses in the movie were great. It also helped me understand that this is not only the male world, but also the female world, and many women can do the same, if not more than a man, and women deserve a lot of respect for their duties.
