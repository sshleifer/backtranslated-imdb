This is a funny, intelligent and, in a sense, realistic comedy about a 14-year-old girl trying to live her first love while on vacation, as well as the complex, sometimes funny, sometimes touching relationship between a divorced father and her growing daughter ... and how far a woman (not just Nicole, a teenager) can go to get the man she loves! I laughed a lot at this lively scenario that never drags on.
