Despite several acceptable changes in the main themes of the book, “The Queen of the Damned / Vampire Lesat” did not remain true to the complex story of Anna Rice. The deep layers of which all the characters consist were broken only on their surface, if not on a completely different identity. The chronological order of the main events in the film looked distorted and uneven. <br /> <br /> However, the film did quite a lot of things to deserve my rating of 7. First, the film caught a strong eye. that Lestat (among other vampires) had for the public, especially young girls. The film also did a pretty good job, focusing on the importance of heredity and the story that vampires are proud of. Scenes of sensuality were also atmospheric satisfactory. <br /> <br /> The acting game in “The Queen of the Damned” was moderate, if disappointing. At Stuart Townsend and Aalia there is an amazing chemistry, although it only shows when the acting is at its best (not very often). Characters are nothing compared to characters from The Interview with the Vampire. He also lacks the emotional intelligence of PIE OF ALL SAINTS, which is a shame, because in the book “Queen of the damned” Rice was this and much more. <br /> <br /> This film does not give all that it seems. The effects are boring and very disappointing. The extravagance required in many scenes is not given, and the dialogue is tiring. The settings for many scenes are not the same as I portrayed them in the book, and I think that many of them were not even taken from the story. At the beginning and in the middle of the film there are only a few areas of inconsistency, but this ends quite neatly, giving the viewer a complete story (if they have not read the book). <br /> <br /> Somethings I think that the film is necessary with a good original score (Howard Shore or Elmer Bernstein) instead of a mixture of rock music; although I had no problems with some songs. One more thing that would make the film better is to set the direction better. The scenery was boring and unclear, which is important in a story that often moves. <br /> <br /> Overall, the Queen of the Damned was disappointingly disappointing, but at the same time somewhat satisfying adaptation of an important novel. With a few simple changes, perhaps this was a very successful work on the film. I would recommend this film to people who watched INTERVIEW or read books so that they can form their own opinion about adaptation.
