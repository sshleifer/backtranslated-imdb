I'm not going to lie. To say that this film is confusing is like saying that the sun is hot, but not quite. And if you’ve seen the previous films by cult director Richard Kelly Donny Darko and Tales of Southland, you know that this should mean something. When I went to see this film, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before the hour of the film, about half of the viewers had already come out. Towards the end there were only 15 people left who were wondering what the hell they just saw. For example, I could understand only about 40% of what I saw on the screen, and even then it can only be called an interpretation. So why did I give this film a generous seven stars? Because, first, we get some impressive performances (Marsden is great, and Langella returns as a familiar creepy character), and, most importantly, two, because he is completely original, and Richard Kelly is undoubtedly one of the most daring directors , uses his creative vision to tell a story that dares to be different. Frankly, this is the ONLY way - only thanks to Kelly's unique style can you tell this story as it was intended. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you don’t want to waste serious thoughts on a smart movie (and even then it may mean nothing), stay away from it. But if you want to see a deep, rich, complex and thought-provoking article on the spirituality, existentialism and predictability of human nature, look at this. However, be prepared for long discussions with your partner. <br /> <br /> * Note. If you accidentally read this review, taking advantage of my recommendation, really watched the movie and BELONGELY believe that you lost 2 hours I would love to share my views on the whole point and plot of the film. See, that's why I liked it so much - it promotes discussion! No matter how difficult it is, I will try to summarize by paraphrasing the rather depressing quote from the character of Langella, which explains the meaning of a simple box for an employee: “Your home is the box in which you live. You went to work, it's a box on wheels. When you get home from work, you sit in front of a box with moving images. You watch until the mind and soul rot, and the box that is your body collapses when you are finally placed in the final box ... rest underground and earth. "
