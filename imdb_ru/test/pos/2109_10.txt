Without a doubt, GRAND CHAMPION has the most impressive cast of "AAA" stars and musicians who ever get together for a fun family adventure rated "G". This is MUST BUY for each video collection! Directed by BARRY TABB skillfully combines the drama of the rodeo / 4H competition for the cow “GRAND CHAMPION” with a touching and amusing history of resistance to difficult trials. Joey Loren Adams, as a well-intentioned mother, demonstrates her usually conscientious role, but the star of the series is 12-year-old Emma Roberts, whose presence on the camera shines like her famous aunt Julia. You can expect a lot from this young pro-Roberts protégé, who has already established herself in her new popular Nickelodeon series "UNABABULOUS".
