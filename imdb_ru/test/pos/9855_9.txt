What a crazy movie! It lasts 12 (!) Hours, and you do not understand who these people are and what they do! The main story is about a bunch of ignorant actors trying to bring "Prometheus" to the stage, but there are many subplots, such as the disappearance of Thomas and the crazy guy looking for Monsieur Varok .... what is the meaning of all this ???
