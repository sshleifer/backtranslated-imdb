One of my favorite. As a child, when I grew up in the New York Metro area in the late 60s and early 70s, I was often given the opportunity to visit New York with my grandfather or father as they did business there. The sandy, noisy, human reality of this city, especially in winter, remained with me. <br /> <br /> This film very well reflects the harsh, cold and extraordinary feeling of the winter season in New York, while at the same time vigilantly revealing the lower part of the notorious underworld of police and police activities. Great shot of the place, time and culture. <br /> <br /> And the car chase is just awesome. At least, on a par with what is in the "Bullitte", and surpass the pursuit of the "French connection." I can watch, again and again, how the suspension detaches from that police cruiser Plymouth Fury, rushing in pursuit of the GW bridge as it moves along this steep right curve, bouncing and slipping into oncoming traffic. The stunt coordinator for this scene was filmed in the films Bullitt and French Connection, as well as in many other famous films. Good acting and decent storyline. The musical score is sharp and irresistible, and cinematography and direction are top notch. An excellent, though underrated, police drama of the 1970s. The keeper. However, not yet released on DVD. <br /> <br /> Similar in style and content to: The French Connection and Super Fly. The beginning of the 1970s, police drama took place in the cold winter months of New York.
