This film is very stupid and very funny. You can never criticize him for taking himself seriously. If you heard their previous album or saw their HBO video from the album, you can imagine what a terrible, awesome time it is - this film tells a fable about how the band Tenacious D. has appeared. only gives a fictional story about Tenacious D, but also represents the history of musical history. Humor reminds of “Something about Maria” in the sense that they often “go to places you thought you wouldn’t be about,” but they lack the scatological humor of South Park. This film does not contain nudity, with the exception of the moon.
