I love this show. This is a refreshing look at some old sci-fi sensations and styles. they are not afraid to shoot, and when they do, people tend to die. Too many shows are afraid of this and end up simply pointing their arms, and then doing it with opposition. Farscape also comes with a lot of heartbreaking characters. They all grow up on you until the moment when you are confused, when they discuss how to take some of the animatronic ones from their boxes to create a mini-series. From start to finish, Farscape leaves you with a sense of hope and despair when new and unexpected things happen, and then people live and die, surprising you every time. Worth seeing, even if you have no time.
