This is not as good as in the movie, which says that this is a cute children's show. Well, the Emperor has reverse gear, and he again becomes a selfish, spoiled boy, accept him and enjoy the cartoon as something interesting. He has a lot of jokes for his parents, and he still attracts the attention of children. It also boasts two original voice cast actors from the film. The Land of Kitt, which starred in many films, but I am sure that many people know that this is Catwoman. And Patrick Walburton (sorry if I'm wrong), who also appeared in many films and TV shows, but is most widely known as "Tick." This is really a rare and wonderful combination. If for some other reason, I highly recommend comic fans to watch at least one episode to enjoy a dynamic duet. To sum it up, an entertaining children's show with lots of jokes for adults to laugh with them. If you are looking for educational value, this is not your show. If you're looking for something funny, then this is a great choice for a Saturday morning!
