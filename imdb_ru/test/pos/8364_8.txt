Shazam was fine, but Hero High was my favorite when I was a kid, I mean, before Sky High (2005) and Zoom (2006), there was Hero High, a school of learning superheroes, teenagers with supernormal abilities, help the police catch the bad guys, and in other cases they end up in awkward situations, such as "The Greatest American Hero" (1981). It was a funny cartoon that was also funny, it was a live stage show called The Kid Superpower Hour with Shazam. The actors, who voiced the characters, also dressed, there are characters in the show. Rex the Merciless (John Berwick), Misty Magic (Jere Fields), WeatherMan (Jim Greenleaf), Captain California (Chris Hensel, who also sang the theme song), Dirty Trixie (Meilo Maccaslin), Glorious Gal (Becky Pearl, who is a love child Superman and Wonder Woman) and Punk Rock (Johnny Venokur). The whole cast just went with anything when it came to anecdotes. The cartoon was a funny superhero comedy, I support it, will return in live action as Fat Albert (2004)
