I thought this movie was good, I liked the plot, I liked the shooting scenes, except for a few, they were not needed, and I also liked the character of Ma, she was a racer, I liked it. I have to say that in this gangster movie the actors were chosen well, because sometimes some actors simply do not fit the role. However, although I hate to say it, but I hate the final, I felt that he had to go in a different direction. It would also be better if there were a few more details based on real events, but there were so many facts that were not taken into account, but other than that, it was good. If you like movies about past gangsters, you will love this movie.
