I think Melville conceived this film to be cool definition; it has the cool approach of the late 60s / early 70s thrillers - the same discrete quirkiness. LE CERCLE ROUGE, a bitter and fatalistic story, is also the playground of Delon, Bourvilles, Volonte and Montana for defining roles. <br /> <br /> Bourvil is a police officer who has three cats and a daily routine in the apartment. Delon is a bully. Montand is a sick, unlucky cop. Volonte plays escaped suspect. LE CERCLE ROUGE is, of course, far superior to film robbery; Melville uses his tricks - long wordless detailed descriptions of each step of the robbery, etc. And yet this particular action movie is much better than his other films, and it is very unlikely that he will be much better. The appearance of the LE CERCLE ROUGE is very distinctive for Melville, very Melvillian. <br /> <br /> Delon was sharp and cool; Bourville brings his craft, and Montand plays perhaps the best part in this film; his performance has unexpected warmth. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, characters are barely drawn, nothing more than strictly necessary and are personas. Or masks; yet the image is inspired, economical, but suggestive. <br /> <br /> Another film that proves that Delon is a good, very good actor; and the fact that he is not a genius does not mean that he should be despised as a fourth-year actor. He is good, he can bear the closeness of Bourville and Montana. <br /> <br /> Just ten years. before LE CERCLE ROUGE Melville did, by the end of the 50s, a boring, too long tasteless noir-pastika (starring himself) - and after only a decade he was in full shape with this rather amazing fighter. Stylistically, this is a success. <br /> <br /> Before seeing LE CERCLE ROUGE, I was not a Melvillian fan; Now I think I'm alone. <br /> <br /> LE CERCLE ROUGE is a drama, namely an action movie, one of the most demanding genres. Melville scores.
