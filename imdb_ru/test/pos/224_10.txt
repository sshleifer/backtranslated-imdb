I still consider "Police Squad!" like the funniest tv show of the 1980s. Somewhere on BetaMax no less, I have all six episodes. I knew that this good show would not last long, and I had to keep it for myself. How stupid was the alphabet? According to them, the audience did not know that “Police Squad!” Was a comedy, because there was no laughter in it! Right! When Drebin has a line like “You risk just getting up in the morning, going to work or putting your face in the fan.” How can this be a comedy!?!? I have seen each episode at least ten times and still see something new that I missed before. Even deep backgrounds always have ongoing jokes. Do not miss if you have a chance to see the episode, but if you are reading this, then you probably already have copies, you have slipped out somewhere, like me.
