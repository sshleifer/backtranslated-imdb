Greystoke is without a doubt the best Tarzan movie I've ever seen. Christopher Lambert portrays a very believable person trying to return to the world of humanity with the fantastic Ian Holm. Johnâ€™s struggle to leave the jungle and the monkeys that raised him are very exciting. Some very memorable scenes, including when Lambert makes jungle noise for romantic interest, and the scene where he witnesses the death of his monkey father. Tarzan's feelings for both worlds are well developed and really make you feel him. <br /> <br /> An excellent and underrated movie.
