As a purposeful lover of all Egyptian, this is a classic of the 50s, along with my other favorite, the Land of the Pharaohs. "The sets and colors are just wonderful, and everything seems so neat as production. I thought Victor Matrei was well played , and Peter Ustinov is a real gem! The whole view of the film (along with others shot in this era) has an appeal that you just won’t get with modern films with all their digitized effects (I’m still to watch the 1999 film Mummy, but i am u Yep, I like him!). <br /> <br /> Best stuff!
