In One Dark Night there is a typical horror movie for teens with a completely unique plot. Ultra-thoughtful music and gothic / claustrophobic atmosphere greatly complement this small film, which is a pleasure. Meg Tilly copes with the role of "Julie" and leads us through the maze of the mausoleum, giving a feeling of foreboding and loneliness. Other teenagers are equally effective in their roles, as is Melissa Newman, the main character of the film. The special effects are great, although outdated. This film is highly regarded, but it can be good, so that it will never be destroyed by endless sequels. In this film, great dark magic flows; after you connect, you’ll really understand this and you’ll have fun. A DVD with two discs is available, although it was not possible to find the original negative to restore the movie. Maybe someday it will be found. I think that to some extent, carbon speckles piece by piece help the film, giving it the respectability of the old school and making it more unexpected in the end, when suddenly a lot of effects appear. <br /> <br /> The second disc has a draft / alternative version with a temporary version of the film, which gives a more detailed explanation of the death of two girls, very poetic (“Amontilado Barrel” comes to mind in a new way!) In addition, a great end voltage at the entrance to a dark crypt. Not sure that it was a blow to the main audience, but it certainly worked for me and very creepy ... there is also a documentary film that is interesting because it gives information about what was happening at that time with the actors, the crew director and writer; candid material, then current logos, discussions of frames and scenes, rehearsals. It is very unique that this material exists for a small film then.
