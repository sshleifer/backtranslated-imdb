I don’t know about the English version of this film, but the Norwegian translation is the funniest film I've seen in years. The characters say so many funny things and make so many strange references to current events that I am amazed that they have more and more options, like an architect who can never correctly name the name of the magician Miraculix. It becomes such things as Malcom (i) X and "utenriks", which is Norwegian for foreign affairs. <br /> <br /> Like the word "utenriks", many translations do not give any meaning in English, and probably not in French, so translators had to come up with their own jokes, and did it very well. Of course, they have a very good basis for creating a film that is simply comic from the very beginning to the end! <br /> <br /> Recommended in all languages ​​with good translation!
