Perhaps the best TV show ever made (there is no argument here yet) about Earthman Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkov and the beautiful Dale Arden, traveling on a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet. Along the way, the fascinating, action-packed and action-packed heads of Flash and his friends, along with new friends found, such as Prince Barin, Prince Tun and the amazing King Vultan, combine their resources to fight evil and the armies of merciless Mina. Mongo and the jealous betrayal of his daughter. Bring Aura (now she is a car!). This series is not just head and shoulders above most TV shows in terms of plot, action and budget - it is much ahead in these areas. Produced by Universal Studios, it has many former kits at its disposal, such as the lab set of The Bride of Frankenstein and the opera house of Phantom of the Opera. Production values ​​in all directions, in my humble opinion, increased in 1936. The costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are truly creative and first class. We have people hawks, people sharks, people lions, high priests, creatures such as dragons, octagons, orangapoids and tigrons (oh my God!) And many, many other fantastic things. Are these all believable and first-class special effects? Never. But for 1936, most are impressive. The musical accompaniment is excellent, and the beginning of the chapter is well written, long enough to revive the viewer's memories of the previous chapter, and is skillfully voiced. Directed by Frederick Stephanie copes with his tasks perfectly and creates a decent film for the phenomenal comic book Alex Raymond. Finally, the acting in this series is pretty good. Too often, TV shows have no names or talents surrounding one or two former talents — here most people have some abilities. Don't get me wrong, this is by no means a Shakespeare troupe, but Buster Crabbe does Flash in a businesslike, enjoyable job. He is skillfully helped by Jean Arden, Prezella Lawson and the rest of the actors in general with two outstanding performers. But before I get to these two, let me add, as another reviewer noted, it must have been surprising that this show went to the Hayes Office. I see more flesh on Flash and Gene Rogers and Countrylight Lawson than in films a decade later. Crabbe shorts (and, unfortunately, for all of us, who are worn by Professor Zarkov ((Frank Shannon)), are about as tight as the shorts guys can wear. Girls wear swimming trunks in the middle and absolutely beautiful Jean Rogers may have limited The game is talent, but she is a blonde bomb. Lawson is also very sultry, sensual and beautiful. But for me, the two actors who make the series are Charles Middleton as Mina: responsible, sardonic, merciless and funny. Middleton is a cool game. Jack Lipson plays King Vultan: w Many, cheerful, cheerful - a symbol of pure joy in the life and essence of hedonism. Lipson steals every scene he is in. The plot twists here, there and everywhere - but Flash Gordon is the penultimate series, the space opera and the basis for many science fiction. Fine!
