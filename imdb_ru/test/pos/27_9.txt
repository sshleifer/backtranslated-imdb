Albert Finney and Tom Courtney are great, like Sir and his chest of drawers. Of course, the performance is brilliant to begin with, and nothing can compare with the immediacy and collegiality of the theater, and I think that you listen better in the theater; but on the screen we become closer, we are “closer” more than in the theater, we see subtle changes in the expression, we “see” better, and also we listen. Both the play and the film are amazing: touching, clever, illuminating - the behind-the-scenes history of the company, the historical context, the two main characters and the parallel characters in Lear itself. If you can’t see it in the theater (I don’t think it’s been filmed a lot today), please do yourself a favor and get a video.
