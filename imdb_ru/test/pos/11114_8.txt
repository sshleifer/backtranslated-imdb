Although at first glance this film looks like the story of your parents' school life (and many people will try to tell you that this film HAS BEEN OBSERVED) ... and I admit that it was MY first impression .... but honestly "lessons" of heroine is def. NOT outdated. Who does not want to be famous? And who does not want to be accepted by my peers? And the homosexual guy - isn't there today disagreement about same-sex marriage, blah, blah? This film, although released in the 1980s, still solves some of the biggest problems in the modern world. Although this film is really too much profanity and nudity. (thus rating 8/10)
