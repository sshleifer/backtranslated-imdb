Looking back at the career of Alfred Hitchcock, it is impossible not to wonder how such a brilliant and far-sighted person can be denied sufficient recognition of his revolutionism in the film industry. This is probably a sign that Hitchcock is ahead of his time, always trying to push the envelope and never stop at what has been accomplished with a film made just for fun, but always with a deeper, more insightful motive in his mind. “Strangers on the train,” one of Hitchcock’s first and most misunderstood hits, is a great example of these traits — a fascinating and tense story, even if viewed more than 50 years later, yes, but so carefully and reasonably constructed that today it is a masterpiece in engineering movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the innovative “thrillers about indecision”, “Strangers on the train” may seem a bit outdated in some aspects, but it retains all the beautifully created tension, as it did in 1951 (if a little less shocking). The brilliant use of cinematography and lighting, as well as quick, careful editing, is what really highlights the film, drawing every possible bit of tension and keeping the audience’s attention even in slow scenes. If ever there were any doubts about who was just a masterful director Hitchcock, then just watching the five minutes of “Strangers” on the train should be enough to disavow such feelings; each frame is carefully thought out and constructed, and all this helps to advance the storyline in a particularly innovative way. Unfortunately, there are certain moments in this story that are completely irrelevant to divert our attention from excellent cinema and editing - Bruno’s ability to get to the bottom of the sewer grate is just incredible, and the stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly uncontrolled carousel provides inadvertent comedy relief in that should be the most intense and attractive movie scene. These are just brief moments, but they are enough to stand out in a film that has a sharp star, so painfully weak. <br /> <br /> But what really sets the Strangers on a train apart is the premise of the story. While the recent Hollywood films risk inevitably descend farther and farther into a vat with a dim cliche for cliches, it is surprisingly nice to see a 50-year-old film with a premise that actually looks smart and original. Of course, this is quite simple, but the concept of "exchange of murders" is simply a concept that will not fly in the films of today and the era, which makes it even more interesting to watch; The brilliant script of the film provides dynamic dynamics, at the same time providing us with amazingly memorable lines. It is impossible not to notice the deeper themes that Hitchcock hints at, especially the concept of “darkness in the heart of mankind”, which is demonstrated by elderly ladies, excited and excited by the prospect of murder, as well as Bruno’s own cavalier position. to death. Hitch also works in many moments of dark humor (Bruno slams a child's balloon with his cigarette - priceless), and ironically, shooting disturbing scenes in happy, calm conditions, such as cult carnival scenes, to create an even more eerie atmosphere, It can be an alarming thriller Yes, but it would be simply unforgivable to ignore the brain hidden under it. <br /> <br /> The antagonistic figure of Bruno (composed by Robert Walker in his last role in the film, unfortunately, perverted to perfection, but easily stealing the film from his, apparently, very talented fellow cast members) , makes Strange On A Train as memorable as a character, a miracle, to behold. Here we have a simply magnificently created villainous figure, all the more intriguing because of how simple and modest it seems. Instead of madly giggling and disturbing the hero at any possible moment, Bruno is a calm, controlled, psychotic mess. He talks about killing in such an indecent tone, but at the same time he retains a passionate gleam in his eyes, discussing various ways of killing people. It seemed that Bruno represented the “Eid,” as Freud would say, the inner, darker and freer aspects of humanity. This creates an interesting contrast with the hero, Guy Haynes, and with how soft and uninteresting he looks, almost as if he made it clear that the likelihood of evil is much more interesting and attractive than the constant desire to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, despite this implied message, Hitch still distorts our emotions so much that we cheer on Guy at every step and welcome every new obstacle that he has to overcome. This is testimony to the talent of the actor Farley Granger that, despite the fact that the villain Robert Walker easily steals the series, the hero Granger still shows sympathy, is still the commander of our support, even when he falls prey to a much less convincing character. Excellent support is provided by Ruth Roman, who manages to overcome clichés and become a more innovative and challenging romantic figure, Casey Rogers in the role of tremendously manipulating and hedonistic first wife Guy, and Patricia Hitchcock, proving that she is much more talented than being just “the director’s daughter” . The superb cast (led by just great Walker) really animates the film, adding to the film a lot more merit than just Hitchcock's breathtaking style. <br /> <br /> In general, “Strangers on the train” may still seem a bit outdated to some viewers, but it still shocks how modern and attractive it is to modern audiences, given that it was released half a century ago. Once again, Hitchcock proves his unparalleled mastery of the tension and technique of the film, and the surprisingly original and pleasant premise of the film is worth seeing. Strongly recommended to anyone who wants to spend a brilliantly, but incredibly exciting film screenings! <br /> <br /> -9/10
