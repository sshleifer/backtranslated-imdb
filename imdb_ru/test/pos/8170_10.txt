I can be a sentimentalist. But I found this film really touching. It was the first film that turned me into tears. And this was done more than once !! I recommend it to everyone, both gays and p8. Religious or not! Auxiliary colleague Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one liner. The nude scenes were also superbly crafted, and they all had good taste. The most shocking was the deprogramming image of the orientation change set by the Mormon church for the main character. I was shocked that this is still happening in the world. However, I really liked this movie. This is by far the best gay movie since the Torch Song Trilogy. And much better than the other gay movie of the year - The Fluffer.
