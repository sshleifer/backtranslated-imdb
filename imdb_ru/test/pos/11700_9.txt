Although Crackerjack is not for everyone, it’s nice to look at, the tongue is firmly set on the cheek. The handsome character Jack Simpson, played by Mick Molloy, is cheating on the local “bowlo” for free parking and earning a few dollars on the side by selling the parking space to his work colleagues. When Bowling Club members need to raise some money to save their club, they urge Jack to join their bowling team and play competitive balls. <br /> <br /> Filled with Aussie Charm, Mik Molloy’s concise wit shows through (he is also co-author of the script), reminding the viewer of his earlier work in radio. Wonderful Australian cast with Bill Hunter as Jack Bowling mentor Stan Coombs, John Clark (Games celebrity) as ruthless businessman and owner of rival club Bernie Fowler’s Bowl, with Samuel Johnson as roommate Jack Dave and Judith Lucy. journalist nancy. <br /> <br /> Initially, I thought that this film would only appeal to Molloy fans, but judging by the amount of blue rinse coming out of ridiculous cinema, this is a film for everyone.
