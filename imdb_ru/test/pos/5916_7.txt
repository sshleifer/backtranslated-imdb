From director Billy Wilder (“Double Refund”, “Seven Year Itch”, “Some Like It Hot”), I see that this is a slightly underrated and undervalued film that can be seen. This is the biographical story of Charles August "Thin" Lindberg (James Stewart), who in 1927 wanted to be the first person to cross a single flight from New York, cross the Atlantic Ocean and reach Paris in a small cabin. The first half hour, or something else, sees Lindberg getting permission for this, and building an airplane called the Spirit of St. Louis, and all the necessary preparations. Then, of course, the rest see that his dangerous journey crosses the journey, overcomes fatigue, almost loss of fuel and moments of losing a sense of direction, but it was successful. Also starring Murray Hamilton as Bad Gurney, Patricia Smith as Mirror Girl, Bartlett Robinson as Benjamin Frank Mahoney, Robert Corntwaite as Harry Knight, Sheila Bond as a model / dancer, Mark Connelly as Husman's father, Arthur Space as Donald Hall, Harlan Ward as Bodecker and Dabbs Greer as Goldsboro. Obviously, Lindberg was a bit younger, so Stuart was too old to play with him, but again, you can't think of anyone else who could do more. This is a witty and emotional drama with Stuart (as always) a fantastic, excellent piece of music by Frank Waxman and a good guide from Wilder, a good little-known gem. He was nominated for an Oscar for the best special effects (the only reward he ever nominated). James Stewart was 12th in 100 of the greatest movie stars, he was 3rd for 100 years, 100 stars for men, and he was the 13th for the greatest actor in the world. Fine!
