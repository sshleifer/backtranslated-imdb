Well, I'm 12 years old, so that is where you can watch a movie from a teenager's point of view. I also commented on Magnolia and Bicentennial Man, both great movies if you want to check it out. Well, here on Earth was a beautiful film with amazing scenes and images that are very pleasing to the eye. The author (I do not know who it was, check IMDB) either worked very hard, or appreciated love, poetry and drama. I cried 4 times throughout the film, once for more than 30 minutes. It was really sad, really beautiful, really meaningful. This is a great movie for anyone, say, 11 years or older, who is not a fan of romantic comedy. Yes, it is romantic, yes, it is comedic, but (in my opinion), it is better than “She is all that” or “Everything you need” I never cry! This is a gentle story. Go rent it and scotch :).
