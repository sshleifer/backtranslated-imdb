Get ready to meet your Messiah - they call him Masten Trust. In today's overexposed society, it is becoming more and more difficult to find male role models. Every day, an obvious role model is forced, with tears in his eyes, to apologize for youthful negligence, or he innocently drinks a few young people on his ranch. The last dinosaur is the story of the last great hunt for the Masten Trasts, an old gray-haired big game hunter who serves as an example to follow. Despite his emaciated facial features and a bulging nose, females, including Joan Van Ark, attract him like Meatloaf to tender texts. The trust is openly sexist and makes no apologies for its complex lifestyle, which includes a red headscarf and a private plane with a working fireplace. <br /> <br /> The Trust begins a mission to search and hunt for the last dinosaur on earth, when, ironically, after a rich and fulfilling life, it is indeed the last dinosaur. Despite his tendency to shout at everyone in his presence, his co-workers and girlfriends are always loyal to him. He may act as if he is constantly drunk, but do not make a mistake if he calls you "Ding Dong" and you are "Ding Dong." <br /> <br /> Not to deprive himself of his own ballad, Trastz's songs shamelessly praise him and his manliness. The sample of texts includes: “Few people ever did what he did, or even dreamed that he dreamed / Few even tried what he tried, most men failed, where he prevailed / The world holds nothing for him the new, and the things that scare us with you, are just a bore for him / Few people ever lived, how he lived, or even walked where he went. ” Even BMTG, banned by the artist, Clay Aiken, could expose these texts and become a debris strike machine. <br /> <br /> Trust and his team of scientists fasten themselves in the Polar Borer mini bicycle helmets, although Trusts provides the luxury of a red scarf around his neck. A giant drill filled with a man digs through the ground and the ice jumps out into the lagoon. Dinosaurs from the air and the earth soon fall on scientists, forcing the Trust and the team to run after their lives. Masten leaned back and laughed out loud, not so much to celebrate. For example, you need to recognize that "the game is in motion." <br /> <br /> Soon it is not surprising that we see several cavemen hunched over, creeping up on their visitors. The draft, not content with simply killing a dinosaur, then decides to make its mission to seize the cave. Throughout the film, the lonely T-Rex contradicts the belief that dinosaurs have a peanut-sized brain. Despite its enormous size, the local T-Rex is able to approach its victims almost imperceptibly. With the element of surprise, T-Rex simply crushes a scholar or two and plunders the campsite. From time to time, the bloated and stubborn Trust is visible when someone shouts, shoots at something or flirts with a primitive Jo-Lo in a manly way. <br /> <br /> Similar to James Tiberius Kirk, not only in his addiction to love, but also when it comes to creating sophisticated weapons using limited natural resources in a short time. The trust and the rest of the crew create a high-precision catapult that throws a large boulder into the skull of the cunning T-Rex. Realizing that even he, Masten Trust, cannot surpass this addition to his trophy case, Trust decides to remain in his prehistoric environment. Then, the constantly shrinking team leaves Thrust to live their days with their sweet, albeit slightly playful cave woman, and present her to their personal collection of STDs. This is only a brief overview of the film, so complex and rich in BMTG traditions, that it takes several views to understand its message and understand that Masten Trust is the answer. A press conference with a screaming jerk, the mumbling of reporters and the presentation of the great Riots is a classic moment. Also look for a body that resembles the dead Ricky Schroeder, lying on logs, and the most powerful use of a man who is called "Ding Dong" in cinema history.
