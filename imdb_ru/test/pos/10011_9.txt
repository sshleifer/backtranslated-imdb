I have to say that every time I watch this film I’m deeply touched not only by the most painful four years of Hongshen’s life, but also by how his family copes with his drug addiction. It is also true that getting addicted to something, such as drugs, alcohol, or pornography, can not only harm you, but also harm your most important people in the world: your family. Since family is the No. 1 priority in Asian culture, the circle should get together and show one person how much the family loves him / her. in fact, this is the first Chinese film that I really like, not for fun, but the elements around it (an excellent game, a touching story, a great guide) make this film worth seeing. What stands out the most is that Hunshen and his family are playing this story themselves, instead of some actor from the B-film trying to emulate a real person. It shows the authenticity of the film.
