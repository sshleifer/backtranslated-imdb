This unusual horror movie seems to receive only bad reviews. My question is why? I think this movie is pretty good. Dee Snyder did an excellent job with his first (and only) directing. He also plays the antagonist, Captain Howdy (Karelton Hendrix). This film seems to have a future look. Although it was released in 1998, it seems that it deals with contemporary problems. Online predators seem to be the main plot here. Although it is elevated to another level, it is a problem that we still face today. I admit that the story ended several times, but this does not make this film bad at all. Robert Englund even in this film, it automatically makes him better. The acting was good, the characters were pretty good too. I think Hendrix was a pretty good antagonist. I give this unusual horror 7/10. Recommend for lovers of saw.
