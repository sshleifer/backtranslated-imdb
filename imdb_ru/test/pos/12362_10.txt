This landmark film can now be seen in two different versions of the video release Grapevine, which also includes an English translation of the novel by Selma Lagerlof, based on a Swedish folk tale. The first version is the Swedish edition called the Phantom Carriage. The second version is a reconstruction of how it was shown in the United States under the name “SOFT SOFT”, released by Metro (before it was M-G-M). The actual release in the US has long disappeared, but a detailed review in the New York Times allows us to find out how the scenes were reordered for the internal release - both are interesting to see. Each version of this film was presented at Organ Loft in Salt Lake City with live theatrical scores provided by artist Blaine Gale. A live recording of these performances was made, and they are included on the Grapevine video disc along with the novel and notes on the two versions. While the Phantom Carriage follows the order of the Lagerlöf novel, Midnight Strike is in some ways easier to understand. Viewing two different edits shows how silent films can be effectively modified for release in different countries. <br /> <br /> Some viewers look at this film as a horror film, which, of course, no. This is a moral game with hints of the supernatural, used to hit the whole world with its grim message. The directorial and leading performance of the great Victor Siostrom was significantly ahead of their time. It’s easy to see why M-G-M brought him to Hollywood to make films such as Lillian Gish in Scarlet Letter and The Wind, and Lon Cheney in the movie Who Will Get the Slow Down In America, his name was Victor Sastrom. He will also play a major role in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Tubers, playing masterfully. Bergman was heavily influenced by CORCARLENE or a PHANTOM CARET in his early days. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful film that is worth seeing and exploring. Grapevine video release is a great way to do this.
