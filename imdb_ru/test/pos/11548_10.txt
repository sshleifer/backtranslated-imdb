Oh my God ! I can really say that Maya Angelou is one of the most intriguing and important people in the world, especially my culture. She is incredibly inspiring, and her story is the story of a great woman! When I first made this film, I thought that the cast was superbly composed, now let's see them in action! Maya Angelou is already my favorite poet, and now one of my favorite actresses and speakers. I believe that it is the greatest of all times. In this film, I was on the edge of my place and reached out to Kleenex, at the same time reminding me that no matter where you came from, if you decide that you will be great, you will be great! And Esther Roll played a wonderful secondary role ...... 100% AMAZING ... and now even "I know why the bird sings in a cage."
