The slogan on the box reads: “100 PAPENGERS-TRAPS ... 3,000 VENOMA VIPERS!” You almost have to admire that degree “damn it, we can never fulfill this promise.” I could admire Hexterism Vault more if they made films that, well, you know, were good or at least worth the hell. Haha, and this is what I like about these films. They are rubbish. You put them in the toilet and then flush them. It's worth the price if you're a fan of cheese films. It can become a cult classic among many fans. Bloody scenes are effective, I can’t say anything special, this is film Z, parodying a new film with Samuel L. Jackson, damn it, maybe better, who knows!
