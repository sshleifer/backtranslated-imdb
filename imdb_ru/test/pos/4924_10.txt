Although this is not the first film I bought for myself, it is almost certainly the one I watched the most. The animation is well traced by experts from Tokyo Movie Shinsa, and animators often used ingenious tricks, for example, when the sun causes lens flare, permeates the camera (and the camera operator’s hand clears the lens!) did not become a “gadget-festival animator”, a reasonable, but generous use of such techniques gave the film a much more “realistic” feeling than a typical cartoon. <br /> <br /> There are many intertwined stories in the story that seem to have nothing in common with each other until everything fits together at the end, so even authors who modestly admit themselves are invented. Each of the main storylines has its own musical theme, ranging from “Pop Goes Weasel” [Hamton & Plucky] and ending with the love theme “Romeo and Juliet” [Fifi & Johnny]. The transitions between storylines are slightly different, but consistent. <br /> <br /> A truly wonderful film; there is not much original music, although the new lyrics to “Spinning Song” is smart and pleasant. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.
