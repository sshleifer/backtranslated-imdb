The ruthless mercenary Bruno Rivera (Our Ours in a picnic otherwise) betrays his pregnant partner / friend Meiko (well played by Eiko Nagashima) in order to receive exclusive charms on stolen diamonds. But Meiko manages to seriously hurt Bruno before he leaves. Bruno finds himself in the luxurious chalet of the good, rich Dr. Don Simon (excellent performance by Lautaro Murua). He also attracts the attention of two daughters of the beauty Simon: fiery Monica (juicy Silvia Aguilera) and sweet Alicia (nicely composed by the beautiful Azuchena Hernandez). However, Bruno soon realizes that something is wrong in an isolated place and plans to escape as soon as he can. Meanwhile, bitter Meiko is trying to find Bruno to get revenge on him. Ours, who wrote and directed the same way as the stars, composes one of his weirdest, most perverted and perverse horror machines that ever existed with this little strange weirdness. The unusual plot and mysterious atmosphere are becoming increasingly strange and unnerving as the story unfolds, which ultimately leads to a truly amazing unexpected finale. This film also benefits from the episodic moments of the graphic smell of blood (beware of the memorable sequence with one poor guy who is devoured by fierce pigs eating flesh!), Alejandro Ulloa's graceful cinematography and decent nudity and soft sex. Good support for Roxanne Dupre as the cheeky maid Raquel, Pepe Ruiz as the playboy in love, Don Serafin and Julia Sali as the insane Theresa. Pleasantly gloomy and worthwhile shocker.
