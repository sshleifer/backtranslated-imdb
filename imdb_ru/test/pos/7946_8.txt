Many blame Rod Staiger for reappraisal, and anyone who has seen the Amityville Horror and the “flies” section would have struggled to say otherwise. However, he is great at it. <br /> <br /> This is never on television, you can not buy it on DVD (legally). In 1988, when Channel 4 had a recipe for innovation, they showed it among the small amalgam films of the 60s, Privileges, etc. - and I remember essentially theatrical experience transferred to the cinema. The great thing about the theater is that it is closed, how to make it accessible and interesting on the screen? PH is about to cope. Since this kind of films are never broadcast even on cable or Sky TV, it’s hard to start a discussion, but for anyone who has seen or can remember, my memories of Sally Jison’s direct, almost abrupt speech are all. everyone took care of '(which avoids the almost uncertain general actions of her and her brother in many sentences of the early 70s), she says ref conception. There are several of them - key lines that you remember years, decades later. This is the power of a movie like this. <br /> <br /> PS I just saw him again, and that’s just as good. One day television will also be enlightened.
