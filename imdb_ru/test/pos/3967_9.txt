Dior Baird in this movie is absolutely hot. But in fact, all the characters are amazingly interesting to watch. <br /> <br /> (LITTLE SPOILERS) As usual, the main character, B, is sane. B. has this crazy idea to create his own college when he is rejected from all the colleges he enters. He is known for making fake IDs. Thus, the acceptance letter is not a problem. <br /> <br /> Since Bi's dad is a difficult @ $$ and is suspicious of this university, which he had never heard of, B. forces his friend Sherman to develop a website for the university. Sherman was accepted into a good college and is afraid of being arrested for fraud. He is very fast with witty lines, but his flaw is that he too wants to be accepted in society. <br /> <br /> Glen, Ruki and Rory are three puppets that follow B. Glen got zero on his SAT and has no thought process. He constantly offers royal battles, but he is very good at making cocktails, which in one way or another cause him a lot of hot girls. Hands was a great footballer who did not receive the scholarship he was counting on and turned to crafts to cover athletics. Rory was preparing to go to Yale from 1st class and was not accepted. She spends time meditating. <br /> <br /> Uncle Ben was my favorite character. The picture of Lewis Black plays himself. If you have no reason to watch this movie, then watch it for Lewis Black and John Hill. They are delightful. <br /> <br /> Monica is the love interest of the Bee group. As most of these stories go, she is more popular than he, and does not even notice him until halfway through the movie. However, unlike many other stories, B really gets it and keeps to the end. Monica is, in fact, a good character, but, of course, she is primarily to adore B. In <br /> <br /> In a fictional college there are more supporting students who are fun to watch. The Ph.D. name speaks for itself, and, oddly enough, he finds himself in a meditation class. Kiki is a hot ex-stripper who is on her heels for a chance to go to school and eventually falls in love with Glen. Maurice - a former military idiot who got GI Bill and wants to study rock and roll in college. The last guy is known as Freaky Student, who thinks he can blow it all up with his mind. Those who have little faith in him are waiting for the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, the villains are the dean of the opposing university, the president of the student corps of his university, the girlfriend of the president and their friends. . <br /> <br /> Every character is cute. I think this film has a good plot and is well-made, despite what many people say. Even though the general story is predictable, the characters make you guess and make the movie great. Go watch this movie. I give it 9 out of 10.
