When I read the “Messiah” synopsis in the television guide, I was not ready for what was in the store. The story follows from DCI Metcalf trying to solve a case of horrific murders committed throughout London. Soon, he understands the pattern: there is a serial killer at large, killing people with names and tasks similar to those of 12 Apostles, and their murders are identical to their suitable Apostle. The two-part series held me right on the edge of my seat, Metcalf watched the killer closely, but always missed him for a few seconds and found the terrible mess he left after his ill-fated victim. The “Messiah” will undoubtedly cause much controversy, but, nevertheless, this is the greatest play that the BBC has shown in a long time.
