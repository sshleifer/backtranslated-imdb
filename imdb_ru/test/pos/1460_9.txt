There are only a few films that can be called “must-see”, and SHEPHERED is one of those films. In many ways, he was ahead of his time (and you can say that he served as a source of inspiration for several more famous films). Copied by many, equal to no one, this film is really one. <br /> <br /> The story is complex, but unfolds as a tight, but often funny, thriller and deeply provoking thoughts about the nature of humanity. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where people must live underground and chaos reigns. K. Thomas Howell - "shepherd", which protects the population from various religious leaders, killing any unsuitable members of society. The whole idea made me think about our society. This is a really brilliant social commentary, and this is more than I can say for some recent sci-fi / action movies. MATRIX RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS made it impossible to feel that some real innovations were taking place, only the boring effects of video games. But SHEPERD also scores points on a scale of action ... <br /> <br /> No film allows the viewer to take a breath. Peter Heyman proved that he is one of the few brilliant directors. We are talking 100% high class home kung fu fight! It was excellent. Really good special effects, shootouts, dark futuristic style cyber-punk noir ?? The film does have its elements. <br /> <br /> Speaking of SHEPHERD, it’s impossible not to mention his style. The vision of this city is truly amazing. This is reminiscent of the images of a very memorable vision of Tim Burton Gotham in Batman. And these sights are photographed by Graham Myrs with a degree of skill that makes Gordon Willis and Conrad Hall ashamed. Even the special effects were awesome. Undoubtedly, the scenes where the fighting takes place, are reference points in the entire film industry. This film is an amazing visual ballet. <br /> <br /> However, the basis of all this is an interesting story, which is demonstrated by a strong cast. The acting skills (especially Roadie Piper) and the plot are both gorgeous and perfectly directed. Unlike many futuristic films created with a strong artificial taste, the characters are believable, and the dialogue is natural and full of mind. I am always proud to see such a wonderful film as SHEPHERD. It is a pity that he did not get a good spread and did nothing at the box office. This is a rarity to look for. This film will amaze you and make you feel 10 times cooler after seeing it!
