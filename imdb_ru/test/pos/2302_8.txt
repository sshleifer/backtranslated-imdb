This is Oshima's film, the director of the notorious “Empire of the Senses,” a film so sexually soldered and shamelessly controversial was forbidden for some time. This film takes place originally in Japan in 1895, and in it the main role is played by the very pretty Keziko Yoshiyuki, Seki, the wife of a rickshaw driver, in love with a much younger man who takes care of her in kind. This man, Toyoji, comes to her when she sleeps, and seduces her, although soon she is likely to be seduced. Soon they have a romance and conspiracy to kill Seki's husband to be together forever. They do, and throw him into the well. However, they did not count on the ghost of a dead husband stalking Seki and others in the village! This film is visually very stunning, the use of shadows underlines this murder story for the sake of passion. Mrs. Yoshiyuki (who is still active as an actress) is especially good in her role. It's sometimes sexy, but not like "In the realm of feelings." Part of what follows depends on our imagination. I found that this film has a mood that makes it very watchable. A bit creepy, but this concerns the territory. I would recommend this.
