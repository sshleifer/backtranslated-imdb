This is another classic Seagal movie. He walks, no, travels around the patriot, like all other Mega Seagal films. Nothing even comes close to challenging Seagal in this film, except perhaps the part where he has to find a cure for this so-called “plague”, and he begins to scatter things about the laboratory, but it all works, mean, let's face it, his Master Seagal, he must conquer. As for his outfit in the film, a masterpiece, he must have chosen it himself. It's great that everyone in the film dies after being exposed to the virus, but Seagal doesn't even cough. The incident at the end, when he killed a fat man with broken glass, a genius, I bet, Segal also thought about that. This movie class is clean and simple. great plot, great characters and seagal.
