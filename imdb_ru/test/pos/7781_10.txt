This is my favorite love story, which has everything that should be in a good love story. Poetry, jazz, friendship ups and downs in relationships. Finally a film that shows the positive side of the black community. Larenz Tate was great, I can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Darius. He read this poem as if he wrote it himself and meant every word. I have this film, and if I had time, I would watch it every day, it always helps me feel better, and this is what a good film should do. In addition, the character Savon could not be better deal with the subject of marriage. We all would like to find Darius, but most of us simply agree to watch this movie. My voice is 10/10
