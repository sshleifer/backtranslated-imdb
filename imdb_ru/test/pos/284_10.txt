With the obvious exception of Fools and Horses, in my opinion, it was the best David Jason series. <br /> <br /> Immediately after the television debut on “Don't set up your set!” These 13 episodes showed the skill of comic time not seen since the time of the old silent movie. For comparison, Porridge, Open All Hours and this horrible series “Lucky Man” did not come close. <br /> <br /> I believe that Jason forbade the repetition of the series because he showed it in its raw form. Shame on him. A new generation deserves to enjoy it. The series actually failed in the ratings, but this is most likely because it was shown against the Brothers, which were broadcast on the BBC at the same time, before the VCRs became common. <br /> <br /> By the way, I just noticed that Mark Eden played his long-suffering assistant Spencer; Alan Bradley from Coronation Street. I am amazed that he did not try to kill Edgar Briggs !!!!
