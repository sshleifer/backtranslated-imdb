Many films are trying to be ambitious. Little will succeed. This film is one of them. <br /> <br /> Although this film has been declared a black comedy, this term seems too restrictive to express the true nature of the Max and Grace story. Multi-hyphen Michael Parness managed to weave elements of an absurd comedy with incredibly real human emotions. Of course, this is a wonderful feat. <br /> <br /> Although comedic aspects are certainly present, the essence of the film is in its leading roles: David Krumholz and Natasha Lyonn. The delicate balance of the film - really crazy and true love - falls on them, and they reach it, bringing it from the initial scene to the heartbreaking climax and to the heartbreaking finale. David Krumholz, starring and as a narrator, anchors the painting and does exceptional work. We see the world through the eyes of Max, and Krumholtz fills them with some surprise and hope, which could not be expected plausibly if it comes from a character who had previously tried to commit suicide. From this point of view, there should be no doubt that he really achieved the status of a leading person, deservedly after more than a decade of memorable supporting roles. Natasha Lyonne can be a revelation for anyone who has seen her only in less complex roles. The role of Grace is wide in scale, and she demands that she show simultaneously great rage and tenderness - sometimes within a few seconds of each other. She manages to convince us of the deep despair of Grace, who is hiding under her alternation of torpor and mania. <br /> <br /> This is not a funny comedy episode, so don’t watch a movie that is strictly humorous from humor. end. Think more than a drama, not a comedy. There are some very dark moments, as one would expect, given the subject of suicide, and some strangely real moments, most clearly manifested by Emma Adel Galvin as Max’s sister, sister. The most humorous scenes are those in which many named actors play secondary roles. While Lorraine Bracco and David Paymer provide the most surreal aspect in their scenes, other heroes who inhabit the institution where Max and Grace meet are a real treat. Guillermo Diaz is an unceremonious kidnapper of scenes, like a delightfully crazy eccentric, Hector. Ralph Moller, like Bruno, acts like his direct man, but has his own charm and appeal. Rosanna Arquette fully populates the role of the Faith with the bluestone of the embittered waitress of a truck stop. Even her stubborn character is finally melting away, like everyone whom Max’s immortal love for Grace has touched. <br /> <br /> Whether love can win, everything can be a matter of the film, and although the realist in the film says no, films about escape from reality, at least for a few short hours. I recommend watching this film as an antidote not only from reality, but also from cynicism, which says that such a love story never happens. Spend a few hours in a world where he can work wonders with the soul. <br /> <br /> (Seattle International Film Festival, June 2005)
