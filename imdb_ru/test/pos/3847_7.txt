Walt Disney’s 20th animated film was the last to be highlighted by the great man himself (he died at the end of 1966) and, as a rule, is not considered one of their best results. The main problem is that at first glance the film seems to be just the cat version of “LADY AND TRUMP” (1955) or “101 DALAMATIONS” (1961), both of which are certainly more loved by fans. Despite this, both are animation and cat lover, I dug this rather vigorous mixture in which a spoiled cat (voiced by Eva Gabor) and her three little kittens throws a greedy butler rich lady (Hermione Baddeley) on the streets of Paris. Fortunately, they meet a street cat alley (Phil Harris), who directs them on the way back, and later they are helped by the cat-like jazz band (led by Scatman Crothers) and two helpful and friendly-intoxicated dogs; Meanwhile, at home of Edgar, the butler celebrates his intended legacy, and the mouse and horse do their best to help their feline pets. Legendary artist Maurice Chevalier was dismissed from retirement to sing the title song (which includes a verse in French), and the Scatman group is relegated to the latest number “Ev'rybody Wants To A A Cat”.
