Exclusively for fans of Coop, although Clint Eastwood is very strong, although unobtrusive presence, is a big advantage of this very good documentary. This is Gary Cooper's biography, based mainly on his filmography, as well as on more private archives, in which he is depicted as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc.), as an elderly Finally, as a sick and close to death person. After the “end” I did not have the feeling that I know a person much better. But I spent a very good moment, reviewing many of the best moments of his films; and my respect for a very talented actor and great professional has increased tenfold. The film shows that it is most interesting how Cooper's career can be parallel to the evolution of US society before and after World War II. Two great moments are the time when Cooper must answer the question of communism in the world of cinema; and when James Stewart (also very great) received a reward for Cooper a month before his death. I'm not a crying bowler, but ... it was close! See if you can: it is worth it. ... If you love Cooper, then it is. Or old America ...
