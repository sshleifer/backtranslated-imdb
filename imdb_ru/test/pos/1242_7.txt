Maybe I was just in a very good mood when I watched this movie. but for some reason I really liked this movie. Was it terribly original? Was it a bit predictable? Yes. So what? It was still a really good movie. I always liked Bruce Willis (well, almost always, there was Hudson Hawk and the Fifth Element, after all), and he portrayed a selfish, sarcastic idiotic ideal. Maybe this film is not Oscar material, but it is really good material. Go rent it.
