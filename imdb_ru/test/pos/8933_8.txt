I have long wanted to see this movie. In the end, I just bought it on E-Bay, as it is very difficult to find it on the state side. But the wait was ... somewhat worth it. <br /> <br /> I can not say that the film was great. And I can not say that the movie was fun. But it was good, and he has pretty funny moments. In addition, the shots in this film are just great. And the whole cast, especially Brenda Bletin (someone I havenâ€™t seen before, unfortunately) was excellent. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a good romantic comedy, and I recommend checking it out, if only you I just died in the family. <br /> <br /> In the end, the last chapter is very worth the money. >. <
