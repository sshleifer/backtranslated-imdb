This is an amazingly well-filmed early adaptation of the play by Eugene O'Neill. Its main disadvantage is a static camera, and as a result, it is shot most of the time as a filmed movie, which is very unfortunate because it is a good piece of primitive filmmaking made at a time when the sound represented all kinds of technical problems, and as a result The films were experimental, regardless of whether it was the intention of their creator. Garbo is also mysterious and charismatic, as in her silent films, and her entry still remains classic. Her voice is strangely deep, almost boyish, which only reinforces her already seductively eccentric personality. As her boyfriend, Charles Bickford is a manly man — he was obviously born rocky — and the perfect counterpart to the divine Garbo. His Irish chord is not bad at all, and he seems to be always a natural marine person, very much like O'Neill in his independent, pensive nature. As a (very) bewildered father Garbo, George Marion seems to be really from another time. He has such a face and voice - open, helpless, completely without guile - disappeared from the ground. Marie Dressler is also at the height of O'Neill's things. Her empty expression and intensity around the eyes speak volumes because she plays her drunk character as a woman, sometimes bordering on psychosis. Perhaps a poetic license, since it is not in the script, but we can forgive the excess Miss Dressler; she is too good not to do that. The story ends with a move to the next, in contrast to the resolution, which is not the author's cup of tea; and those who like their films, carefully crafted at the end, will be disappointed by the absence of any real surprises. In Anna Christie, we are in the country of O'Neill, the place of the sea, storms and fog, a sense of pervasive and cursed uncertainty, which we now would call ambivalence or anxiety neurosis. Instead of analyzing this mood, the author simply and wisely presents it as the weather, the earth, the ocean and people intertwine and address each other in a unique language that we feel we are glad to hear.
