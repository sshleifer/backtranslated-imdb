This gives an ordinary guy / girl the opportunity to sing on television as their favorite stars. <br /> <br /> Most of the time they sound like a singer, who should be portrayed. <br /> <br /> Another twist to this is a team of make-up and costume designers dress the participant like this singer. They may not look like them, but the likelihood that someone looks like a person who looks exactly like them is very slim. <br /> <br /> This is fun for your Saturday night - and the participants will not be raging as if they were on another TV show. The fact that the prizes are not involved and are intended for entertainment, means that it will attract a different type of people. <br /> <br /> The only thing that worries me is the Kids version - it looks like they made a round of stage schools - what happened to normal children?
