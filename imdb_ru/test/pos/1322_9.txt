It took me a few views to fully appreciate this movie. Initially, I was amazed at the stylized sets, but the rest was slow and boring. I thought such a sensational subject needed to be treated by Ken Russell to surpass him. Now I believe that the forced restriction (imposed on the production of the widow Mishima) is an advantage. Some of the more sinister aspects of Mishima’s life are repeated and dramatized by the relevant themes from his novels. I think it helps to be familiar with novels — that finally changed me. Still, I feel that the film as a whole may be a little denser and warmer, but it is truly unique and deserves serious attention. I love the fact that Japanese characters speak Japanese, not English. Philip Glass's assessment fascinates.
