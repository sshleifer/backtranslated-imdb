This movie was sooooo good! It was fun! There are so many jokes that you can just watch the movie again and again and not get tired of it. John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were great, like Pete Hogvallop and Delmar! I love these guys! I also love the adventures in which they were. I definitely recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the music in this movie is awesome! I love to sing along with all the songs!
