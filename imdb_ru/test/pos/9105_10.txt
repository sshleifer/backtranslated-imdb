I was lucky enough to win free POD preview passes. Let me just tell you, from the previews, I was glad to see it! The film is absolutely awesome! What I really liked about this is that JB was in his element. In other films, such as The School of Rock, he performs pleasant music for children and families, but this music clearly belongs to him. <br /> <br /> I took my brother and sister with me, and we laughed mostly all the time. There are a couple of places where Iâ€™m wondering what the hell they think, because some items are a bit disconnected, but for the most part it was great. In most cases, it was not like a low-budget film, so this is a plus. <br /> <br /> Dave Grohl in the role of Satan surprised me the most. It's damn fun! You honestly wouldn't know if you saw the film that this is it. <br /> <br /> I say that if you are a rock fan and you like JB, KG and / or Tenacious D, watch a movie. Get ready for a LOT of references to drugs, a LOT of four letters and a tiny rock!
