Thirty years after the classic 1939 film won an Oscar from Robert Donat and made Greer Garson a star, “Goodbye, Mr. Chips” overcame many problems before stumbling on the screen in this musical version. The original stars Rex Harrison and Samantha Eggar were replaced by Richard Burton and Lee Remick, who in turn were supported in favor - fortunately - by Peter O'Toole and Petula Clarke. Andre Previn’s account was rejected and eventually used — unfortunately — by Leslie Brikuss. The first director, Herbert Ross, was given the daunting task of turning a simple love story - a story about a man with both his wife and students - into an extravaganza with a big budget. That he succeeds as well as despite the many obstacles in his path is evidence of his two stars. <br /> <br /> Arthur Chipping is a Latin teacher at Brookfield, a boys' school in suburban England where he was educated. Introvert and socially inept, he is devoted to his students, but he cannot inspire them. Before summer vacation, a former student will take him to the London Music Hall to watch an entertainment program featuring Katherine Bridges, a young woman whom he hopes to marry. The meeting after the performance is inconvenient for everyone, and Chips - as he is usually known - goes to explore some of the ancient ruins of Italy. Suddenly, he encounters Catherine, who has ordered a cruise on the Mediterranean, to give her time to mourn the unsuccessful love and ponder the direction of her career. While they spend together, she discovers a kind and gentle man under an embarrassed appearance, and upon returning to London, pursues him seriously. When the fall semester begins, Chips returns to Brookfield with his young bride, and they live a quiet home life. Complications arise when aspects of the past surface of Katharina, and again when World War II invades their lives, but Chips is supported by his wife’s support, and his newfound confidence makes him a favorite among students. <br /> <br /> In addition to a few musical breaks - the delightful number of the London-London music hall and Katherine’s love confession “You and I” - most of Brickus’s songs, some of which are performed in voice acting, while the characters explore their emotions easily forgotten and in no way reinforce the film. Eliminate the bill completely, and "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" works quite well as drama. The script by Terrence Rattigan retains the elements of the original, expanding it and updating it for a couple of decades. He created several scenes between Chips and Katherine, which perfectly differentiated their devotion to each other, and inspired some with the help of comic relief, courtesy of a friend and Catherine cohort, actress Ursula Mossbank (adorable played by Sian Phillips, O'Toole) ). He also shoots life at a British public school — the equivalent of a private academy here in the States — with unmistakable perfection. <br /> <br /> Ross succeeds as a new director, abundantly sprinkling the film with amazingly photographed moments - a sequence of opening credits, during which the school anthem echoes in the school’s huge stone corridors, ideally sets the tone for the film. Costumes and decorations correspond to the period. Students who are portrayed by non-professionals who have been enrolled in school, which is used as Brookfield, do well with their various minor support roles. <br /> <br /> Highest praise for starring Peter O'Toole and Petulu Clark. O'Toole has long established himself as a first-class dramatic actor, so his performance in the Oscar nomination is not surprising here. Clark, a veteran of about two dozen B-films in the UK and last year's Rainbow Finian, absolutely shines because his performer in the music hall refuses his theatrical career for the sake of the life of a schoolteacher's wife. Her golden voice enriches her songs and almost lets us lose sight of how tasteless most of them are, and she more than meets O'Toole in their dramatic scenes together. The chemistry between them is palpable and leaves no doubt that this couple is very much in love. <br /> <br /> This version of “Goodbye, Mr. Chips” is not as classical as its predecessor, but the Crash is hardly described by many critics when it was released. Do not pay attention to the account, concentrate on the performances and enjoy the atmosphere that Ross put on the screen. This is a pleasant way to spend a rainy day with your loved one.
