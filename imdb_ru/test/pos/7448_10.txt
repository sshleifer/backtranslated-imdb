I will begin with a disclaimer: this film is NOT recommended for those who show no interest or have never played FF7 before watching. The film is based on the knowledge of the audience of each character in the game to transfer plot elements of the plot. And it is very subtle. Do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of CG movie, and I promise it will be much better. <br /> <br /> With this in mind, this film features some of the most exciting CG episodes I've ever seen. The whole experience resembled a very long sequence of FMV from playing on steroids. Yeah. The attention to detail in every scene, especially in heavy, action-oriented, is so impeccable that it makes me feel awe. <br /> <br /> I think the soundtrack is simplified to help the audience focus on the quality of the animation more than the music. Again, for those familiar with the history and background of FF7, the music should not surprise anyone (although the time and location of each audio track from the original accompany each scene and mood to such an extent that the music simply enhances the animation). br /> <br /> Once again, I myself only once played FF7, fully enjoying this piece from Square Enix. And this is felt in most scenes, staged and organized. Like a dance. <br /> <br /> In short, if you liked the music or the game Final Fantasy 7, this film will knock you out of the water. If you are an overwhelming majority who have not experienced perfection, known as FF7, on a Playstation or PC, then before watching a movie this will allow you to get a much greater experience. <br /> <br /> Finally, I just want to pay attention to the quality of the animation of this film. Characters move smoothly. Each scene background comes alive and tells its story. For those who criticize the subtlety and dependence of the storyline, I urge you to review the animation. Facial reactions, subtle clues that lead to another level of entertainment compared to the typical narrative delivery method of the plot. <br /> <br /> Square Enix and the great Tetsuya Nomura set a new bar for high-quality animation and storytelling. Advent Children have opened a new era for computer graphics animation, allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak about themselves in many ways. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Square Enix. The wait was worth it.
