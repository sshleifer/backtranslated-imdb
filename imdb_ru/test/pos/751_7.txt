Low budget, but memorable potential shocker, which instead appears as a strange theater. Vulnerable, naive nurse Charlotte Beale enters a secluded mental hospital and is completely unaware that the only sensible people were killed, despite the red flags that are constantly rising around her. <br /> <br /> The lack of a decent budget really gives directors a little more than a sense of style, as well as a set of stupid characters. The pleasure of this film does not come from the shocks of the film, which are rather tame, but from a strange atmosphere. First we have a crazy woman who thinks her doll is real. There is also a judge killing an ax, a war veteran shocked by a projectile, and old Mrs. Callahan looks like an agitated elderly grandmother. A young patient named Allison gives the term "nympho" a new meaning. A big guy named Sam is a little slow after a failed lobotomy, and Jennifer suddenly jumps between catatonia and outbursts of violence. It seems the only other sensible person in this place is Dr. Masters, but does she have a secret? <br /> <br /> “Don't look to the basement” is a great example of low-budget films about exploitation. The plot is not so much, but the film is cheap. Several actors are shot in unforgettable performances, in particular, Betty Chandler and Annabelle Vinic, and the way the director adds small strange details to the film can really please you. <br /> <br /> Scene between Allison and the “telephonist” “This is a classic for all ages, and the expressions of Dr. Masters are particularly delightful when she starts to go beyond the limits of the film’s close to the final. Brownrigg is also actively using a cheap soundtrack with several musical remarks that really evoke the characters they accompany. My favorite cue is a “crazy” cue, a sitar that sounds whenever one of the patients does something pathological. <br /> <br /> It’s also wonderful how Charlotte herself falls into hysteria in the midst when patients show that Dr. Masters is just another prisoner, and then assumes that Charlotte is also a patient who is allowed to play her delusions (she , of course, poorly controlling reality, why should she not doubt the ominous absence of a telephone connection or external contact?). The scene where Charlotte manages to finish off barely living Dr. Stevens with a toy boat should be one of the greatest moments in a low-budget horror. Yes, “Do not look in the basement” may well be an “American beauty” from Z sort garbage.
