I was skeptical about this because of the terribly collected trailer, because of which he looked no less terrible film. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I did not waste my money. I believe that the success of the film is related to how terrible it really is and what is the situation in the house. Such little things as touch lights, create a real uneasy feeling. Shadows and ominously cold feelings from home make it easy to understand that no matter what happens in a film, no matter how much horror films you know. The game is by no means perfect, nor have they been bad. The main character is convincing, even with the annoying teenage dramas that surround her. In the end, I was impressed with the film in most aspects. <br /> <br /> This is a film that I would recommend.
