There are one or two other Shampa era shorts that I like more (for example, SCARMED BRAINS), but I think we can say — without any particular argument — that in this particular episode, Schempe gives his biggest comedy performance as a puppet after reunion team in 1946. <br /> <br /> Scene behind the scenes, this episode almost never leaves: from vocal lessons of Professor Shemp Howard from terrific Dee Green to his vain attempts to win the ladies hand in marriage (these are your little skunks ... you will marry me * clicks *) to a noisy end, I will never stop throwing. <br /> <br /> I would not mention this immortal scene with Miss Hopkins (always sweet Christina McIntyre). By the way, is she not sufficiently dressed and too in love with the greeting of a man whom she considers her cousin Vasily? Who knows, maybe the real Basil was a “very” distant relative, which makes him legal in some states (as far as I know). >: -]
