I sell the dead revolves around a convicted grave robber Arthur Blake. Blake's friend and grave robber, Willy Grimes, has just been executed, and Blake is going to follow his example the next morning. While he is sitting in his cell awaiting execution, a priest named Father Duffy comes to him and asks him if he will tell everything he saw as a grave robber. He then proceeds to give Duffy's father a quasi-biography of his more interesting exploits. <br /> <br /> The plot largely consists of several cases related only to chronology. This prevents the viewer from fatigue, but also makes events less significant, as you can easily add or delete multiple scenes without noticing it. Despite the shortcomings, I thought that in general this method added the funny nature of the film and left it very interesting. Most of the different stories are good, especially about aliens, Murphy and vampires, but others were not so good. <br /> <br /> The game is not amazing, but I havenâ€™t found anything wrong with that. point. Dominic Monaghan had a good performance, he managed to be serious when it mattered, and also played very well in the comedy parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The characters were not very deep, but they were all interesting, I also liked how many villains were done in an excessive manner of almost comics. Part of the background of Murphy and their gang is priceless. <br /> <br /> In general, I sell the dead very well, combining horrors, comedies and science fiction into a mixed mass of fun and excitement. This is one of the most interesting and original films I have seen lately, and, unfortunately, such independent films do not receive greater recognition.
