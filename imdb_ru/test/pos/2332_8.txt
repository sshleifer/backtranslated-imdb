Starring: Grammar Kelsey, Rob Schneider, Lauren Holly, Rip Thorn. This film is a classic family favorite. At least for most of my family members. One of us rolls his eyes at the mention of this movie and thinks: "What a stupid movie." I am not that person though. I still find this film very funny. I just watched it again last night with someone who had never seen it, and I laughed as much as the first time I watched it. This is still very funny for me. <br /> <br /> The captain of the Navy Tom Dodge (Grammar) is a black sheep in the fleet. He is one of those guys who will play golf on a boat, cracking the ball on the golf course as they swim past him. He is one of those guys who get drunk, faint and wake up with a hangover and a tattoo on his key. He is not one of those guys that everyone wants to command a subwoofer. <br /> <br /> But Dodge is at the end of the lineup. He submits applications for command of his submarine several times, and if this time he does not receive a submarine, he goes to work in the office, that is, it is for marine life. The Admiralty decides to give him his own boat, but they do not give him a new nuclear boat. They give him a diesel boat, an ancient relic from the Second World War. His mission is to bring it in order and take it to the Atlantic for a war game. <br /> <br /> Dodge was obviously a little disappointed that he was given such a crap boat when he tried so hard to get it. to the extent that he is, so he goes and talks about it with Admiral Winslow (Torn). Winslow explains the purpose of the war game. Diesel submarines are still sold in the real world, including in countries such as Iran, Iraq and Libya. Winslow wants to know what will happen if a renegade captain on a diesel ship arrives in the States and tries to ship a nuclear warhead to one of the bases. Will they do it? Dodge and most of the Admiralty do not think so, but Winslow wants to know for sure, which is why he developed this war game. Dodge's mission is to bring Stingray into the sea, and then try to evade the US nuclear fleet and blow up the US naval bases. In the battle simulator, of course. <br /> <br /> So this is about as deep as the plot. This is not a plot movie. This is a stupid movie, it's just a big gag. It makes fun of yourself, and you shouldn't take it seriously. If you are looking for a good dumb laugh on Friday night, I would advise you to check it out. <br /> <br /> Outcome: 3 out of 4 (worth seeing)
