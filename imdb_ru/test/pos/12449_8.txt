This is one of the nicest teen films I've ever seen (and I wanted to be released on video). It was released in the same year as another great comedy in which Tim Matheson played the role of “House of the Animals” (probably that is why she was not noticed). <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable parts of this film will certainly be the soundtrack, which could and should have been the official release of the label. The soundtrack depicts a less well-known 70s act called High Inergy, whose song “We are the Future” played an important role in the final scene of the film. I remember buying the album "Steppin 'Out" in my childhood, mainly because of the girls' appearance and not necessarily because of their musical talents. <br /> <br /> The final song is one of the best ballads I've ever heard, and I still hear it in my head. I wish I knew the name of the group to look for it somewhere in cyberspace. <br /> <br /> If you like films such as Over the Bound and Rich Children, I think you will also like it.
