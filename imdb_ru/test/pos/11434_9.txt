As a modern Marco Polo, from Venice to China, we again came to Amelio, taking on the task of making out of a gray area in the middle of two worlds solid colors. The pessimistic vision of Europe, shattered by the side effects of globalization, is mutual with China. <br /> <br /> A glimpse of this fascinating but amazing country is viewed from below, without any claims to study or impose one’s opinion. The reality, however, is harsh. Abandoned and exploited children, hives, backward areas - this is ANOTHER china, which we ignore. Vincenzo (Castellitto), a steel mill technician, is one of us. His journey to China is an excuse to understand, to learn from within the country, where progress and problems of the third world live together in a notorious balance. It is not entirely clear whether Vincenzo knew for the first time that the mechanical component had already been fixed, I think so; In any case, this is a secondary aspect. Liu, a Chinese woman, is the key of the entire film. She has a lot of difficulties on her back, she needs to overcome strength, but how can she fight with little money and a little help? <br /> <br /> I was very touched by the realistic and unbiased look of the girl at the facts, refusing Vincenzo's money. A bundle of bank notes cannot return her husband, her child (forced to treat the Law as a stranger), to protect her from ridicule. Liu knew that his intentions were kind and kind, far from the cold charity event. Their friendship is beautifully told, as it grows step by step, worthy and shaping, unique. An invaluable legacy to keep. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are stunning, either for acting (Vincenzo cries on the ferry), or in dialogues (in a restaurant, on the railway). In addition to careless editing and a rather lazy start, La Stella che non c'è is brilliant and insightful only because it chronicles innumerable truths. <br /> <br /> In the 63rd Venice Film Festival competition there are a lot of bets on Tai Ling for the Mastroianni Award dedicated to new stars. She definitely deserved this award. <br /> <br /> [8/10]
