Hello to all of you, cute fans of Dirty Dancing !!!! I stumbled upon this bulletin board when I was bored and I think it's cool. I absolutely love DD! I first saw him in the house of my friends when I was 13 (now I am 17), and they hooked me !! I saw it there at least 10 more times, and soon after that I bought a DVD for myself. At this stage, I remember most of the script and can repeat it whenever someone asks me about it. “Did I carry a watermelon ?!” Most of my friends consider it a shitty movie, but I don’t care what they think about it, I know it’s a diamond! I read the comments earlier, and I have a few questions for you - 1. Why do you ask trivial questions, such as the age of Lisa and the Little ones? I do not think that is so important. They are teenagers in the 60s, isn't that enough? 2. Where did you get this special edition that you are all talking about? Sounds VERY interesting ... Please answer this. I would like to see the opinions of other fans ... Hooray! charliesangel415 xxx
