I think Toy Soldiers is a great movie. This is one of the few films in which, in addition to some well-known actors, there is an unknown cast who can really play. In my opinion, the plot is captivating. He holds your attention without having an outrageous story that could not have happened in real life. I think everyone will like this movie. Sean Astin always seems to choose the perfect films to demonstrate his talent. He is very undervalued and does not receive the recognition he deserves. Other films in which he was in other actors were the center of attention, but this film and Rudy do demonstrate it, because he is the main character in both. I hope that someday he will receive the praises he deserves for his game. If you want to watch a great movie, you need to watch it, and if you are a fan of Sean Astin, you will surely like this movie.
