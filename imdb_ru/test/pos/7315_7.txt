I found it more chaotic than the average Stogs (no matter how strange it may sound). There were a few funny things, especially running jokes (“Call Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!” The glass door smashed, The staff ran into the supply room and returned from ... well, you know), but also quite a bit things that just didn't make any sense to me. I must assume that these were, as a rule, scenes from the film “People in White”, but since I know little about this film, I can’t say for sure. Maybe if someone could explain this, I would rate this short more.
