I caught the first run of Driving Lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival. Rupert Grint shows that he can act past Harry Potter. Laura Linney is amazing as a domineering mother. Julie Walters is as cheerful as Dame Evie Walton, with lips worse than that of a sailor. I hope that this film will be picked up by an American distributor so that everyone can see it. This film is not only about driving lessons, but also life lessons. Ben (Rupert Grint) is torn between his desire to obey his domineering mother and his vicarious father and the desire to live his own life. This is an amazing film from an amazing director who committed suicide and put it on the screen so that everyone can see it, and everyone who can, should.
