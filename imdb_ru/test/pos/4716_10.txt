I have seen Beyond Rangoon about 20 times, it was good. At first, when I watched it, I saw the story of Laura Bowman, but later, after several shows, I realized that it was also a parallel documentary. I remembered the story of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the struggle of women to remain strong in the face of uncertainty, danger, and sadness. I would also include history and politics in the list after further viewing, since I learned a lot about Burmaâ€™s past and present and could only guess about its future. This film is not only the one you want to see, but the one that you definitely need. This is a film that could easily be seen by the whole family, but not for children under the age of thirteen. However, the educational benefits of this film cannot and should not be diminished.
