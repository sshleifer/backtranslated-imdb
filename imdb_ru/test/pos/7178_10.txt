The film is of high intelligence and activity. Along with the fact that he was a strong capsule of time and personality of the 60s, he is also a REAL surprise in his visionary topics and a unique view of the power system in the group. William Greaves assigns himself to an authoritative role in the group. He asks members of his team to take pictures and take pictures and keep shooting. First two actors, then a film crew taking pictures of actors, then the whole set, including witnesses, policemen, and finally, a homeless person who lived in the bushes in Central Park for 9 weeks. <br /> <br /> Greaves edits the film (thousands of feet) together and surprisingly makes a strong story with an interesting arc and motifs. Don't expect to be bored by this movie. Each of the crew members attracts companions and often expresses thoughts that the observer is watching this film. Greaves does a good job with integrating snapshots of multiple cameras using synchronized three-in-one snapshots and other methods of shifting attention. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film will really be effective only if it is what you are looking for. If you are looking for some abstract feature film that feeds your own selfish ego, but does not make sense, look in another place If you are looking for a film that will make you talk for a long time and think about striving for honesty and sincerity in the documented "reality" and the inevitable transparency that comes out of it, then this is the perfect movie.
