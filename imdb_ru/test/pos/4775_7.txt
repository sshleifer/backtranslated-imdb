“Steamboat Willie (1928)” is often mistakenly advertised as the first film about Mickey Mouse, although in fact this title goes to “Plane Crazy (1928)”. The source that feeds this common misconception is probably the episode of The Simpsons, which puts the origin of The Itchy Mouse in the short film of 1928 entitled Steamboat Itch, obviously a parody of this cartoon. Interestingly, Steamboat Willie itself was a travesty, faking Buster Keaton's latest release, Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928) ”, although this connection is slightly beyond the scope of the title and the general plot. In this Walt Disney short film, Mickey Mouse takes responsibility for the river steamer, much to the annoyance of Captain Pete's cat, which angrily throws him aside. But Mickey should not be surpassed in nastiness. Far from the pleasant, rewarding Mickey that later generations enjoyed, this little mouse only cares about numbers, causing pain and displeasure to a number of farm animals to provide music for their own entertainment. <br /> <br /> At first there is a laughing parrot who digs a bucket and a big potato over the head. Then the goat is twisted by the tail to give music ("Turkey in the straw") with a guitar, which she swallowed. The cat flutters its tail, the goose strangled his throat, and the piggy was viciously loaded. For the children's cartoon “Steamboat Willie,” directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, certainly has some sneaky humor, although I also noticed similar elements (although not quite to that extent) in some later Disney shorts, such as Gulliver Mickey "(1934)." Let's not forget, of course, Minnie Mouse, who suffers from treatment, for which she could sue for sexual harassment today! The jokes can be rude, and the animation may be even more, but this cartoon delivers a lot of laughter, and it is easy to understand why this little rodent has become one of the most beloved characters in movie history. If you're a fan of Mickey Mouse or Disney in general, this is one steamer yacht you can't miss.
