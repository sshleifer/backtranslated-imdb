Spending an hour to see this brilliant Dan Finnerty and his “Dan Band” perform in their special bravo is the most pleasant hour I've ever spent watching TV. This young man (Dan) has such an incredible talent as a singer, performer and even a dancer. He can go from the cutest ballad of pop songs, all of which were sung only by women, to hip-hop, rock, as well as songs written for women ... This guy can do anything. I saw him live at least 11 times, so I didn’t expect how well his show adapts to television or film format, but all reservations disappeared instantly when the show started due to the stunning quality of Dan star. Do yourself a favor and watch this, or better yet, buy it.
