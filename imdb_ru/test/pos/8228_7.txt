Search for Randolph Scott’s title, and TRAIL STREET is the only movie missing from the list you’ve seen. One of the 4 films that Scott shot at RKO during his premiership (1947), the rest is always easy to get. Liberal, Kansas, lies southwest of Dodge City and is a powder keg that is about to explode between riders on the trail that carry longhorn on Trail Street, the main street of the city, and the fools who feed our stomachs. It takes a strong man like Bat Masterson to stand between the two groups and put the city in order. I will not say more, except that in Scott films there is usually only one beautiful girl, and in this one there are three. RANDOLPH SCOTT has always played with men to whom you could strive because of their sense of honor, courage, poise and willingness to do the right thing. Fifty years ago, parents could send their children to the Scott movies with the confidence that they would learn positive values. Robert Ryan starred in this film, playing the good guy for a change. In real life, Ryan was one of the many heroes of World War II who starred in American films. How sad that we get these days. George Clooney teaches our young people that we should sympathize with suicide bombers, while Steven Spielberg teaches that there is no moral difference between the Olympic athletes killed in 1972 in Munich and the Palestinian terrorists who killed them. Hollywood 2005 gets its moral compass due to too much cocaine and excessive adherence to remaining insane. I wonder how this all unfolds in Liberal, Kansas? After all, a liberal was not an abusive word 150 years ago when the city was named.
