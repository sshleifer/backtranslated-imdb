This depiction of the unfortunate Japanese forces in the Philippines is a journey of power in the total senselessness of war. This is an effective representation of Japanese pacifist views after World War II. In the film, Japanese soldiers were left to fend for themselves in the jungles of the Philippines. Faced with impending famine, they resort to cannibalism and gradually lose the little humanity they have left. To call this film depressing would be a bit of an understatement. The viewer is left with a completely desperate sense of the lost value of life in modern combat. The final scene is almost too nihilistic, but the film is nonetheless a worthy statement. Highly recommended.
