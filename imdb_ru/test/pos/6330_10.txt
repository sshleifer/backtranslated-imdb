Bergman is a great comedy director and writer. This fact becomes apparent in “En lektion I kärlek”, where comic elements range from pure farce to deep, but very emotional scenes. This film opens the way for Bergman’s later comedies Sommarnattens leende and Kvinnodröm, all starring Gunnar Björnstrand and Eva Dalbeck. This is an excellent film from which you can start your experience with Bergman, with a sharp depiction of the emotional problems of both young and old. The cinematography of Martin Bodin is astounding, for example, on a picnic scene. In short, the film is an excellent example of a successful comedy, with a clarity of depth, even surpassing some of Bergman's own comedies.
