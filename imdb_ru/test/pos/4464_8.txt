DO NOT ATTEMPT A DUCK - this is one of the earlier (and, to be honest, in terms of plot, better ...) Fulchi films - and although this is not the typical “blood bath” that Fulci is known for, it is still very unique and Pleasant film. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds a small town where a series of murders of children take place. Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigation - either as suspects or those who "help" the investigation (or in some cases both) - include the city’s police force, a small reporter, a handsome and rich former drug addict, a young priest and his mother, an old man practicing witchcraft, and his protégé, a woman with mental disabilities and a deaf-and-dumb little girl. All these people are woven into the plot to create several turns, until the actual killer is revealed ... <br /> <br /> DO NOT ATTEMPT, DAKING is neither a “classic” hyallo, nor a typical Fulci gor film. Although it contains elements both are more of an old-fashioned murder mystery, with a darker plot and several scenes of graphic violence (although nothing is as strong as some of the later works of Fulci). This is a well-written film with a lot of turns, which made me guess to the end. Recommended to giallo / homicide fans or to anyone who wants to watch some of Fulci's movies not sprinkled - but don't despair, DON'T TORTURE is still more than a fair share of violence and meanness. Some may be pushed aside by the killing of children, and one of the main female characters has a strange habit of hitting very small boys, which is also a little embarrassing, but if this type of material doesn't bother you, then definitely look at it. 8.5 / 10
