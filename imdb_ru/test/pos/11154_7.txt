Like many stars of the big screen, when their careers curtailed, many turned to television, where they probably achieved their reputation for posterity. Donna Reed is a case in point. <br /> <br /> I don’t think that Donna Reid ever thought that Donna Stone was something difficult, and not a woman who won an Oscar for playing a completely different type in “From Here”. to eternity. She was certainly better prepared to play wife, mother and housewife Donna Stone after playing Mary Bailey in the film “It's a Beautiful Life.” <br /> <br /> Donna was always beautiful, wise and always helped with the problems of her children and her husband. Karl Betz was not an idiot, he was a pediatrician, whose office was attached to the house. Talk that this person was always ready for a crisis. <br /> <br /> Although it was a Donna Reed show, because at that time Donna’s husband produced him Tony Owen. And yet it lasted as much as because of the popularity of two children, Shelly Fabares and Paul Petersen. Fabares had the best-selling teen album, Johnny Angel, which she presented on the show. She successfully passed on to an adult star, best known for her role as a trainer in the role of Craig T. Nelson’s wife. <br /> <br /> But Petersen used to be the idol of teen gum. The Donna Reed Show, I dare say, attracted the majority of viewers thanks to him. This is now forgotten, but Petersen also had a best selling album, my dad. Not as good as Johnny Angel. <br /> <br /> Now Paul Petersen is leading a support group for former star children like him. Many of them end so tragically that he does a good job. <br /> <br /> The stone family was the quintessence of Central America. They lived in a suburb not far from Chicago, they led a healthy life. Mom and dad were always with their children. Of course, the problems they usually had were nothing more than a curfew violation. <br /> <br /> I believe that this particular series was a model for the television town of Pleasantville, in which Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon were drawn. <br /> <br /> I have fond memories of Donna Reed's show. Easy to take, but not too serious.
