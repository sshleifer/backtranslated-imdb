Although it does not seem very promising for a long period, the French Cancun Renoir ends up being an easily charming film. This is a cliché: a laundry girl Nini (Françoise Arnoule) was discovered by the owner of a nightclub, Danglars (Jean Gabin). Danglard stole her from his boyfriend baker and left his current girlfriend, both of whom returned for their former lovers. Nini has to choose, go back to her modest life with the baker, continue the show with her employer, oh, or become a princess, since the prince falls in love with her at one point. I am glad that the film did not go to the most obvious choice, as, of course, a smaller film. The film ends with the opening of the new nightclub Danglard, "Moulin Rouge", and a couple of great songs and dance numbers. The first one, “Complainte de la Butte”, which is also the basis of most of the film’s musical works, is simply one of the most magnificent songs ever written, and Renoir himself wrote it. If you are a fan of Baz Luhrmann’s 2001 Moulin Rouge! Film, you will recognize the melody at the beginning of the film, played by Rufus Wainwright. Although it is not very noticeable in this film, everyone I know who owns the soundtrack likes it. In addition to one of the finest songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the sweetest leading ladies ever to adorn the screen. It's hard not to fall in love with this girl. 8/10.
