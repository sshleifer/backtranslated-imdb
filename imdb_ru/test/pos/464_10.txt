Despite the fact that it was dark, depressing and at times difficult to observe, “You are alone” caught my attention and was sincere in their dialogue. It really captured the anxiety of teen romance. Also, the soundtrack was awesome. The lyrics and the tone of the songs so well complemented the sadness of the film, which made you wonder whether the tracks were created specifically for the film. <br /> <br /> Jessica Bol is the best actress I've ever seen. Her convincing and believable performance made the film. It made me wonder if she really was a prostitute. Who knows. In any case, the film was very worth watching. LOVE, YOUR SISTER! Yes it is....
