“Christmas in Connecticut” is an absolute gem and you should definitely look at Christmas! Elizabeth Lane, the predecessor of Martha Stewart, is a columnist for the magazine, as well as the spouse of housewives — the ideal wife, mother, and home goddess. The only thing, it is not one of these things - complete fake. Unfortunately for her, she will soon be cleared up. Its publisher, Mr. Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet's brilliant comic turnaround), gets the bright idea of ​​inviting the famous war hero to the “perfect farm” Elizabeth for the Christmas holidays. The only thing is, there is no farm, “ideal” or not. The comedy tells how Elizabeth must keep her real identity a secret so that she does not lose her job. Elizabeth's colleague, John, has a Connecticut farm that solves this problem. However, he wants to marry Liz, but she does not want to marry him. He offers to marry her, although he knows that she does not treat him as he does to her. In any case, he makes an offer and assures her that he is ready to wait. And here, Barbara Stanwick, like Liz, pronounces one of the most destructive blows I have ever heard. With complete innocence, she replies: “Could you wait so long?” OH! In addition, the scenes between Una O'Conner and SZ. Sacall is cheerful. They seem to dislike each other (although they suspect they really love). They are rivals in the household, and S.Z. The disfigured English Sacallus equates to the suffocated pronunciation of Nora in his name ("Mr. Basternook"). "My name is Felix!" It's amazing how these black and white movies are at Christmas. Excellent work of the characters of all participants. Do not miss it!
