Octavio Paz, a Mexican poet, writer and diplomat who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1990, said of Nazarin: â€œNazarin follows the great tradition of insane Spaniards created by Cervantes. His insanity is to take great ideas seriously and try to live accordingly. "A humble and spiritual priest (Francisco Rabal in a beautiful performance) tries to live according to Christian principles, but is expelled from his church for helping a local prostitute, giving her refuge after how she committed the murder. Nazarin wanders along the country roads of the 20th century Mexico border, offering help to the poor and begging for food. Two of his followers, the murderer-prostitute Andara and her sister Beatrice, failed suicide, about Looking for love, consider him a saint, but this does not prevent him from hating and humiliating both the church and the people he meets on the road. As a result, he is beaten in prison and begins to question his faith for not being able to forgive the assailant. <br /> <br /> Bunuel tells the story in the form of a Christian parable, masterfully and uniquely combining the admiration and irony of the protagonist and strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy. The film is simple and deep, as well as beautiful, ironic and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> I consider Bunuel one of the best directors in history. I have seen twenty of his films, and they all belong to different periods of his life, but they have a common feature of his magical touch, a masterful combination of dark realism and surrealism, his curiosity, his inquisitive mind, his sense of humor and his dark and brilliant fantasies. With great pleasure, I add to my list of my favorite films the little-seen and almost unknown, but surprisingly frank and touching surreal tragic comedy "Nazarin".
