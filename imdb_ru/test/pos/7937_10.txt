There is a version of "Nevsky", which is shown with a live symphony orchestra, chorus, soloist and film. If this has ever been done during the day, you see what the Nevsky did. The Oklahoma City Philharmonic did this with the OKC Canterbury Choir (one of the best in the world) a couple of years ago. I think I cried through it all, it was one of the most emotionally strong impressions of the film in my life. I'm listening to Nevsky on the radio right now, and it still breaks me. There are films that I love and classical music that I love, but I canâ€™t come up with any combination that comes close to the Nevsky effect in real time.
