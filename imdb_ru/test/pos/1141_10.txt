I went to this movie, not knowing what to expect. I actually took it on a date in theaters when it first came out. We both really liked it, and it helped someone to discuss it after watching. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie only if you value non-mainstream movies. It is not as scattered as Liquid Sky or fancy as Forbidden Zone. The original plot is very simple to follow. There is a lot of subtle humor. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief summary of the plot, if you are completely lost: a government of the type of elder brother watches everyone in society. A new person suddenly appears, and there is no data about him (he looks insane). It may or may not be the second coming of Christ. An overly cautious government goes berserk to find him and uncover his true motives. The ruler is also obsessed with immortality. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are insane, while others are completely discreet. We follow the main character when he encounters different people in society. <br /> <br /> I didnâ€™t need to change my mind in order to enjoy the film, but I know that some of my friends felt that it helped. <br /> Split was filmed also in Santa Cruz and San Francisco.
