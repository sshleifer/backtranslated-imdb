A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to point to another stupid 80s inbred / backwood festival; the type where sex is death, and the actors are all annoying stereotypes that you really want to die. However, "JBD" provides significantly more. <br /> <br /> Instead of focusing on bare flesh and blood (although everyone has little - no gender), the click focuses on securing looming fear / growing tension among a beautiful scenic backdrop. These feelings are further enhanced by realistic characters and antagonists, which are more immoral than the cardboard definitions of evil. Oh yeah, George Kennedy is here, too, and when is that bad? <br /> <br /> If you like Wrong Turn, look at this to find out where its methodology came from.
