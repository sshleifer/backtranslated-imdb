Mary Pickford plays Annie Rooney - the daughter of a police officer who lives in a difficult part of the city. She is a rude and confused young woman of uncertain age (somewhere between 12 and 16) who loves to wrestle with her head, but deeply has a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> This is a very typical film for Mary Pickford. Like many of her other films, she plays a young girl - although she was almost 40 years old when she starred in “LITTLE ANNIE RUNIE”. And, like many other stories, she was courageous and brave. As a result, I had a strong feeling of deja vu. Now, if you have not seen her other films, this is not a problem. However, she essentially plays a character very similar to the characters of Sparrows or Daddy with Long Legs, although these two other films are much better. This is not to say that this is a bad film - it is just that it is certainly not one of her best works - mainly because of a rather “damn” story that is very heavy in feelings, but not particularly convincing. Fascinating, but not obligatory viewing, if you are not a big fan of silence.
