I was stunned by this movie. I made Antonioni films / rediscovered them, and this film showed me the climax and the fruits of its 50-year-old director. What kind of settings, color and detail! I have never seen such visual beauty and poetry, taken earlier. I had to stop after the first story and hold back the tears. Yes, beauty drives me, as if Keats wrote Ode on a Greek urn. This film is made for a mature, emotional and intellectual audience. Those who hope to see the physical performances and the series will be disappointed. I will have to watch this film several times before I can truly appreciate it and judge it. This film should be watched by all filmmakers and directors. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is a truly magnificent film commissioned by Kurosawa.
