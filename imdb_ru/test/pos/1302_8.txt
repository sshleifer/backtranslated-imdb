It's nice to see a romantic comedy, in which there is no main character, which has a masculine as well as a feminine principle, and although the story is a bit long and a bit cliche, you canâ€™t help, but she likes it. br /> <br /> I think the story was a bit hasty at the end, but an extension that would have made the story even longer. Surpasses other romantic comedies, such as 100 days with Mr. Arrogant, and possibly related to my tutor friend. <br /> <br /> That would be an interesting acquaintance with Korean cinema, not as big as my sassy girl, but still good,
