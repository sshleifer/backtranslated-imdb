Well - it was black and white and probably on a 2-inch tape - which means the BBC erased it, right? But it remains in my memory from all those years ago (1960 ??) as a wonderful piece of history, animated by the most innovative editors and wonderful actors full of youth and bravado. <br /> <br /> I WANT TO SEE THIS AGAIN! Do you read this, BBC? Find your original 2 "tapes or a 35 mm film, deal with the actors and the director for rights and reprint! I know, I know, some of them are dead, some are missing. <br /> <br /> Where else I can see Is Mary Morris like “a snake's heart wrapped in a tiger's skin?” Where else can I see Paul Deinman doing “It's a winter of discontent ...”? Or will Robert Hardy give a talk about “that idolatrous ceremony”?
