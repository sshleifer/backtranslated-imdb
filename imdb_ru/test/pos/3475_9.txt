“I'm dancing inside” (Rory O'Shea was here) is the story of two young people with disabilities, Rory O'Shea, who is almost completely immobilized and confined to a wheelchair, and Michael Connelly, a weary MS and also a limited wheelchair. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in Ireland. Rory arrives at the care center during his lifetime. In the end, he became friends with Michael, but only after several tense scenes in which Rory rebelled against the staff and other patients in the usual "cinema way", playing loud metal music using profanity and general confrontation. His nascent friendship with Michael is confirmed by the fact that Rory seems to be the only one who understands Michael or is at least ready to try. <br /> <br /> In the end, after some trial and sorrow, the couple filed a petition, and the right to live independently in a specially equipped apartment was granted. Paid for his apartment Michael, who essentially abandoned him because of his disability. They also hire an attractive assistant named Siobhan (played by Romola Garay) to help them in their daily lives. In fact, this is the essence of the film, when both have feelings for it. Michael is particularly impressed. Unfortunately for both, but especially for Michael, Shiban does not feel the same, and this leads to the fact that she has to leave. How Michael temporarily regresses and wants to return to Ass. Living Center, Rory convinces him to continue living on his own. The film ends with a sad note that many viewers could expect, but ultimately, we still have a feeling that Michael really became independent, and the future is his, as Rory pointed out to him at the end of the film. <Br /> <br /> You know, I cannot say that I have seen many “films for people with disabilities,” and I don’t know if they can be considered a specific genre. But there is a type of formula for them. One person does not want to live outside of his illness until some kind of liberating force forces him / her to do it, and “Inside I dance” really knows the other. What works, however, is probably more subtle about the peaks and valleys that two men pass through than you might expect. There are no intentionally gratuitous moments and no “get up and cheer” manipulations. The sad parts are sad and the funny parts are funny. Some viewers may rebound a bit from the fact that Rory is a spiky punk-type with pointy ears as a too perfect cliché of the “rebel”, but actor James McAvoy somehow makes it a reality. The same can be said about Stephen Robertson, who plays Michael. When Michael's heart is broken, it doesn’t seem to be caused by a bad script trying to get the audience to work, but rather by a young man who genuinely suffers from unrequited love. The type of pain in many can be associated with any of their physical condition. Again, these are the things that make the film work and make it shrill, without being domineering and enjoyable on many levels. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
