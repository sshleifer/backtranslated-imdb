Thirst <br /> <br /> I discovered that this film is beautifully made. Cinematography was far superior. I think that almost any frame can be frozen, and you will have an exquisite photo. The use of color stands out the most. In many cases, the camera slid around the stage, and the work was flawless. <br /> <br /> Direction Chan Vuk Park was fantastic. He made me firmly believe in his contrived universe. There were several touches of verbal and visual humor (of a dark nature) that only added another depth to the picture as a whole. <br /> <br /> An act which I wouldnâ€™t call outstanding, was suitable for the film and worked well enough. <br /> <br /> For me, the only place that lacked this film was history. At times I will not lie, what is happening between the characters simply did not make sense. Sometimes the course of history was awkward. Overall, I was disappointed with the muffled narration and felt that it lasted too long. <br /> <br /> But I still recommend this film, because of its vision, its visual flowering, dark humor and End of the Day, this is an interesting film, albeit imperfect. 9/10
