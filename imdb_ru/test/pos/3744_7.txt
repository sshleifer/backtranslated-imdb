Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, leaves his wife abandoned, and his son (uncredited James Franco) does not respect him and loses the patient with whom he operates. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers that her husband has cheated on her. They both need to leave. She is looking at a beautiful coastal hotel in Rodanthe, at the same time he is booking a room. They are all together. You can pretty much deal with the rest. <br /> <br /> This is what is known as a film about a fan or a female film. It is beautifully captured with a romantic setting and lots of quiet scenes. There is a tragedy, romance, more tragedy and an inspirational ending (sort of). The great game of Gere and Lane helps to hide the fact that this film is not really about much. Every bit of the plot is predictable. I rolled a lot at some events. Besides, it's too short - I didn't believe in the novel between Gere and Lane for a second. If it appears out of nowhere and moves VERY quickly. Still the film works. The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous, and I was in tears to the end along with most of the audience. So this is a predictable, but great movie with a great acting game. It does not deserve all the criticism. I give him 7.
