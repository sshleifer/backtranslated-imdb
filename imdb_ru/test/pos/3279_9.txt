Thanks to Mario Van Peebles for not only informing us about the existence of black cowboys, but also presented an exciting story that was easy to follow. <br /> <br /> The plot, background, music and talent were top notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the story of black cowboy. It was also nice to see Billy Zane in this film. Did he ever play a good guy? <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to expand their way of thinking. This is a great movie and I feel honored to see it. I hope you feel the same way.
