Little Gus is a ten-year criminal. He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a trip. Reaching the petal is hard for him, so he creates a device to help him. His goal is to win an ingenious lottery-type card game called Motorama. He must find all eight letters to write M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. Dark laughter follows as he turns into a journey from hell. He encounters some abnormal Lynch as characters. The most memorable is the employee of the gas station, who puts his photo on a kite in the hope that God will see it. Later, Gus receives a tattoo and a bandage for the damaged eye. He becomes one of the most rebellious bad 10-year-olds you have ever seen on the screen. This is not a children's movie! Look for camels Jack Nance, Flea and Drew Barrymore. Be careful, although Drew is on the front cover, she appears in the film only in a dream for a couple of seconds. In addition, the film confuses closer to the end, reaching the territory of David Lynch, you can watch it a couple of times. Motorama was written by Joseph Mignon, best known for his scripts for After Hours and Kiss Vampire. So enjoy this depraved surrealistic fun journey!
