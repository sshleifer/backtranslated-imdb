Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu is a very popular anime on almost every review page you find on the Internet. So I really wanted to know why, and I was not at all disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you can get through a very strange (but rather funny) first episode, you will find yourself in a very interesting and very strange world. This is a very well traced, perfectly animated world. <br /> <br /> I can’t tell most of the story without spoiling it, so I’ll just say it’s a school comedy ... and yet it’s not. In fact, I can not say exactly what is being said. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'm a HUGE anime fan, I have about 50 full episodes, and I’m not joking when I say this. Despite the fact that I didn’t finish watching Haruhi Suzumiya, in fact, she takes a very high place in my personal collection. I fell in love with him at first sight and I assure you that, at least, you will not remain indifferent to his irresistible charm. Believe me, I do not go 10 for each thing that I look.
