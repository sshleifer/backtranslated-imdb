Seriously attractive, intelligent and thought-provoking drama at its best. Sneaky, exciting, capricious and charming. Every home should have a copy! Do not believe my word, see for yourself. One Life Stand makes you think about your lifestyle and how you feel about your family and friends. Beautiful photography and impressive acting is one of the best cinematic impressions of the year. John Kilty's debut is admirable and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this deep and sandy movie. This is a film that cares and has honesty, which has no equal in recent years. No car chases, but the film is filled with hum and emotions. I first saw this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival in 2000, and now I am pleased to have the opportunity to have a copy on DVD.
