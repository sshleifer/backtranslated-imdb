I really love this movie. It has a very real feeling for it. I believe that he was never popular because of the subject, however, because of the subject, he makes the film much more important. <br /> <br /> This is the “A” film, and I highly recommend it. If you like the book or the “1984” film, I think you will like it too. <br /> <br /> This is at least harsh, including mental and physical torture, some rather nasty. Not for a week in the heart or abdomen. No blood, but his film is so good at projecting mental expectation that it does not need blood and courage. <br /> <br /> If you are not a realist and not a pessimist, I don’t think that you will like it, It leaves you with an unpleasant feeling about people, about what they can do, and about the real possibility that our government will not necessarily have a personal interest in his heart.
