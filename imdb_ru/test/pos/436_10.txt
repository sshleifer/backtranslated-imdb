I just watched Jean Renoir’s wonderful Frenchwoman Can. This is a visual delight and a great entertainment. For comparison, the recently released cobblestones from the Moulin Rouge I did not quite get all the praise that a recent film received. Now I am convinced more than ever that my assessment was correct after I saw a master cinematographer, for example, a version of the same story by Jean Renoir. He succeeded in getting great performances from his entire cast, and the great French actor Jean Gabin was in a rare form. The dance sequence near the end was one of the most exciting that I have ever seen. It was a long time, but I didn’t want it to end. This film deserves more recognition than it received.
