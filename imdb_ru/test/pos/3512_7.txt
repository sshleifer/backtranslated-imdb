I was fortunate enough to see the DVD version of the movie “Classical Horror” before it was mysteriously removed from 4 DVD movies and replaced with something else. The picture and sound quality of the film in this release was a nightmare in itself. However, this version still surpasses the one with luxurious DVD processing. The reason was set forth in the Brad Fidel interview segments on a Special Edition DVD. He noticed that I first found so striking in this film. This is the use of music in moments of inactivity in the film, but leaving moments of activity in silence, thereby giving the horrible scenes a feeling. The problem with this reprint is that it carries an extra movie bill used to fill these deliberate gaps in the bill. Fidel complained about this and made it clear that the filler music was not his. The music actually sounded very similar to Howard Shore's work for the Videodrome. I am sad that I am also a big fan of this film and should link them. <br /> <br /> The film itself managed to add some interesting realistic elements to the horror film of the genre. A group of friends climbs a mountain, one of which is inherited. On the mountain, they face the family with a nightmarish secret. The film moves at a great pace. In fact, every time I saw it, I was still shocked to see that 45 minutes had passed before everything became really bad for tourists. <br /> <br /> While there are a lot of gaps in The Awful Classics, the fact that there is no accompaniment that accompanies the horror scenes is what makes this film clever and even surpasses most of the cutting films I've ever seen. either seen. Directed by Jeff Lieberman made several unique horror films that preceded this, which makes him the most massive, but at the same time very different from the main one. This is a good fun movie with amazing acting. The new DVD version with DVDs is worth the rent, now the collection item is Horror Classics, and now the PLO is worth the hunt.
