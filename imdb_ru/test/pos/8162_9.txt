I was impressed with this story. There were a “typical” predatory male-male and a “typical” Mormon missionary. But each of them also had friends and family who balanced their lives. There are several characters, some cute, and some not so cute, each with its own individual nuances. And most of them reminded me of people in my own life. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a few humorous moments and gradually turns into a film about spiritual relationships. The story unfolds without obvious plot twists and never speaks to you. It makes you think, waiting for what will happen. Even when I thought I could foresee that something would happen, I was surprised at how it actually happened. <br /> <br /> Not many films make me consciously laugh at the real gay dialogue, and then cause tears in my eyes when I feel the pain of the characters. I watched a movie on a DVD and couldn't bring myself to stop watching until it was over. (I usually watch the movie piece by piece for a couple of days.) It's nice to see a movie with funny characters that is uplifting but not preaching. I highly recommend this movie! And not just for gays. Relationships go beyond sexuality.
