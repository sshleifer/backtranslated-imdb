Jungle is more an adventure than a science fiction movie. The only sci-fi part is woolly mammoths living in our days. <br /> <br /> Elephants attack villages in part of India, and these attacks also kill people. The expedition is sent to investigate, and one of the participants in this, an American hunter, accuses these elephants of the fright of woolly mammoths, who are supposedly extinct. At first, no one believes him, but they believe when the Mammoths appear at the end. An earthquake completes them. <br /> <br /> “Jungle” was shot on location in India and has many beautiful landscapes and good Indian music, including some songs that make the film continue to evolve. Mammoths are real elephants wearing fur coats and long fangs. <br /> <br /> The cast of actors included Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero (The Lost Continent) and Marie Windsor (Cat Women of the Moon). /> <br /> The jungle is worth seeing, just for the sake of landscape and music. Very nice. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
