We just watched the latest episode shown on the SBS network and miss our weekly dose of Danish Delight. My wife and I took up the show after the Swedish show “Eagle” was over, and, compared to him, it seemed like a very bad substitute for our favorite show on television. However, week after week the show grew on me, and although it was not as glossy as the Swedish show, and certainly more severe from the point of view of investigating everyday crimes, it certainly provided a truly satisfactory weekly meal. /> Before these two concerts I was not a fan of the police genre and I can’t say that I am now, but two Scandinavian shows really gave us an idea of ​​life in these northern European countries through the eyes of their special police units.
