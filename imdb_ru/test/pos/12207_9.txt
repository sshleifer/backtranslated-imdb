The surface, from the day when its teaser first appeared in the summer of 2005, was unexpected. On the one hand, it seemed so high concept and driven by the plot that it seemed to a passerby that it would turn out better than a movie (or several). Plus, it seemed like it was an NBC “lost killer” attempt. On the other hand, one could understand that the story was too extensive to be told in one or two films, and Lost fans seemed intrigued. <br /> <br /> So, after one (and possibly the only) season on NBC, the show goes on an indefinite break, which can either put it in storage, on a science fiction one, or fill the gap in NBC in the summer or autumn 2007 or later. His ratings were among the best on the network (which doesn’t say much), but the show was off the air without a real official announcement of its future. <br /> <br /> So is it worth it? Yes. <br /> <br /> The surface follows a continuing plot format based on a plot without filler episodes. Almost everything that happens on a show is important to the plot, very much like a movie. There are no episodes of filler that would hurt you when you missed the episode. However, the double advantage of the show helped make up for it; It seems that big things happen in every episode, but since it looks like a movie, every episode ends with the fact that little has happened and you have left to want more! This feature of the show, however, shows how great it is. The cast is solid; The three main characters, including the beautiful Lake Bell in the role of Laura Daughters, demonstrate a solid game in each episode, each of which is based on their own reasons for searching / studying creatures. The supporting cast, including Ian Anthony Dale and a short performance by the Rade Serbdzij, complement the acting cast. The story begins slowly (my only regret; in fact, it does not resume until 3-4 episodes in the short season of 15 episodes), but the second half of the season compensates for this. The visual effects are awesome (the jaw drops when you see a top view of one of the creatures attacking the ship). <br /> <br /> Many of the problems of the show can be fixed by buying the end of the first season and you don’t have to wait a week (or three) to watch the next episode. <br /> <br /> In short, if you missed the first season and you are interested, go back and watch it. This is not Twin Peaks in terms of quirkiness, but its high conceptual character is combined with Lost and other similar shows. with a talent for action and adventure. Enjoy it.
