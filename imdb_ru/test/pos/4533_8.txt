I think that every critic who prepared Tommy Boy when he was released in 1995 should come back and watch it and find out that this is not a bad film at all. Every critic prepared the films of Chris Farley and David Spade. Yes, “Coneheads” was funny, but in a way it was a joke, and “Black Sheep”, with which I agreed, is one of the worst films ever made. But "Tommy Boy" does not fall into the category of "Coneheads", which could be a little funnier, and "Black Sheep", which is a piece of scar. It is very funny and entertaining. I agree with the critics that Chris Farley was not John Belushi or John Candy, because he claimed to idolize these guys, and these guys had a comedy genius, but Chris Farley was very funny, and I would like him to I was there to prove to critics, yes, he was not John Belushi or John Candy, but he was very funny. The scenes between Farley and Spade as a sworn enemy are ridiculous, and the premise also laughs loudly. It's very sad that Chris Farley is no longer here to make us laugh, but we have films like “Tommy Boy” to remember how really funny he was. Tommy Boy is one of the best comedies of the 1990s.
