This short was nominated for an Oscar, losing to Anne and Bella. Since Dr. Strangelow didnâ€™t become as merry as nuclear war! Condi takes the situation and turns it over in his ear, then twists it for good measure. In Condi's work, there are a lot of visual congestion, and I always see something that I missed before each of these viewing. On the Greatest Animation in the world, it is worth looking at this and many other shorts. Featured.
