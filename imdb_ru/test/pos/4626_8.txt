2:37 shows us perfectly well what Australian teens feel and don't say. These are stories of real children, and I think it would be naive to think otherwise. The only thing that really brings us 2:37 is the Australian point of view. We often watch for troubled American children, but often we cannot connect the same problems with our teenagers. Performed with clever and cunning cinematography, I (however, immediately recognizing the disappointing final song) found that the musical direction lacked sophistication. I applaud the incredible casting of this film. These are regular-looking Australian children who have a lot of sympathy for this. Great performances everywhere, and you can't beat Gary Sweet, this film made me remember why sometimes in high school sucks, and if you are not squeamish, or you don't like to leave with warmth and fluffies, go and see 2:37 .
