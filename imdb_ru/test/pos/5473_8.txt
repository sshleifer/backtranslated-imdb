Seriously, any film with John Malkovich is usually very good. And this includes Clint Eastwood, Rene Russo, John Mahoney (Fraser), Dylan McDermott (“The Practice”) and many other great actors. <br /> <br /> Clint is getting older, but thanks to him he is also a great director (by himself). <br /> <br /> We are accustomed to Wolfgang's “water films,” such as Das Boot, Poseidon, and Perfect Storm — it was really a different, but equally sublime, guide. <br /> <br /> The premise of the killer is as serious as possible, the film goes well, some of the violence is a bit ... But generally recommended (but not for children).
