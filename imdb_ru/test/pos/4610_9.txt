British nobleman Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Green) decides to find two of his best friends who disappeared after visiting Count Carl von Bruno (Stephen MaNally), an evil and powerful man living in the Black Castle. Sir Burton travels under cover with another person, as he fought against Count von Bruno in Africa with his two missing friends, and the Count lost one eye in battle. When he arrives at the castle, he is invited to hunt in the Black Forest around the castle with the count, while he is looking for evidence that the count has killed his friends. Later, he and the wife of the count, Countess Elga von Bruno (Rita Corday), fall in love with each other and with the support of Dr. Meissen (Boris Karloff), Sir Burton and the Countess try to escape from the claws of Count von Bruno. “Black Castle” is a great movie from romantic time, with action, romance, mystery and even horror. The story is exciting and great entertainment for any audience. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "O Castelo do Pavor" ("Castle of Fear")
