A truly accurate and unsightly look at modern life. It can be installed in any city in the UK. <br /> <br /> I live in a residential complex in Glasgow and am very good at this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, situations and characters are too realistic, but not predictable. <br /> <br /> Actors are incredibly believable, it seemed to me that I was spying on my neighbors. It was a deep immersion in the life of fragile and hopeless people. I was very touched by several scenes. <br /> <br /> I liked how this movie was made. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is a must see.
