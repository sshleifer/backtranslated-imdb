This is a fun movie with subtle intent. His unusual comedy is fun for me, not funny with my friends. The soundtrack is perfect. <br /> <br /> I have it on VHS, and I watched it many, many times, because it's just a fun and funny love story with great performances from all the main characters (although using Joan Cusack exclusively as a perch for big hair is a waste of her talent. I know, I know, she was still young ...). <br /> <br /> On a sad note, I decided to check out the DVD last night (instead of watching my VHS tape), and was shocked to find a lot of important cut scenes. And the copy I was looking at was not a special function of the deleted scenes: it was as if the deleted scenes never existed !! I'm so glad I bought a used VHS at a flea market. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this was a lot of choreography, and this is another reason why I love him so much. It takes a lot of skill, talent, and genius to get around scenes like Mercedes Ruehl, Dean Stockwell and Matthew Modine make scenes into scenes (pay attention to the scene when grocery carts converge, rolling on the floor during an exchange of gunfire in Miami, defeating chicks chicken licking, foot massage, washing the hair in the salon.) This film has a very “theatrical” feeling that can be turned off for many whose bad reviews follow: I know some viewers who don't quite understand this style, take exaggerations and excessive exaggerated Oia for a bad game and the worst direction. Not this way. Jonathan Demm did a great job, bringing the whole company and their respective roles to life. <br /> <br /> Introductory titles and first scene are also among my favorites for all time (another favorite intro title / first scene: Fly home). <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Matthew Modin has so passionately jumped out of the public eye; I really liked him, and I found his acting as IDEAL as Mike Smith. In fact, this film is good from soup to nuts: everyone is believable and true to their role. Regarding the question of the expected audience to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians - why not? I thought they did a great job. <br /> <br /> Charming, fun, exciting ... what's not to like here? If you want to have some fun, watch this quaint, colorful adventure-crowd-love story.
