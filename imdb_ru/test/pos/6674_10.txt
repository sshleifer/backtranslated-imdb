I thought this film was greatly underrated. The topic really seems a bit strange, and I initially put it off, but as soon as I watched the movie, it did not seem at all strange. I was intrigued by all the possibilities this story could offer, and I could not wait to find out how it would end. As soon as it ended ... I thought about it for a long time. I was pleased with everything about K-Pax, from acting and history, scientific elements and psychological problems to the final. This is not a particularly optimistic or funny movie, although it sometimes makes you laugh, but I found it especially interesting and thought-provoking. I own it now and am going to watch it many times.
