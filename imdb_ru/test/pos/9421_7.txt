Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson respectively, the second in the Universal series, where using a written prologue, it was again established that the famous detective story is legendary and takes a long time. It helps to get comfortable here in the "real" era of the early 1940s. <br /> <br /> In this sentence, Holmes goes through several different disguises (with Rathbone’s very prominent features, it’s likely that people don’t recognize his true identity?), because he protects physics from the hands of the Nazis, and from the enemy of Holmes, Professor Moriarty (now played by Lionel Atville). The scientist developed a scope with a bomb that would greatly help in aerial bombardment, and he promised his plans to the British. But Moriarty wants to get him so he can sell them to the Nazis. <br /> <br /> Good entry has increased slightly due to the participation of the truly villainous Attvil, who now plays like Moriarty (although George Zucco was not a fool himself in the adventures of Sherlock Holmes). It is always intriguing to observe how Holmes and his greatest enemy participate together in witty banter (“Needle to the last, eh, Holmes?”).
