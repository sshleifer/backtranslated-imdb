The film, of course, can be a narrative medium, but not at all perfect. The literature best carries the plot, because the reader can provide the imagination necessary to complete the structure. The film is valued best when viewed, because it is a series of images grouped together. What Soderberg does in Ocean Twelve is the combination of impeccable filmmaking technology with the smooth shape of American films from the 1970s. Looking at the comments published recently, most people expected a theft film to be released with a standard release, a la Entrapment; It seems that people actually miss the tedious romantic cliche disguised under the tension between the leashes and the ridiculous plot twists meant to keep the audience awake. Soderberg's directing skills are the only reason to watch this film, but close ups of Pitt and Zeta-Jones at 40 feet on the screen also do not hurt. A true pleasure for those who love the flickering of lights on a silver screen, and disappointment for those who are trying to make a film of what it is not.
