To begin with, I have always been a fan of Bonnie Hunt .... She always adds life to any character she plays, and she has done an excellent job with her directorial debut. <br /> <br /> I must admit this film about tiptoe ... But, considering this, this is a wonderful story, it touches on many emotions and causes all sorts of reactions. <br /> <br /> This film depicts real life, similar to people with real life. as a situation (I mean, I have to exclude a coincidence, which is the main part of the film). <br /> <br /> This is a love story ... not only men and women, but also love for family, friends and loved ones. Past (Even Pets). <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. Worth renting or buying.
