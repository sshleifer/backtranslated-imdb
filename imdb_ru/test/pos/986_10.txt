Without ever reading or seeing the original work of Bard, I cannot begin to compare this work with his story. So I will not. Instead, Iâ€™ll just say that it was a very interesting story with some very good special effects (and some that looked a little less budgeted but still decent enough to enjoy). I thought all the main actors were great. The style of magic seemed black rather than white, and would almost certainly offend anyone who would easily get upset about this sort of thing, but I thought it was well done.
