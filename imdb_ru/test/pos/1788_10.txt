After the all-round success of MY NAME BARBRA, CBS television allowed Barbra to create an even more thoughtful sequel as her second special. Streisand wisely knew that in order to follow the success of MY NAME Barbara, that her second special really needs to raise the bar even more in ingenuity and entertainment. Not surprisingly, she succeeded once again. Even more impressively, Streisand was able to create this large production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of MY NAME BARBRA. <br /> <br /> Once again, the special offer is divided into three separate laws. The on-site filming at the Bergdorf Goodman department store was so successful in the first special edition that Streisand and the company decided to shoot again on the spot for the first act of this second special offer. At this time, the decisive place was the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which would allow Barbra to “enter” into various works of art that would correspond to the songs being played. In addition to the many artistic possibilities this place has made possible, the museum will provide an excellent opportunity to take advantage of color shots. <br /> <br /> After writing "Draw me a circle," opposed to After the opening credits, Barbra rushes through the museum in a maid costume to the sounds of "yesterday's" Kern and Harbach. She ceases to admire various pictures and statues, often becoming a character who is depicted and sings a thematically appropriate song. Streisand plays the bitter-sweet performance of Hammerstein and Romberg's “One Kiss” as “CONCERT SINGER” by Thomas Ikin, delivers Chopin's “A Mint Waltz” in a cheerful, mannered performance, embraces abstract art with the fierce rhythm of Peter Matz's Gotta Course and performs the agonizing performance of "Non C'est Rien" as a distraught girl Modigliani. The culmination of Act I, however, is that Streisand compares profiles with the sculpture of the bust of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti, performing Rogers and Hart’s military force performance "Where or When." The Act II circus medley allows Streisand to interact with various farm and circus animals, performing various farm / circus / animal songs. Some highlights include Barbro singing "Were Your Special Faces" for the baby elephant performing "I'm used to that face" as a serenade for the little pig, walking "Sam, You Made Long Pants", sung for a group of little penguins and Barbra, comparing profiles with an anteater, singing "We have so much in common." Streisand also swings on a trapeze and jumps from a trampoline into the chorus "Spring Again", and then slows down, performing the obsessive version of "I stayed too long at the fair," sitting alone on the stage. Barbra also has the opportunity to show her pet poodle Sadie in this segment and even speak a little French. <br /> <br /> The concert in the third act again became a high point. Dressed in an elegant white wool dress, the concert segment takes place on the stage of a unique design with a partial staircase that leads nowhere. Streisand opens the Act with the sultry performance of Harold Arlene "Anywhere I hang my hat at home" before proceeding to the insightful versions of the familiar "It Was You" standard and the rarely heard "C'est Si Bon (This Is So So Good). "Then, Streisand truly amazes the audience with a tremendously powerful octave performance of the Sweet Charity ballad" Where I'm Going ", from which Streisand performs the final performance. Streisand also presents the newly written ballad of Richard Maltby Jr.-David Shire" Start here, start this song yhchas ”, which contains Strasand’s passionate vocals, which is one of the best vocal performances in her entire long career. <br /> Most of all, Color Me Barbra was a showcase for the ever-growing megawatt power of the Streisand star. Despite its presence even more visual blinding brilliance, Streisand herself has always been the main attraction. Her voice sounds as beautiful as before, and this release for the first time demonstrated how amazingly she takes pictures in color. As in the case of MY NAME IS BARBRA, COLOR ME BARBRA was another hit of the rating and spawned another Top-Five gold-selling soundtrack album. Simply put, COLOR ME BARBRA defies tradition and becomes an extension almost equal to the classic original.
