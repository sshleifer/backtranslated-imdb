Forget Samara / Sadako and Jason ... <br /> <br /> Horror got a new name: GRANNI. The plot is simple but effective. The actors are good (two thumbs for Michel and the killers), and the dialogs are even pretty smart. From the very beginning to the end, the action will force you to hold your breath, you simply cannot avoid it ... Blood, horrible murders, funny moments and a sense of perversity go far beyond any rule. "Deja vu"? Of course, NO: “Grandma” is not another slash film, this is a truly classic game ... She deserves the success she had, and with the reprint, even greater success is expected. Congrats!
