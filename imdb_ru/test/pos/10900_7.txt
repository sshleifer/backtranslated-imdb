It is halfway to being the best movie. The opening section, which forges Hollywood films about the "social message", is absolutely brilliant. This is a riot from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The second section, which introduces us to the main characters of this story, is also very good. We get a lot of great comics, first-class performances, and the dialogue is truly dynamic. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler warning!) <br /> <br /> The only thing that really irritated me in this film, although it is the final, which I think contradicts everything that happened before. My interpretation was that this film removes from Mickey all the stupid prejudices and hints of gossip from a small town and the national tabloid sensation. I liked that the film protects the reason why a personâ€™s sexuality is NOT determined by his hobbies, fashion features, fashion sense, or anything else. And then comes the final, which reinforces all the gossip and stereotypes that the film successfully ignited in the first place. It turns out that everyone was 100% right !!! (Godamit!) It was very disappointing for what was actually a great story.
