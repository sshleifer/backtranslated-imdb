This is the best movie ever, but this is my opinion. Some say it is stupid, but I think it is a really beautiful film. The chemistry between Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze is unlike any other I've ever seen, and that makes the movie so perfect. I always wonder what would happen with this film if these two actors never existed, because not one of them did it for me, they both did. If you have never seen this movie, then you will understand what I mean. Dirty dances look as if they were made from the heart, and for some reason they seem as real as magic and the LOVE IT soundtrack. In addition to the two main actors, the soundtrack makes the film as beautiful as it is. As you can tell, I'm in love with this movie, and I know you too.
