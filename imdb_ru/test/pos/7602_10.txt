I thought that this film was great not only because of the storyline, but also because of the great cast. I read that Drew Barrymore was not exceptional Josie Geller because she is beautiful. Yes, she may be, but in the film she played outside of herself, which led to a simple girl looking for who she is in the world. The story is sweet and definitely for hopeless romantics, I'm sure. David Arquette is mad like her brother Rob, and Michael Vartan is great like Sam Coulson. Lily Sobieski did a great job with her friend Aldis, someone who was not afraid to be herself. I think this film should get more respect, and not be called the movie "tiny puppy"
