Despite all the negative criticism, I really liked this film. I don't say that easily. I love movies and are quite demanding of them (my home DVD collection contains over 9000 films - some are great, others are fine, some I don’t like at all). And to all who have been criticized: this is a comedy. I just love this movie. It is light, funny and very calm. I am aware of all (or most) flaws, but I like it. Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro's comedic talents are involved (in full - for this type of film). Do not compare it with other movies with these star actors, just enjoy it. The cast is great and, I believe, the goal of this film has been fully achieved. If you want a truly "peaceful" and very good night - watch this movie. De Niro and Murphy just had fun making this movie, so we have to (watch it). And please do not be so negative. Do not wait for the performance of the Godfather or “Meet the Parents” from DeNiro, do not expect the performance of comedy blockbusters from Murphy ... This is a completely different genre, and it made me relax after a hard day’s work. Your parties can not separate from the laughter, but it's still very funny.
