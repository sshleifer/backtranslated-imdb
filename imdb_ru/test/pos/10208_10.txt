Fritz Lang led two great westerns: "Western Union" and "Return of Frank James." Frank James film equals "Jesse James". Western Union is one of the great westerns of Randolph Scott. I have never seen Robert Young in the west; he is terrific as an employee of the telegraph. This is the only film I can remember about the telegraph company opening in the west. This is a fascinating story about a telegraph in the west, a love story about a triangle and about loyalty. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is superb. Dean Jagger, who made several westerns, plays a telegraph manager. Virginia Gilmore, who plays Mr. Jagger's sister, is a love interest in the film. Miss Gilmour has had a short film career. She quit movies in 1952 and became a drama coach. She is primarily known as the first Mrs. Yul Brynner. It's nice to see Slim Summerville again in the movie with Mr. Scott. They were in two other great films: “Rebecca from Sunnybrook Farm” and “Jesse James”.
