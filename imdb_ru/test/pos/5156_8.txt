You cannot call Roy Andersson prolific (6 films in 37 years). You also cannot blame him for being ordinary; he does not do it "directly," at least when it comes to narration. “You, Live”, his first film in seven years, is like a surreal documentary, in which it is noticed that a large number of characters do nothing, and if this sounds discouraging, let me assure you that this is not so. This is a funny, affordable and surprisingly heartfelt film, a piece of life that is far from what we usually see on the screen. <br /> <br /> Of course, “a piece of life” is hardly the right nickname to apply to this film, since most people’s lives are unlikely to be. The incidents on the screen stretch the gamut from almost horribly ordinary to completely stupid, and although the characters may fly past, sometimes they will never be seen again, others appear again, as if eager for approval, Andersson gives them all good love that we spend time with them well.
