When I first saw Colleen Moore, it was a great series about silent films called “Hollywood.” There she was in 1980, her hair is defiantly cut, as it was in the twenties, a sparkling, witty and charismatic elderly woman - the very definition of "presence". Then I saw her incredible silent comedy in films such as Ella Sinders and Orchids and Ermine. Then disappointingly gloomy radio "Scarlet letter". And now she is in “Power and Glory,” demonstrating a dizzying force, skillfully working together with one of the best actors of the talking movie - Spencer Tracy. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me that the film lacks brilliance on the plot, but Moore and Tracy give such brilliant ideas that the story hardly matters. Both actors grow old from adolescence to old age throughout the entire film - and mostly it happens alone, with minimal makeup and hair change. Moore is almost unrecognizable as an elderly wife, and the scene where she finds out that her husband sees a young woman is one of the most beautifully performed scenes I've ever seen. She does most of the scene without dialogue, where her silent acting experience gives her an advantage even over Tracy. Contrast this with her delightful comic, playing in another quiet sequence when she is a young woman, and Tracy struggles to make her an offer. Amazing This film shows more than anything about how disgraceful that Hollywood allowed this wonderful actress to slip through and spend most of her retirement life.
