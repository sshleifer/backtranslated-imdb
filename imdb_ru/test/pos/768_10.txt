pretty I just love the movie. I want to watch this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor. his expressions are wonderful, impressive. the film was superb. Julie Walters, that was beautiful too. I think Rupert is the only red haired boy I love. Rupert has a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. and a wonderful accent. I think the film was great and great if you look at Rupert except for Harry Potter and this is a very good actor, so he deserves it and more. he just has a golden ball, but he probably deserves an Oscar. There are actors who do not play very well, but in any case have an Oscar. It does not matter. but he is perfect, brilliant and beautiful
