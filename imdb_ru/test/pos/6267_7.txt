A very nice film about a young Chinese who is in love with Western technology, and about an Englishman who is trying to make money at the screening of films in China. This is a very interesting story, presumably based on real events, although I assume that this is more a fantasy than a real one. He has a fabulous quality that you rarely get in real life, and 8 people are credited for the script, so they must have composed things left and right. <br /> <br /> This is a very cute film that conveys a magic film to people who have never seen it before. This is not a particularly deep film, which briefly speaks about the loss of tradition and the encroachment on Western culture, but basically it is just a nice little movie. This is a film that I really liked and which is already starting to fade from my memory 15 minutes after watching. Light as a souffle, but I enjoyed every minute.
