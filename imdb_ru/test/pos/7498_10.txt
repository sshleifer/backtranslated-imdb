For those who are not familiar with Paddy Chaifsky, this is a very good introduction. Although Chaafsky deals with the reality behind the myths of many things, including medicine, this work is surprisingly prophetic from the way medicine goes today, two decades after the film was made and more than ten years after his death. In addition, some ideas about Chaifsky’s view of life in general are “slipping” in the film. The 20th century may well be the first and last century of the United States in the history of the world. If it turns out that the contribution of the United States to art was in the dimension of "cinema", then this is a vivid example of this art.
