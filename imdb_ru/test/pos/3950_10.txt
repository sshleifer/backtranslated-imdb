I can't get it out of my head. It is definitely completely different from everything that is there. Over the holidays, I saw a ton of movies, and although with some everything is in order, my world is not shaken like BlindSpot. There is something cool about the actors and how they put together the film. As if there are really scary things, mixed with some damn funny black humor. Franco is great, but the older, rude dude steals the show in several scenes, for example, when he hits a child in a dirty grave. I think that some political corrections will not appreciate the atmosphere (do not take your grandmother with you), but this is absolutely amazing. Best style kaliedescope. There are some really serious things mixed with super interesting shots of the road. The film really makes you sad and scared piecemeal, but it also spins your head with what happens and how it is shot. WTF with the world? Oh, so many critics are delighted with all these supposedly revolutionary innovative films, and when you see them, they are boring and predictable, and not all. I do not understand, because there are many other best options. The “blind spot” is really great because it gives you thrills and chills, as well as a powerful coming star power, but it makes it completely fresh and definitely joyful.
