Great movie, very decent 7/10. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was at his best, a heavy alcohol congressman who saved Afghanistan from his communist oppressors! Based on a true story, tells us how the West throws money and weapons at the problem and expects it to disappear. Well, it passed, albeit temporarily. Look, with whom we (the British, among others) are now fighting the same people to whom the United States gave weapons, training, and money in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This film has always evoked political thoughts from people who watch it, but it does depict a very good story. However, as soon as the main goal is reached, that is, the deliverance of the Communists from Afghanistan, it is clear how quickly they forget about the plight of the people. <br /> <br /> This film was good, it was deserved 7/10, It described in detail about the invasion of the Communists in Afghanistan and the subsequent secret operation of the United States, and he was well dramatized. Being a good film, I will recommend it to people, but some will not like it, especially a serious film about good (USA) against evil (Russia) is not your thing!
