It is a pity that the Gershwin family and the Goldwyn Estate made this wonderful film from their viewing, thus making it impossible for the public to see some of the most wonderful actors and performances ever packed into one movie. <br /> <br /> It is also true that the singing voices for Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge were dubbed for this film, and this is used as one of the reasons Gershwin doesnâ€™t want this film ever to be released. <br /> Despite the flaws in the film and the creative differences between the Gershwins and the Goldwyns, this film presents some of the most wonderful performances ever presented on the screen. Sammy Davis, Jr. and Pearl Bailey are particularly commendable. <br /> <br /> This film was the swan song of the great independent producer Samuel Golvin. It was also, ironically, the greatest shame of Gershwin. <br /> <br /> Finally, this is a loss for the beautiful black actors who appeared in it. For we can no longer see them at their best.
