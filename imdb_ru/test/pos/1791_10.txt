How Margot, in Fear of Fear, falls victim to her ambitious husband, how Fox in Fox and his friends leads her boyfriend to suicide, who took all his money, like Xaverl Bolizer, in Zhenya Station Chief, who goes to prison, to give his betraying wife a chance to get rid of him, like Hermann Hermann, who seeks refuge in madness, to escape his foolish wife and bankrupt company, and Hans Epp is a victim of German society "Wirtschaftswunder" - society after World War II in RW Fassbinder "Merchant of four zonov. " Just from the fact that Fassbinder played through social abuses between men and women, as well as between heterosexual and homosexual couples, it should be clear that he does not approve of any gender. <br /> <br /> In the case of Hans Epp, there are women who bring him to despair, illness, and finally death. When he returns from the Foreign Legion, where he flew, because he could no longer withstand the pressure of his mother, she complains that he is still alive, while the good boy from her neighbor was killed. Then Hans gets a job as a policeman, but his boss is surprised when a prostitute seduces him. Having lost his job, he works as a fruit dealer with a small income, moving from the yard to the backyard, shouting out his products. His mother, one of his sisters, and her husband are ashamed to have such a “street worker” in their family. "The love of his life" (she does not have a name in the film) refuses to marry him, because his work does not match her social status and origin. Therefore, he marries Irmgard, whom he does not love and who does not love him. From her constant pressure on him, he runs into drunkenness. One evening, when his wife chased him, he explodes and hits her. She runs to her family, for whom this event was exactly what they were waiting for. When Irmgard calls a lawyer for a divorce, Hans has a heart attack. Imgard decides to stay with him, but from now on he is no longer allowed to do hard work and drink alcohol. Thus, he begins to feel more and more redundant, becomes more and more quiet and more and more depressed. When he learns that Irmgard is deceiving him, he decides to end his life, but not like Hermann Herman, having traveled in the light of insanity, but he drinks himself to death before Imgard, their little daughter and his drunken buddies. Fassbinder said in an interview that Hans knew what he was doing. The question, however, is this: did Hans just commit suicide because he could no longer bear his pitiful entourage, or did he cultivate himself?
