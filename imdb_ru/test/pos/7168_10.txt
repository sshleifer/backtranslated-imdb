My first film about Mom, looked at IFC and LOVED him long ago. It seemed absolutely artistic, original, funny and fun. Not a single moment in the film let me down and did not make me feel bored, and I laughed or smiled a lot. I mean this movie is really funny. But this is the catch: he is also very artistic and creative - if you do not know Yuri Mamin (perhaps, unfortunately, because there are not many of his BIG films), he has a very original style than anyone else, and it’s not even my favorite movie (now it's crazy ("Saideburns / Bakenbardy"). Besides, I must say, like Russian, that this movie is great because you really see what Russians look like. And it is possible, because that this is a real Russian film for me, and not a foreign film that is trying to be American and and tries to appeal; Mamin did not sell out (and since then he has not become as good as Gorky (1998)). This is real Russian cinema in a style based on communist socialist realism. <br /> <br /> If you liked this movie I think you have very big chances to fall in love with Mamina’s other films, in fact I like some of them, more than this one. I think this is his most accessible film. Similar movie “Fountain”, which took place 6 years ago time adjustment, has the same actor in the lead role, and many more regular customers Mom's, whom you will learn from Windows to Paris; it has one supernatural twist at the end, but mostly it's a realistic comedy, great. Viva Mamin, I hope Criterion will connect all his films one day, it still works, and its catalog is so good! Watch any of his films if you can.
