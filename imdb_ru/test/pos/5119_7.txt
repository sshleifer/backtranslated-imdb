This time an attractive asshole is called to the jury, where a corrupt lawyer notices that he looks like a jailer who wants to break free, so both switch. Of course, most of the film is a series of gags; in "Ernest goes to jail", most of the plugs are connected to electricity. I really liked the whole sequence of the vacuum cleaner at an early stage. In general, the meaning of the film is just to have fun, and I am sure that you will do it. This is arguably the best movie you watch with a bud. It is safe to say that Jim Varney will really be bored. Knowwhaddamean? For your information: the only other actor I recognized was Randall "Tex" Cobb, who played Lyle. You must have seen him somewhere.
