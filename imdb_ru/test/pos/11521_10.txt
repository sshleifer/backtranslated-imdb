I have to say that this film had a great cast, places, music and camera work. Cameron Diaz was great, she had a very exciting cast, very noisy, while Jordana Brewster had a serious cast that still captured one. Jordan is very nostalgic for me, she reminds me of my classmate! In this film, I was really attracted by a very skillfully planned camera work and selection of places. The story is very talented written. it needs to be seen. he who starred in mysterious films should watch this one, I guarantee you everything that he will keep you in their places until the end.
