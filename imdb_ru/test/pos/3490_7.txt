If you like his show, you may be a little disappointed. There are some very funny moments in this film, and the laughter is quite constant, but none of them is very memorable and not as funny as in the series. The initial sequence is really very stupid and funny, and a great start. Yes! Borat does appear in cameo. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan, then look! if you do not know him or do not love him, then do not worry. 6.5 / 10
