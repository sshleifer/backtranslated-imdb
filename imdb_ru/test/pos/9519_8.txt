Wow ... for a long time I have not seen such a funny movie like this one !!!!! I have never been a big fan of French films, but since I fell in love with the beauty and acting skills of Catherine Deneuve, I decided to watch all of her films ... but I did not think it would be as fantastic as it turned out. I was lucky that I bought it, although I had some doubts! This is a really good movie with class and quality. There are some important social themes and moral dramas that are very close to the modern lifestyle, which are very beautiful and realistic. I also really liked the dance scene in the men's room! But my favorite is a rather timid attempt by Catherine Deneuve to sing ..... she brings it as she is, with great grace and modesty at the same time ... very tempting! In the future, I would also like to express my respect and admiration for Lina Reno, who played a fantastic role (I didnâ€™t even know that she played ... I only knew her from her music). So don't wait any longer and watch the movie ... you will be surprised in many ways.
