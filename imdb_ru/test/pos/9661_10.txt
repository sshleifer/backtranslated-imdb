My teacher made this film. This is a new beginning. Watch it and you will not notice that this is a Romanian film. The old boring style is gone. Now this is something else. Post-revolutionary film. He uses the latest visualization technology and mostly unknown artists. They are unique. You will not even know what you are looking at, you will simply be transferred off the screen, and you will feel every frame. Do not miss, pay attention to the plot, but do not ignore the details. They make the difference between this film and other Romanian films. You will hear the music at some point. This is a representative for us, but he does not represent us. Please keep your head straight and leave your body free.
