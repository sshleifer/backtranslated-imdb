This drama beats hard and impossible to forget. The young cast does a decent job — even Keanu Reeves is better than usual in one of his earliest roles. Of course, there is no reason for Lane (Crispin Glover) to be as crazy as he is, but this is only Glover, who is himself. Veteran Dennis Hopper plays a particularly good loner role, which, despite its dirty past, is saddened by the attitude of this group of children.

It's too sad for that. <br /> <br /> 10/10
