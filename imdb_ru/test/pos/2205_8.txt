I have only praise for this film. From start to finish, he captured the brilliance of Stephen Sondheim's musical. I'm not a big fan of musicals, most of them have overdone it. This one, however, changed my mind. I myself am an actor and actually played Sweeney, and I know how difficult this role is. George Hearn gave a terrific, masterful and rounded performance worthy of the highest awards we can give him (he won an Emmy, and this is something.) Everything he does, he turns into gold. He is so good that it will amaze you, why he does not act in films winning an Oscar. Lansbury is also very good and very funny. Sarah Woods is creepy and wonderful, like Beggars Woman. Overall, great video. Take it if you can.
