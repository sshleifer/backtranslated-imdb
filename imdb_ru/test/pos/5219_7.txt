I do not like boxing, I do not understand the attractiveness. I like this movie. Positive images of Hispanics, without drugs, sex or street violence. The plot actually showed a stable, loving family. The sequence of fights, like boxing, are cruel, but not as much as in the Rocky films. There is nothing wrong with attempting familiar topics from a different perspective and ethnicity. This is a good rental.
