Under the confident guidance of F. Gray, “Italian Work” never loses its ability to be cool and fun. Although the material is paraphrased and average, the film itself is expertly executed and satisfactorily good. The tone could possibly be much heavier, given the killing-revenge plot line, but F. Gray Gray maintains the tone thanks to good mood, brisk dialogue and pulsating music. It's nice to see that these potential bad guys form a great bond and cling to each other through deception and murder, while not forgetting to have fun. This is 7/10.
