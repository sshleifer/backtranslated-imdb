I love this film. This is the first movie that Master P has ever made. It is based on his life story. It is low budget, but it is very good. This shows how Master R grew up in projects in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> Master P. not only started acting in this film, he also was a screenwriter and director Moon Jones. There is also an unlimited ice cream party on the DVD. This film shows how “Master P” becomes too bad and how he had to deal with the things around him. This film also has a lot of The No Limit Records listings. You must buy or rent this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that you like to watch, whether you like rap or are a Master P. fan. I won’t ruin this movie for you. Get this movie as quickly as possible and watch it. You'll like it.
