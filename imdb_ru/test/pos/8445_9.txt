As long as you don't mind paying a little more attention than usual to other films, this is one of the best thrillers you've ever seen. The film is about an incident that can happen in real life; in fact, nothing in this seems fictional. It also shows how people can react in real life. <br /> <br /> In fact, he portrays them so well that it looks like real life. Add to this the lack of a soundtrack, and you’ll get almost the best movie ever, like the news you’ve ever seen. Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are especially good at this late seventies masterpiece, causing her concern and sincere tragic pity. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves thrillers.
