Six out of seven people who took the time to comment on this film received very positive feedback. One negative review happens (or was done) on the first page of the movie's location in IMDb. <br /> <br /> I found "What Alice Found," one of the best films that almost no one heard about what I saw this year. His rating of 6.4 is misleading and may be a feature of a complex subject rather than a film quality. Who would have thought that a film about alleged prostitution with truck stops is worth seeing? Guess again. <br /> <br /> For me, “Alice” was an exciting psychological thriller. I was practically on the edge of my place all the time. This is a very plausible story with a realistic scenario, and it is very well played. In a fairer world, actress Judith Ivey will be rewarded for guessing whether she is good or evil. <br /> <br /> Ignore the rating and watch this awesome movie. (And, by the way, I would like a soundtrack album.)
