This show borders on brilliant. This is a modern day, married ... with children. Scenarios are witty, as they are sprinkled with clever sarcasm. They are also realistic, dealing with the problems that many parents of teenagers face today. And also the constant burden that you may not be the best parent of the world, and how best to cope with it? However, at the same time, he manages to remain frivolous and cheerful. That, despite all the drama and action on television these days, is a very pleasant and welcome change. This is what you can sit down in front of 30 minutes and relax, laugh and chat. This is not the most fun comedy in the world. still make you laugh at least a few times per episode. Michael Rapaport is a great leader in the role of Dave. He fills the big shoes that are required for the sarcastic scenario, and then some. He and Anita Barone (Wicca) have fantastic chemistry and bounce off each other perfectly. This show has a great future, if it is sold to the right target audience and placed in the correct time interval. In addition, if Fox releases it on DVD, the next one will be stronger and bigger. (Like the classic Scrubs example.)
