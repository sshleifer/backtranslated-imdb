Flash Gordon was a first-class TV series. I know that there were a few stupid things, but I did not watch the flaws. Buster Crabbe - Flash Gordon. He was not a trained actor, but he gave a very good, convincing presentation. Jean Rogers is beautiful and she is 20 years old. the old one did, in my opinion, a pretty good job. Charles Middleton, like the Emperor Ming, is magnificent. He was in many other films, quite versatile, he could sing and dance. His image of "Ming The Merciless" in all 3 series of Flash Gordon was top notch. The rest of the cast also did a very good job. Well, boys and girls, take popcorn, relax and enjoy. John R. Tracy.
