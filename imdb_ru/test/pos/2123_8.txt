This is a new film about Barbie. The graphics were really good. They made the film seem partly realistic. I did ballet, and this film made me want to continue it. This film was something like Cinderella, but a bit different. The father of 12 princesses is very sick. His cousin poisons him and wants the throne. The girls find the secret magical land thanks to the stories of their deceased mother. It is up to them to save their father and society. With the help of his beautiful prince. It was a funny movie, and my friend and I watched it merrily. We really liked, and also liked the Indian speaking parrot. The music was very pleasant and made the movie even better. He had a great classical orchestra. The voices were great and the characters were amazingly sweet and sweet. I liked it, so enjoy a movie that is great for a family. In general, I would look at it again.
