Undoubtedly, the film is full of black warlike stereotypes and most of the jargon of time. In this sense, the film is really dated. But as a satirical look at the parasitic industry number one in America, advertising, it is still aimed. But just as important is the counter-message, namely the influence of big money on those who will make the industry more socially responsible, and not on the propaganda of military toys, alcohol, etc. Thus, the film is also about the charm of capitalism. Pay attention, for example, to how Putney's clothes change suddenly, resembling the revolutionary Fidel from the third world, just before he leaves the firm. For a moment, it seems that the mini-Swap revolution was successful among its employees, and he goes further, perhaps to spread the movement. But then the former militants give up the attractiveness of big money, and he leaves, shaking his head, perhaps to hijack a plane to Cuba. Downey's last word, however, is ironic, since an Arab (I suppose) burns down the money tower, leaving the metaphorical structure (advertising, capitalism) of a smoking ruin. To me, it looks as if change can only be successful as a cleansing act of destruction, and not as a reform process â€” a message that corresponds to the radical spirit of the times. <br /> <br /> Whatever the subtext, some really funny moments, especially with ads that play as well as then. Those who compare the anarchist style with the Marx Bros. style make a good point. Ejection lines fly thick and fast along with outrageous installations. Forty years later, it is still a difficult film to get consistent control. Nevertheless, despite the rudeness, the film remains a work of bold originality with some truly exciting moments.
