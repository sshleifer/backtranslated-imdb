The film tells about the students of the High School of Performing Arts in New York. There is Coco (Irene Cara), a black singer who, in spite of everything, will reach the top. She is assisted by Bruno (Lee Curren), a white musician. Then there is Doris (Maureen Tifi), who wants to be an actress - but she is shy and scared. She became friends with Motgomery (Paul McCrane), supposedly the only gay student in school, and an affair with Raoul (Barry Miller). Then there is Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray - who, unfortunately, died in 2003), who is a homeless and excellent dancer - but cannot read. Then there are various teachers (Albert Haig, Ann Meara stands out) trying to teach children. <br /> <br /> BIG songs (the title song and "Out Here On My Own" were nominated for the best song-- "Glory won"), the dance is energetic, and the young cast demonstrates many ambitions and talent. BUT this film skips the boat in the dramatic department. Many storylines are raised and completely left open by the end of the film. Why do coco make porn? Doris and Raoul stayed together after the words? Or did it? What about Montgomery - what happened to him? And someday Leroy graduated - and how? Too many long speeches (Raul has two) and moments that simply lead nowhere. I guess there were cuts in the script - I can't believe the film just left it all open. <br /> <br /> However, it is worth looking at the performance and, again, the music. There are mostly not one bad song, and the dances go to full strength (and at one fine moment, to stop the movement - literally!). My favorite "Fame", "Out Here ..." and "I Sing the Body Electric" is a great final song. Therefore, I recommend it, but I can give it only 7 - the script is really needed in order to make ends meet - and this is not so. <br /> <br /> General information: they wanted to make this film in the school for the performing arts, but could not get permission. The dean of the school read the script and said that there were too many curses in the film. It is true - there are many obscene words, but schoolchildren say that. Avoid the TV version, which exaggerates it terribly.
