Once in Sweden there was a poor sister of the Salvation Army. At the door of death, she asks: “Send David Holm!” But Victor Shestrom (like David Holm) cannot be found, because he spends New Year's Eve in the cemetery with his fellow drinkers. Astrid Holm’s dying sister (as amended) wants to know whether any result has brought a prayer for Mr. Shesthrom’s soul over the past year; perhaps it is not. In the Cemetery, Sixstrom tells the story of the Ghost Coach, which he heard from his dead friend Thor Swenberg (like Georges). According to the legend, the last person dying each year must take away the souls of all the victims until they are released on the eve of next New Year ... <br /> <br /> Director Sestrem, whose main roles are very strong, in conjunction with the photographer Julius Jenson to create a visually appealing film. The great “double exposure” effect is often used, but never seems excessive; and it does not make the other dramatic highlights of the film less memorable (for example, the Sjöström rip its sewn coat and the turn of the door). The story of Selma Lagerlöf was probably not the one you could or would like to intervene in the 1920s - which may or may not be, why the end of this film is a disappointment. And, unlike similar spiritual stories, it is difficult for you to suspend your disbelief if you think too carefully about what is really happening in Körkarlen. <br /> <br /> ******* Körkarlen (1/1 / 21) Victor Štrém ~ Victor Šström, Hilda Borgstrom, Tore Svennberg
