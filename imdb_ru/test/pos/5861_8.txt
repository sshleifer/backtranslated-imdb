The stars by "Murder by Numbers" Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are two rebellious high school students who are content with the perfect murder in order to overcome their shattered self-esteem. Sandra Bullock plays a heroic thorn in the way of her plans as Det. Cassie Mayweather. This in no way resembles the traditional murder mystery pointing the finger, since the film graciously reveals the killers to us (Gosling and Pitt). Instead, the film focuses on the goals of its killings, and if they have what it takes to commit a perfect kill. <br /> <br /> The name itself is rightfully chosen for various reasons, mainly due to the fact that the “Numbers” in the title are the loudest. The angle that focuses on the reasons for the heinous murders, although it haunts you with its cold dialogue (especially from hard-core boys), does not fully correspond to the study of the reasons for their insane murder. Characters are attractive, you have a handsome rich guy Richard (Ryan Gosling) and a clever but clumsy in communication Justin (Michael Pitt). At school, they pretend to despise each other, and even love sympathy for a classmate named Lisa (Agnes Bruckner), but outside of school they are allies and participate in a ritual in which murder is the salvation of the mind. <br /> <br /> Of course, the story of the guys seems exciting, but it is relegated to a more mundane plot involving Det. Mayweather (Bullock), who suggests that their killings were due to discrimination (hence the arrogant look of Gosling) and unexplained characteristics, but managed to do it right. At first, viewers may despise Cassie's character because she is very stubborn and not very supportive. She demonstrates dominance and control over her younger partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin). Despite the fact that he is trying to argue with her, he knows that this is a battle that he is unlikely to win. <br /> <br /> The reason for her tyrant's behavior is that Cassie was the sad victim of a crime that has left a permanent mental scar on her. This side story has no particular place in this film in part because it does not offer anything exciting with the main plot (killing the boys). He also offers some of the character development of Bullock in the film, but this is only half the task and does not perform very well. I would have liked if they, devil students, had an extra story. Resources were right in front of them for the perfect criminal grid, creative schemes for boys to manipulate the police with their false evidence and lies, just to get out of a potential life sentence in prison. <br /> <br /> Despite the one-sided plots and the senseless ending of the “real killer”, “Killing by numbers” demonstrates excellent results thanks to the magnificent cast of actors. Sandra Bullock was convincing, like a hard verbal ruthless policeman who is trying to transfer his inner pain to a more positive light. Ben Chaplin shows his strength as a young detective who is trying with all his might to understand his partner and is able to repel her occasional tyrannical offenses. But the scene theft is the devilish duet of Michael Pitt and Ryan Gosling, as they keep you glued to their place, waiting for what they are going to do next. The boys' chemistry resembles Matt Damon-Jude Law in "The Talented Mr. Ripley."
