“Mishima: Life in Four Chapters” is a visually stunning play that easily raises difficult questions. It is based on the life of the controversial Japanese writer Yukio Mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. In fact, this is not a biopic - at least not in the traditional sense - this is a study of Mishima's iconoclastic creativity. The film manages to present abstract concepts in an embroidered, fully attractive manner. Paul Schrader makes you sympathize with Mishima without having to deconstruct him or his work. This does not completely solve the riddle, but makes you understand it. An added bonus: since we see Mishima’s rage because of a lack of tradition in a morally empty modern society, Schroeder gives us a wonderful demonstration of the dichotomy between thought and performance in the movie. John Bailey's cinematography is impressively good. The grandeur of the work of composer Philip Glass is ideal for the project. "Mishima" - the best film that I saw this year.
