Director Kannatil Muthamtal made the first Indian film, which I watched “Dil Se,” which led me to the path of buying over 122 Hindi DVDs for four months. I can say that I understood all the attractiveness, I was somewhat puzzled by why the film stopped at the "music videos". It was an excellent film, I didn’t know what to do with dancing, and the female vocals were a little shrill for my western ears, but somehow I found the hypnotic score of AR Rahmen. I bought the soundtrack the next day, and then the next week Lagan, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and K3G, and, with the exception of "Ichi the <br /> <br /> killer", several other Korean films, it does not bother me to watch a lot another. This is strange for those who for the past 30 years have watched only a strict diet from Hong Kong, horror films <br /> <br /> and action films / fiction. <br /> <br /> But I have to go back for Kannatil Muthamtal, this is one of the last works of Manya Ratman, and I laughed, wept, completely lost my mind, terrified, and most of all I did not feel the manipulations. The game was great, the photo was beautiful, I think you could stop the movie at any time and notice that any frame will be worth painting. The music was perfect for the film, and after the captions <br /> <br />, I wanted to watch it again ... I did. <br /> <br /> It would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you might miss the pleasure of watching the events and the development of the characters. This is what a great movie is about! I stood and applauded at my home theater when it was all over! <br /> <br /> My wife is looking now, and I cannot wait for her reaction, I cannot expect her to be anything less than mine.
