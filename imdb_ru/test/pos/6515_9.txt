Sally and St. Ann are a very funny movie. The first time my mother told me about it, I was 7 years old, and St. Anne was just a saint that I had for my holy communion. My mother knew this, so she told me to watch it with her. I have seen and seen it many times because it is really funny. Aunt Bee from Andy Griffith’s show participated in it, and Sally’s grandfather was the guy who played Santa Claus in Miracle on 34th Street. So there were a lot of actors that we saw on television shows. There is a bad guy who continues to try to steal a house, and Sally continues to try something with St. Ann to help raise money so they can save the house. This includes a boxing match with Hugh O'Brien, who plays her older brother. This is a good and funny movie that I still love.
