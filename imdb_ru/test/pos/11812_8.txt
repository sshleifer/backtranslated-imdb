I really liked the film, I thought it was very interesting and dramatic. But I just had a question about the music of this movie. I could not find any soundtrack (if there is one at all). And, in particular, it was interesting to me, can someone tell me the name of the song that sounds while the boys are walking along the river on their way to New Orleans? I thought it was something like “My big escape,” but I searched the Internet for books, almost everything I could think of, and I just could not find it anywhere. If someone can help, it will be very valuable. Thank you.
