I really have no complaints about this film, except for disturbing scenes with the body. I fell for it, switching around the TV one night. The game was really amazing, I did not expect it to be better than it seems! I thought that Keanu's acting game (which looks the same since 1986, which is very good, hehe) was really * gorgeous *, and Crispin played his character well! This film is a hidden gem! This is a fresh awakening of reality by the 80s compared to other teenage films made by a group of guys (although I also like these motives). In general, I throw it!
