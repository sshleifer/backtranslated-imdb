Compared to “Battle of Britain,” this is a real movie, with real characters and a real storyline. The Battle of Britain is basically a documentary with random Lawrence Olivier and Michael Caine, but the real main characters are Braids, Hurricanes, etc. plot. I highly recommend it to everyone, even those who are not particularly fond of war movies. This is well filmed, and I wonder what the director could do if he had big capitals behind him. And I do not think it is too sentimental. Only in the fighters there are real people, with real feelings and real life - as real as any fictional life in any great film.
