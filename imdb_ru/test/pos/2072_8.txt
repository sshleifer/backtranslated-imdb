This part of Hamlet, partly filmed by the BBC during the filming of all of Shakespeare's classic plays, does not dispel my particular impression that this is one of Shakespeare’s most overvalued plays, and Hamlet himself is not a particularly touching and tragic character. I feel no sympathy for him, and I have not watched it. <br /> <br /> Even when you have great actors, such as the great Derek Jacobi as the Dane and Patrick Stewart as Claudius and Jonathan Hyde as Rosencrantz, he cannot hide the lack of passion in the storyline. And when a good actor like Jacobi brings passion into him, he makes the whole role incomprehensible. I just could not link his character's physicalization to what he was saying, and that killed me. However, he does make the right speech “To be or not to be” correctly, since his actions with the dagger clarify the character's suicidal intentions at that moment in the game. <br /> <br /> Supporting roles for me are better written and, therefore, better to play, this is pleasant, in particular, the crazy Ophelia Lalla Ward and the detailed interpretation of Claudius Stewart. <br /> <br /> At four and a half hours it is very long and is best seen in bite pieces. Check it out if you're interested, but be prepared for long hours.
