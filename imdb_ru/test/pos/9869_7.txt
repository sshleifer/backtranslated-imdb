Although I brought this film by chance (I thought it was the original Halloween (stupid!) Of the prequels, why Michael Myers is killing people and why he seems to have supernatural powers. I thought this was the best horror movie full of action and surprises, I am very glad I brought it. I gave it 9 out of 10.
