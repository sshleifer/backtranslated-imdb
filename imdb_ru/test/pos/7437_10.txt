I can't believe how perfect this film is. Excellent graphics of computer graphics, good storyline and fights, oh battles !!! This movie was great! Characters They look real enough to be considered real. They definitely resemble those from the game perfectly. A scene in which ... well, all the scenes made my jaw fall. Fantastic Graphics Graphics History. Excellent explained. Plus the way Aeris comes to help Cloud many times in the movies. They explain it very well and make your jaw droop on how perfect it is. But repetitive contractions do take some kind of history, but this is only a minor thing. History 9.5 / 10 Everything else is great. The film was just awesome. I really don't know what else to say, except that this film was pretty much perfect. I LIKE IT!!!
