I have a copy of this film, and I always loved it. I comment here, however, because I saw the PBS presentation of Sweeney Todd’s live version earlier this week. This production was staged by the San Francisco Opera, which starred George Hearn and Patty LuPone. In the early 80s, Hearn replaced Lena Kariu in the role of Sweeney (Kariu won Tony for his performance). I saw Hearn and Angela Lansbury (who also won Tony for her role as Mrs. Lovett) perform Sweeney on Broadway. They must have made a movie around the time I saw the show. To this day, the most exciting moment I ever remember in the theater happened when Hearn sang "These are my friends." (“These are my friends, look at how they shine.” “My hand is full again!”) twenty years since I first saw him play a Broadway play, and then in a film. What a talent! He is responsive, cheerful and scary - all at once; and he can sing, boy can he sing. It all reminded me of how awesome the film is. Highly recommended. Ten out of ten.
