This is one of the few films with a stunning acting game, a great storyline worth watching. It is about changes in life. It is about how happiness can be found when a person is true to himself. It's about accepting yourself and others. This is about life issues. It is about reaching an agreement with reality. It's about courage. It is about love. Both actresses are very true to their role. The actresses had very good chemistry among themselves in the film. This is the key to the film that made the film. Itâ€™s rare to see an independent film like this. One could say about the hard work that the film crew had to do when creating this film. I want to see more movies from this producer / writer. Watch a movie you enjoy.
