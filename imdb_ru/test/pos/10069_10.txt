I love this film!! Of course, I love it because of Madonna, but who cares is damn funny !!! * ALANiS Rocks *. When I first saw this movie in cinemas in 1987, I thought it was all fun! Madonna is so funny, and I like her duplicate accent and wacky / catchy look. The funniest time is when Madonna (Nikki) screams at the man who is going to get into a taxi. And also when Griffin Dunn (Lowden) stumbles and falls on the site of the apartment interview. ** Alanis Rocks **. Madonna's character Nikki steals / buys in the store and deceives people throughout the film - her funny tricks are enough to keep you on the floor all the time. “Nothing robbed when you rob a store, you put a cashier. We hacked a few tapes, there is some difference. "I love it !!! This is a classic. *** Alanis Rocks ***. I do not know why this film was as successful. I do not see anything wrong with this - of course, if you are a big fan of Madonna, then everything she does is simply amazing. Anyone who wants to see fun classic fun, and then see "Who is this girl?" And another very important fact that all people should know about, or at least everything that exists, ALANiS will always “rock you” to the end! Like Madonna in this film, and only entirely! Her game is great!
