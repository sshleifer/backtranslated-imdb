This is how I would sum up! There were others who said that Naked Gun meets James Bond. I think my more accurate, but I am not neutral in this matter ...; o) <br /> <br /> This film is a kind of explosion from the past. It reminds you of old films (from the 50s and 60s), and this is not only because it is played at that time period (more precisely, 1955, except for Memoirs), but this is the mood in which the film is made it shows on the screen! The main actor here (who, I was told, is very popular in his homeland in France), is perfect in his role here. He is a spy with the number 117 attached to him. There is one character who sums up his film, asking if he is good or not ... you will see when you watch the movie! <br /> <br /> This is really funny, and if you like your spies, mixed with comedy with old-fashioned talent, but not related to yourself or anything else in this regard seriously, than you need to watch! : ABOUT)
