"Witchery" is a decent little terrible Euro-Trash yarn! David Hasselhoff in this movie is pretty darn funny and, unfortunately, he is one of the best actors. Linda Blair is terrible and the lady who plays Hoff's wife ... she is very bad! The plot of this film is also funny. He has some holes that you can't help but notice, but they are still interesting. <br /> <br /> The blood in the "Witchery" is incredible. I liked the part where the old bag is “sucked in” into the gutter and gets into the frying tube! And the part where the devil's lady “uses” was damn worrisome. I would say that it is just necessary for the hounds. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a reproducible, well-played film, look elsewhere. But if you like old-fashioned Italian scumbag and blood over it, “Witchery” is on your shelf. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised at the low rating here! What did you expect from Exorcist? 7 out of 10, children.
