I feel the heat Niiiiiight! I feel your HEEAAAAAAAAAART rhythm! Something is wrong! The song-theme written by BJ Cook from The Lark is an old band and David Foster's wife. She also wrote a memorable topic from CBS Airwaves. Oh, the heat of the night! Which programm! Well written, well played and completely classic. Criminals and a good team and a bit of humor at the end. I would like to think that this is exactly what detectives do / did. Jambone was a real favorite! From the Canadian Council, I recognized EVERY Canadian actor's name and style from guest seats, filmed on Night Heat. Everyone went through the Night Heat set and, like Law & Order, was based on a plot, so you could just watch and enjoy without a characterâ€™s special melodrama.
