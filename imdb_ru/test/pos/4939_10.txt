Bonjour, Monsieur Shlomi, just a wonderful movie! Scriptwriter / director Shemi Zarhin created a story that is not similar to any other, and created it with such consistently beautiful actors that it remains a mystery to me that this film did not become a favorite of the audience all over the world. It is intelligent, emotional, instructive and warm, interesting, and in all categories it is a winner. Shlomi (Oshri Cohen, in a brilliantly understated version) is a 16-year-old boy who cares for his extremely dysfunctional family: his mother (Esti Zackheim) is almost as disgusting as a shrew as ever thought up, and is in a constant foul mood for the fact that her husband cheated on her and because she was stuck working in two shifts to support his sick father-in-law (Ariek) Elias, who, like Shlomi's grandfather, is a bright, cheerful, wise, loving old man who deeply cares about Shlomi ); Ziva's married sister (Rotem Abuhab), who periodically returns to the house because of constant quarrels with her husband, who do not help her to take care of her little twin sons; his brother Sacy (Assi Cohen), whose life - loud electric guitars, Braggadosio about women's conquests and his mother's favorite son. Mix this mixture, and as a result you will get the penultimate dysfunctional family unit. Shlomi prepares exquisite dishes for them, makes purchases, cleans the house, performs errands, bathes and cares for this grandfather and generally leads a life of humility in the family, which considers him "backward." Shlomi longs for a girlfriend and practically fails at his school due to his lack of time devoted to taking care of his family and lack of concentration. By luck, his math teacher Begin (Nisso Keavia) notes his natural mathematical genius in the discarded test, and with the help of the school principal (Yigal Nair) they encourage him to get tested and find out that he is a genius (“with dyslexia”) and agree on , so he tried a special school in Haifa. Shlomi’s mother doesn’t hear anything about it, but between fights with absent Shlomi’s father (Albert Iluz) and confrontations with the teacher and the school principal, they finally agree to test him in school. Meanwhile, Shlomi discovers a girl of his age, Ron (Aya Koren), who moved in the next door, and gradually they intertwine in physical and intellectual relationships. Always in the background is the support of Shlomi’s grandfather, and when the grandfather dies, Shlomi goes on a journey to live his life for himself, to realize his gifts, to find his happiness. The way the family comes to grips with this is the pinnacle of the film, and it does not need to be revealed for the sake of losing the power of the message. The film is beautifully photographed, the musical score is creatively beautiful, and the end result is an elevation of the human spirit. Highly recommended at every level. In Hebrew with English subtitles.
