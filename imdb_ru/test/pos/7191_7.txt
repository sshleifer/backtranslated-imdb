In the original French version of the joke with Numérobis (a great funny voice - Jamel Debbrouze) is very funny. <br /> <br /> But in the translated versions (I saw the German and English versions) this is not half better than the original. <br /> <br /> But: goof Special Effects, an almost complete comic (with such differences as the picture of Lünix (German name)) is placed in another comic. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Asterix comics are iconic, but when you watch animated comics from 1968 to 1998, you’ll see much better jokes, a better story and the old “charm” and “talent” of iconic stories. <br /> <br /> For French-speaking people, I suggest watching it in its original version, with or without subtitles, where they are available in different languages.
