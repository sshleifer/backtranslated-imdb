although I liked this Western, I must say that this is not one of my favorite "John Ford Westerns". For me, what is missing in most of his other films (the ones that I saw anyway) is simply not enough, I am not sure that this is something. It is not something tangible. In any case, the essence of this story is the Mormon train, which is used by a group of criminals as a shelter from the pursuing squad. Ford hires a lot of its regulars here. There are some interesting characters, some beautiful landscapes, a bit of action and excitement. All this adds to the watchable experience. This, of course, is not boring. Just not quite according to the standard of John Ford. For me, Wagon Master 7/10
