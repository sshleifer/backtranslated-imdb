The plot in a nutshell - the Duchess (the voice of Eva Gabor) - well-polished single cat of three small kittens. When their owner, a rich elderly woman, known as Madame Adelaide, realizes that her time is up, she decides to write her will, leaving everything she has to her cats, which are then passed on to her butler Edgar when the cats pass. Edgar overhears this and is deeply offended by the idea that cats will get everything in front of him, and plans to destroy the Duchess and her kittens; One night he throws a sleeping pill into their dinner, and then leaves them in a French village. Because of their element, the Duchess and her kittens became friends with a smart street stray cat known as Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris voice, which made the voice of the big bear Ballou in the Jungle Book); making a pass in the Duchess, not knowing that she is a single mother, O'Malley decides to take them home, and the Duchess sincerely falls in love with O'Malley when the usual dependent surrogate family bond develops; chaos and chaos, culminating in a fierce clash between O'Malley, his brotherly cats from the streets and Edgar. The appearance of the British geese, the American South hound dogs (what they did in France, you can only guess) also appears, the mouse, which is very similar to the rabbit from “Alice in Wonderland” (in fact, he was voiced by the same guy who voiced Winnie the Pooh) and the horse. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a slow, but still nice Disney project. Shows an unforgettable musical play “Everyone wants to be a cat” performed by the late Scatman Krothers (better known to fans of the 1980s as the voice of jazz on transformers). Of course, if it was done now, it would probably be a grim social commentary on class division, represented by the gap between the well-bred and well-fed duchess and the street O'Malley.
