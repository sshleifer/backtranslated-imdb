This is where "Where's Dad", "Groove", "Putney Swap." This perpetuates the mentality of the city of New York of that period, an amazingly strange man with a bizarre plan, raised by his own petard and, finally, retreating to his foster parents' bed. Absolutely absurd, this is the life that everyone sees through magic glasses, seeing things as they really are ... I do not think it will ever be shown. If so, then surely Tivo will do it and release it. The kidnapping goes awry: mixed up during a rain storm, running up and running out or leaving the shop window, our hero throws a raincoat over his prey and throws it into his ice cream van driven by a bicycle, takes it to his basement apartment in the village. He is amazed, surprised and incredibly disappointed when wrappers are removed: instead of a juicy lady, he removes a medieval suburban housewife who talks, talks and talks. The film is full of vignettes from the life of residents of the suburban area, suburban life, city officials and all such respected relationships. This pushes the boundaries of comedy, for example, a magical reality can push the drama, just as Duffy Duck is able to draw on art scenes, demonstrating her plight or desires, and all this at the very edge of plausibility. All this with humor, no one is sneaky.
