Three children are born during a solar eclipse and turn into nasty suicidal little tics that everyone suspects, except Joyce (Lori Letin) and her younger brother Timmy. This is a story in a nutshell. The game is tolerable for the most part. Noteworthy for MTV-J is Julie Brown (not "Downtown"), showing a bit of skin, and a very early part (small) for Michael Dudikoff. The film is not too good for any imagination, but in the sub-genre of “Killer Children” it evokes a feeling of guilt. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Julie Brown shows T & A (so far the only film) to claim this honor); Sylvia Wright gets topless DVD Extras (R1): 16-minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg (where he insults the director and Canada, great stuff); Biography of Ed Hunt; and trailers for the film "Kiss Taratuli", "Do not open the door", and the shackle for "Homework" (with nude) <br /> <br /> My rating: B-
