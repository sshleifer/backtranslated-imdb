Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet have always been two of my favorite movie productions, and although Lynch’s past films have been a bit disappointing for me, they have always been worth watching a few times. to be pretentious, lynch can be like a good wine - you need to savor it and think it over. but in the end, you have to decide what you saw, because Lynch never gives you complete answers. <br /> <br /> Many people will come out of Mulholland Drive, perhaps wanting to strangle themselves. A mind-blowing visual puzzle that has just unfolded in front of them. but there is perverted logic in this movie, you just need to look for clues. Betty (Naomi Watts) arrives in Hollywood, with blue eyes and in search of fame. She then finds an amnestic in her bathroom, who escaped an attempt on mulhollandic driving. together they try to unlock the secrets of amnestics. All this leads to a club called silencio, where the blue box will show everything. and then the film throws everything out the window. people whom we thought we know are completely different people ... is this a dream? memory of previous life antics? You will love this film or hate it. David Lynch always causes such extreme reactions in his viewers. but since his universe itself is always in extreme conditions, it is entirely appropriate that his films provoke such reactions. <br /> <br /> It is better to look at this film thematically than on a direct narrative. and appreciate the fact that Lynch is a director who still allows you to draw your own conclusions. He recently had many imitators, especially in the “vanilla sky”, where a stunning film decides to give you all the answers in the last five minutes, and you will probably forget about this film as soon as you exit the movie. Mulholland Drive will haunt you.
