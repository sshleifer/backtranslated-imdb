I think this film has it all. He has really cool music that I can never get out of my head. He has cool characters. It is REALLY funny (you know, this is what you will entertain on earth, and you will repeat funny roles every day for three weeks). Despite the bad game, bad CGI and bad history (about the cops after the robot), this is really cool. This is one of those films that you and your whole family can watch, get together, eat pizza, laugh like crazy and watch it two more times. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny roles like when Kurt was trying to get Edison's attention, gave him a finger, and then threw a gun at him with a ball so that they could play the ball. In this part, I continued to say “Remember, remember?” To my cousins, who saw this and showed them what had happened. There was also a really fun part when Edision ran into the room, and Kurt was there (just before they fought), and Kurt talked about his “Strange Dream” and how he was “Superman.” I loved this part, although it’s been a long time since I saw it, so I don’t remember this part. Everything the actors said was funny, for example, as Kurt says: “I worship you as GOD!” To the robot. <br /> <br /> Although there were bad things, in general it was a BIG movie. Dude, I can't stop laughing. I wish I had this movie. );
