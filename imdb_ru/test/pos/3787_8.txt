SPOILERS BELOW <br /> <br /> "Dog's Life" deserves special mention due to its excellent time for comics. In another film of Charlie Chaplin of 1918 “Shoulder in Hands”, the genius of a silent film focuses on a completely different brand of humor. His military comedy specializes in surrealistic, exaggerated scenery, in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When a soldier’s bunker is flooded, the water level reaches the desired height so that Chaplin can fulfill his gags most successfully. In the later scene, the soldier dresses like a tree, a disguise that refutes the greatly increased ingenuity and stupidity of Chaplin. Naturally, when the enemy discovers his cunning, the soldier rushes straight into the forest. The subsequent pursuit is a visual miracle: Chaplin not only hides the soldier from the Germans, but also uses the forest to disguise the soldier from the audience, and also so that the disguised soldier stands unlocked in the middle of the frame, but somehow remains invisible. All this time we thought that our little hero was quickly attacking the German army; to our joy, a joke on us too. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
