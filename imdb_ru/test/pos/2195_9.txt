Stephen Sondheim's genius has never been as noticeable as it was in his 1979 Music Thriller SWEENEY TODD, a gothic, dark, terrible, but delightful musical composition about a crazy barber who returns to London to get revenge on an evil judge who is not only forever banished him from London, but also raises his daughter as his own and plans to marry her in order to "protect her from all the evils of the world." The barber finds love, sympathy and help from the lonely pie-maker, who has his own agenda, where Todd is concerned. This musical shook Broadway and received nine Tony awards, including “Best Musical” and “Best Actress in a Musical” (Angela Lansbury). The production was completely filmed in 1982, when Angela Lansbury re-created her role on Broadway as Mrs. Lovett, the owner of a pastry shop, which finds practical use for the heads from which Todd makes ground beef. George Hearn, who replaced Lena Kariu on Broadway, is electrified in the lead role, so much so that you have to wonder why he was not originally played in that role. Lansbury and Hearn enthusiastically rivet from beginning to end and give 100% to their vile characters, which is facilitated by Sondaim’s first-class assessment, perhaps the closest thing Sondheim wrote to the opera. Lansbury shines in "Worst Pies in London" and "By the Sea". George Hearn stops the show with "Baptism" and is also irresistible during the "Beauties", a duet that he sings with Judge Turpin, a man whom he swore to take revenge. Chris Gröndahl is vocally impressive as Anthony, a young sailboat who saves Todd and falls in love with his daughter Joanna. Betsy Jozelin is a little higher than Joanna, and really pushes her to lose her voice for a few minutes during "Green Funch and Linnet Bird". The rest of the cast is first-class, especially Edmund Lindek as Judge Turpin, who plays "Johanna" in this performance, cut from the original production, and Ken Jennings as Toby, whose gorgeous tenor fills the audience in "It's Not Me" I'm around . "But this is an exciting musical accompaniment by Steven Sondheim and a fascinating performance by Lansbury, especially George Hearn, which makes this evening of the Gothic musical theater an unforgettable event that will remain with you long after the call. Not for every taste, but if you play and you have a strong heart, SWEENEY TODD is a joy for all lovers of musical theater and a must for fans of Stephen Sondheim and Angela Lansbury.
