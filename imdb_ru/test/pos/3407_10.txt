The story of love and hate, tragedy and happiness, and, most importantly, friendship began in a very interesting time of the US civil war. <br /> <br /> You are interested in history, emotionally engages and makes you frantically waiting for the next episode. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the casting was great. Many superstars appear in short cameos, starring in a variety of talented memes - here mention should be made of Kirstie Alley and Terry Garber - this is simply an excellent example for television production, as it should be. <br /> Don't forget the pure charm of Wendy Kilborn, depicting Constance :-)
