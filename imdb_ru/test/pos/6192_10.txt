The problem with this series is that it is too real. I look at Amazon Unbox and, having just finished Series 2, I hate, I absolutely hate Fark, the cell leader. I can’t remember a single television series that has ever had such an emotional impact. Remember the old horror movie label "Just keep telling yourself it's just a movie"? Well, I constantly repeat that this is “only TV”. But, of course, this is not just television, is it? The likelihood that the cell depicted here really works in the United States is certainly within the limits of credibility. This is what gives this program malicious authenticity. And that is why I hate it so much.
