I liked this movie when I first saw it. It describes in detail what the leaders working in the news industry will do just to take the story off the air: especially Jane Craig, who is hurrying Kenny to finish editing, to remove it, and then Joan Cusack struggles , and William Hurt, who, according to Jane, commits an incredible violation of ethics, falsifies his tears during an interview on date rape - a flaw pointed to by Aaron. Another important point is that Tom uses Jane for his own benefit, and then turns around and sleeps with Jennifer. The script is brilliant, and the direction is almost as good. All three main actors played their heroes perfectly, especially Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks, who is the funniest in the film. William Hurt is also very good. It deserved at least three Oscars, best actress (holly hunter), best supporting actor (Albert Brooks) and best picture. I liked the last parts of the film, where they show a reunion 7 years later. <br /> <br /> 8/10
