I really loved this movie as a kid. I can't find it anywhere! I mentioned this to some friends the other day, and none of them remembered it! Can someone help me? My older sister vaguely remembers this. There was another movie that I remember, which was half live and half animation, but I can't remember its name. The characters were animated, and the background was real ... I think I remember that it was about kangaroos, and I think the scene of the film was in Australia. I'm losing my mind trying to get copies of these films, which were such a memorable part of my very pleasant childhood. Edit: I searched IMDb for this other movie and found it called Dot and the Kangaroo! All I had to do was type "kangaroo" in the search bar under the characters, and the name of the movie in the list looked like a buzzing call! MAN, I love IMDb! Thank!
