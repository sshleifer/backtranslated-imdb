At first glance, this camera's camera angles immediately make you think that this is a low-budget film that will tire you to tears or force you to press the stop button. Surprisingly, the storyline comes forward and reproduces through the screen as it seems to me most relevant to this. I starred in this film at 7, but, like most of the others, I felt that it should be 10, you will understand how you watch it, because the film rarely meets people, and how life should be shown on TV. set. Most films try to leave you in awe of their special effects, turns, etc. This film, made with a real hand, showed a good film, backed up by an Alabama-style storyline, which, according to most, would be a waste of a couple of hours. It is a pity that I put the popcorn after all is well done!
