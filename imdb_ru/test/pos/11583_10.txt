THE SEA INSIDE (2004) **** Javier Bardem, Belen Rueda, Lola Duenas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Joan Dalmau, Alberto Jimenez, Tamar Novas, Francesc Garrido, Jose Maria Pou, Alberto Amarrilla, Nicolas Fernandes Lu. (Deer): Alejandro Amenabar) <br /> <br /> Inspiring story of living death; Bardem is magnificent. <br /> <br /> The true life account of Spanish quadriple player Ramón Sampedro and his petition to fulfill his desire for euthanasia with the right to death cannot be considered a likely source of inspiration, but this film is just that. <br /> <br /> Sampedro (superbly played by Bardem) was an energetic, energetic young man when he lost his function on his limbs after a tragic diving accident (terribly told in memories with an intuitive impulse to feelings) and for almost thirty years paralyzed lay in bed, while his loving family took care of all his needs. Although his movement abilities were nil, his mind was very active and proved himself as an inventor, poet, writer and artist who occupied his mind until he could no longer tolerate the idea of ​​living longer in his short stature. . <br /> <br /> Enter into a beautiful, but also suffering from a horrendous illness, lawyer Julia (ethereal Rueda, who blends in beautifully with Bardem, as if they really are kindred souls) are hired to see Sampedro’s last death, and , in turn, becomes an assistant camp when he begins to open to her like no other. Not so much time has passed, and Julia begins to investigate the past of her ward, finding many letters hidden by his family. When Julia encounters Ramon, he does not want to discuss anything with her at first, but finally agrees with her that this can help his cause, and the project becomes a book in the making. memoirs / biographies in the form of freestyle poetry and prose. <br /> <br /> The film is a heart-rending story about the human spirit and how love ultimately overcomes heart pain in many forms, including Ramon — an incredible love that he shares with a complete stranger named Rosa (Duenas), a single mother, who once sees him on TV, inspiring her to ride a bicycle to his remote farm house in Spain to get to know him and perhaps change her mind about her life. <br /> <br /> Directed by Amenabar, who co-authored with Mateo Gil A fascinating script that allows you to bring some imagination to the mix when Ramon imagines that he magically leaves his bed and flies over the bucolic landscapes to the possible sea, where he survived so many years ago the cruel twist of fate that imprisoned him for three decades. The film is not full dull with cunning wit and sometimes humorous tone that does not soften the impact of the final act of the story. The prestige of James and Joe Allen's remarkable make-up work also does a tremendous job of turning bright Bardem into an aging man to the full effect that should give them the Acadamy Award. <br /> <br /> Bardem and Rueda deserve an Oscar nomination as two people who have so much in common, and despite the fact that Julia Rueda is married to a loving, adoring husband, that a couple of people who are so created for each other friend, it is completely impossible they were never together from the start. This is just one of the atrocities that rings true, but this is not the definition of the film as a whole; This is a must see and one of the best in the year.
