There are many people who make these 80s films, but these people may not have come of age at this time. When this film was released, I was just starting to go to college, so I really could appreciate it at the time, and my friends and I will still joke around from time to time about certain lines in the film. No matter how much I like the character of Sean Penn Jeff Spicoli in “Fast Times”, I actually love Chris Penn “Tommy” more because he is a lead character with a lot of real performances and not with a single liner series, such like with spicoli. Chris Penn probably needs to insert this film in his VCR and use it for motivation to lose weight. Yes, the subplot involving Randy Quaid, a veterinarian from Vietnam, seems a bit out of place, but he does a convincing job in this role. If there is someone who has not seen this film, but loved other films of this type, such as “Fast Times”, etc., I highly recommend it.
