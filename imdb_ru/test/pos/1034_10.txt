I can not remember the series, I believe that it could be “American masters”, but it was broadcast on PBS in 1980. Most people have some knowledge about the development of the bomb "A", and those who have little or not, probably think that this is a rather dry subject. Anyone who watched this series of 7 parts, does not think so. You will learn about the tumult in the Oppenhemer mind and how development has changed his life forever. You understand what a tragic figure he has become and why. With 7 episodes, you will get to know the main players, as well as intrigue and backstabs. I contacted PBS about being able to get a video or DVD, but never received a response. Sorry, I would like to see it again.
