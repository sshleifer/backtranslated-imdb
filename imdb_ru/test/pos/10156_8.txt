If there is one good intense film, this is one of them. James Stewart plays a great performance as an American doctor, Ben McKenna, who is on tour in Africa with his wife and son. They stumble at the scene of the murder, and Dr. McKenna’s son is kidnapped a few hours later. <br /> <br /> Before you can say, “fasten your seat belts,” Dr. McKenna finds out too much about the attempt and tries to stop it. However, other people know that it can be dangerous (that is, dangerous for them), and try to get rid of it. <br /> <br /> In the end, Hank, the son, is found alive and well. <br /> <br /> If you like tense movies, this is something to watch. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10.
