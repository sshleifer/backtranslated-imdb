"Joe" is one of those films where, although you think that everything can go smoothly, in the end you end up like you ... I can't think of an analogy. He showed that not only in America was the long-standing idea of ​​unity a controversial issue, but also various aspects in our society. Melissa Compton (Susan Sarandon) is a first-class child of flowers, and her father Bill (Dennis Patrick) is the executive head. One day, Bill accidentally killed Melissa's boyfriend. Right after that, Bill meets Joe Curran (Peter Boyle), an ultra-right, insanely racist worker. As a result, they are both more and more associated with hippies, whom Bill considers unpleasant, and Joe frankly hates. But in the end, everything has deadly consequences. <br /> <br /> Yes, some parts of the film are a little outdated, but this is a good comparison of the two sides of America during the Vietnam War. And rest assured, the residual effects of everything that probably never disappears.
