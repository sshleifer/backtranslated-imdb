Awesome action movie I've ever seen. This was the first expression I said after watching twice on local television in my country, Indonesia. The combination between constant shooting and excellent combat choreography was well played by David Bradley. He was good here, except for the "American Samurai." His mastery in martial art was above average. He managed to make the battle scenes enjoyable to watch. Not just punching and kicking, like what most martial arts masters show in their films. David Bradley could use all the techniques of martial arts, such as throws, punches and kicks. Highly recommended for fans of action. I tried to find the DVD, but still can not get it, especially in my city. Can anybody help me?
