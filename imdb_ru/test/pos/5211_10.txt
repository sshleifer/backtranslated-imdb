For the main criticism of the film ... Love Story: It was not a love story. These were two distraught people gathered together, trying to find humanity in ANY. The same thing happened to the soldiers and the Russian boy. It added a feminine touch, but let's look at American films ... no, close to a love story. There was no plot: does war have a plot? I think this is stupid criticism. The plot line is as follows. They start with 400 people, and the film narrows down to show the lives of about 10 people and how each of them contributed and died. Death is the ultimate end of any story. The fact that there was no happy ending does not mean that there is no plot in it. <br /> <br /> This movie was a terrible truth. I would not call it "anti-war." Of course, it was a political statement, but the film was not only about politics. In fact, except for a few cases, when the captain? revealed, there was never a suffocating air of Nazi Germany. They were far enough away from the reach of the main Nazi party. Fat cats were not going to go to Russia! <br /> <br /> It may not be an exact and not a Hollywood hit, but it demonstrates the excellent knowledge of a simple soldier (I would say almost any nationality and war) and that they must go through. It was a lost battle, of course, the film will be depressing. And to the one who said that it was bold (and stupid) even to portray the Germans as victims: in every war there are victims on all sides (any real soldier will tell you this). <br /> <br /> This film is the perfect balance between a film and a documentary. A few problems with this, when arguing for only one, but he instills the best of both worlds. See as such. However, be careful, because it is a heavy film, if not graphically, emotionally to watch. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m waiting until they make a film about Iraq. He will probably have many identical topics and will be very controversial, I want to see who has the courage to do this first. (Jarhead doesn't count)
