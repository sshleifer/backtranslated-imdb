So you want to be a rock star? Watch this movie. You do not like rock, you say? Or are you really in heavy metal? Then put your favorite album and dream about yourself, thereâ€™s nothing to offer in this movie. Rarely have I ever seen a film capable of depicting a dream of being in a rock band as good as this one. I had long hair in the late 1980s and early nineties, and I have been playing guitar for the last 15 years or so. I liked the rock star? Oh yeah. The music is good, not great, the actors are good and believable, even Jennifer Aniston plays her part in perfection. And Mark Wahlberg is great as a rock singer. So you know what you are going to get. The film is about how dreams come true, they are attacked and finally find out what life really is. This is a good solid seven out of ten, no more, no less.
