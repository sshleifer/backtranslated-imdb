What's not to like there? <br /> <br /> Tonight I caught it again and was surprised at how Hugh Bonneville captured the essence of Philip Larkin without resorting to ticks and caricatures. <br /> <br /> There are many layers depicting the complexity of the main character and Hugh brings them to life. His brave mother, his unresolved problems with his father and his inability to indulge in one woman. <br /> <br /> His poetry is intertwined everywhere, and some scenes come across in his story about them to his girlfriendâ€™s wife, which he later offers, but quite by accident, almost innocently. It is not difficult to understand what its attractiveness is to many women who fell in love with him (and knew about each other, loaded up and continued to see him!) It is always more than it looks, women go beyond their balding, deafness and myopia. And the wonderful nuance of Eileen Atkins in the role of his mother is an added bonus. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
