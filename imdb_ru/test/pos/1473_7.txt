I must say that this film is definitely one of the best trash bin movies - I would feel a little deceived if I paid £ 15 for it, but for about £ 1.50 I felt I definitely got more than my money's worth. <br /> <br /> The film cannot decide whether it wants to be "Mad Max" or one of Clint Eastwood's "nameless" spaghetti westerns, and therefore it is full of both cliches. Even a crazy psycho who hangs out with the bad guys in Mad Max is there. <br /> <br /> This guy from Blade Runner also copes with good billing, although he only appears at the beginning and end of the movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite moment is for me to strike from above at an oil refinery - if you look closely, you can see how the “post-apocalyptic” movement at rush hour passes away. when the two main characters knock out seven bells from each other. <br /> <br /> Beat in a few lagers, a few pizzas, sit back and enjoy what eventually becomes an easy, but interesting exercise.
