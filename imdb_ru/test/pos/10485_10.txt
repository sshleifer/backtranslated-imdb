This silent and unassuming Danish film is flawlessly directorial, written, performed and filmed is an example of cinema at its best, and if there is a person who can watch PIE BABET without touching it on a very fundamental level, this is a person whom I do not care know. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple. In the 1800s, two elderly girls (Birgitte Federshpil and Bodil Kjr) live in remote Jutland, where they sacrificed their lives, romantic opportunities and personal happiness to continue the religious ministry of their long-dead father for the small flock he served, One of young female fans send them Frenchwoman Babette (Stefan Odran), whose husband and son were killed in France and who left their homeland so that she would not suffer the same fate. Although they do not really need her services, her sisters attract her as a servant and cook - and over the years her mind and tireless efforts on their behalf allow the aging community to stay together, and her sisters to live more comfortably than they were. imagined; indeed, the whole village admires it and depends on it. <br /> <br /> One day, however, Babette received a letter: she won the lottery and now, by village standards, is a rich woman. Knowing that her new wealth would mean her return to France, the sisters fulfilled her wish so that she would be allowed to prepare truly French food for them and the members of their tiny congregation. The food and the evening she serves is a truly unforgettable night, but not for the reasons that one would expect, because Babetteâ€™s feast turns out to be food for the body and soul and, ultimately, is her gift of love to women who she accepted and the villagers who were so kind to her. <br /> <br /> The film is unusual in all respects, meticulous in detail, but not too strong in their presentation. As the film progresses, we begin to love the heroes for both their simple devotion to God and their too human weaknesses, as well as scenes in which Babette prepares her feast and in which they eat food, powerful, beautiful and incredibly incredible. memorable. There have been several films in which food was used as a metaphor for love, but none of them fit the simple artistry and beauty of Babette's Feast, which reminds us of all the good things about humanity and proves food for body and soul. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer
