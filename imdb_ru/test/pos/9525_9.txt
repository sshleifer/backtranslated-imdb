“Railway Children”, at least, this version of the 1970 film, written and filmed by this long-time British character by actor Lionel Jeffreys, is a real ... classic. It tells a children's story with great simplicity and charm; sentiment is muffled; evokes memories of children's adventures; and Jeffreys adds mind and style to his production. <br /> <br /> The Waterbury family leads an idyllic life in Edwardian London. The father is prosperous, the mother is beautiful and loving, the children are educated and affectionate, in their home is warm and cozy. Then one night, during the Christmas holidays, two men appear at the door, talk quietly with their father, and then take him away. In an instant, Mrs. Waterbury (Dina Sheridan) and Bobby, 14 years old (Jenny Agutter), Phyllis, 12 years old (Sally Tomsett), and young Peter (Gary Warren), have changed. Only their fortitude and good mood will see them to the end. Now, in poverty, Mrs. Waterbury takes her children to an old musty brick house in the countryside near the railroad, not far from a small village with a train station. Children discover the rail and regularly sit on a small hill to wave to passengers when the train drives past. Once an old gentleman, going on business to the city, looks up from his newspaper and discovers that he is waving back. Soon he will play an important role in history. <br /> <br /> In time, Mrs. Waterbury transfers all her love and mind to her children. She starts writing stories to make money. She teaches them lessons and provides them with warmth and safety. The story, however, is about these three children, especially Bobby. At age 14, she is old enough to want to share her mother’s concerns, and at the same time young enough to enjoy the adventures she has with her sister and brother. At the station they find a poor man who does not speak English. They discover that he is a Russian refugee who no longer knows where his wife and child are. They insist that he should come home with them, and their mother takes them. Soon the children wrote a big sign to the old gentlemen on the train asking for help. They help a young man participating in an obstacle race that breaks his leg in the train tunnel. Soon he is recovering at home. They decided to have a birthday party for the station manager’s birthday, a man with several friends and several children who stand up for their dignity. Soon the children help him realize the difference between friendship and charity. In other words, three children face all sorts of problems in their childhood adventures and can play an important role in ensuring that all problems have a happy ending. <br /> <br /> But what are your own problems? Finally, Bobby learns from his mother that her father was taken away because he was accused of treason, in transferring state secrets to Russians. Can Bobby find a way to help? Will an old gentleman be anything more than just an old gentleman in a passing train? Will their father's case be re-opened? Will there be a happy ending? <br /> <br /> Jenny Agutter was almost 18 years old when she cast her part; She plays 14-year-old Bobby with great naturalness and charm. No matter how important other players are, especially Dina Sheridan, as a mother, Agutter is the heart of the story. For me, Jenny Agutter's talent, Lionel Jeffreys style and restraint make this film so memorable. Problems of history do not cause serious doubts, but they will be solved. And Jeffries does not just give us a masterfully adapted and directed film, he adds touches that are barely noticed, but that fascinate us. This may include only a fraction of a second freeze frame when two people are talking; or a slow, large yellow yellow wildflower in the grass near Bobby’s house, and then a slow pullback from the yellow oil lamp looking inward; or the realization that a delightful interior shot, or a view of the green countryside, or a view of the railway station from the hill ... all suddenly remember these charming Edwardian, hand-drawn drawings of the perfect past. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this gentle story cannot be compared with the time in which children need to improve their Nintendo skills. I am pretty sure that this will never attract the attention of most of their parents, especially those who are excommunicated from Batman and Leone. Nevertheless, it is a beautifully composed film, and it should not be forgotten. In addition, 19 years later, the story was retold as a television program. This time Jenny Agutter played a mother.
