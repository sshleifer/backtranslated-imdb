- The best bit: when a boring thug (Nicholas Turturro) calls out to the fugitive (Matthew Modine) "Shane! ... Come back Shane!" and when the elder sage asks him: “What are you doing?!” he simply repeats “Enjoying my time!” In fact, as I am at the moment! <br /> <br /> - The most terrible part: I always wanted to see: where have I seen this girl before? where where Until I found out during the closing of the captions .. Oh, my God! She (Elizabeth Berkeley). From the fiasco show girls! But I just could not recognize her in clothes! Honestly, I felt a brief shiver. She is very cute and sweet, but maybe in Hollywood there was no mercy at all! <br /> <br /> The most sexual: when (Berkeley) says: “Do you mean the material that gives you a slip ?!”. <br /> <br /> - The most boring thing: a backward assistant after the day and night in the back of the car is still alive and well at the end !! In addition, the Mexican smuggler took 3 bullets (on the same car!) and he also did not die !! <br /> <br /> - The ugliest thing: all those dead people, as well as numerous (F) parishes in a boring degree! <br /> <br /> - The most beautiful thing: a crazy smart script with all the funny characters and noisy situations, the acting looked cute also especially from (Paul Rodriguez) who stole the show for (since he had the best Dialogue too!) . <br /> <br /> - The most disappointing: Despite the fact that the leadership did not affect the wit of the story, but at the same time it did not give it a unique, incomparable signature, some kind of madness Fun, as in the story itself. However, perhaps low production made a mistake! And, of course, light tasteless music, which may be the same due to cheap production! <br /> <br /> - The most convoluted part: (Matthew Modine) is a talented guy, but what did he do precisely to be on the Hollywood "A" of stars? What could be what he did (or did not do!) To complete in a light independent joke, such as (Shipping)? !! <br /> <br /> - The most missing scene: Where (José) has the Mexican smuggler finally gone ?! I thought we would see him again at the end, again smuggling as a surviving little criminal who, in such a brief trick as this, could materialize a continuous breakdown of such a world. <br /> <br /> - The biggest question that I had after the end: when will we see (“Shipment - 2”)? Since I so want to see again this beautiful little humorous atmosphere! <br /> <br /> These were my own answers. If you want to give your answers to this questionnaire, please email me.
