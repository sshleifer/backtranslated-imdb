Ignore the bad reviews here, this movie is awesome! “Just Before Dawn” is a great example of what can be done in a movie with a minimal budget, if you have a dedicated team, a decent script and a great idea for a movie. It's damn fun. <br /> <br /> I liked it a lot more than most other slashers of the 80s, because the killer is so unique. "Wrong twist" tore this film from something fierce! There's a lot of blood and scares. My girlfriend was shocked, she looks at me almost everything and does not flinch. In this there is such an eeriness. <br /> <br /> I would say that "Just Before Dawn" is the best slasher of the early 80s. I really liked it. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 children.
