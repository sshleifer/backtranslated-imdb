A pair of cow heads helps the Mormon group cross some stern country on the way to a new settlement. This discreet western is unusual for Ford because there are no big stars in it. Johnson gets top billing, but his role is mostly subsidiary, although he and Carey work well together. Dru give little to do, except how to ensure love interest. The best performance is given by the beloved Ford Bond, playing the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him get a major role in the long-running western “Wagon” before his untimely death at the age of 57 years. Thanks to the excellent cinema, Ford considered this one of his favorite films.
