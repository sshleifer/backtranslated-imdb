I have not seen "hardware wars" for many years, but I remember it as one of the most fun events of human experience, and it ended too soon. Every aspect of this movie was fun, and it was even better than Star Wars. I was laughing. I cried. After seeing him, I asked a family member for three dollars so that I could kiss him goodbye (just kidding about the latter). I love it when assistant / co-pilot Ham Salad tries to eat cinnamon rolls from Princess Anna Droid, and the character Darf Nader is just jolly! This film would be great to watch side by side with “Thumb Wars”, and I sincerely wish that there could be “Hardware Wars, Episode II: The Umpire Strikes Out”. (Was here?)
