A review that I put off for too long ... <br /> <br /> Roughly speaking, the year 2001 is one of the best science fiction films to date, if not the best. Stanley Kubrick was a film director genius, and this is one of his best works. And although many people misunderstand him and, accordingly, underestimate him, he is considered one of the best films of all time, and I have to agree. Back in 1968, no one did anything like this before, and since then no one has done it. Then it was a miracle breakthrough in the field of special effects, and seeing how these effects survive today, it is not surprising why. The film still looks amazing after almost forty years! Take note of CGI people. Using large miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. This aspect alone, almost alone, created a chilling cosmic atmosphere, which is also attributed to music and realistic sound effects. I can’t think of another movie where you can’t do anything in space here, as it really is. Not only is the lack of sound effects in space realistic, it is used as a tool to create a mood and works flawlessly. <br /> <br /> In addition to the brilliant display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors that play a role in creating the sensation of the film. Playing classical music complements what the eyes see, and makes you feel the significance of a man’s journey through his evolution from a monkey to a space traveler. <br /> <br /> History that seems simple, deep. Consistently, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and mainly cause certain events that are integral to the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What are they doing? These are all questions that are asked of themselves, watching the development of history, and asking to find their own way. Although most of them come to a common notion of what happened in history, each person must decide what this means for them. Any way to resolve this issue leads to deep solutions. It does not completely depend on the interpretation, but in some aspects it is. Try this for more clarification. The end result is pretty daunting, regardless of your personal decision. <br /> <br /> Although it is a long film and sometimes it slows down, it must be accurate in order to portray the journey of a person. This is not a subject that would be well shown in a short film at a faster pace. Those with short intervals of attention should not apply. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, the epitome of the merciless antagonist HAL 9000, a computer. Never had a car such a frightening screen. Which reminds me that for a film with such deep ambitions and performance, there is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius. <br /> <br /> In general, one of the best films to date and one of the best science fiction films. Personal Favorite. Everyone should watch this movie at least once. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
