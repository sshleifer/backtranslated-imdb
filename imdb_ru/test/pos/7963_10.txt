How often do we live a romantic life, like on a big screen, with hot affairs and passionate meetings? Almost never, if I consider what I consider to be a normal life around me. Romances, as already mentioned, are unlikely to ever be monstrous deeds that leave you on top of the world or beaten in bruises. <br /> <br /> Romance is in everyday life millions of times around the world. the world is a slow, delicate and quiet affair. Something that grows in you is very slow, perhaps even if you don’t notice that it slowly captures your being. No one can tell me when I'm in love. For if someone believed, I would not believe him, because no one but me would know. And even then, it’s just a feeling, a certain knowledge, that you feel this sublime emotion. That you want only the best for someone that you never want to see how they suffer from a minute of sadness. That you are willing to accept a greater degree of pain for them. I would not go so far as to say that I’m ready to die for a loved one, because we are all human, and we don’t know what we can do in the face of death until this moment has come. <br /> <br /> Is the love between the main characters of the film, so thin and restrained, no less noble than the love between Romeo and Juliet? Unidentified emotions, unspoken feelings convey much more than any repeated cries of "I love you." The restraint shown by the lead actor, shown so keenly on stage, where he watches his love love through the cafe window, but at the same time he never moved to declare himself, was just heartbreaking to watch. Will most of us be selfless enough to remain hidden, knowing that her emotions and feelings cannot be mutual? <br /> <br /> On the other hand, how will I deal with my own certain death? Although I can say that I am seriously ill, I cannot honestly say that I was ever close to death. Will I be so calm, I will put all my affairs in order and leave instructions to others to do what I leave behind? I suspect that I will be calm, because I will not have much choice in this matter. Can I be so selfless? Again, the answer must be negative. I can empathize with suffering, knowing that your life has been lost, that fate has dealt you a mortal blow, and that future events, no matter how little they are left, are no longer under your control. <br /> <br /> Life is nothing more than a series of small events, the culmination of which may seem great to some in retrospect. But only very rarely.
