“Kid” is a really good family film about the stifling image consultant Rass Durits, who has a lot of money, good work, a good home, etc. The only problem is that he doesn't have as much social life as he likes because he is not always very nice. Once, when everything changes, when its eight-year version will magically appear. This gives Russ a second chance to get it right. Bruce Willis plays a leading role here, and he gives really good results. The kid is a good, spiritual film for everyone.
