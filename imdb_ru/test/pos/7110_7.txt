Collection of All-Monster in the final film of the world famous cycle of classic horror Universal. Count Dracula (an energetic, dapper John Carradine), who calls himself Baron Latos, comes to Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens) asking him to recover from his illness. Naturally, this is just a ploy. Then, by coincidence, Larry Talbot (Lon Cheney), who is also the Wolfman, appears, and, of course, he * really * wants to be cured. <br /> <br /> As others have noted, monsters do not. get equal screen time. The Frankenstein Monster (Glenn Strange) is added at the end only to include all Universal Monsters. The footage and music library are also used here. The film spends, perhaps, too much time with a part of the story of Dracula, although Carradine demonstrates an impressive, tasteless performance as a count. The film is mainly a showcase for Stevens, who runs through his own tragic character trait and does an excellent job with his work. Women are gorgeous, and I must say that I loved Jane Adams as a glowing nurse - who turns out to be a hunchback. <br /> <br /> Of course, this would not be complete without the inclusion of angry villagers. <br /> <br /> Competently, professionally made chiller, for my taste, not at all scary, but interesting. In general, this is a respectable series. <br /> <br /> 7/10
