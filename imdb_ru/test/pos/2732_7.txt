SPOILERS AHEAD 15 / PARK AVENUE: “My humble look at this film” <br /> <br /> Now for the movie viewer, which has as limited a taste as mine, are niche films, such like 15 Park Avenue, must be acceptable to my senses. With this thought and a slight sense of embarrassment, that I did not watch the entire movie before, I watched this movie last Saturday. There are some initial similarities with other works, such as the legendary Mulholland Drive (David Lynch), from which this film borrows at least 3 concepts: - <br /> <br /> a) What (at least some) truths are relative b) The first scene, in which Shabana and Konkonam ride in the car during the initial credits, is strikingly similar to the trip by car that Betty and Rita made to Mulholland Drive. In both cases, the object of the investigation is the place, which is probably mythical in both cases and, possibly, more openly symbolic in the Aparna film. C) The incident, which revolves around a mad, impoverished woman, is again extremely reminiscent of the whole “case behind Winky”. involving the ass, but while this scary creature is the embodiment of something and that it is “something” and also the character as such is inextricably linked to other works of Lynch (pay attention to disheveled long hair), the effect of a poor woman 15 PA seems like a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message. <br /> <br /> Other films, of which 15 PA also borrows, are Blow Up (especially the last scene is a throw back to True perceived as true , put closer to the end of Antonioni's masterpiece). Of course, the professor and the schizophrenic also suggest the idea of ​​"Beautiful mind." Although, admittedly, the subject here is the high eyebrow physics, and Shaban, who professes it, inadvertently ends up becoming the brilliant opposite of Concona's illusory hallucinations through those very prophecies. In an outstanding scene in the film, some of these elements are superimposed on each other, and this scene comes off back and forth from the “real” world of Shaban, where Quantum Physics and Theory of Relativity justify the finality and composition of the universe, to the artificial structure of the “believers” world of Mitha. But despite all their differences, the sisters are also alike. Both are unable to form lasting relationships — one of choice, and the other outside of nature. So, Mitha’s pain is that Joydip rejected her in love is in harmony with Shaban’s inability to create a special relationship with Kunal (Dritiman) or Sanjeev (Kanvalgiit). But I am running ahead. The audience, as a rule, watches this film in one of the following two ways: - Hypothesis 1: <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 1: “It was Shabana all the time.” There is a certain part of the audience that thinks so. But this explanation is not only too far-fetched, but also invented, since it would mean that she also comes up with so many other characters (that is, all those characters she visualized as visualizing Mithi with her) <br /> <br / > Hypothesis 2: “THERE WAS A REAL Mitya, and the ending is a metaphor.” This film says that the essence of the film is summarized in a single dialogue of the film, when, in response to the statement by Joy (Rahul Bose), Mitya is looking for something that she will never find, his wife Lakshmi (Shefali Shah) philosophizes that we are all really looking for this ghostly utopia, the end of the rainbow, in which there seems to be a mirage of happiness and satisfaction. <br /> <br /> There are other more insignificant possibilities that have not been so widely accepted by our well-informed audience, such as: - <br / > <br /> Hypothesis 3: “Shaban and Concon are the alter ego of the same person” Hypothesis 4: “Shabana is also the fruit of Imagination of Mitya.” Hypothesis 5: “An old, emaciated, possibly insane, beggar woman is a true hero of this story. <br /> <br /> Is it worth testing these hypotheses? Well, your assumptions are as good as mine <br /> <br /> "Why is 15 Park Avenue?" Contrary to popular belief, what she thought about Park Avenue in New York, I think she got her name from semi-popular bathing soap. Remember that she claims Joe Joe is the “Prime Minister of Sikakai,” which, as you may know, is a popular ingredient used in shampooing. The prefix "15" is used in the same way as on December 15, when Mitya became engaged to Joydip, and after his departure she remained forever in a time dependence. The film has its own share of flaws - the lack of using a strong background evaluation, which in such films can really strengthen the narration, some careless dialogues that are not weakened by some kind of forced transfer of dialogues. Inconsistent actions (Shabana and Dhritimaan are excellent, though IMO) by some of the actors, although many of the cast have been wasted. Shefali Tea's sudden uncertainty about her husband seems unimaginably introduced into the plot. I give it 7/10, because it made me think, but not above it, because I can easily understand its sources of inspiration and, having experienced (and for the most part getting great pleasure) from them earlier, I had already thought about it earlier Thus, the experience after 15 PA will surely be without a certain degree of novelty. Where am I from? I gave 9.5 / 10 '36 Chowringhee Lane '(although it is still rumored that one of the ghosts of Satyajit Ray sent it), 7.5 -' Paromiter Ek Din ', 7 -' Mr and Mrs Iyer 'and 5 -' Paroma ' . At the existential level, this did not arouse my interest, not even as much as, say, the Truman Show.
