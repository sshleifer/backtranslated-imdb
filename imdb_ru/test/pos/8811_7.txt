Cardiff, Wales. In this city a bunch of 5 comrades is boring. There is a jeep that works in a clothing store. Coop, calm DJ. Nina is inseparable from her best friends Lulu and Moff. A week for them is hellish, and they are waiting for only one thing: the weekend. At this time, they went to a nightclub and to the sounds of technology, not music, they are experiencing various drugs, especially Ecstasy. Then they usually continue to party with a friend. At the end of this really good time on Sunday, the following feelings: fatigue, melancholy, just a memory of a crazy night ... <br /> <br /> Surfing on the wave of the notorious success of "Trainspotting" (1996), this debut film, written and directed Justin Kerrigan, introduces and develops a new version of the concept of hedonism. This means: how to have the most fun, knowing that you have a shortened period of time. Indeed, as I wrote earlier, for the 5 main characters of the film, the week is hell, and the weekend is the only time when they can break free and have a crazy time without any pressure (besides, in one episode Jeep talks about the positive aspects of shooting in yourself: you are numb, you do not feel any pressure, you are like an astronaut in orbit above the earth. Kerrigan’s unrelenting directorial style very well expresses the spirit of depravity and carefreeness of the 5 main characters. In addition to livening up a bit the festive atmosphere in which his film is bathed, Kerrigan is not afraid to include fabulous episodes that represent the fantasy or embarrassment of his characters. Then “Human Traffic” (1999) also serves a particularly vigorous sound track. Number? Perfect a symbiosis between sound and music. Finally, this weekend of euphoria allows you to postpone for a moment the British cinema - the usual monotonous image of popular social classes - studied a lot. <br /> <br /> Although the film (in good faith or not) uses the fame of another famous film, it rarely matches the brightness of its film. predecessor. “Human trafficking” is in this condition. There is a bit of ingenuity at the level of narrative structure and character introduction, and there are several useless digressions (Jeep who comes into the manager’s office at a nightclub and tells him a story about a rooster and a bull to allow Moff to enter the club, but it’s useless because the latter can come without problems). You can also blame Kerrigan for having lost sight of the dramatic aspects that could be associated with this story. His film can also be read as a transition from euphoria to paranoia, and the dramatic connotations of this second pole are not actually explored. It's a shame! He could convey the following message: even in the happiest moments there could be something terrible that could fail them. The same can be said in the event that Kup had jealousy, because Nina is deceiving the guy. <br /> <br /> This may not be the last great film of the nineties, because it was shot on the cover of the DVD, but “The Road Traffic Man” should be perceived as a good and sharp little film that conveys the styles and fashion of the end of the twentieth century, the desire have fun without hidden motives and troubles. An ideal film to start any party or before going to the club.
