In this interesting film noir there are three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are especially outstanding. Demming, as a detective, unfortunately, is not so good. He lacks the intelligence, strength and cynical ideology of Bogart. If Humphrey played this role, we could have a classic. <br /> <br /> The pace, location (library) and atmosphere are all good. But there are some holes in the plot. Sanders is very afraid of Blackmer and the ruthless organization (Nazis) he represents. However, after the erroneous assassination of Blackmer, Sanders does not seem to be worried or remorseful. Sanders then captures the library and its occupants, using the trick that he and his people are detectives investigating the murder. However, the hired killer of Sanders later tries to kill Demming by shooting at him (without a silencer), although one would expect many other prisoners to hear and be alarmed by the noise. Finally, the hired killer of Sanders is trying to kill Roberts, who discovered the truth, but when she loses consciousness, he inexplicably does not. <br /> <br /> What worried me the most was the fact that the chance of a great and unexpected conclusion was missed. Throughout the film, Patrick is portrayed as a smart, stubborn sociopath, not afraid of anything. And yet at the end she runs in panic from the last surviving Nazi, the cruel thug. By the time the police found him, he had killed her. And in the end, it becomes another weak, stereotyped victim. What was going to happen was: the police find a Nazi gangster, but he is dead. She deftly killed him, and then disappeared, continuing her evil path.
