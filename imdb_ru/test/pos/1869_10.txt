I was a big fan of this series. Yesterday I watched it again on DVD. I was worried about whether laughter would come or not? But in a few episodes, I laughed hysterically, and some episodes were good. Acting wise Rakesh Bedi (Raja) and Satish Shah are great, while Swaroop Sampat is pretty bad, but I think she does her job. Perhaps the best actress could be used instead. This series shows what a good, clean comedy. <br /> <br /> If this series were aired this year, I would give it 9/10. And to think that this series is almost 25 years old, and his comedy is still good. I give it 10/10. I highly recommend this series for watching on DVD.
