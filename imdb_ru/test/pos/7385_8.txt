Rickman is sexy and good, but the "stranger" is less convincing - Reedus seems to be sexy, but he is not a consistent actor - this may be the director's fault - we have to find him attractive in extreme conditions because he is "cute" - but not enough. A torn-up wife is almost convincing — a seven-year marriage, and her character and Rickman's character should be more consistent with each other, regardless of whether their roles should be incompatible — they should already have patterns. I understand, although I think that the wife is a bit tense in her role - and she is not very convincingly attracted by the "stranger" - so this is a failure - the unspoken connection between the character Rickman and the "stranger" is better done, even if we are not sure that such I miss Rickman's sexy English accent (fortunately, he slips in and out of the American style). disappointing, but with excellent acting.
