China White (1989) was the first international film by Ronnie Y. This production in the UK, Holland and Hong Kong was filmed in English and slightly edited for western audiences. The American brothers Wong (Michael and Russell) were supposed to star in the film together, but because of previous commitments it was not available, so another Western actor, Stephen Lee, took his place. Several Hong Kong stars, such as Tommy Wong (playing dumb) and the always creepy William Ho, appear along with the director in an interesting episodic episode. <br /> <br /> The Chow brothers are in Holland to run a family business. They want the family business to become legal, but other Asian gangs don’t want it and see this as a face-saving movement to please the “foreigners”, and they want to continue making money the old way. Others want to bring their business to a new minimum, smuggling drugs and what not. After the elder Chow is shot dead in cold blood, the brothers take steps against any family that is not with them. Can a chow family not allow families to kill each other, or when the streets of Holland are full of innocence and gangster blood? <br /> <br /> A film with a high degree of undervalued. I was surprised at how good it was. I have not seen the Hong Kong version. It would be a great pleasure for me. It is longer and has much more production-related Hong Kong movie stars. It is a pity that this film is not available on D.V.D. The video I saw was blurred and the sound was not very good. <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended for action lovers. <br /> <br /> factoid: this film takes place before the decriminalization of drugs <br /> <br /> in Holland.
