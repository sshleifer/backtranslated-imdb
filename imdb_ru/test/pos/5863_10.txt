This film is probably one of the most creative horror works ever. It has everything you could want ... suspense, drama, comedy, intricate stories, Native Americans, eating the brain ... If you are looking for everything and all the brain-count movies, look no further. The story of a man inclined to revenge. And how best to get it? "I know, I'll suck their brains!" With great sound effects and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.
