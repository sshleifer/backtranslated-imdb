I'm sorry to see that the SURFACE was not matched for the NBC 2006-2007 season. I believe that the market demand for meaningless gaming and reality shows on television, reflecting our sense of culture, has won a good story. I hope and pray that some network picks it up so that it continues to work, as does STARGATE and its by-products. <br /> <br /> I also hope that the producers will find a place where they can produce the level of post-production that they wished in the TV guide interview. Right now you'll have to do replays on Sci-Fi, marathons. I would really like to see where the story goes after the tsunami that completed Episode 15. I would like to know who is leading the effective efforts to hide the true essence of the creatures. <br /> <br /> FYC Morningbear
