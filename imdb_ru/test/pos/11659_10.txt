I really liked this movie. It challenged my emotions and beliefs, making it a real piece of art in my book. The game was unsurpassed. I would never have watched this movie with someone I could not cry, I don’t think I cry more than any movie, perhaps because it makes me look at myself, I don’t know This is a must see.
