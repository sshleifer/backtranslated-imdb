What makes watching and watching movies enjoyable is that from time to time, when you least expect it, a “Cage” movie appears that knocks your socks off. This film is an excellent horror, in which there is everything that you could want when you want to get scared to madness. Without going into the story, all I will say is that it has a good start, middle and end, which keep you on the edge of your seat, while at the same time striking you with amazing special effects. The game is good, not being outstanding, but it does not matter, because the subject and the way it is placed on the big screen, make it one of the best horror films that I have seen for a long time. This is one of those films that you imagine, which began as a novel, but, speaking of the credits, it does not look like an adaptation, so Mark Protosovich, the writer, should be of great credit. 9 out of 10
