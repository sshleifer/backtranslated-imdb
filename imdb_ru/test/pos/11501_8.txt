This film is based on a true story. The author of the novel with the same name Einar Mara Gudmundsona had a brother who became mentally ill. I found this film very touching, following the path of the protagonist to the disease, to see how he tries to cope with life after diagnosis and how he makes friends in a mental hospital, all this is very convincing. There are also quite a few funny cases in the manuscript. The name of this gives nothing relative to the story. You have to watch it in order to understand ... and listen to music that twists and turns your heart and soul upside down and back as the movie progresses. Be sure to look for everyone.
