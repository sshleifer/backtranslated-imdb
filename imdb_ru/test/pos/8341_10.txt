Too many Christian films become centered around the fear of the Court, and as a result they are indulgent and unintentionally squeamish. The “second look” does it right. This is an almost perfect evangelical tool; it deals with the real reason why so many young people want nothing to do with Christianity. This ensures the audience that a person must give up his sin, not pleasure, in order to succeed in the Christian life. “Second Look” even works as part of filmmaking. The filmmakers obviously worked with a very low budget, but they managed to write a fairly dynamic script to divert the attention of viewers from this obvious fact. This film brought me to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and thanks to Christian stations everywhere that show him, he undoubtedly influenced more people than I did.
