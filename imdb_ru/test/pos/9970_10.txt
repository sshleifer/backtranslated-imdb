I am always impressed when the director (and in this case, the director / screenwriter) takes a piece of the classic text - and makes it come to life. Undoubtedly, the text of Shakespeare can give you goosebumps, even when forged with self-importance, but to see a production where true ingenuity makes wonderful words even more - giving context or nuance not found in the stage directions, just inspires fear. of things. This is a racist game about racism - and it still stands. I never accepted Jessica’s desertion from her father for no acceptable reason. I have never accepted the position of Christians about sanctimonious self-righteousness. But, brilliantly, there is a textual prologue that helps us understand the times and policies in which the story unfolds, and, fortunately, much of Jessica’s role is cut off. <br /> <br /> The text is pretty truncated with many cut passes. But I noticed only one line, which was cut at the moment when I expected to hear it - and it was replaced by a look that said it all. This savings and thoughtful editing gave us an exciting film - not just a play movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a reason why Antonio is so loyal and generous to the undeserved / unrelated Bassanio - you almost feel Antonio’s pulse starting to beat when he notices Bassanio passing by in the gondola or arrives to visit. But it is as thin as it is - no more. I was fascinated. <br /> <br /> There were many other highlights. I felt that the arguments during the trial were heartbreaking. And the costumer trials are fun. <br /> <br /> Add it all to the magnificent cinematography and costumes that have found a response in time, and you will understand why I can’t wait to see it again. And again.
