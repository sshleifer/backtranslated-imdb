I recently stumbled upon the TV show "Passion ...." (skipping the first scenes). Miss Currier deserves praise for having the courage and courage to do so to display De Balzac’s strange story. I am grateful to all the actors and film crew for their participation in the creation of such a beautiful film. It must have been hard to shoot so many scenes in the desert. And I can not understand how her coach persuaded such a wonderful "game" of the leopard, Simon. (This ad reminds one more disturbing adventure “Naked booty”). Why is this film no more famous? I hope I find it in the video.
