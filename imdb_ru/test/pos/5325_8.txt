There are subtleties in this film that I think many people can skip if they are not careful. You really need to follow what Leland says and read his character to find out exactly why the movie is presented at the end. Nothing, it is hard, it is not certain, it is what the individual viewer extracts from this. I think it was a plan from the very beginning, people are not meant for everyone to understand it the same way, it is almost about forming your personal relationship with Leland to perhaps feel it a little better. <br /> <br /> The storyline is interesting, but its summary can never explain what a movie really is. It is dramatic and makes you think a lot of hard ideas, but the pace of the film is almost reassuring, even with its more intense screaming scenes. I think that this is probably Leland, he is simply calm and almost serene, even with all his sadness. The film somehow personifies Lelanda. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is exciting and appeals to you, if you allow it, but there are some recycled ideas. I mean, Leland has a lot of impressive dialogue, it’s not at all typical, but he’s not a prophet. Everything he says is not a revelation, many people I know mentioned that he mentioned, even I watched a few things he watched. Leland is a unique and attractive character, he is probably mainly for the image of Ryan Gosling. <br /> <br /> In the end, the acting is exceptional, there are no bad guys, there is no way to psychologically evaluate Leland, only it is possible to understand him and life is a little better. <br /> <br /> Comparable to Igbi, it seems, not comedic, but similar in its general outlook on life.
