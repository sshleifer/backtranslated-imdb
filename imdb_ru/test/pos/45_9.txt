Just a great soundtrack. Really nice music. Outstanding cast, excellent performance. Worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Actually does not explain what happened to the surroundings. You have a feeling that integration is to blame, or that the neighborhood has broken up with the departure of the main character. <br /> <br /> This film seems well studied and extremely well thought out. I especially liked some minor characters such as Jeffrey Wright. <br /> <br /> Cutting out during the opening sequence helps to express what a vivid, exciting and desirable experience this nightclub would be with music jumping, food, drinks, dancing, gambling and sex.
