Yeah, that's a little silly. But it is intense and interesting, and one of my favorites; There are great actors in the film, and they are doing a commendable job, given the limitations of the plot and the characters. It's interesting to see David Sole in the role of the “bad guy”; I thought that he was quite plausible and rather intimidating, as the increasingly paranoid commander Robert Conrad — a longtime favorite — I think he very well embodies his character; and Sam Waterston was a stellar quality in everything I saw - in the movies or on television. <br /> <br /> I watch this film very often, but our tape (television copy of VHS, which I received) is of so poor quality that it is difficult to fully enjoy it. I think this is a movie they should release on DVD; it may not be in demand everywhere, but I’m sure there are a lot of people like me who like this movie, so there would be a market for a DVD version. I will continue to hope!
