I saw this movie in Santa Monica on August 23, and he stayed with me. I want to thank the filmmakers for going into the details of Harryâ€™s mysterious, eccentric life. And also to show the flaws and flaws of Nilsson, man. Thank you for showing good and bad, ups and downs, and for revealing these amazing shots of the BBC. The film is also an excellent demonstration of the huge amount of Nilsson's music, which is really well located throughout the film. I recommend this film to anyone who loves good documentaries, especially if you are interested in Harry Nilsson or the music scene of the early 70s. Some reviewer on the website Ain't It Cool wrote that it was the best film they saw at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and I believe it. The film is informative, funny, sad, touching and full of cool music. It succeeds at all levels. Really, really good.
