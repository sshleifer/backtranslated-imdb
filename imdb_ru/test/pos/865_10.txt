If you have ever been an MTV "The State" fan, then these three guys will be familiar to you. But even if you stumbled upon them only through the Internet, like me, you will soon understand how their unique brand is comedy. <br /> <br /> Born from their comedy trio, Stella, Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter and David Wayne created these brilliant vignettes of surrealistic comedy to be shown on their shows, and are now available only for download sites, they appear in original glory on a single DVD. <br /> <br /> Think comedic sketch show without censorship, and you find yourself halfway through. Not a single stone of decency will go unnoticed. But for those who like their comedy, rude, self-indulgent and bordering on childishness (and I mean it in the most flattering way) this DVD is for you! <br /> <br /> I think he is worth the money for a comment from two Michael and one David, you can't help but fall in love with them when they explain their actions by squeezing their own antics with the former toys and patting each other in turns on the back and hurling insults. <br /> <br /> Fantastic. <br /> <br /> I must say something about the attractiveness of Stella, like Julie Bowen and Paul Rudd are ready to rush into battle so fearlessly. And you have to follow their beautiful example, cast aside prejudice into the wind and get ready to laugh at yourself.
