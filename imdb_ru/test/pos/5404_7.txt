This film does not have outstanding visual effects offered by American Beauty or The Ice Storm, and since it was made after these films, it also cannot be marked as very original: music, although slightly subtle, sounds very similar to American music. Beauty. <br /> <br /> The story has some similarities with Icestorm in particular (as well as with Sigourney Weaver). Perhaps without intention, the film is trying to recreate the success of the two aforementioned films. From time to time, the story tends to remain a bit more superficial than its larger, more successful “brothers” due to too many ongoing events or the lack of the most effective dialogues. Here writing can not be compared with American beauty. But this can be said about the majority of films ever made, even the best ones, and there is something else that you might like: musical evaluation and (expected, given the cast,) effective performance. It should be noted Emil Hirsch, who a couple of years will appear in the outstanding "Into The Wild". <br /> <br /> In general, I can recommend this film if you like suburban dramas, although it is not the first on a list of must-see that will be headed: 1 American beauty 2 Ice storm 3 Small children. <br /> <br /> After seeing and liking it, check it out.
