In 1968, when "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" came out, he appeared from nowhere and struck like a psychedelic lightning strike. African-American actor and director William Greaves sought to forever change the style of documentary film production "news feed", and to this day has never been anything like that. A film is a film about “making a film,” and it is specially written and directed so as to create as many contradictions and contradictions as possible. Located in New York's Central Park, the dialogue about action and scarcity concerns a couple who are fighting and arguing about homosexuality and abortion. A woman wants a relationship, but a man wants an explanation. Towards the end of this interaction, a drunk homeless person interrupts the process and offers his comments and personal story. Then, after the main shots were taken, the film crew adds their own views on the director, and what they feel is his inept handling of the film. And throughout the entire film, several cameras are used to record the actions on the stage and extraneous comments from the actors, the crew and the audience. I would certainly recommend this film to anyone interested in avant-garde filmmakers, such as Andy Warhol, John Cassavetes, or Jim Jarmusch. William Greaves tries to show that a thing cannot be truly observable and understood, because the viewing itself would change reality. “SIMBIOPSIHOTAXIPLASM: Take One” can be viewed as a cinematic representation or application of the uncertainty principle. This is only one of the possible explanations, and the true intention of the Mane is certainly open to speculation. First of all, this film seeks to mix, resist. and stimulate, and no doubt succeeds excellently.
