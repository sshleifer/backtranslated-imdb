If you had made a really good Jack Black movie, added some creeping jeepers, and then a little joy with a hint of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre and a house of 1000 corpses ... you would have MONSTER! I entered this film, not really expecting much, but in the end I really enjoyed the film. the whole premise is really stupid, the monster man in the monster truck is stalking people, but it's so funny that the screenwriter / director doesn't expect you to take it seriously. Justin Urich is a jewel of comics, and he should have a very promising career. It is identical to jack black. the only problem with the film is the incredible role of the hero played by Eric Jungmann. but in general, if you are looking for a truly truly funny movie that will split you up until you roll in the aisles, and at the same time scares you to hell ... watch this movie.
