Opera opens with a very close-up view, which always looks at the bird, and thus starts one of the most bizarre and enjoyable features of Argento (my second favorite is actually Deep Red). Of course, sometimes the film is quite absurd (the lack of real concern after the killings, the attack of the birds, the burnt dummy, is it the end ??), but this is the fantastic world of Argento, and as soon as you agree with this, you will find that it works. I do not want to completely reject these shortcomings, rather, that the film's artistry more than fills them. For example, the above-mentioned attack of birds is in theory completely impossible, but look at its wonderful performance; crows fly in chaos, adding their enraged piercing cry to the impact of rock music, the crowd in a panic, as seen through a rotating camera from a bird's eye view, and then a targeted attack; really aria of terror. Amazing, smooth cinematography Argento is on full display in the Opera, and is undoubtedly one of the highlights of the film. I also liked the soundtrack of operas and rock music, the pleasant contrast of the music that everyone used effectively (rock is involved in murders at the perfect time and gives the scenes a very mad feeling). The sound effects also deserve the praise, knives, knives, beaks and all that. <br /> <br /> Inspector Alan Santini: “I've seen a lot of your movies. Yes, you are really an expert in this field. I would be very interested to know your opinion. "<br /> <br /> Marco:" I think it is unwise to use films as a guide for reality, isn’t it so inspector? "Inspector Alan Santini:" Depends on what you mean by reality. "<br /> <br /> Considering that this is hyallo, stylish killings are simply necessary, and Dario It does not disappoint (the scene “a bullet through the door”) is quite possibly one of the greatest deaths in history, if you forgive the pun.) The killer in black gloves, with a deep voice and pulsating brains (cool shots!) is cold and cruel, and have pins for scotch under the eyes of our heroine, so that she was forced to watch the killings, was pleasant by touch. However, like giallo, Opera is not as good as it should be. The killer is kept secret from the audience quite well, but in the movie about the disclosure of the facts of the killings, there is not much effort. This strange end could have used more work. for these problems, Opera still manages to become a worthy and satisfying horror film. <br /> <br /> And the last remark: it was nice to watch the film, this time to show the correct look through binoculars (just a circle). and not two circles together)! A good look at the details, Dario!
