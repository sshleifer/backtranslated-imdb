Most of the criticism of the “Attack of the show” comes from people who unfairly compare it with the old computer television program called “Screen savers”. People are upset because G4 decided to cancel the “Screensavers” and replace it with the “Attack Show” pop culture. Comparing two shows is like comparing apples with oranges! <br /> <br /> “Attack of the Show” is a unique watch program covering the current culture of the X / Y generation. It presents cinema / television segments, group discussions, video games, new DVD releases, sex tips, new gadgets (MP3 players, mobile phones, etc.), Comics / graphic novels, magazines and online hobbies. <br /> <br /> This is a fun show, definitely worth checking out that you're over 20 or 30. I give it 8 out of 10.
