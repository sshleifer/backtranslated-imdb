Bart Genius Although this is not the first episode of the Simpsons, Bart he Genius is more or less the first typical episode. There is no trick or theme, this is just a typical episode of The Simpsons in setting up. It always seems to me that this is an episode that grows on you. There are some elements I don’t need, mostly spotty animation that can be forgiven. But over time, I like this story about its uniqueness. <br /> <br /> For example, for a comedy series with a standard budget, it would be very difficult to make this episode due to the different sets that are shown in this episode, computer compartments in the class of Miss Melon, opera and so on. I want to say that the Simpsons are aware of one of the greatest strengths of animation. The absolute lack of visual limitations compared to live action. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of writing, it is also very smart and fresh. The concept is quite unique, and especially the problems encountered. Instead of the previous fault tolerance, this work was too hard, just Bart’s social isolation from his classmates let him down (although an explosive scientific experiment may prove the opposite ... which I also consider to be one of the best visual jokes of the series.) that Bart, running naked to his room to escape Homer, was already in shorts, but still funny for the short mark Marge and Lisa. /> <br /> Ultimately this is a very good episode, with many interesting new moments in the series, although not entirely flawless. <br /> <br /> Yes, and now the iconic name Kwijybo was, of course, released to the World.
