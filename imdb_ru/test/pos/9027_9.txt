I really don't understand why people don't like this movie. I found it very interesting (of course the fact that it plays the magnificent Laura Fraser is a bonus!) When I first heard about it, I thought it would be in the spirit of the inverted role of "Strange Science" Of course this is true, however there is a turn which I really did not expect. After seeing the trailer on a DVD (which I hadn’t seen before watching the movie), I saw that the “trailer” was actually shown in the trailer! Very strange. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, the comparison “Strange Science” is becoming less and less suitable, and I think this is the best of the two films. Of course, there are some scenes that do not work wonderfully, but they are filled with the enthusiasm of a young actor. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would say that this is a great example of science fiction. - a fantastic movie, and I don't think I've seen a lot of them!
