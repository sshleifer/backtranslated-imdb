This is an excellent film, and it immediately hit my top ten (believe me, I know movies!). This is one of the films that really makes you think not about the plot, but about yourself! The film is about a fifteen year old child (Leland Fitzgerald) who kills an autistic boy. he is sent to a juvenile hall where he meets his teacher Pearl Madison. His relationship with Pearl is growing slowly, and eventually Pearl decides to write a story about Leland and his colleagues, but as he gets closer to finding Leland's motives, he learns that he must first solve his own problems. great movie that you definitely need to see with great pixie music and a fantastic score! Watch it!
