I absolutely adore this movie! I never heard of it when I saw it in a video store. I saw that this was Kathy Bates, so I decided that she should have some value, you know? I watched it for the first time, just shaking my head. , , Yes? Then it was the last scene, and I felt that I was smiling so hard. I clicked on Play Movie and watched it all again. This is without a doubt the strangest film I've ever seen. But the more I look, the more I love it. This is absurd, insane, cute and cute. Kathy Bates is flawless, but the rest of the cast are great too. What strange characters they all are! The dwarf is too funny for words. And Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow are hysterical. This is just a funny, incredible movie. I am eager to see it again. Whoever watched it for the first time, please hold it to the end. It's worth it!
