Imagine the scene: a bored student with a blank day ahead, a video store with a special offer of 5 videos per week rental. This former student usually just grabbed a bunch of videos of dubious quality for the most arbitrary reasons (Did someone turn around?). Sometimes a strange undiscovered gem did fall into his video recorder - this is the case with this film. Everything in the film is good, but much more than these parts, all in a grid to provide something too rare - a stunning good movie. Why this never happened in the British film distribution, I do not understand, especially if we take into account the trash that we have to overcome in the multiplex week of the week. Although I will gladly take note that this is not Oscar's material (but neither the one nor the other has spoiled Titanic - black talk), this is a very nice movie. I tried to figure out how to describe how best to evaluate / take this film - the perfect film to watch it, talking with my father, after returning home for the holidays, after a big Sunday dinner.
