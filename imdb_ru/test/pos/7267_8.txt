... princess bride meets ... well trainspotting. But wait, really, this is a good combination! It was certainly one of the best films I have seen in a long time ... there is a kind of witty dialogue in it that I associate with Bride Princess or Graveyard, along with horrible scenes of violence in a horror movie. .. the heroic feeling of the princess of the bride in combination with (this is strange) the absence of any really nice guys that Trainspot had. <br /> <br /> I’m not saying that it was as GOOD as the princess’s bride, but it was in the Arena, and it swayed. Some dialogues go beyond the pleasant for the genius, the plot is interesting, the characters - although SOME anacronical - are anacronical not because of their inner nature (in the 18th century WAS bright gays, contrary to the comments of the previous reviewer), but only in a little language, which they used. Nevertheless, the anachronisms made him funny, and NOT cheesy and easily dismissed. <br /> <br /> If you have ever read any episodes about Simon R. Green or Garrett Glyn Cook, you know exactly what kind of movie it is. Check this. It's great.
