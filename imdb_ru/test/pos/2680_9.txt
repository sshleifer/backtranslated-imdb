"KING KING", in my opinion, the net hit CBS! Despite the fact that I have never seen every episode, I still really like it. For this reason, it's hard for me to say which episode is my favorite. However, I have to say that CBS really knows how to make a good comedy series. Before finishing, I would like to say that everyone always gives good results, the production design is impressive, the costumes are well thought out, and the writing is always very strong. In conclusion, if this show lives in syndication after it comes out of CBS, I strongly recommend that you catch it in case it goes on the air for good.
