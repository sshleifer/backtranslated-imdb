Anyone who correctly identifies the initial images as a God killing himself without reading the latest credits certainly deserves a free ticket to a holiday home in Transylvania. I could imagine that this is a favorite movie in the dark twin Peach box that night when there was time. I would think that the best name could be: “How much can you have fun with someone who is almost dead in the forest with only Neolithic technology?” The answer would seem to be quite a bit. Thus, despite the stupid “God kills itself”, excessive pretentiousness (a successful phrase taken from the previous letter), the clearer “Aleister Crowley - Hi, I’m a beast, figure it out!” The Christian cosmology (I can't believe another viewer had the courage to see in this Judeo-Christian Bible) ... in spite of all this ... this is a bold, important work that most people should not see. I am impressed and frightened that it was done at all.
