It must be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The idea of ​​a typical family leaving everything to live in the desert. When mom and dad lose work there, not to mention the fact that they have green mucus in the bathroom. They decide that their families are best moved to Oregon. Once things go wrong. An interesting set of characters complements this film. Including young Molly Ringwald, this film I would definitely recommend.
