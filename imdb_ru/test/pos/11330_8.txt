Two hours ago, I watched this wonderful film that stunned me with its sharp photo. It is quite clear how he won the prize “Best Camera in Cannes 2000”. It was dominated by close-ups. Close-ups of walls, people and many other things. Warm color lighting (which is also usually the director) gave the film a warm atmosphere. In most of them you can see only two people. Interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the film almost all the time. Each of these themes represented a specific atmosphere throughout the film. Silence and slow movements characterize the film. Some scenes were protracted moments or serious close-ups. Not only Tony Leng deserves a prize for his excellent game, since Maggie Cheung was also gorgeous. I wonder how many dresses she wore in different scenes. The story was also somehow related to the history of Hong Kong and the region of the 1960s. This prevented me from understanding some of the details, especially at the end. In short, I would recommend feature film lovers to watch it in the cinema.
