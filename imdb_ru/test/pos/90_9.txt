I really liked this short one, even as a Toronto Maple Leafs fan. <br /> <br /> Director Sheldon Cohen and narrator Roch Carrier perfectly captured all the boyâ€™s emotions. From the feelings he had for his hero Maurice "Rocket" Richard, to the excitement, anticipation and hope of getting a new Montreal Canadiens sweater soon, to the horror on his face when he received a sweater from his mother; The Toronto Maple Leafs sweater was invaluable, and the shame of having to wear this terrible (in his eyes) white and blue Toronto Maple Leafs sweater; Not rouge, blu and blankets of Montreal Canadiens with number nine Richard, like his old sweater. And worst of all, his mom made him wear this maple leaf sweater from the house. You can imagine and anticipate the ridicule he gets from his friends when he hits the ice in this sweater before he gets there. <br /> <br /> I was laughing all the time, and this is one of the best animated shorts I've seen. <br /> <br />
