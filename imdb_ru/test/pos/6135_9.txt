Like most other reviewers, I really liked this mini-series. I did not see him when he first came out, but my grandfather - a big fan of mystery and war films - accidentally recorded it in 1989. I remember once watching him in the cabin of my grandparents, and I was completely drawn into the story! He has a very intriguing plot and a good mix of drama, romance and espionage. I saw a lot of films shot during the Second World War, but not one with such a turn was not! Fortunately, I was able to make a VHS copy of the film a few years ago. Since then I have watched it several times and still enjoy it. I would like this movie to be released on DVD. It would be much easier to browse the chapters.
