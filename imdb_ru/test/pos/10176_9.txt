I thought it was a really cute film - inspirational (makes me want to try acting) - I LOVE Kelly Ripa, and it's nice that I can watch this in addition to all my children - I already watched it 3 times! Of course, I also liked to see Joe Barbara - especially since the Underworld came out of the air!
