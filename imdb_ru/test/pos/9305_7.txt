If you know something about the Manhattan project, you will find Fat Man and a Little Boy, at least an interesting description of the events surrounding this story. The film in all respects is a very realistic depiction of these events, and in many respects it is almost too real (for example, some scenes related to radiation poisoning). Paul Newman, as usual, is great in his role and always manages to act like a real person on the screen. Supporting actors such as John Cusack, Laura Dern, Bonnie Bedelia and Natasha Richardson are also pretty good. This film, however, is not one of the best examples of turning a real story into a film. Great films are able to take a true story and use a sufficient number of artistic licenses to attract an audience to the entire film. This one, however, tends to pull a little everywhere, and some scenes (such as the love story of John Cusack and Natasha Richardson) may have been eliminated completely, without causing the film to lose a lot. However, there are enough interesting facts and tiny humorous pieces to at the very least, it is enough to interest the audience to see the whole movie. It is not always entertaining, but as for the gorgeous images, it is very accurate, fascinating and will make the audience think. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
