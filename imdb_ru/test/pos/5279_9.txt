Miyazaki has been doing his mojo since the 1970s, and only recently his films made him American shores thanks to Disney, and fans admired his great talent. Ponyo is no exception. Although some of his other films were a little more accessible to the American audience, some of them may find this film in their presentation as “Japanese.” For the same reason, Pom Poko is VERY “Japanese” and does not make much sense for the American audience, as well as some elements of Ponyo. This should not distract you from watching this funny movie about growth, hope and friendship. <br /> <br /> What is clearly seen is the very thoughtful and magical animation and the story of Miyazaki, in which there are elements of wonder and fantasy. This is combined with its characteristic use of character development and often with the use of girls and women as main characters. He is a little out of his area with Ponyo, since the main character is a little boy who lives in a small village by the sea with his mom while his father leaves for work on the high seas. Although not alone, Sosuke, he, like any other curious boy, loves the adventures and charm of the sea. Like Spirited Away, we see different worlds of people and sea creatures, and I feel that Miyazaki may be trying to draw the audience’s attention to the vast and unexplored nature of things that live under the sea, and our acceptance of them, and so on. these are different things. <br /> <br /> I was able to see a version of this film with subtitles last year, and I was pleased with the plot and plot. Miyazaki claimed that "this is my last film" over the years, but shortly after Spirited Away, he presented us with the Moving Castle of Howl. Ponyo is certainly proof that Miyazaki has not hung his spurs and continues to delight, innovate and create the most creative animated films of all time. Watch Ponyo with an open mind and put on a hat for children's fantasies and fantasies, and you will go back when you catch Fireflies, and secret hiding places were more important than boring adult things and eating your vegetables.
