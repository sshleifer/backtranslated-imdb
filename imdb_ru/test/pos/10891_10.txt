GoldenEye 007 is not only the best game in the cinema genre of all time, but perhaps the most influential first-person shooter on the gaming console market. If you don’t know the plot of this game, this is not a problem, because in essence it’s the same thing as the popular James Bond film, GoldenEye, which was released in 1995, two years before the release of this game. <br /> <br /> This is a game full of techniques and styles that will be repeated in many future games, and it gives the player a wide range of goals and challenges. A.I. clever (especially at higher levels of difficulty), and the environment is complex enough to provide entertainment, as well as difficulties for any player. <br /> <br /> Introducing logical hit points for enemies is a great opportunity. Even the bosses in this game can be killed with an accurate shot in the head. It is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond, and you can sneak, sneak, secretly kill minions in the direction of travel, cause anxiety and go through massive skirmishes. Because of this, there are many ways to go through the game and endless possibilities for how you perform your tasks. AKA: You can choose an easy or difficult way to overcome levels ... and if you do not have a strategy guide, you will have to look for these ways yourself (which I could add is incredibly fun if you want to spend the whole day). <br /> <br /> This is one of those games where the more you play, the more you value its contribution to the gaming industry. Every time I play it, I notice aspects that have been reproduced in many of the next FPS games. So, if you have a Nintendo 64, go into the mud and order a used copy of GoldenEye 007, because, believe me, as a Bond fan and an ordinary player, I can say that this game is strongly recommended to all those who want to enter James Bond or just get a stunning, rich gaming experience. <br /> <br /> (Also note your perfect Perfect Dark game, which is also on the N64, after the same controls and very similar weapons.)
