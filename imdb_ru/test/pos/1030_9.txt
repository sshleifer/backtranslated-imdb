Oppenheimer was a GREAT series (this was the first thing I saw in Waterston), and too bad copies are not available. A similar situation exists for the British TV series "Glory Enough for All" at about the same time about the discovery of insulin. I would pay a good price for both of them on DVD. Is it so hard to burn Oppenheimer on a DVD that can be played in the USA? Another very nice series, around the same time, was "Danger UXB". The UneXploded bomb disposal series, hence the name. One that you can get at your local library. <br /> <br /> Pete
