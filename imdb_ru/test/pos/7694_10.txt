I have always been a fan of this mostly unseen filming of Gershwin's opera since I last saw her in 1959. As many of you know, it was not available on video or DVD; In fact, the Gershvin family sought to destroy all existing prints. <br /> <br /> However, for some reason, hoping to signal an end to the opposition, the Gershwin family recently approved a fashion show for the collection press at the Museum. moving images in Astoria, Queens. . <br /> <br /> Technicolor widescreen printing was superb! (Not perfect, but great.) The sound was excellent in stereo road show quality. People who saw it in the original version would not see a much better copy. (Notes to the program include an original review of Variety, which contains a warning that people may refuse a steep ticket with a limited edition of $ 3.5!) Better than I remembered. This is just great. Sydney Poitier, like Porgy, was at the moment when his career was just beginning to catch fire, and his charisma shone through. Dorothy Dandridge as Bess is amazingly beautiful. Brock Peters as the Crown is aggressively masculine. Pearl Bailey in the role of Maria gives several comic moments, although her role is small. And Sammy Davis Jr., like Sport Life, steals every scene he is in; he was especially fascinated by his two big numbers: “This is not necessarily the case” and “The boat that will soon go to New York.” (This last one won the applause in the show that I saw.) <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS are tied to a set, but it really doesn't matter when the set is as great as this one. Costumes are also outstanding. <br /> <br /> The singing voices of Sydney and Dorothy are voiced, but they are voiced very well. Exquisite “Summertime” is sung by Clara performed by young Diaanna Carroll; her singing is also called. (Actually, only Pearl and Sammy make vocals in their own way.) <br /> <br /> Of course, the music is sublime, but this time I was amazed at how many emotions Preminger pulled from the story. In fact, people sniffed the audience several times - once, when Bess sings this beautiful song "I love you, Porgy." And I enjoyed the audience, who actually loudly laughed at the lines in "This is not necessarily the case." Maybe they never heard this song before - or never listened to it? I believe that most of the emotional impact of this film is associated with the performances of Poitiers and Dendridge - you support their love of victory. <br /> <br /> A minor altercation with a duration of 136 minutes is one or two slow and stereotypical scenes of Amos-n-Andy that Bess sees a joker attorney to divorce the Crown, although she does not even marry him. (I would cut it off.) And the beginning is a bit confusing - both title characters are embarrassed to be introduced - they are part of the film before you know who they are. <br /> <br /> And I don’t wear it I don’t think that Preminger used one close-up in the whole film. All this seems to have been shot at 3/4, which I think was his way of working with a widescreen. <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS has always been a cult film for those of us who have seen it, for those of us who loved the soundtrack, and for some of us who have only heard about it. Let's hope they find a way to re-release it and release it on DVD. It deserves the widest audience.
