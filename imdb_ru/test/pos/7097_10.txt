This movie was a very good Universal Monster movie. This again stars Lon Chaney as Wolfman and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein's Monster. Oh yeah, that jerk John Carradine returned again as Dracula. I like every actor in this movie. I especially liked Onslow Stevens as Dr. Edelmann. (This is spelled from 2 N.) I thought it would be nice if a kind-hearted doctor was doomed just like Talbot. One scene, which, in my opinion, is very good, is the scene when Dr. Edelmann thinks deeply when he changes. All that bothers him, flashes before your eyes. A good Doctor says no, while his evil side says yes. This is the only reason I didn’t want Dracula’s character to be completely excluded from this movie. I thought that Dracula had no business in the House of Frankenstein. If his character were destroyed, you would not miss him. In this film, the doctor's blood is contaminated with Dracula’s blood, giving him the curse of Jekyll and Hyde. I hate John Carradine and I don’t think he should have ever played Dracula. I didn’t mind other actors playing the Frankenstein monster after the great Karloff, because they all did a good job. But when they invite another actor to play Dracula, he immediately stops. John Carradine thought he was so tall and strong. Once they offered him the role of a Frankenstein monster, and he refused because he thought he was too well trained. I could just imagine Carradine if he played Monster, arguing with the director on the set: “I don’t need to take that from you, I did Shakespeare.” John Carradine was not Dracula, and he never will. Sorry, John, Bela Lugosi is the only Dracula. Thank God they made Bela return as Dracula for Abbott and Costello. Meet Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie. It will not disappoint you, and you will enjoy it, like others. This is a very good addition to monster movies. If you are a collector, do not miss this one. <br /> <br />
