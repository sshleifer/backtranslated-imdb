I was able to watch this wonderful film at the Fantasyfilmfest festival in Berlin, and when I left the cinema, I felt like I was stupefied with * g *! I really saw a lot of films, and there are only a few that I would call perfect, like Fight Club or Koyaanisqatsi! Subconscious Cruelty is now one of them! Half of the people who watch it in Berlin have left the room, and I can understand it absolutely, because it can be a real shock for a person living in his / her ideal world, day-to-day dreaming about their dreams, not thinking terrified of our planet - in our life! I do not think that I should describe the history of the film for you, because people have already written on this page! This is a film that shows everything and even more !!! Gets 10 points + out of 10 !!! It would be great if you, people who also saw him loving, would write me an email! Until now, I have not met anyone as impressed and pleased with this as I am !!! In the end, sorry for my bad English - I am not a learned person (and yes so well!) :-))))))
