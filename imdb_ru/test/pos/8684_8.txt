I recently saw the Blurred test show and was surprised to say that it was actually pretty good! This is a film about different groups of children, your goats, your rich snobs, your typical teen couple, as well as two disgusting guys and one post hippie. Together, but as separate storylines, each group is sent to the Gold Coast Week for schoolchildren. In Australia, there have never been any problems with writing a comedy, and in Australia there are never short actors who can play a comedy with subtlety and just the right amount of quirkiness. The cast is full of stellar Australian actors with tremendous talent and a multitude of screen presence. Follow Craig Horner, a young graduate who looks at the weekly party with optimism, is lost in the machinations of his friends. Travis Kotten and Mark Priestley, who successfully coped with some clever physical comedy as two crazy goddesses and Jessica Gower as a cutie, but a bewildered teenager who worries about love its place among the many more experienced performers. Pay attention to Matthew Newton, skillfully played as a battered limousine driver. Fantastic Aussie
