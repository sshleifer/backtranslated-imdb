“Insignificant Murder Case” is a great TV movie that is worth renting. William H. Macy is great as a film critic who accidentally kills his mistress and then tries to hide the crime. Although it may seem bleak, the film is actually quite frivolous and funny, with many memorable lines (“Acting is more difficult than I thought - have you ever seen BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hert an apology” and my personal favorite “For Next Week, answer these two questions about the film Noir:“ What do these people do during the day? ”And“ Why does it always rain? ”. The film featured supporting actors, including real wife Macy Felsity Huffman , James Cromwell and Adam Arkin. Must See for Macy Fans !
