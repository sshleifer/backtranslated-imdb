It is a pity that this film did not get to play more in cinemas. This is a rich, textured love story with believable, completely human characters that are too busy playing and protecting their hearts to learn the Real Thing when they experience it. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is his screenplay in Chicago, among fashionable, artistic, literate middle-class African Americans who discuss poetry, music and literature. The other is his royal subtlety, Larenz Tate - and if you are at least half his fan, you MUST see this movie! His boyish boldness and vulnerability are perfect for the role of Darius. Nia Long also shines like Nina, who wants to tell Darius that she loves him, but is afraid to break the Rules. Great movie to watch, curled up on the couch with your sweetie!
