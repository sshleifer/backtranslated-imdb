“Rock Star” is not on its way to any category of “stairs to heaven” as one of the best rock films of all time, but it makes you jump from time to time because of its high level energy. The theme of the film is dedicated to a fanatical rock band, which actually becomes the vocalist of his favorite band. The story is based on a true story of what happened to the Judas Priest heavy metal band. If you think that this film is filled with a witty script and an intelligent direction, then you have “one more thing coming”. Nevertheless, the fact that "shook me all night long" - this is a wonderful game Jennifer Aniston as a devoted rock star girlfriend. I could not say the same thing about the rock star itself; Mark Wahlberg was a much better porn star than a rock star. I really enjoyed the retrospective journey of the 80s, which captures the movie. It reminded me of my teenage years, when everything "smelled of teenage spirit." I suppose the film is worth seeing, but for you to watch it better, be sure to take with you “girls, girls, girls”. *** Average
