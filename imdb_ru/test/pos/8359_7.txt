When the episode was filmed and aired, Eisenhower was president. Kennedy was the elected president. <br /> <br /> As for the episode, it was a tolerable episode, if not serious. The “professor” does not demonstrate a very wide range, and it all looks a bit hasty (many episodes of TZ do not seem to correspond to a time interval, some look like they are being killed and thrown, some almost or nothing at all so that it decomposes in half an hour , of course, fit). I suppose you just expect a little more stress than being returned to some rooms and drugged. But overall a decent episode. Indeed, the “what if” motive of time travel is itself a nugget and sets the table with a basic interest. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10, considering that many of the episodes of TZ were not so good, and some were much better.
