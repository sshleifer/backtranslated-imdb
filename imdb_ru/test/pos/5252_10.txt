The crying and almost unbearable longing of Amalia Rodriquezâ€™s music goes to a place in the soul that only music can stir up. In her voice and her magical presence lies the exquisite agony of Fado, an art form that I did not know about until I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> For me, the success of this beautifully created documentary with love lies in the fact that the director resists the temptation to edit and simply allows us to separate the magnetism and elegant passion of this icon. It seems that inevitably there is a repetition between the Portuguese fado and the American blues. <br /> <br /> Documentary films in the best possible way bring us to a previously unknown reality. and having received this glimpse, we are transformed. <br /> <br /> Abrigado, Sr.de Almeida
