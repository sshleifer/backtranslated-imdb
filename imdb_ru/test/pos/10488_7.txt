I was unfamiliar with this film until I saw that it was included in the list of the 20 best westerns of spaghetti that I had recently encountered (after the marathon I had done in the last few weeks from a sub-genre movie); then it was favorable that the film should have appeared almost immediately on the night Italian television program (for the first time, I am sure, many years later)! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the cable reception of the channel on which it was broadcast has not been good lately: I recorded the film on VHS, but decided not to leave it because of this factor; As soon as this happened, the very next day, when I watched the film, I discovered that it was available on DVD-ROM of Region 2 from Italy (with an interview with uncredited screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi) - and, being quite impressed, I decided to order it here and then, even if I knew I wouldn’t get on DVD for a long time, because I like to spend time between watching a movie and watching a movie! A brief bracket is here: when I recently bought a series of spaghetti westerns on an Italian DVD, I decided not to order SERGIO SOLLIM FACE TO THE FACE (1967), since I had the impression that it was a naked novel; however, I just found out that the disc actually contains an interview with the director (as was the case with THE BIG GUNDOWN [1966], which I bought). It seemed to me strange that Sollima would not offer such a contribution to the publication of this film on DVD, when he actually viewed FACE FOR THE PERSON as his favorite work (according to the biography of the director’s talent included in the Blue Underground Region 1 disc of yet another Solgim ​​spaghetti) Western - RUN, HUMAN, RUN [1968]); The trouble is that I loved THE BIG GUNDOWN so much that I followed her, watching FACE TO FACE through the record I owned on Italian television! I ordered the DVD of this film now - especially since it is still at a discount - but, as I said with regard to the second look at the PRICE OF POWER (although I can still check the interview with Sollima when the disc arrives) ... <br / > <br /> Okay, he ranted: the film in question was a rather unusual spaghetti western and very interesting, really ambitious, because it transfers the case of the assassination of John F. Kennedy to the situation in the Old West! In fact, this is reminiscent of Anthony Mann’s short black and white thriller “TALL TARGET” (1951), which described the assassination attempt on the life of the then-US President Abraham Lincoln. It features one of the most popular Italian stars from this subgenre, Giuliano Gemma, in what is probably his most impressive role in the West (many of his other films tended to be lighthearted). The supporting cast includes at least two other famous personalities: Van Johnson (in one of his few and mostly unremarkable Italian films) as the American president who was killed in Dallas after the civil war, and Fernando Rey as the head of the conspiracy Southerners — who are not only planning to kill him, but also conveniently maneuver the new acting American leader, Vice President Johnson, through blackmail! <br /> <br /> Benito Stefanelli also makes a good impression of a corrupt sheriff stalking Gemma throughout the whole picture and with whom he participated in a “duel in the dark” a couple of times - with weapons lying on the floor rather than in the corresponding holsters, and the only light in the room that cowboys give cigars ends! Also involved is Ray Saunders in the role of black mate Gemma, whose narrative eventually turns into a doomed figure "Lee Harvey Oswald." Stelvio Massi - who later cut his teeth as a director, in a number of poliziotteschi - is behind the film’s vivid cinematography; In the same way, Luis Enrique Bacalov delivers another great EuroCult score - which is quite different from Ennio Morricone's style to be equally distinguishable. The direction of Valery here can be as impressive as in other Westerns spaghetti, but he copes with the case quite effectively (the final shootout is especially good); the film is certainly one of the most under-rated subgenre recordings, and for those so inclined, the novelty of the storyline alone should make it look for ...
