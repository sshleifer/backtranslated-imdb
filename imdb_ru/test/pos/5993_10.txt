One of the two best films of the year. A well-made, well-written, well-composed film with an outstanding cast. Lau Ching Wan and his friends (Dayo Wong Chi Wah, Anthony Wong Chau Sang, Francis Ng Chun Yu, Jordan Chan Siu Chun, Chung Man Tat) had a great chemistry before the film and their friendship shows in their speeches. Theresa Lee plays her comedy role well (although she is very similar to the female version of Michael Wong, her gag seems to be a Chinese woman of foreign origin surrounded by local HKers), and I found myself enjoying innovative explosive scenes, which I didnâ€™t do when I started from 1. boy fans adopted alt.asian films and 2. John Wu hard-boiled. Of course, the final was expected, but I feel better cheering on the cops than a group of young gang members. Very nice.
