Has the Angel of Death ever, like MIMSI FARMER, ever appeared on the Barbet Schroder heroic opus of the 1960s? Like Jean Seberg with subcutaneous administration. Pink Floyd score. Despite some ultimately minor weaknesses, the classics unabashedly torn by Erich Seagal / Noel Black for their inept JENNIFER ON MY MIND (1971), although Tippi Walker, who plays such a character, is very attractive to drug addicts in the last mess. MORE, however, is amazing, a great film about drugs of the 60s and, simply, an important document of its time. Very cult film, so join the cult. <br /> <br /> No American film then, as I recall, shows the same territory. MIMSY is an amazing archetype that takes it to the mythical worlds. Not for the faint of heart. Great sex scenes too.
