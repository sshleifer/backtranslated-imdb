Gerald (Richard Carlson) and Kitty (Veronica Hearst) have just finished celebrating an engagement announcement in France with family and friends when he receives a letter asking to visit the castle of the ancestors located in Scotland. Gerald's uncle was reportedly sick and asked to attend Gerald, the only heir. Gerald leaves for Scotland, leaving his future bride behind. A few weeks pass and he does not return. Concerned, Kitty sends telegrams, but does not receive a response from her fiancé. Four more weeks passed, and Kitty finally received a strange answer from Gerald, canceling her engagement and telling her to move on. Not ready to give up her relationship and seek answers, Kitty jumps on a plane and decides to pay a visit to Gerald. Her trip is accompanied by her balanced aunt Edith (Catherine Emery, known for her lead role in the classic chiller ISLE OF THE DEAD). When Kitty and Edith arrive at MacTeam, they immediately suspect that something strange is happening. For starters, Gerald seems to be at the age of twenty in a matter of weeks. Secondly, this once sweet and charming guy turned into a complete jerk, who repeatedly demands that they leave the castle and never return. When Edith catches a cold, Kitty uses this as an excuse to stay there to try to get to the bottom. <br /> <br /> Why is Gerald so cold and cruel to the woman he was just about to marry? Why is Gerald so against having a company? Why do house rules say that guests should be locked in their bedrooms at night? Why are guests not allowed to enter certain areas of the estate, such as Gerald's bedroom and a large labyrinth of hedge? And what makes these weird whining sounds every night? These are just some of the questions Labyrinth poses. The film actually works great, creating mystery and intrigue. You are genuinely interested in what is happening, and patiently wait for a decision to explain the strange events that are happening. And then THAT is happening ... I definitely do not want to spoil the finale of this film, because you better not know, but it takes one of the most incredible and incredibly strange turns I have seen in any film. In a sense, it's funny, but it also takes a pretty solid little b / w riddle and sends it straight to Z-Grade Schlock territory. And yet, this finale seems so out of place that you can hardly forget it as soon as you see it. <br /> <br /> Despite the finale (or maybe even partly because of the final), I really liked the strange bird. This is very talkative and slow movement throughout the execution time, but I managed to keep my interest on everything throughout. Directed by William Cameron Menzies (who made much more famous INVADERS FROM MARS that same year) is best known as Oscar’s twice-recognized art director, and his decorations are also really interesting here. At times, there is an almost silent movie, with modeling works for some exteriors, some painted backgrounds and rarely decorated interiors with very high ceilings. As in any other good castle, there are secret passages and long stairs. It also adds a few rubber bats on the strings for good measure. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors are a bit tough and clumsy, but I liked most of the actors. Hurst - one of those little-known and mostly unknown actresses who, unfortunately, never seemed to gain popularity, despite its beauty and talent. Emery, who also plays the narrator in the frames at the beginning and at the end of the film, is quite decent, like an over-educated and cautious aunt. My favorite, however, was Michael Pate as an ominous servant with gray hair, who makes this fun vertical zombie walk every time he climbs the stairs. Also on board in smaller roles are Hillary Brooke (who played a major role in Sherlock Holmes's riddle “WOMAN IN GREEN”) and Lilian Bond (“OLD DARK HOUSE OF KIT”). Of course, Carlson also starred in IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, CREATURE FROM BLACK LAGOON and some other horror films, so you have a good cast for fans of the genre. I say check it out!
