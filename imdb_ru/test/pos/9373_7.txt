Crossfire (1947) <br /> <br /> Great message, great symbolism, very good movie <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s hard to completely fail with Robert Mitchum, Robert Young and Robert Ryan when all three men lead, and directed by Edward Dmitrik, connecting a complex murder and detective yarn. This is reason enough to watch it once or even twice. <br /> <br /> You may need a second look to fully capture the plot, as explained (too much) or shown in the memoirs (also too much), because it is a little difficult without a good reason. But in general, it makes sense, and we see early (probably too soon) who the culprit is, and even why. <br /> <br /> In addition to the drama, well done in typical noar lighting and filled with those short jokes that make post-war films dramatic, they have a social meaning, an anti-Semitic sense of all of this. It borders on a sermon only once or twice, and this is obviously a very good moment to make us observe how it is done approvingly, and wait until the plot and the dramatic play take up the first row. What they are doing, especially Young, who is a brilliantly concise and patient detective, and Ryan, who is viciously believable and rude (Ryan is good at this, his typing is reasonable). Mitchum basically plays a diluted version of what he is known for, and the fourth well-known acting force, Gloria Graham, is gorgeous, short-lived, although a bit optional. <br /> <br /> Although the film is dominated by a sequence of events and a message, both of which grow in strength, in the process, it is really easy to observe only the lighting, camera work and action, including the classic battle scene that opens the first few seconds the film is all made with shadows. <br /> <br /> The soldier archetypes presented are very thoughtful, and this may be something that people were very familiar with at the time and may be related to anti-Semitism. The soldier in shock from the shells turned into a helpless (but still capable of it), a modest youngster without confidence (but capable too) and a weary, but seemingly capable veteran. And, of course, an evil, cruel soldier who is also a product of war. The latter is also the responsibility of society - even the army is doing everything possible to correct the injustice here, not only because they are criminal, but also because they come from the wear and tear of a long terrible war. <br /> <br /> The audience then, more than now, could really get it, but it is still appreciated there.
