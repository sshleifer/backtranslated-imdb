USA The film is like this: You take a nap on a long hot Sunday afternoon. Feel great when you close your eyes and let your worries dissipate. Soon you are lost in one of those intense lucid dreams where you know that you are sleeping, but you still cannot wake up - not what you want. You go with the flow, and soon you find yourself in some strange story about Alice in Wonderland, full of characters that you could not even dream of. They tell you all sorts of crazy things about war and peace, taking you through a journey into the past and even the future. <br /> <br /> Sleep is getting harder, and you feel that he is on a path that you cannot control. Maybe you want to wake up, so you try to open your eyes, but you can't. Now there is destruction, sadness, confusion and scary voices telling you that it can be true or false. You see images that flicker and change, and then become clear, but do you even want to see what your brain creates for you? <br /> <br /> At last you are lost in the world of myths and understand that the end has come. The end of the world and the end of the dream. Its end. What do you wake up? What are you going to do next? <br /> <br /> You might write this dream, because you know that dreams do not happen too often, and when they happen, better pay attention. <br /> <br /> Or maybe you open the beer and forget it all. Bad idea. Do not forget
