Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. This is the most unconventional film by Werner Herzog. He has no plot or story. Instead of history, we are given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. This is also not a documentary. Some of the people in this film are given instructions and lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages, and we see cars and people floating in the middle of the desert, which are not there, but hundreds of miles away are reflected like in a mirror. The use of music in this film is so brilliant - from Leonard Cohen, Mozart and the Three Ear group. Imagine Stanley Kubrick 2001: A Space Odyssey in the Desert; this is what this movie looks like. This film is so hypnotic that it can make you feel as if your spirit has left your body. Must see. This will change the way you watch movies. Rating: 10 out of 10.
