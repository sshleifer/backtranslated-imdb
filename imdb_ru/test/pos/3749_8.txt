A woman and her aunt are going to Scotland to find their evasive groom. This is a very vicious film due to its denouement, but until this moment it is interesting, well-played, creepy and with a subtle design of scenery (William Cameron Menzies, designed for 3-D projection). Veronica Hearst is charming and noble, like the chic Briton Marilyn Monroe, still in love with Richard Carlson, who hides family secrets in her forbidden castle; there are even bats in the bell tower! He moves slowly until the last extraordinary plot, when Hearst and her aunt (Catherine Emery, also the narrator), do not make their way from the castle at night to go to the maze and find what they are looking for in its center. In childhood, I always remembered this sequence - there is nothing worse (or claustrophobic) than not leaving the 10-foot maze of hedges. Naturally, the two women broke up, setting the stage for an exciting wait with terrible music. The end result is really a little disappointing, as Carlsonâ€™s epilogue at the end makes sense for all the events that are taking place, even causing sympathy. Worth seeing.
