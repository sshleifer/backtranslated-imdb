Andaz Apna Apna is undoubtedly my second favorite comedy of all times, primarily Namak Halal (although technically it was a drama). There is nothing fundamentally new in history, but the complexity that is added to it makes it awesome. Aamir Khan is a total cartoon. Just look at his expressions in the song Yeh Raat aur yeh doori. He is amazingly good at comedy, I never knew. Salman Khan was also good as the duller of the two characters. The noises he makes are almost as funny as the faces of Aamir. Ravina and Karisma serve their purpose, but nothing surprising. The real choice is as usual Paresh Rawal. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, Amar (Amir) and Prem (Salman) are useless sons of poor fathers. They do not believe in hard work and just want to get rich in a simple way. Thus, both their brains came across the idea of ​​caring for the daughter of a rich man (Paresh Raval) (Ravina Tandon), who comes to India in search of a husband. Thus, Amar and Prem meet on a trip and team up to ward off hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl. When they succeed, now they have to get rid of each other. Somehow they both end up in the house of Ravina, Amar as a wounded boy and Prem as his doctor. From this point on, they try to push each other. But everything is difficult, because a friend of Ravina (Karisma Kapoor) falls in love with Prem and pursues him. And the evil twin brother of a rich man (also Raval) is trying to get rid of the heiress and her father so that he inherits the money and sent two of his most trusting but clumsy fools to do the dirty work. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you don't want to miss. Watch it! It will be worth it. I even have a DVD, that's good. And if you like this movie, I would also recommend Gol Maal if you haven't watched it yet. Other good comedies are Namak Halal and Hera Pheri (new).
