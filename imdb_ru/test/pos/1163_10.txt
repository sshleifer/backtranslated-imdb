When I watched a video for a local magazine, I called it "the greatest achievement in the history of American cinema." It was not quite a tongue on the cheek. TW & TL is Milius's best job, and it's sad that he has so few opportunities to work more. However, TW & TL remains a vivid exposition of what was once known as “American character”, largely due to the excellent image of Brian Keith Teddy R. “Rough riders”.) balance of action, levity, attitudes and the serious theme of America’s maturity in the world. In addition, TW & TL is extremely attractive in all areas: pay attention to the statistics showing that it is best suited for men under 18 years old, women from 18 to 29 and over 45 years old! Obviously, Candy Bergen was struck by the responsive chord of both women and men.
