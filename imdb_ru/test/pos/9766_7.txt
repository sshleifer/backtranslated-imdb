I ran to the library to check out this mini-series after I had just finished listening to the wonderful “talking books” without an abbreviated version of the book. The first half of this television version is really very good, but in the second half it stumbles a bit. The relationship with the guardian is overestimated, and conflicts arise between Jin and Joe, which are not found in the story of the Jester, in my opinion, it is unwise because they significantly reduce the power of their love story. I was disappointed to find that Joe, the wonderful Brian Brown, seemed much more impudent and much less attractive than the man in the book, but Jean Helen Morse was really quite good. I think they would have to make it a 10-hour miniseries to properly develop the outback history. But, despite all this, I watched it all more or less at a time and appreciated its virtues, all the while wanting someone to do a less soapy remake.
