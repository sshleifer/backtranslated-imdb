A £ 3.50 DVD can be gambling, and it was a kind of game. <br /> <br /> A decent Saturday Night movie, which is entertaining if you disguise the obvious plot flaws. The special effects are few and few with some repetition (and why does London always look like it was in the 60s?) <br /> <br /> If he had a budget, say, Armageddon, then I am sure in “Box office "it would have seemed better, since the story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> In general, Tycus is dedicated to the history of film B, but if you watch it for £ 3.50, then it’s worth buying.
