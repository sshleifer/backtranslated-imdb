Dolelemite (1975) is a cult classic. Starring Rudy Ray Moore as a superhero pimp with the wrong rights, while challenging the MAN. He has two enemies, this is not a good Willy Green and nasty mayor. Watch as Dolemaite kicks, hits him in the face and hits him on the screen. What is this man's name? DOLEMITE! <br /> <br /> An interesting film that paved the way for a generation of rappers and performers. To sell more of his party albums, Rudy Ray Moore made several on cheap films during the seventies. Independently produced and sold, he served a certain audience. Some people call it black prey, others call it garbage, I call it interesting. Dolemitom was followed by the semi-sequel “The Human Tornado” and the direct video “The Return of Dolemit” 25 years later. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, classic iconic classic! <br /> <br /> Footnotes, if the video properly glue the video, you will not see booming microphones. Dolemite was reduced to get an R-rating.
