A GREAT MOVIE! Chucky is definitely the funniest character in the movie. Jennifer Tilly (Tiffany) makes this movie even better! Long before his death, Chucky Tiffany and he were together. But, like ten years later, Tiffany returns Chuckie (like a doll) and brings him back to life. It was a great movie! Scary and definitely funny (just because Chucky!) 10/10
