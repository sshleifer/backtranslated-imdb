Not much to say, other than just a masterpiece. This film contains many messages that everyone should take to heart. especially - women do not destroy your man’s dreams — their honor is why you loved him first! Those who are planning to die will live in a grave. Those who die will awaken those who live in fear. Even our Lord spoke of this when he punished the one who buried his talent in fear that he might be mistaken and cause Master's discontent. Take a chance, get out of the boat and you will walk on water. Life is a journey that ends not in the grave, but in our minds and souls.
