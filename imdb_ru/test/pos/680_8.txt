I see that the ratings of this film are not so high for this film, so I should be in the minority for the fact that he likes this film so much. Well, I'm right, and everyone else is wrong (just kidding). I think I like it, because I am a psychology teacher, and I really liked the thoughtful character that Ryan plays. Although he is really dangerous and VERY dreadful, you will definitely not be able to hate him, because he is obviously mentally ill and probably suffers from some kind of brain injury. And wow, Ryan did a really good job portraying this man! You really feel that you feel for Ida Lupino when he ruins her life. So with such an intense acting and threat, why is the film rated relatively low? Well, probably because it is not quite believable, but, man, this is interesting and creative. Try and do not believe the score 6.4 - this is much better!
