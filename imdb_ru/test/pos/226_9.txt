The creative team that brought us the police squad - and the “Naked Gun” derived from it - said in an interview that their online contact reported that the show would be canceled after the release of the first episode. In fact, the show was never given any chance. Typical Hollywood. Contact apparently told the team that the problem with the show was that in order for the show to be fun, the viewer really needed to watch it; Most of the shows are broadcast on TV with the understanding that the viewer needs to get up and skip a few minutes while eating, going to the toilet, etc. the universe in which the characters live is the one in which everything can happen, regardless of logic, as long as it is completely unbelievable; for example, in one episode, the surgeon must bribe an informant on the street to get advice about heart surgery. <br /> <br /> Those familiar with the Naked Gun movies should be warned that there are a number of interesting disconnects between the show and the movies. In the films, Nielsen developed a special “take” approach - that is, his eyes widened when faced with the unexpected. This does not happen in the series, where Drebin Nielsen is the center around which the rest of the universe revolves - for him there is nothing unexpected. Also in the show there are no romances and parodies on MTV. Finally, the show takes on certain risks that films avoid; In the first episode, Drebin, “to act out a crime,” has a group of murderous detectives who shoot each other from different points of view - ballistics is a difficult task. This is actually a risky humor, as we have to admit that the police completely kill each other during the investigation of the crime, and this is for nothing more than experiments. Such things rarely happen in movies. <br /> <br /> In every single episode, everything is funnier than in any movie “Nude Gun”, since both of them are more compact (more happens in a shorter time). -frame), but still more leisurely pace (not the rush rush, as is sometimes the case in movies). There are some inconsistencies that occur in films (mostly “2” and “3”) that never occur in the shorter time frame of the show. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is no doubt that Naked Gun (the first film) is one of the great comedies of theatrical cinema. And if you watch an episode of a TV show after an episode in one sitting, the dry quality of humor can weaken your tolerance. <br /> <br /> However, it would be useful to have a DVD with this, and watch the episode a day for a few weeks - if laughter has, as some claim, medicinal value, watching this show is good for health.
