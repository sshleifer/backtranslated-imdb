Okay ... it's 2005 now, and when you finally watch this film, you will probably say that it is outdated. But the fact of the matter is that the script was bold, that at that time the music industry was equally bold, and it took some time to ensure that the music created by African Americans was promoted at the same level. how whites act. In some cases this is the case - but as early as the 1970s, this film touched on certain “prerequisites” that many did not even know about. Now we have “American Idol” - “Pop Idol” and other similar things that allow us to penetrate the minds of “record managers” and how they think they should sell what is for sale, not market talents. <br /> <When I was a kid, I loved the release of Earth, Wind and Fire "This is the way of the world", which contained some of their main hits: "Shining Star", "Reasons", "Yeanin ', Learnin'" and the title . Little did I know that it was an SOUND FILM ... until I moved to Los Angeles and received a wonderful Z channel. <br /> <br /> Channel “Z” showed this film as part of a “Harvey Keitel” retrospective. Gee, I had no idea, Harvey Keitel REALLY so many films - and when I saw this, I was surprised. This film is not a cinematic masterpiece, but it deserves more than it received. This is a good little movie. Harvey Keitel is not just "vanity" for Earth, Wind and Fire. He does an excellent job, trying to "fight the system." From this you can draw a lot of lessons and a lot of “insider” trading. <br /> <br /> If you can find it uncut ... it's worth seeing.
