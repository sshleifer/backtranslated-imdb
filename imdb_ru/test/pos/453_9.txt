As a big fan of Dostoevsky, I have always been disappointed by indecisive attempts by Hollywood to feel the Russian romantic aesthetics, in particular, Yul Brynner as Dmitry Karamazov. I thought that the whole problem was in bad decisions on casting, but then I saw Yula major Surov and changed my mind. When he was given a clever script for work, he suddenly came to life and became as noble, sexy and controversial as you might ever want to be a Russian neurotic officer! Thus, he was the best Dmitry as Major Surov, than he was like Dmitry. But this is because the writer Tabori actually gave Yul, as a Conflicting Russian Officer, the kind of Conflicting Russian Officer who is worthy of real literature and has real meaning and pathos. For example, a proposal for folk music, he thoughtfully says: â€œYou hear a person crying in the dark. And if you listen carefully enough, you know what he is crying for. You will be surprised, Lady Ashmore. Despite the fact that you may have heard "Russian tractors and Marxism - not the only thing that worries Russian. There is always time for music. <br /> <br /> Great !!
