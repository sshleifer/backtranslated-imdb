This is easily one of my favorite musicals of all time. Bette Midler is as close to real magic on the screen as everyone else is, moreover, like a lush, busty, bold and very scary Gypsy mother Li. It evokes a feeling of despair, which is sometimes both comical and tragic, but always sincere and quite beautiful. Such a charm and sand she really is a woman pioneer without boundaries. This border is open to children. Who, in turn, must create their own world, ruled by their domineering mother. <br /> <br /> This particular version, as I understand it, fully incorporates Jerome Robbins' brilliant choreography and original stage directions.
