Dirty dancing is one of my favorite movies. I only looked at ABC twice, because I did not have the opportunity to buy it or rent it at Blockbuster. I did not know that Jennifer Gray was 27 years old when she was making a film because she was very persuasive in her teens. Compared to some women in Hollywood, she has a very flat chest, which is why I was so easily fooled at her age. Thus, both physically and emotionally, Gray plays a great teenager. I also loved dancing - who would not be? Both times I watched “Dirty Dancing”, all the time I wanted to see dance lessons. I also like the soundtrack, and I recognize some songs from eight or nine years old. I LOVE to be able to watch this in my drama class, and I'm going to ask my teacher at some point if there is any part of the film that he can use for educational purposes. This is much better than what he made us look last year. And the final was absolutely FANTASTIC. This is one of the best moments in the film. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that I look forward to the first day of returning to school because of the "dirty dancing"! Who could ask for a better influence from a movie with that title?
