Plot: Michael Linnette Connors did everything in the films, except the direct one, and is looking for his first big chance. He discovers Molly in the play and immediately knows that she will become a big movie star. He signs her a contract with the condition that he should supervise. The producer agrees, and their big career is in full swing. This is followed by a re-creation of the era of silent films and early sound films with a greater emphasis on comedy. And oh, yes, there is romance, and a little sadness too. The speeches of Don Amech and Alice Fay are top notch. Music is a real plus, with some old familiar melodies. This renovated version, released in 2008, also has many additional DVDs. It should be emphasized that this film is the first story, and not just a tribute to silent films. In subsequent years, similar films will appear, such as Singing in the Rain (1952) and Dick Van Dyke-Carl Rainer, Comics (1969). What is special about this film, however, is the re-creation of silent films in 1939. We see parts of them, like moviegoers in that bygone era (although some sound effects are included) in gorgeous black and white, and the rest of the movie in its original color. One of the greatest in the silent era, Buster Keaton, who at that moment was on the rise uphill, is beautifully used in 2 silent, recreated film scenes, and he is on top of his game! It is said that he also contributed to his scenes. But the real reason to watch a movie, if you're a fan of film history, is that, among other things, the Hollywood Cavalcade is the legacy of Mac Sennett's film. You don't need to be a genius to understand that this film is the “positive” reworking of Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand. The character of Michael "Linnett" Connors is Mac Sennett, whose real name is Michael Sinnott. And Molly, of course, Mabel. Sennett had cake throws, bathing beauties and Keystone cops. He worked with Buster Keaton, Ben Turpin (cameo), Roscoe "Fat Man" Arbuckle (double) and fell in love with his lead lady. Not only all this, but Sennett was the technical adviser for this film and appears in it as well. Since most viewers today prefer sound effects, those who were associated with short plots and silence were left on pasture. Since Mac Sennett fell into this category, fortunately there is the Hollywood Cavalcade! Sennet, of course, greatly contributed to the development of comedy in cinema. His career began in 1908 as an actor, then a writer, director and producer. He retired in 1935, having about 500 films. He worked with the best, such as Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, Bing Crosby, Washington. Fields, Keaton, Harry Langdon, Arbuckle and even Roy Rogers (in Up Up Ap Tar). Since comedy about movies is an extremely difficult way to continue his entire career, Mack played it wisely and only did selective work for the next 25 years. In 1931, he received the Academy Award in the category of short subjects, and in 1937 for his working life. In the 1940s, his presence was still felt, for example, Here Come Co-Eds (1945), where a scene is recreated from the oyster soup used in Wandering Willies Mack (1926). In 1947, The Road to Hollywood used some of Sennett Crosby’s films. After 2 years, there was some nostalgia for the film Down Memory Lane, in which he participated. With his ability to always communicate with the right people, the guest role with the ever-popular Lawrence Welk and his radio show appeared later this year. 1950 brought a reissue of his greatest triumph, Punctured Romance Tilly (1914) with sound. In 1952, he was awarded the honor of television "This is your life," then his autobiography "The King of Comedy" (1954) was published, which is a great addition to the Hollywood cavalcade. The year 1955 brought a more concrete connection with Abbott & Costello, as he had a cameo at the A & C Meet the Keystone Kops. Finally, in 1957, another tribute to the compilation of the film “The Golden Age of Comedy.” So when you watch Hollywood Cavalcade, this is the legacy of the pioneer movie. In a movie on a banquet scene, a camera shows guests at a long table. When we get to the gray-haired Mac, he alone turns his head to the camera, as if to say: "Here I am!". When he rises to give a speech after a while, he in his depressed state underestimates the words given to him, as if mentally expressing: “I know that my influence on comedy will never end, but people will forget Mac Sennett, man. Maybe this movie will help. "
