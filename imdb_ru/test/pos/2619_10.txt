I'm not going to talk about it, but I'll just do it briefly. mostly for those who donâ€™t know how Prue actually died ........... The first time a demonic killer comes to life, he hits Piper and Pru with an energy ball that they fly through the wall blood everywhere. Phoebe, the third sister, descends the stairs, utters a spell that sends him off, but does not win. (NEED POWER THREE) The lion comes, heals them both and so on. they strip along the line, and the only way to save them is to have a demon named Tempus, to turn back the clock. the only way he can do this is that Phoebe remains in the underworld. she agrees, tempus reverses time. now again around 7:00 in the morning. The demon strikes Piper and Prue with an energy ball. they fly over the wall again. but this time Phoebe is not going to cast a spell to ward off the demon. the demon kills the doctor. the doctor flies through the window. He is dead. The demon goes in a wing-like whirlwind, and the glass on the doors is broken, which is a great effect, by the way, there is an airy sound. that's where it ends. NOW .......... that the whole world does not know if they did not pay attention to the next episode. although what I am going to say was not shown what would happen, believe me ................ because this time there was no Phoebe to summon Leo, this time he arrives later. Piper survives because her injuries are not as fatal as those of Prue, and Leo heals her before Prue, so by that time Prue is already dead. There the secret is solved. Call to Prue with the spell should have worked !!! and she should have unexpectedly appeared in the last episode. Ok i wandered around
