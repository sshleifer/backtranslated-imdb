We really liked this movie. He did not try to be outrageous, controversial, clever or deep. It was just entertaining and, as said on the box, a charming romantic comedy. It seems that any other British director wants to change the world, it's nice to see one that just concentrates on telling about a good yarn in an elegant style.
