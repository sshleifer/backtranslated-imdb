I have seen this film several times and consider it very convincing and sad. The lack of real emotions in most characters is very disturbing. They seem empty, hopeless. The story is based on real events. <br /> <br /> A teenager killed his boyfriend for no apparent reason - apparently, he just wanted it. Then he brags about it to his friends and, since they donâ€™t believe him, he takes them to look at the body - several times. Nobody reports the murder. There are two strong leaders - Keanu Reeves and Crisp Glover - the character Crispore Glovers is seriously annoying. <br /> <br /> Keanu's character, Matt, seems to be the only one who has a sense of good and evil. This is Keanu at his best - flawless work and very believable - anyone who thinks that this person cannot play should watch this movie. Matt's younger brother is perhaps the most disturbing character in the film. Only twelve, and in his life there was neither compassion nor a love factor. It is very sad to think that there are such children. It really makes you grateful for what you have. 9/10.
