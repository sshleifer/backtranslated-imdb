This film tells about the crew of a spacecraft, which falls on a strange bright planet with three suns. Among the passengers convicted serial killer Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel) and his sworn enemy Jones (Cole Houser). While the survivors of the crash begin to navigate, an eclipse of all three suns occurs. Shortly thereafter, terrible creatures begin to appear and begin to select the crew members one by one. During the eclipse, Riddick comes to his senses, as his eyeballs were surgically illuminated, giving him night vision. The crew is forced to rely on him to try to secure them. <br /> <br /> This is a very stylish film in which the color of the sky changes the scene behind the scenes, and it looks very strange. Vin Diesel is great as Riddick, truly formidable, but forced to help people who would otherwise see him as a threat. It also features humor, which adds another dimension to the character. This is the role in which Vin surpasses, an antihero whose character is not as one-dimensional as it seems at first glance. I can not imagine anyone else in this role, it could have been written specifically for him. <br /> <br /> Drop the Chronicles of Riddick!
