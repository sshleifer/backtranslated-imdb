A year after the release of the average "House of Frankenstein", Universal released another Monster Mash, where all their famous characters would face off again. "House of Dracula" will reunite Dracula, a creature of Frankenstein and the Wolfman, which will be their last battle, and finally close the era for the studio. Directed by Erle C. Kenton, "House of Dracula," is a small but noticeable improvement over the previous film and offers a better constructed (albeit still erroneous) story that, although far from perfect, is a more suitable ending than the previous one. film. . <br /> <br /> History ignores most of the events of the previous “House of Frankenstein” record and introduces a new look at history. Earl Dracula (John Carradine), tired of having to hide in the sunshine, asks for help from a brilliant scientist, Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), a doctor who is known for his research in biology. Edelman admires Dracula, and soon begins an experimental treatment, in the meantime, Larry Talbot (Lon Cheney, Jr.), The Wolf Man, visits Edelman to get rid of his curse. Soon, Edelman realizes that Dracula is a monster that needs to be destroyed, but his own exposure to Dracula’s blood also makes him sick. Finding a Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange) in nearby catacombs will cause even more turmoil to a brilliant scientist. <br /> <br /> After the previous clash of monsters, it's nice to see that the series goes back to the roots and delivering almost direct gothic horror, returning to the dark pessimistic nature of this kind of films and moving away from the comic relief of previous recordings. There are many interesting themes in the story (Edward T. Lowe Jr.), such as the contrast between Dracula and Talbot (both are looking for a cure, but with different goals) and Edelman’s growing madness. Probably one of the most interesting topics is the inclusion of the character of Nina, a magnificent but deformed woman who helps Dr. Edelman to hope to recover from her condition. <br /> <br /> Director Earl S. Kenton is back again and this time he finally reflects the dark nature of these three characters, a nature that was obviously lost in the previous film. Despite the low budget, Kenton creates a gothic horror that is simple but effective, and even manages to introduce old partners to such characters in new ways. Although “House of Dracula” never reaches the level of the originals, it restores the charm that Universal Studios used to have horror films, and Kenton guarantees that at least for the last time monsters will get a chance to shine. <br /> <br /> This time the cast is very good: Carradine, Cheney and Strange reiterate their roles (although the role of Strange is much smaller) with more enthusiasm than in the previous film. Adding Onslow Stevens, Jane Adams and Martha O'Driscoll to the cast returns tragedy and drama to the show, and Stevens plays a terrific role as Dr. Edelman. A small cameo of Lionel Atville and the presence of Skelton Knags as the creepy Steinmyul in one of the best actors of the universal horror film in recent years. <br /> <br /> “House of Dracula” - a great addition to the series. especially after the mediocre "House of Frankenstein." However, it is nice to see Kenton fit in some serious horror film, and, although the plot is quite original, it suffers not only because of the budget, but also because the film is trying to do a lot in a very short time with poor results. It is true that all the characters have very inventive storylines, but the film is given very little time for their development, and the film seems very hurried and disunited. <br /> <br /> Although he is far from perfect, he is also not the worst of the series. “House of Dracula” is the perfect end to one of the best times for the horror genre, a time when ghosts and ghouls roamed in foggy nights, and mad scientists gave life to disgusting monsters. Later, the monsters will return to Bud Abbott & Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948), but this will be a completely different context. after disappointing previous entries, it is easy to reject “House of Dracula”, but give it a chance and let the monster wander for the last time. 7/10
