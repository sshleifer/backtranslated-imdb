Family happiness collapses when rich father Ward (Michael Ontkin) from the very beginning becomes poor and can no longer support a family. Then mother Fei (Jacklin Smith) should take on the role of the breadwinner in the family and starts working to support the family, and at the same time, periodically, alone, should manage family life. Not always as good, but as good as she can. Family life is hardly easier when the father finds out that Lionel's son (Joe Flanigan "Stargate of Atlantis") is gay and lives with his lover John (Joel Grech "4400"), also an old family friend, with the result that his father clearly understand Lionel that he is no longer expected in the family. Lionel is the one who meant the most to his sister Anna (Leslie Horan) during her upbringing, because the family neglected her. Ann cannot bear the fact that their father cut the cords with Lionel, and so she ran away from home. Since this was not enough, the son Greg (Brian Krause "Enchanted") is enlisted in the marines and sent to war. The storyline in this film can sometimes seem a bit thin, despite the fact that it still has a lot of realism, which makes it worthy of attention. Since this film illustrates many sensitive relationships and situations, I would have believed that a mature audience would appreciate it best, even if it would not hurt adolescents to see it and think about something before adulthood.
