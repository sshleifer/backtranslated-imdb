Minnie and Moskowitz - the most miserable and ungrateful love story I have ever seen. Between Minnie, a frustrated museum curator, whose offended married guy leaves her and leaves her even more anxious and confused than she already was, and Seymour Moskovich, a valet who desperately needs attention, he spends the night going to bars and restaurants, annoying people from the very beginning is a chaotic and disappointed match. Like many couples that we see every day. <br /> <br /> In almost every love story, there is a man and a woman, and the man is confident, cheerful, classically hot or attractive in her own way, whose flaws are charming, and the woman is a wounded soul who can have any man, whom she wants, who chooses this guy because there is something in him. These films make everyone feel so good, because the characters embody what every man and woman wants to see, and not what they are. Minnie and Moskowitz, instead of indulging in any fantasy in the field of romance, portray people who may be more ordinary than attractive, self-confident people with so much experience playing on the field. What is the story of a love relationship with an ugly, anxiously awkward man who does not have the life and work that we all face, or a woman so exhausted by uncertainty that it is difficult to talk to her? <br /> <br /> This film is not as fascinating as “The Faces of Cassavetes” or “Opening Night”, but it has that exciting quality that Cassavetis always rendered so hard that it represents an unbridled image of people hiding behind the ego which is hidden behind almost all other films. Gene Rowlands and Seymour Cassel, delivering remarkably miserable people, are hardly cute. Moskowitz almost makes us crazy, not to mention Minnie. He imposes himself so strongly on her life that dates are an explosion of our inner voices that respond to shouting inept anxiety about dates we all went through, failures we all swallowed, and arguments we all had that we know , were our own mistakes. I admire such films as Minnie and Moskowitz, because, since this trademark is used in films made by Cassavetis, he identifies us with 100% honesty. Our ego plays no role in the company with its characters, thus a great achievement in the performance of the actor.
