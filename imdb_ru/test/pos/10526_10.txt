Unfortunately, this original mix of action and laughter is hidden from movie fans, as it is always rotting in the vaults of Colombia. Shame, because it may be the most powerful film of Jack Starrett, in which there is a witty script by young Terrence Malick and the fully realized performances of his two main characters, Stacy Keach and Frederick Forrest, who turn to criminal life to receive money for opening a seafood restaurant. Many prominent scenes include interrogation in the bathroom and an electric razor, as well as an intense exchange of fire in an abandoned building when a destructive ball blows it down!
