Note: I tried not to give out any important plot twists (or ending), but if you are concerned about this, think about watching the movie before reading on - Thank you! <br /> <br /> This was obviously a fairly high budget production, released by Paramount. The story follows the (presumably truthful) exploits of man-highway Jack Shepard in London in the 1700s. He was a locksmith who was blackmailed in the criminal life by the heinous “deceiver thief” to save his brother's life. After a double crossing by a thief-thief, we turn into a kind of figure of the type of Robin Hood and get the support of ordinary people. He continues to make shoots from several prisons (including the infamous "Newgate"), and also manages to "entertain" numerous noble ladies. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie, although the plot was a bit predictable. The film was shot in Glencry and Wicklow, Ireland, and the filming was very well done and seemed realistic. I think that Clavell captured London’s rather noisy atmosphere in the 1700s, and I liked his creative use of camera angles. And, unlike many films telling about this period, Clavell does not make any blows, showing us the deplorable conditions in which the poor lived (in one scene several people fight for meat pie that rolled through the mud on the street). <br /> <br /> Overall I really liked this movie. I admit that he lacks the marvelous landscapes and fundamental political commentaries that are in the following movie, The Last Valley by Clavell (the parable of the Vietnam War), but he still deserves one or two views. It is regrettable that he never (as far as I know) was released on video or DVD.
