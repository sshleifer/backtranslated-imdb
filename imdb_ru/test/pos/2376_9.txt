The third part of the trilogy "Dead or Living" Miike is also not associated with the first two parts, as they were with each other, more or less. Show that Aikawa and Ricki Takeuchi have returned to the main roles, but this time the film pushes us forward 300 years into the future ... after the apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Ricky plays a tough cop, a rapist for the extreme police policies of a corrupt city, and Shaw plays a tramp who joins a bunch of oppressed city rebels. The film must have been shot in Hong Kong, as most of the other actors are Cantonese speakers, among which the most recognizable faces are Terence Yin and Josie Ho. There is also a cascade HK team for action movie episodes that are very cool in the style of HK-via-Miike. <br /> <br /> This may be useful for a terrible low-budget B-film, but in Miike’s hands this, of course, becomes something more interesting. This is a rather slow, thoughtful film that squirms and does not try to force something to cut the throat of the viewer. The characters are rounded and interesting, and the plot is an interesting, but rather loose basis for the plot on which to hang the story. <br /> <br /> In general, a rather modest effort is up to the scenes that show Mike's growing skills in directing. and the choreography is very good acting. Watching the short film "Shows and Ricky" on wireline rigs is very exciting - you can say that they had a great time. <br /> <br /> The film finale tries to tie together 3 films of “Dead Or Alive”, which are completely unnecessary because everyone is truly self-sufficient. Miike's explanation of the connection is very funny, and the series finishes quite nicely. <br /> <br /> Not as deep or well developed as DOA2, not as outrageous and intense as DOA1 ... another good movie Miike though.
