After World War II, the relentless crime in Phoenix, Alabama, inspired by money from a military base across the river in Georgia, became even worse. Gambling, prostitution, usury and the like helped the organized criminal apparatus in the city. Soon it was too bad and cruel to endure. This film is based on the true story of this fight. <br /> <br /> By the standards of the 1950s, it was shockingly obvious. Despite the low budget, the same small budget helped with realism, requiring shooting on the spot. Very sandy movie. Richard Keely, as always, was marvelous, and John McIntyre impassive. <br /> <br /> Why this good movie is not filmed, this is a real puzzle!
