TROMEO & JULIET - TENTH ANNIVERSARY EDITION <br /> <br /> William Shakespeare’s play Romeo and Juliet has been interpreted hundreds of times on stage and in films. Sometimes literally following the original text (which is sometimes unclear in the stage instructions), sometimes in new interpretations, when the directors decided to show their view of the play. Some are good, many are mediocre. The film by Lloyd Kaufman certainly stands out as one of the most original, modern versions of the bard's creation. It can be placed in modern disintegrating New York and filled with modern antisocial behavior, piercing, dismemberment and strangeness sex (from which Shakespeare did not hesitate to read, but not too evasive), but at the same time he is incredibly close to the general feeling and meaning of the play which is quite difficult. Kaufman wrote the script along with his co-director in the film “James Gunn”, who is now known for having written two successful films “Scooby-Doo”, doing the impossible by creating the perfect remake of an already perfect film with his script for “Dawn of the Dead And the director. one of the best horror films of the year: Slither. Lloyd Kaufman’s innovative directorial view, along with an original and unlimited letter by James Gunn, gives an interpretation of the Shakespeare play, which perhaps not everyone will “get” immediately, but will certainly be recognized as a truly unique and extremely important look at the classic play. With a script written entirely on an iambic meter, the appearance of Motorhead's Lemmy and the incredibly strong soundtrack for the film Tromeo & Juliet is something that no one will ever forget. In addition to historical significance, Tromeo & Juliet is a treasure for all movie lovers. Not only for the script of James Gunn, who is now well influenced by Hollywood, working from the inside, but also because it has the early role of the legendary actress Debbie Rochon. It is well known to everyone who is familiar with films made on smaller budgets. The release of the 10th anniversary on the DVD complements all of this, including so many gems not yet discovered, that not only all the information you could wish for about the film itself and the experience of creating it is presented in such a way that it is impossible to turn it off. The DVD, as well as a very honest (and alarming) look, tells how independent cinema should survive these days. In many ways, the additional recordings on the disc are an invaluable addition to the already impressive amount received at the Kaufman film school "Make Your Damn Movie." More historical objects from Troma’s repositories, which include James Gunn, Debbie Rochon and all the other authors of this masterpiece, are included, and the film itself, in addition to looking better than ever, is accompanied by at least four audio commentaries, each informative, painfully funny and everything is done for a serious addition to the film instead of the boring and meaningless comments that are so often found today. There are new comments (one with Kaufman and Gann together), but also the one that James Gunn made for the original DVD release, but it could not be included due to some honesty, which he shows about some of the other people present on this disc. With a fan-re-creation of several scenes from the film, a video diary about Lloyd Kaufman's visit to the set of James Gann Slither and a visit to the two Eli Roth birthday parties at the hostel and many others, this is the final set everyone should own. Whether you are a film historian, someone interested in interpreting the works of the great Bard, a great movie fan, an independent film fighter, a James Gann fan who is interested in learning more about making low budget films, a fan of Lloyd Kaufman or something else : this is the most important DVD release of this millennium!
