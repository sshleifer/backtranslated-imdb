I wasn’t even born when this show was released in the USA. British television took about another decade. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was lucky to see the very first episode in which The Lone Ranger was one of the units that faced an ambush and slaughter TLR was the only survivor. Although he was seriously wounded, he was rescued by a passing Indian named Tonto. I believe that he was used to wearing a mask to hide his true identity because of the fear of reprisal. But instead, he made himself even more recognizable. I do not know if he wore it in a dream. <br /> <br /> This was the main drink of the Sabbath. The fanfare from the William Tella Overture anticipated the telly, and the food was still in hand. Although he very quickly became repetitive, predictable. No one ever exposed him. No one ever struck, no one ever replayed it. He was too good, and just too cramped in his dress for most children. Poor Tonto, on the other hand, became his aunt Sally. He was always beaten and tied up, kidnapped and all that. <br /> <br /> And how did he keep calling the Lone Ranger? King Savvy was a general consensus where I lived. It seemed that the Indian speak big know-it-all. But it sounds different, as if Mr. Silhilfs had a speech impediment. 'Kemosabe'; what the hell is this <br /> <br /> A later, less-sold duet called “Range Rider” and “Dick West” eventually won my vote. It was Jock Mahoney with a naked face, who was beaten quite thoroughly in each episode, and overall he was less lager, less super and more believable. <br /> <br /> however; even today I cannot hear William Tell's overture without waiting for the hoofs and the warm hi-silver hoofs. <br /> <br /> Divine stupidity.
