Was amazed at how even the game was everywhere. William Haynes had an acting range that is perfect for a silent film. Not on the edge. There are moments when camera work is most effective and is combined with the plot, for example, when he is waiting for a meeting with the superintendent, very well done. <br /> <br /> Thoroughly enjoyed the shoot. <br /> <br />
