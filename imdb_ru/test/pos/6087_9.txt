“The English Patient” can rightly be compared to the films of David Lin, whose exciting epic films such as Lawrence of Arabia and The Bridge across the River Kwai must have inspired director Anthony Minghella. The film is beautifully photographed and, like Lawrence, was shot in North Africa, but during World War II. The story is complex, but it comes down to a forbidden love between the self-confident and often difficult archaeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and the married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas. <br /> <br /> A story based on the novel Michael Ondaye recounts in the memoirs of Fienne “The Comte Laszlo de Almasi” - the title character. The fact that his name does not sound like an Englishman plays a key role in what is happening. He was badly burned in a plane crash that happened just at the moment when the film opens, and Hana, a military nurse played by Juliette Binoche, is courting him in Europe. What makes this story epic is the enormous coverage of time and place, as well as the development of characters outside of ill-fated lovers. The film clearly shows that true love and passion, even with terrible consequences, can make a life worthy of life or worthy of death. If you are a romantic at heart and can appreciate a movie without standard happy ends and simple moral codes, you may find that the “English patient” speaks directly to you. <br /> <br />
