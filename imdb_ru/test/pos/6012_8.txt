After showing five seasons on a small screen in 1976–1979, “George and Mildred” transferred themselves to the big screen in the middle of 1980. Instead of Johnny Mortimer and Brian Cook retaining their roles as writers, Dick Sharples was invited to work as a writer. Unfortunately, this adaptation of the film does not seem to hit the public point. A shame. I liked it better than the show itself. It was a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> Mildred Roper (Yuta Joyce) wants to find out if her untidy husband George (Brian Murphy) remembered her wedding anniversary. Obviously, he did not do this, but tried to convince his wife, otherwise he orders a table in a restaurant, where he offered to marry Mildred a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Upon arrival at the restaurant, they learn that the place has changed hands. In the end, seeing George’s lies, Mildred insists that they celebrate their anniversary in a posh hotel. Arriving at the hotel, George mistakenly deceived "Harry Pinto" (Stratford Jones) for the ruthless assassin who wants to destroy an opponent! <br /> <br /> Not an outstanding comedy as such, but a good-natured piece of fun anyway. The plans to revive the series after the screening of the film were sadly discontinued when, on August 24, 1980, Yuta Joyce died from alcohol poisoning. <br /> <br /> The funniest moment - George is talking to his favorite garden gnome. His neighbor Tristram creeps up behind him and says: “I think it's time for us to chat.” George, thinking that he had developed the power of speech, shocked the dwarf! <br /> <br /> Merry Christmas to other IMDb users, in particular AdamFontaine, Cyril Blake and TheLittleSongBird. Good luck to you!
