Want to know why the French and Italians love / hate each other? Would you like to have a look at the story that drives our lives? So, watch Virzi's film (in the original language, of course) and you can see the beautiful Monica Bellucci, who finally speaks her native language from Citt√† di Castello (Umbria, on the border with Tuscany). And the rest of the characters speak Livorno (sweet Sabrina Impassiore and all the rest). Daniel Othey is definitely in his place with Napoleon. Very fun, a real fresco with landscapes of Elba Island and a picture of political reasons to kill or leave the tyrant alive (for all times).
