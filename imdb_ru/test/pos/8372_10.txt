Sam Lyon (Jean Paul Belmondo) discovers that he needs to rest, as everyone around him is very dependent on him and put his own death. When he discovers that those whom he loved, and who still love, need, he turns to Albert Duvivier (Richard Anconin) to help them. In search of his past, his desires, this fabulous film by Claude Lelouch is the search for a man in adulthood. <br /> <br /> Constructed like all Lelouch films, the film begins with constant memories of being puzzling, especially the scenes where Paul Belmondo (who looks a lot like his father) is played by young Sam Leo, while Sam Lyon stands in the same room - a sequence of memories that takes a second to understand. <br /> <br /> One of the most difficult works of Lelouch, the L'itineraire d'un infant gate is a mandatory story of self-realization.
