I had never heard of this film when it was given to me for translation, so I did not know what to expect. I checked it on IMDb and I was curious. It did not take long to realize that this is a gem. Outstanding performances, great story, and it is well written and well written. It is difficult to compare it with other films, but “Stand by me” comes to mind, although it has as many differences from “The cure” as there are similarities. The tale of the extraordinary friendship between the young guys, as well as the dramatic and humorous elements are the most obvious similarities between this film and “Stay with me.” In addition, "The Cure" is an excellent film in itself, deserving wider recognition. It is dramatic, but also adventurous, sad, but also with humor. I can't think of one thing that bothers me about it. Having said that, I don’t want to create the impression that this is a “perfect film”, whatever that means, but rather that I really liked it, it was very moved and would not change anything in it. I will not go into a detailed description of the story / plot, partly because it will be too general or too indicative, and partly because you can find this information elsewhere on the site. In conclusion, I can only say: a wonderful film, watch it, if you have a chance.
