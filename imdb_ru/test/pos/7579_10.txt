I watched this movie several times, and with each view I still feel the excitement of starting the journey and the frustration of trying to overcome the barriers that hinder the way. It is more than a desire to find a home; It is about the most basic human spirit: to find your way in the world, to overcome despair, to meet the shortcomings of character that restrain our goals. At the heart of this human effort is the task of redefining the origin of life. While this film is imbued with serious ideas, there are enough comedic lines in it for viewers to be full of hope. This is amazingly funny. The execution of the storyline is excellent! It is all packed with visually appealing animations. Need to see. <br /> <br />
