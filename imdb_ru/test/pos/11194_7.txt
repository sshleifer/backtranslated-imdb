My interpretation is that the term "remote" is used in the sense of the opposite of "warm"; people who are not kind to others. The film reminds me of the teachings of the Dalai Lama in “The Art of Happiness,” where his main thought is that the key to happiness is connected with others. Not only are the characters in the film closed, but they also have no humor, charm, shyness, silence and unfriendliness. These characteristics do not seem to allow them, among other things, to form and enjoy relationships and be able to talk and solve their problems. And as a result, they are terribly unhappy. I think this is a strong confirmation of the teachings of the Dalai Lama (by the way, I am not a Buddhist). If you are one of those who believe that their behavior is the natural answer to life in a big city, then I think you might be right, but I recommend the book of the Dalai Lama. City life should not be like that. <br /> <br /> I understand why some people find it boring - it draws a little in some places, and the characters are not particularly pleasant. And this is different from the “Lost Translation”, where island symbols are much nicer and communicate with each other, even if they are not connected with people at all.
