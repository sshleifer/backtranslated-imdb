Since Mr. Bean almost never speaks, I wholeheartedly recommend using a DVD player when the teacher holds his finger over the pause / play button. At the end of a lesson of any age group, just devote 5 minutes to pause and play a DVD, encouraging students to shout out answers to the questions “What is this?”, “What will happen?”, “What is happening?”, “What is wrong? ? ", or any other question that causes answers from the new vocabulary and grammar of this lesson. <br /> <br /> As everyone is watching TV, usually shy students become vocals. Since the DVD can be started or stopped at any time, this the perfect “filler” for awkward “intervals” when students leave and arrive. <br /> <br /> I tried other DVDs, especially “Tom and Jerry” “Red Skelton cartoons and DVDs, but no one else was so good as "Mr. Bean", in the constant attention of students.
