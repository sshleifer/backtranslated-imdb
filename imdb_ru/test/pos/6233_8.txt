After a group of young friends have problems with a car while traveling on a beaten track, they accept offers of help from a lonely local Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors), the owner of a nearby museum filled with historic wax mannequins. Caught in a creepy roadside attraction, friends pursue a masked madman who can revive the museum’s mannequins with her spirit. <br /> <br /> The bad guy from the Tourist Trap is a crazy cross between the Texas Chainsaw Massacre Leather face and Anthony, a scary kid from the classic episode of the Twilight zone “It's a good life”, while the plot is a mixture of the aforementioned TCM, Hitchcock Psycho and House of Wax. However, the atmosphere and the performance of the Tourist Trap are so reckless that in this respect it is almost impossible to compare with other earlier films. <br /> <br /> The continuous inventive and unpredictable attitude of director David Schmeller to his own script gives the film a distinctly nightmarish quality and with a brilliant left field from Connors, an incredibly creepy account from Pinot Donajo, a collection of truly disturbing mannequins with removable jaws and the presence of super-sexy Tanya Roberts, who is a “tourist trap”, spends the film in tiny denim shorts and a figure hugging a pipe, and makes it completely unforgettable, and ultimately unique in its kind of horror worthy of his worship.
