These critics need to find a new job !!! This film is based on TRUE STORY, which has gone down in history. This beautifully illustrates how even in the fog of war and tragedy love can conquer all. Exciting Greek Chephallonia captured my heart and soul, as if I, too, were there. Blue-eyed Cage and the delightful Cruz were amazing! Together they beautifully portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can get closer only during a war. This film will affect your heart, like mine, you must watch it !!!!
