I also attended the RI International Horror Film Festival, and I can easily understand why this film won the best of the show. <br /> <br /> SEA OF DUST is a wild game of horror, comedy and beautiful landscapes. Back in time is a tale of strange events. An increasingly common disease with an extremely annoying side effect of an explosion of people's heads brings the apprentice to a young professor; Stefan, for investigation. During his travels, he decides to go round and ask for the hand of his longtime love in marriage for a short time, only to send her packing to an extremely stubborn father again ?? On the way out of town, he encounters a sick girl on the road and takes her to Dr. Maitland (brilliantly played by the ascending Vincent Price, as an actor: Edward X Young). foot. Only the doctor is offended by the fact that he called the professor and received only a boy in training. However, Stefan turns out to be much bigger than an ordinary observer. Horror icon; Tom Savini portrays the ultimate religious tormentor; Prester John. Queen of screams; Ingrid Pitt is retiring to play a star role in the role of Anna. Many beautiful and talented supporting actors organically combined the story and helped to effectively advance it to the climax. <br /> <br /> Dark Religion and everything else, but funny and sometimes very original, bloody scenes play a big role in this. Hammer tribute to tribute. This stylish film is about memories, surreal worlds, dreams and the reality of the character. <br /> <br /> Horror and Gore aside; This is also a very funny movie! Cotton, tongue and cheek, humor and dark comedy raise their heads among the dark storyline. As others have stated; it really is like three great movies in one. Very entertaining and original.
