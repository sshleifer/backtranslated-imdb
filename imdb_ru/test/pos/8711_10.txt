Words let me down whenever I want to describe my feelings for this film (and the sequels) ... Does it have flaws? Of course, this is so ... Starting with the "Subspecies" themselves, which were not performed well enough for a special effect. So why am I glorifying these films ??? For a flock of mass consumers who care more about quantity than quality, cheap fun more than depth, shit like a “blade” (it doesn't even deserve a capital letter), “underworld”, “Dracula” 2000 "," Dracula 3000 "and so on. D. - these are good films to chew popcorn and drink a couple of count ... What makes Subspeed an excellent effort for anyone who claims to be a Vampire fanatic, on the other hand, it’s obvious: Vampire himself - Romanian, the story unfolds in Transylvania (scenes taken on the spot, more than convincingly s), and the atmosphere is not based on any "active" chases or expensive orchestral music. Radu himself is the source of the atmosphere ... This is how a vampire should look, and this is how it should behave! Add a breathtaking dark castle with dark aisles in Romania , turn on some typical elements of vampires (for example, moving shadows on walls when vampires take flight), and you have a work of art! In short, if, like me, you are fascinated by vampires and feel that their appearance, as well as the setting must be sinister and dark and there is no better place to look than in the film about the subspecies ... Or the vampire journals brilliant way out of the former ...
