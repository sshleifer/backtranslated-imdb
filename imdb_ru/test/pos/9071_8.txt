A very intense, surprisingly intelligent film about five medical students who leveled themselves and then reanimated to share their experiences of death and of what is beyond. Joel Schumacher directs with some skill - creates some very creepy scenes, as well as especially beautiful ones. Visions of death are not what the audience expects, and not what awaits us all when we leave - thanks to screenwriter Peter Philardy, who really did an outstanding job of inventing this story. Although the creativity of the story is impressive, it also has many holes, especially in the field of logic and likelihood factors. Despite all this, Flatliners is a good, effective film because of the script, the director, who is sometimes very surreal, and the acting, which brings together four very talented actors and William Baldwin. This core of actors acts very well and reacts to each other. Keifer Sutherland does a very impressive job as a team leader - someone who comes up with the idea of ​​dying and being born again. He also manages to portray a man - a young man - with a destructive, destructive secret from his past. Kevin Bacon is good as the most pragmatic and skeptical in the group. Oliver Platt is really good as a voice of reason and human fears. Platt has really good lines and she plays paranoia well. Yes, Julia Roberts is also here, and very well. the actors do their best by playing with each other and making us believe that they are such good friends. I was properly impressed with many Flatliners, but the rest of the story most affected me the most. The scene with this dog, wandering around the street, caused only one of these strong images, like many of the scenes of “memories”.
