Ida Lupino was trapped at home by the crazy Robert Ryan in the RKO 1952 film “Be Careful, My Beauty.” Lupino and Ryan starred in three films together and worked well in a team, being unsurpassed professionals and strong performers. In this film, based on the Broadway play The Man, Lupino is a widow from World War I who rents a room in her house. She is very active and beloved in her community, and although her husband has been dead for two years, she is not ready to move on. The man who rents her room goes on vacation, and Lupino hires Robert Ryan to help her with some kind of heavy house cleaning. He is friendly enough to start, but later terrorizes her, locking her in the house and not allowing her to answer the phone or the door, as he becomes violent and more and more loses touch with reality. <br /> <br /> The character played by Ryan is shown at the beginning of the film, running away when he discovers a dead body in another house in which he works. It is unclear whether he is a murderer, as he seems surprised to see the body. He can be a split personality, because when his personality is ugly towards Lupino, he doesn’t seem to remember his activity when he leaves it. He does not know that he has the keys to Lupino’s house in his pocket, and he doesn’t know why he has tickets to the party he bought from young children who came to the door. <br /> <br /> “My favorite” is a very tense film, and the two main characters give awesome performances. Voltage rises to a very high level and ends in a way that you do not expect.
