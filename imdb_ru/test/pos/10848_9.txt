This BBC series is amazingly fun. I saw only a few minutes before I realized that I should own it and look at it again with all my friends. I would not recommend it to anyone, but almost everyone will like it - from a snob in a movie to the hungry to the entertainment of the masses. The main character is a lesbian, but still worth seeing if this is not your business. <br /> <br /> Rachel Sterling is incredible in the main role, which turns her into a dazzling set of emotions and situations, something strange nature. No one who saw this show ever said that she could not play. It makes us laugh, cry, wind up and slap our forehead in amazement. <br /> <br /> This story can not be compared with anything else. This is not a rehash of style or plot. This is a fully own beast, comedy, historical drama, erotic, the story of the age of majority, the musical and much more. <br /> <br /> I have to praise the BBC for creating this story. I can't imagine anyone in the (excessively sanctimonious and formal) USA ever doing this. So stop reading about it and go and buy it.
