Perhaps one day a film appears in the generation that is perfect. For me, “Children of the Railway” is a film, a classic, timeless, directed and performed in the most beautiful way. He portrays everything that stands in humanity and culminates in winning love and faith over cruel injustice. Each performance is a gem, although Bobby stands out, and, like Judy Garland as Dorothy before her, Jenny Agutter makes it impossible for us to represent anyone else in this role. <br /> <br /> The world is better this film and today's children would be much better to watch it. <br /> <br /> Of course, like many young people of my generation, I hopelessly fell in love with Jenny Agutter, and her grip was just as strong when I was lucky to meet her a few days ago - a charming smile and a voice that looks like dripping honey, they were still there to send me to their knees, as they did many years ago!
