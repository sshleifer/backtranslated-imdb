The ghost story of a typical Turkish school with pleasant sound and visual effects. As far as I know, Taylan Biraderler (brothers Taylan) made their first shots on a television show a couple of years ago. It was something like the Turkish X-Files, they had very good stories, but they lacked visual effects. This time it seems that they got what they need and used them well. This movie will make you laugh for sure, and may also scare you. It has a good plot and some young, vibrant actors in it. If you study in high school in Turkey, you will find here a lot of things about yourself. In the film a lot of clues about his story and ending, some you understand at the moment, some will make sense after the words, the dialogues were written very cleverly. Thus, they make the film one of the best films of the Turks, created in recent years. Do not forget, this film is the first of its kind in the Turkish film industry.
