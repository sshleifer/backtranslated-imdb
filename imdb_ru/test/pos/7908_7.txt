Difficult life becomes more difficult when three children of a single mother must be sent to separate foster families after her untimely death. <br /> <br /> To stay together, the older boy is planning a brave, risky escape to find a distant lost uncle - their only remaining nearest relative. <br /> <br /> Their path - three terrible escape in pursuit of the desert in the classic beetle, penniless, hungry, desperate, terrorized by criminals, too. young people to drive a car that is being hunted by constantly threatening civil authorities. <br /> <br /> The film lacks acting and plot realism; this compensates for the honest human need to be part of a full-fledged family. even if this family is paved with spare parts of ruined lives. <br /> <br /> Of course, the ending is forced and too dramatic for critics, but each heart beats with the same cry for family and belonging affiliation. <br /> <br /> Despite all the flaws, I still recommend this movie.
