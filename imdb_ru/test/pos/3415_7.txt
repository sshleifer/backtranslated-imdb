The red dust works well and is well done, but I think the film will tire many viewers like me. There was a film that used to be titled “in my country” with Sam Jackson, and he wasn’t so well received, and both films were about the same, I think Red Dust was better because of more interesting performances, especially Oscar winner Chevton Eiphophor, but the plot is simply not enough, it starts quite strongly, but then the film amazes the audience with countless uninteresting sessions in the courtroom, it could be a great film if there were no lack of writing. But look, if for performances.
