This is one of those films that look so "obsolete" that it is so funny. You see and hear things that you will NEVER see or hear on the silver screen today. This is partly good; some of them are too banal for words, some of them are bad (depending on your points of view on certain cultural issues). <br /> <br /> For example, in this short (68 minutes) film of 1931, you have: <br /> The grandfather of the family that is shown in this story extolling the value of patriotism and why you need to oppose criminals for the good of the United States (imagine that in today's films!) <br /> <br /> the District Attorney (Walter Houston) almost begged for the death penalty, and the population showed that it supported him 100 percent (again, imagine imagine that in modern films.) <br /> <br /> In the process of shocking violence, for example, when a boy is Raleigh several times and literally thrown head first into the closet, and his father picked up and throws his head repeatedly against the wall. This is a difficult thing, if not more. <br /> <br /> Yet the film is littered with comedy, mostly a patriotic grandfather, who was remembered by Charles "Chic" Sales. There is a lot of laughter for all those who watch this unique crime film. And, as for the soft touches, there are two young boys, one of whom - Dicky Moore - has become a fairly well-known children's actor in his time. Here he is only a small puppy of about five years of age, which, for obvious reasons, is far from being a polished actor, but you can see his fame on the horizon. In fact, he did it the following year with a solid performance in "The Blonde of Venus" with Marlene Dietrich in the lead role. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is a fascinating film due to an effective mixture of violence, comedy and sentimentality. .... and he has a pleasant, pleasant ending and thought-provoking. It was also for the Academy Award, also for "The Best Letter, The Original Story." I'm sorry to say that it is only available for viewing on cable television, since it has never been released on VHS or DVD ... and that is a shame.
