Almenabar again provided us with a high-quality film. This director is amazing, and he proved that he is equally talented and effective in crossing genres. <br /> <br /> The excellent character development in the film, thanks to the dialogues and personality quirks, but also with more subtle details (the look of Father Ramon), allows viewers to very closely identify with the main characters, making the importance and emotional impact of the events deeper. The visual design is sometimes simple, sometimes stunning (a dream to the beach), and I think that Almenabar films really benefit from the fact that he also composes music - this perfectly corresponded to the changing moods of the film. /> This is more than just a film about euthanasia, which is an important problem in itself, this film tells about the duality of a person who sometimes sincerely enjoys life (albeit in a very limited way), and yet he who steadily moves in his desire die. The stunning sadness of the film is emphasized by timely notes of humor, which seem more ridiculous, because they give the desired respite from the longing that you will certainly feel. <br /> <br /> While clearly in favor of euthanasia, this film works great, presenting many points of view of Ramon’s friends and family. Ramona’s father was most acute when he said in despondency: “There is only one thing worse than losing a child. That the child wants to die. " <br /> <br /> Excellent writing, acting, directing, cinematography, music - 10/10.
