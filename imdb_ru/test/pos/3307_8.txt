You can not take this film seriously ... The plot is predictable and banal, often acting, a ridiculous dialogue; but it all adds up to fun! Three “careerists” in the late 1950s fall into the BIG city and all the evil and temptations that their mothers probably warned about: married men, alcohol, premarital sex, abortion, etc. > Then there is Amanda Farrell (Joan Crawford), who succeeded professionally, but whose personal life was sacrificed for an office with her name on the door. <br /> <br /> This movie may have been believable 50 years ago, but now it's just great fun! Rent / buy and enjoy.
