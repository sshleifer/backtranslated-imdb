I like this movie. I was not sure what I was talking about before I started watching it, but nevertheless I liked it. It was about a girl (Meredith Monroe), whose mother did not want her to be like her. She meets and falls in love with a boy (Riley Smith), who comes to the city for a charity football match. This is a good movie. I just hope that it will be again or will be released on video.
