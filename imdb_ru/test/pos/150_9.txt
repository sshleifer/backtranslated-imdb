The great thing about the last movie of Canak Park “Thirst” is that it is anti-Twilight. Some of you may see this as a minus, but in fact this is a big plus. Pak is serious about the method of vampirism, as well as the hot love story between Sang-Heon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflicts of both characters - Sang Heon, who is a priest who is undergoing a medical experiment, which, imperceptibly for him, turns him into a painful, but truly blue vampire, and Tae-Ju with her mother and "idiotic" brother, the latter is killed by Sangs as in a very strong melodrama. There is nothing terribly deplorable or insipid with history and characters at any moment, and the consequences put forward by religion at an early stage (for example, Sangha is considered a kind of healer, as he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism, even if he simply cannot be knows this) In addition to those who speak of good and evil, cinematically raise it to another plane. <br /> <br /> This Thirst also rises to an amazing level of craftsmanship that the Park has shown with Oldboy, Lady Avenger and an underrated me - Cyborg, but It is good, should be taken for granted. Thirst is a film with a juicy narration and bizarre suburban characters, shot and edited with an eye to the mood, partly satirical, partly romantic / erotic, partly dramatic and, finally, fantastic. And it does not always consider the vampirs as something simple in creating a horror movie (although, like in a horror movie, Park has more than his share of scary scenes). This is more like the movie “Around Darkness”, in which the word “vampire” was never mentioned, but you knew what it was, and treated it with sincerity and a kind of conscious attention, and that the disease itself and its influence on human existence perhaps worse than murder or bloodshed. As soon as you see how one vampire jumps very high or heals wounds, you see them all. <br /> <br /> Thirst also has an evil sense of humor, very similar to Oldboy, only here with a bite (pun). are intended) to emphasize bizarre physical states of being. An example of this would be the detection of the Priest's attachment to sucking blood from people in a coma, taking their blood tube and sucking them on the floor. Or the way Te-Joo clings to one piece of humanity, supporting her mother’s life, even though she has a bit of a stroke, and she can only blink her eyes and tap her finger to react to the bloodsuckers and horror in her house. But these moments are like icing on the cake to make it a complete experience. What the latter craves in the mind is how elements come together, drama and existential pain, a Bunulian-surreal sense of Catholicism (I especially liked the dynamic between Sang-Heon and another priest who gives his hand for bloodsucking, but in fact also wants to be a vampire) and erotica: the scenes in which the priest is finally inferior to Te-Ju are incredible in terms of speed and duration of shots, as well as truly real. Not in a pornographic manner, but in the sense of the release of these characters and run, which does not last long above the frame of the plot. <br /> <br /> If it’s not as big as Oldboy, it’sn’t something to complain. Not all the films that Chanuok Park leads will reach the level of his masterpiece (and at least he will always be known as the man who shot this movie). But Trist is a great addition to his work and to the serious series of vampire films in general. Shooting the film is clear, exciting and even dangerous (and in what white room of the daylight there are heroes!), Humor is dark and funny, the acting skills are intense and capricious - especially from the subtle punches from Song Kang-Ho, and strange evil, and amazing Vulnerability from Kim OK-vin, and the finale, when he finally gets, is one of those truly excellent endings of a vampire movie that you’ll talk about for years, in a good way. In the battle between Thirst and Twilight, Thirst gets knocked out in the first round. Meanwhile, in order to let the right into the near darkness, it is more difficult to call. 9.5 / 10
