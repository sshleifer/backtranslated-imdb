Even from the very beginning of the title of this film, I really love the design and canvas of one of the national islands of Japan. We see large hilly green hills and some eastern houses of the coastal city. Instantly we look at the Pacific beauty on the widescreen theater screen. And to prove how good this film is, I have to say that Charles Darwin will be proud. Teachers in evolutionary and school science classes, such as biology, would fantastically prefer the new Hayao Miyazaki film entitled “Ponyo”. The title character, as you will see, can be the ideal animated icon for media to be presented in all classrooms and classrooms. <br /> <br /> In addition to the scientific aspect of all this, let's dive into the blue waters of this exciting story. We have a thin, old and powerful sorcerer named Fujimoto who lives in the underwater world and cynically related to the urban expansion of humanity and the pollution of industrial waste. He wants to have complete control over the seas and a pretty peaceful aquatic life, including fish and organisms. Fujimoto, whose blood consists of demihumans and half amphibians, resembles both antiheroes and antagonists who love the ocean; looks like the villain James Bond Stromberg in "The Spy Who Loved Me", managing the underwater city called Atlantis. <br /> <br /> His daughter, to whom he treats like a caring pet, is called Ponyo. This is a big golden fish that already looks like a red-haired girl. Her father separates her from the real human world, claiming that he is dangerous and too complicated for her. But, frankly, Ponyo's research curiosity is as strong as her love nature. In the end, gaining strength, similar to the wonderful scenes from Nika Park's “Running Chicken”, she breaks out of her father’s rocky and petrified water city and swims to the water surface of Japan, and to her good luck and joy, the younger captain tanker named Sosuke. <br /> <br /> In Sosuke, who lives in an oceanfront house on a tidy beach (or boulders-strewn), there are two overworked parents, the older housework mother, Lisa, and the first assistant of the tanker-barge Koichi. Lisa seems to be angry with her spouse for leaving on the ship and leaving her with all the household chores. Moreover, the black magic that Pono renders causes an apocalyptic chain of events: the moon approaches the Earth too closely, and the waves break out of the imbalance of the forces of tidal interaction, and huge waves of tsunami wash the peaceful, but evacuated city. However, what seems to underestimate this curse and seems literally more powerful than supernatural power is the love and friendly friendship between the children's captain Sosuke and the charming red-haired Ponyo, who wants to be a sensitive person, not just a preserved fish. Just like the winding and freedom-loving hobbits of The Lord of the Rings, Ponyau gives me a small reminder of this. <br /> <br /> I could continue to write about this amazing animated film, the best since "Coraline", which was in theaters in February. And right now, Hayao Miyazaki, admire another 10-star class from your animation fan, Graham Abraham. 2009 may be filled with dozens of animated films; However, Ponyo is the highest film of many environmental beauties and should be dedicated as a new wonder of the world.
