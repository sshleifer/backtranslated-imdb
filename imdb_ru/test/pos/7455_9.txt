Nomination TV-14 for sexual content and language. <br /> <br /> I remembered hearing about this show in 1998, when it was broadcast on the Teletoon channel. I did not watch it then, but now it plays on the channel, Razer. I saw about four episodes of this show, and I must say that it is quite clever and funny. <br /> <br /> Stars of the show Jason Alexander from Seinfeld and Tim Curry from the Rocky Horror movie. Show and It is glory. Show about a duck that is a cop. He basically fulfills his role as a cop, coping with personal problems. This show is quite funny, and fans of animated comedy will like it.
