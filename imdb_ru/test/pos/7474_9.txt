I saw this film by chance while in Paris. I got into the wrong theater by accident, and by the time I realized that it wasn’t a preview or a short film, I was hooked. <br /> <br /> Polina does a phenomenal job holding your attention with her game. I cannot say enough how impressed I was with her image of this real femme fatale. The rest of the cast is also very good. Don't get me wrong, this is not the best movie ever made, but considering that I didn’t know anything about it, I still had indelible and very positive impressions. <br /> <br /> Finally, NOT speaking French in France paid off once! I never stopped talking about this movie for 3 weeks after watching it.
