Everyone likes a cool, memorable robber movie. Alain Delon provides antiheroes, Melville is awesome, and several other great talents (mostly Yves Montand, Gian Maria Volonte and Andre Bourville) come to add a clear attractive movie ... <br /> <br /> ... with a very a little dialogue. This is great because one of certain aspects of the genre, as a rule, is dialogue, in which savvy people and their various reporters participate. This film, however, could be watched with the sound completely disconnected, and not much would have been missed. This is not to say that the sound is bad, oh no, the jazz soundtrack and the crisp sound catching small movements make slow, patient thinking about patients very convincing. <br /> <br /> This film is also very nice that color cinema is pretty fantastic. Usually, when it comes to cinematography, black and white films are usually remembered, but this film has very strong and beautiful images that make the film just a visual pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
