Offspring is a husband and wife who waste time making love. Not knowing at all what this strange experience means, they are trying to continue their lives. The husband begins to ask questions about the strange event and receives help from a very annoying psychiatrist. He concludes that the aliens are responsible for this period of time and that the unborn child, which he once considered his own, and his wife actually belongs to aliens. <br /> <br /> If you ask me, this is a great science fiction / scary story. Adopting a very dubious real-life scenario involving alien abduction and hybrid breeding is definitely the thumb of this guy. I love everything related to aliens, and this story definitely brought some good ideas. So, if you also share an interest in alien things, you should be very pleased with Progeny. In any case, at least according to the plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film as a whole is quite average. With an average action of all the actors. Yes, even the ever-magnificent Mr. Dourif, who still shows the best results. While the doctor is black heads, he supplies his lines really well. There are several moments in the film, where some of them are worthy of horror or laughter, which is good in my book. I like them because they had some good stinky cheese, and I mean it in a good way. <br /> <br /> In any case, with a less than stellar scenario, you cannot blame all the actors, I was not particularly worried about the hysteria of the Mother to whom the film went. She wanted a child so badly that she neglected and ignored everything that her loving husband (the doctor!) Told her. It almost got to the point that you didn’t care what happened to her. <br /> <br /> “Progeny” is another Brian Yuzna film from the obscene film Society. Again he gives some mucous effects, and again he presents a rather unique horror story. If you are fond of science fiction / horror or are fans of Duriff and / or Yuzna films, there is no real reason not to check out this film if you have such an opportunity. Generous 7 out of 10.
