Post-war England, the dawn of the "atomic age". However, the anxiety of a young schoolchild, eager to experience his first “kiss,” cannot be frustrated by something as insignificant as the BOMB. It was a delightful, if not educational, look at young love from the perspective of a teenage man and his world in the 1940s <br /> <br />. Free from political correctness and preaching messages, this film introduces the viewer to a world that only the mind (and hormones) of a young teenager can create. Wonderful plots <br /> <br /> support the interest of characters ala "Girl Gregory", and many <br /> <br /> well-blocked images help preserve the image of this era. This is a very good story for anyone, young or old, who has ever been in love or ever wanted to be. Does he ever get his wish? Look and look.
