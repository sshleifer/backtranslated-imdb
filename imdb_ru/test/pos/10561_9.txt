After watching “Tilting Velvet from Sarah Waters” I decided to watch “Fingersmith”, the characters were equally good in both performances, although I missed Rachel Stirling in the film “Fingersmith”. <br /> <br /> In general, the storyline was good. The choice, twisting and disentangling the characters were amazing! Wonderful watches miss only Rachel Sterling! <br /> <br /> If you like the romance of two girls, this is not one of the best movies to watch. <br /> <br /> It is different from Tipping The Velvet, but also good. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone!
