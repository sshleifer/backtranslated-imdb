I saw Konrak at night, I could not sleep, and I was never so happy about insomnia! This story of a young white teacher who holds a position for teaching poor black children on an island in Carolina is an excellent advertisement for teaching and simply helping each other. In the early 60s, with the problems of civil rights, Vietnam, everything that came from the 60s, forgot that the Peace Corps and many young people tried to help the poor. Konrak, with his open learning style, is interested in these children as people and encourages honest interaction in his class, which scares the power that will be. The biggest part was that John Voight said they had a 20-year reunion, and 18 of those children became teachers !! This is enough to make you think that we humans can have a chance to survive on their own, maybe we hope. Watch this movie.
