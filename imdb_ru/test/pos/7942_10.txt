Alexander Nevsky (1938) is a brilliant part of cinematic propaganda. The Russian people are threatened by two main enemies, the Mongols and the Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire. In the order to unite the warring princes in the Russian kingdom, Nevsky assumes responsibility and fights against the lesser of two evils (Teutonic). This influential film was copied many times and is still preserved. The soundtrack of the composer Prokiev and the director Eisenstein is a spectacle that can be seen many years later, John Milius used many scenes from films, scenery and costumes from this film and included them in Conan. from my favorite lines from conan was taken from this movie. “It’s not the strength of the iron in the weapon, but the strength of the person who owns it.” Comparisons are infallible. The armor worn by James Earl Jones and the Leader of the Teutonic Knights is almost identical. A real tribute from one director to another. <br /> <br /> I give Alexander Nevsky one of my highest recommendations. The film plays as the last act of Richard III. The presence of Prince Alexander on the screen is truly amazing.
