Hard Justice is a great fighter! The whole film is really nothing but shooting and fighting, but it has a very good story about vampires! For people who say they do not shoot and action movies, as before. Well, this one is really hardcore! Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is superb, and his character is really cool in the film. Nicholas Guest was very good, and he may have stolen the show! He really acts like a fantastic villain! Melanie Smith was also good. I think this very good looking actress is very undervalued. Michael Kavano was good. It was really great to see Vince Murdocco in this movie! As for the action, it is really amazing with all the shootings and super cool battle scenes. The fight in this picture is truly one of the greatest I've ever seen! In 86 minutes, there is so much going on. For fans of action, you will be amazed by the power of fire and the excellent struggle this film has to offer! “Night Hunter” is a film that is not easy to find, and if you are in the video store and see it for sale, buy it, because this film is a big keeper, and besides, the box is cool! There is a mass of actions that you need to see to believe! See if you can find good deals on Ebay, Half.com, Z-Shops on Amazon.com and Market Place! In my opinion, “Night Hunter” is one of the greatest combat films I have ever watched, and the characters are so neat. If you like Don 'The Dragon' Wilson and you want to see Nicholas Guest in excellent performance, then I highly recommend all lovers of action films who love to shoot them, combat films and vampire films, and were disappointed with other films that have looks like real non-stop action movie, but can not deliver it to buy and buy Night Hunter today!
