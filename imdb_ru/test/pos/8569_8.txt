H.O.T.S. This is a fun movie for traveling back when the films had more positive and fun plans. They were made just to tease and laugh. Everything seems less cynical and tormented. All girls have natural shapes, and some of them are playboy buddies. A simple story concerns a group of young women who open an unauthorized house of the female society in order to avenge the arrogant female girls who rejected and insulted them. Instead of today's mean tricks, most of the jokes are just innocent fun. Women are worthy actresses for this genre and are mostly very attractive. To keep our attention between topless scenes, we have mafia minions, a stolen bear, a balloon, a funny home mom, and the cheapest robot we have ever seen. There is even Danny Bonnaucci from the Partridge family. If you have a sense of humor, let go of yourself and enjoy some light entertainment.
