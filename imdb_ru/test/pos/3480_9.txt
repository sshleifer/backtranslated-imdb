Who would have thought that an actor who was not disabled could act as realistic and immensely as an invalid in a film? Probably someone. But no one, truly no one, could ever compare their expectations with the surprisingly emotional and powerful performance that two actors gave in this film. <br /> <br /> Michael (Stephen Robertson) lives in a home for disabled people. He has cerebral sex, and, as we were shown at the very beginning, he has enormous problems with communication. So this is really a lifeline when his disabled colleague Rory (James McAvoy), who can speak normally, understands him. Thus, friendship begins, which relies mainly (ironically) on communication. <br /> <br /> In a fun scene, they manage to leave home to their home. After Rory was rejected, the good-hearted Michael put forward an application to move to his home. Rory, who already had ill fame with the “judges,” was to become his translator. <br /> <br /> But problems soon arose. They start to chase the girl, whom they met in the pub some time ago, and they want her to be their assistant to do little things that matter. She is reluctant at first; she does not know these people, but it seems that they can be harmless; so there’s another friendship, but not necessarily a good one ... <br /> <br /> This film, although sharp, actually relies on actors. But this is not bad. For an actor who is not disabled, you see Rory, although he can communicate correctly, is disappointed that he is completely dependent on other people and does not have his own real life. But the real star for me is Stephen Robertson. He acts with such emotions, longing for the soul and sadness / happiness, that he really sees how he wins the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Great. <br /> <br /> Overall: 5 of 5
