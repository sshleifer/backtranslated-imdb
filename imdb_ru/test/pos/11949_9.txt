This is a classic 80s humor. If you were a teenager in the 80s, it was a summer hit to go see. It was an early look at those superstars. This and Better off Dead are just funny and silly films to sit back and enjoy. Everyone can admit that he had a crazy summer when he was a teenager. Even crazy family and friends love these characters. Getting to know some of these characters was a lot of fun. An uncle who is crazy is sitting every waking moment on the radio, waiting to win a million dollars, a grandmother who only loves her granddaughter and handed the children an afternoon bill, twin brothers who are nothing like, and there was so much fun in meeting the hype. It may not win a reward, but it's just a fun movie that can be lost in one day.
