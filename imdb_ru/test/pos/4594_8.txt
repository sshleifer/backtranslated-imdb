"Idiocracy" is Mike's latest film, Office Space, and he certainly follows a similar theme of this film in the fact that it is watching nonsense and how mediocrity can overcome trouble ... conditionally. This is the story of Joe Bauer (Luke Wilson), who is literally the average guy in the world. Joe and a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph) are being tested in a military hibernation military project. They should have been suspended for only one year, but due to the lack of supervision, Joe and Rita are forgotten and will accidentally wake up after 500 years. <br /> <br /> Here is the scary part: this film explains, very realistically and plausibly, how the entire population of 2505 became absolutely backward. Without natural predators, the evolution of the human species does not necessarily contribute to the emergence of genes, the fastest, smartest, and strongest people ... only those who reproduce the most. Unfortunately, these people are clumsy idiots-trailers that breed like rabbits. Such a rich reproduction of stupid people has negatively affected the growth of society, and now Joe and Rita are two of the smartest people on the planet. If this helps, imagine that the entire population is just a hybrid of goons, athletes, chulo and hooligans. Seeing this horrible dystopia, Joe finds out and tries to track the time machine to find out if they and Rita can return to the time when they arrived, and this is basically the whole story. <br /> <br /> But despite how I can make this film appear higher than you can imagine. There are nuances everywhere, and everyone can see glimpses (warning signs, if you will) of a modern silent society that permeates the facets of everyday life and turns it into a train wreck, on display in Idiocracy. The film has some really amazing showcases of realistic backwardness put on a pedestal. I do not want to give out anything and scold for you, but let's just say that it is quite thorough. I see some say that this is just a lot of toilet humor, but, oddly enough, has a purpose; show how stupid and stupid these people are. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is destined to see the same fate as its predecessor, Office Space; no one will see him in cinemas, but everyone will brag about the discovery of this amazing / funny movie when it comes to video. My only complaint about the film is that the flow of narration is sometimes disturbed, and they can make an exhibition like “Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy” about how things should be, where they are, but this is an inevitable evil and realized better here. In addition, good characters, funny jokes and social comments are better than average, wrapped in a funny bow. <br /> <br /> One final note: if we see our youth becoming gangster, I want to act like trash in the ghetto and pride in it ... if you are educated and cultural in any case and can see how our the country goes out of control into the abyss of stupidity, for God's sake, watch this movie.
