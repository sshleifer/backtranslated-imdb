* SPOILERS AHEAD * <br /> <br /> There were still a few years left until Great Wrestlmania. But this one was definitely good, with lots of good matches and one great match. <br /> <br /> Demolition at WrestleMania has always been the best. I am glad that their last cheers WM (I refuse to include another version) was a victory over Colossal Connection. I liked that Andre never registered. <br /> <br /> Few of the fans know that this was the first time that anyone had defeated Mr. Perfect. For some reason, the feat of Brutus Bifcake was never recognized. Or the fact that he made it pretty easy. <br /> <br /> The Hart Foundation victory over the Bolsheviks was the shortest in the history of WM, including the 24/9 second match between King Kong Bundy and S.D. Jones <br /> <br /> I am glad that Jake and DiBiaz fought at WrestleMania. This made up for the fact that the feud should have been suspended for so long. <br /> <br /> I expected the feud of the Big Bossman-Akim to be heated, but the Bossman just hit him. Whatever the bossman was the heel, he was just as gorgeous as the face. He was always tense and obviously loved his job. <br /> <br /> If Warrior had the best work ethic and maybe he tried to learn how to fight, he would be a great WWF champion. <br /> /> Worth seeing, especially since boring matches are too short to complain. And the team tag matches are all very exciting.
