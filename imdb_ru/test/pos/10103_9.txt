Two sisters, Su-mi (IM Su-chjun) and Su-yen (Luna Kyn-Yang) return home with their father (Kim Gap Su). Yun-Joo (Yeom Jung-ah) greets them, but the manner of Soo-mi is bitter. Soo-mi hates Eun-Joo, because her father allowed her to act like a house wife after her sisters' mother died. Seeing her attitude, Eun-joo begins to treat the sisters coldly, and a tense atmosphere grows among them. <br /> <br /> As if caused by the atmosphere, a number of mysterious things happen in the house. When Soo-mi hangs up her dress in her wardrobe, many dresses of the same design are already hung there. When she puts her diary in a drawer, she finds there another diary of the same kind. When she sleeps in her bed with a frightened Soo-yen, she will be awakened by a nightmare, and she will find a woman standing on her - and an arm will hang from her skirt! <br /> <br /> other people too. The following weekend, Yun-Joo's brother and his wife visit the family, and they have lunch together. Eun-Joo is having fun talking about the crazy person she met when she was a child, but no one is interested in her conversation. She says that the madman annoys her brother, but she says that she does not know anything about him. <br /> <br /> Listening to their conversation, the brother’s wife experiences panic. <br /> <br /> After lunch, the conflict between Yoon-Joo and the sisters becomes the worst. Eun-Joo pulls Soo-yon into the closet and locks it in it. Su-mi saves a crying sister and complains to her father about what Yoon-Ju did to his daughter. But his answer is unexpected. "Give me a break." he says angrily: “Soo-mi, please. Don't get tired of me anymore. ” <br /> <br /> And the following words from the father’s mouth are more shocking than what they saw in the house. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I hate horror movies. Although I was sitting in the theater because my intuition told me that the film was something else, I regretted that my curiosity made me act when it began to be shown. However, regret grew into the joy of waiting ten minutes later. <br /> <br /> This film is a tragic mystery, and not horror - pain is more than horror; beautiful more than sensational. This may disappoint a horror fan, but for a mysterious fan like me, this film is simply necessary. (9 out of 10)
