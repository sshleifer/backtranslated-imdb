It has the same resemblance to the Dean Kunz novel as Jessica Simpson with the rocket builder. If you read a book, I advise you to get it out of your head as soon as possible before watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Observers - your typical “boy meets a dog, the dog turns out to be a super experimental laboratory experiment in the government, the dog and the boy are chased by a super-intellectual and emotionally excited monster created by the same laboratory, and, oh yeah, I mentioned questionable government agents chasing a monster chasing a dog? "the film. <br /> <br /> Corey Chaim is a boy, Barbara Williams is his mother, Michael Ironside is one of the evil government guys, and Sandy's dog is a dog (Fourfike; Einstein in the book). <br / > <br /> The monster effect is ridiculous, most of the dialogue is ridiculous, the script rarely makes sense or believable - a good example is the indisputable recognition of the character of the dog's intelligence, as if every Fido from the street could type messages on the computer keyboard or bark once for all and twice for no! Hmm, it must be a puppy, right? Chaim’s durability is enthusiastic, but shaky, because he leads a stupid dialogue with the least amount of skills. Ironside was the highlight of many bad films, and this is no exception. It easily gives the best performance of the film, although I have to add that the dog !) It comes in the next second. <br /> <br /> In general, a terribly dull movie, but for now., And yet I watched it three times during the week. And yet I can't help but love it. Hey, what can I say, I have a taste for junk - and Michael Ironside (not that I have ever tried Michael Ironside - I'm sure there are laws against it). But any film that can make me laugh so hard (yes, even unintentionally) cannot be bad. Say it with a sense of guilt: the film "Yes, I know that it is insultingly stupid, but I still like it." <br /> <br /> I find it difficult to evaluate this. On a normal scale, I have to give him a D-, but on my personal scale of cheese, it rises to A-. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know. I'm so weird.
