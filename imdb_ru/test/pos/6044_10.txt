I was training camp on the island of MCRD Parris in 1953, and this film is about the exact image of what the shoes went through in that era, even to hide this spoiled flea. Many of the “actors” in the film were active marines. This film may be more interesting for the Marine Corps than others, but I feel that the film itself is very well made, and Jack Webb made a “good DI”. Semper Fi!
