I like this movie !! I was waiting for the release of this film so that I could see it. I saw him open at night, and I liked it. Some people told me that this film is useless and stay away, but I thought it was great. The actors did great, and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a great job on her first film, everything was hard for her when she did an excellent job and she didn't even have such a big role. The set was great, it was made from all wax and how it was made. The two brothers did a great job, and the feeling of death was magnificent. The killers were really scary and made me want to close my eyes and not look at them. I can't wait for this movie to be released on Video so that I can get it and watch it again and again. If you like Hororr movies and you will not regret it, I liked this movie. I give this film 10 out of 10 IT ROCKS !!!
