I like this movie !! Jack Black and Kyle Gass probably made one of the best comedies ever since Up in Smoke. In this movie, everyone will find something for themselves: rock, drugs and Satan. What more could you want? I offer this film to anyone who wants to relax and forget about all the troubles in the world and laugh. Even if the film is not very good in cinemas, it will definitely become a cult classic. I recommend that everyone who is going to see the movie pick up their first album D, because many jokes are only made funnier if you hear songs (for example, JB Sasquatch’s obsession with the epic battle against the devil.) The film still laughs, even if you don’t heard their music, but the songs are so good that you can't miss them.
