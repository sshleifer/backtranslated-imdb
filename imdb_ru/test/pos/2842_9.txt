In this extremely specific film, the question immediately arises: who are the crazy people? <br /> <br /> As the movie continues, the answer becomes less clear. <br /> <br /> Renée Zellweger loses the whining note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as Betty is shocked. In fact, she is so effective that I almost wanted her to be a little more crazy, because her created reality was so believable. <br /> <br /> For the first time, Ms. Zellweger was called to carry the film and it is more than equal to the task. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock ?? even how cursed as usual ?? pretty docile like wesley. He is able to sublimate his maniacal energy, and it appears only occasionally and whenever it is needed most. <br /> <br /> There are several interesting allusions: when you first see Betty, is she dressed almost like Dorothy Gale from The Wizard of Oz ?? then in the film she is compared to Dorothy, when she says she has never been from Kansas before. At some point the song that Doris Day was best known for, “Que Sera Sera”, is on the soundtrack, and then Charlie (Morgan Freeman) describes it as “the whole party of Doris Day”. <br /> <br /> This is a very unusual film with good characteristics of all, including supporting actors. <br /> <br /> He has an amazing finale, which, however it may sound, is actually quite predictable. <br /> <br /> If, for some other reason, to watch this film simply to listen to the master of the human voice: Morgan Freeman.
