This pleasant Euro-Western opens with a scene that preceded a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to film for Once Upon a Time in the West, but could not convince Clint Eastwood to appear. Three hard-looking shooters go to the city, One dressed like a man without a name in a poncho. The other is dressed as Colonel Mortimer from "For a few dollars more," and the third is dressed like Django, except that he rides a horse instead of pulling a coffin with a machine gun in it. Our hero meets them on Main Street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins. "Any weapon can play" is a spaghetti western with a joke about spaghetti westerns, since the hero kills three murderers. In addition to a small comedy story, especially in acrobatic warfare, this is above average. <br /> <br /> The notorious Mexican criminal Montero (Gilbert Roland from Barbarosa) and his gang of triggers. happy pistols rob a military train carrying 300 thousand dollars in gold coins across the border. Directed by Enzo J. Castellari of the Inglorious Bastards, there are many different angles that bring you to the fore. The bandits seize the locomotive along with the wagon carrying the gold and separate it from the rest of the train, which houses the US cavalry. While Montero and his militants hold the cavalry, Pajondo (Pedro Sánchez from Sabatá) commands the locomotive, kills the engineer and his team and pushes him away, leaving the other pistols to himself in charge. In essence, Pajondo crosses Montero twice and steals gold for himself. Montero later catches up with Pajondo in the Rio Grande. However, before the bandit can locate the loot for Montero, a cavalry sergeant shoots Pajondo. Before dying, Pajondo tells Montero about the medallion, which serves as a clue about where he hid the treasure. The enraged cavalry captain (Ivano Staccioli of the Commandos) imprisons Montero, but he cannot weaken the bandit's language even after he uses the whip. Enraged by Montero’s restraint, the captain threatens to shoot the Mexican if he does not speak. Meanwhile, the jailers allow the priest to speak with Montero, but he is not really a priest. A stranger with six guns (George Hilton from the "Ruthless Four") disguised as a man of cloth and rescues Montero from the firing squad. Unfortunately, before Montero was saved, Clayton (Edd Byrnes from the 77 Sunset Strip) took the medallion from him and kept it for himself. Clayton is a representative of the bank that was sent to guard the gold. He is terrified that the captain wants to shoot Montero. Clayton's career at the bank depends on his ability to mine gold. The stranger arranges a fire at the fort to divert the execution squad, and Montero takes the Captain hostage and tries to escape, but the Stranger knocks him off his horse. Before the authorities can make sure that Montero is dead, the Stranger demands the body for a beautiful reward that he will receive, and he rides with the gratitude of the captain. As soon as they left the fort, Montero’s men appeared to save him from a stranger. From this point on, Stranger, Montero, and Clayton make short-lived alliances with each other in search of gold. Castellari and screenwriter Tito Carpi, who wrote several westerns of spaghetti, such as A Few Dollars for Django and another Castellari hunter Seven Winchesters for the Massacre, rely on sly humor and unexpected turns to maintain a fresh and fast pace In one cool scene, Clayton is sitting at the table, intending to eat his food when he hears some suspicious sounds behind him. Clayton pours the drink onto the table and sees the armed men with six rifles behind him. <br /> <br /> "Any Gun Can Play" lives up to its name. In fact, many weapons do play, and at least twenty or more corpses accumulate before they disappear. This Western is not so much a parody as a fake by Sergio Leone "Good, bad and ugly." Keep in mind, bad guys and good guys fall as often as ten pins in a bowling alley, but their deaths are not depicted in the brutal manner of Leone Western. “Any gun can play” does not take itself as seriously as Leone’s aforementioned masterpiece. Three leads the jockey back and forth for supremacy. Everyone has a piece of the puzzle that will lead them to the treasure, but they refuse to share their information before the final of the shootout. Bright, widescreen photographs of Lancer Giovanni Bergamini are impressive, especially the first shots of a train rumbling along railway tracks with distant mountain peaks rising sharply in the background. Another great shot occurs when Montero checks the stranger's calmness. This scene takes place after the Stranger rescued Montero and the Mexican minions arrive to rescue the leader’s bacon. Confiscating an unfamiliar weapon with six guns, Montero aims at the tough guy dressed in a poncho and launches a revolver, harmlessly placing his well-aimed bullets in and around the steady shooter. Bergamini, who filmed the castellari of the Second World War "Inglorious Bastards", creates a frame with a stranger in the background and a gun in the foreground Montero in the foreground for a nice three-dimensional image of the style. Meanwhile, the lively orchestral soundtrack of Francesco De Maci is also remembered for its unique melodies, like Ennio Morricone’s soundtracks for Leone's westerns. The first song resembles a 1950s Hollywood western with his catchy lyrics and guitar riffs. Although this is not the main western spaghetti, “Any Gun Can Play” always entertains with nonsense with interesting plot twists and good performances, especially the tireless Gilbert Rolan, who was then 62 years old!
