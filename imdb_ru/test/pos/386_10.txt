"Strangers in the train" was one of those classic films that I had always heard about, but for some reason did not bother to see them. I finally watched it a few weeks ago, and, as always in any Hitchcock movie, he not only withstood the test of time, but also far surpassed most of the thrillers shot today. You can see the inspiration for the future militants here - the climax ending with an uncontrolled carousel and two villains fighting each other reminded me of the great sequence of actions at the end of “Speed” by Jan de Bont. “Of course, the“ Strangers ”are more than forty years older than the“ Speed ​​”and do not contain modern special effects, but there is internal excitement in it - Hitchcock was a real genius. <br /> <br /> Bruno’s not very thin gay side (Robert Walker in stunning performance) took shape in many other psycho-stalker figures in future films. Consider him as the male version of Jennifer Jason Lee in the movie “The Lonely White Woman.” He knows about Guy before he meets him on the train - we almost feel that their contact is not accidental - and soon completely obsessed with them. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock loved the oedipal elements in his films (also see Psycho for more explicit shades), and there is a lot of it here. Bruno hates his father and wants him to die so that he can be with his mother His effeminate manners and apparent homosexuality must have just escaped the censors in 1951, when gay people were “not allowed” to be portrayed on the screen - however Hitchcock effectively conveys the message when we see Bruno in the living room on the phone, not very male flirting with Guy and answering his mother. <br /> <br /> The deep layers of this film make it a fast-growing thriller, to which you can return again and again - unfortunately, it is converted into a high-budget Hollywood production, but, having seen the original, I, frankly, can not imagine that something transcends the thrill of this film.
