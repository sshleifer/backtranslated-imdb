For us, the film “Abbott and Costello” is what you should be tuned to. I am very glad that I wrote it down - my wife remembered it from an early age, but I never saw it. The family wanted to see something not too serious before bedtime, and it was chosen. <br /> <br /> Our daughter watched many old films with us - she always complained at the beginning, but more often she came to her senses. At first, she basically ignored this, preferring to check her e-mail, but she began to have fun — laugh loudly at anger many times. <br /> <br /> It's nice to think that you can spend a fun evening with 55 years. Monochrome entry that fits into a full-color fairy tale. This is a funny twist to the story with which everyone is familiar, which includes a small song and a little dance, as well as everything you expect from Lou and Bud before delivery. <br /> <br /> Watch her with your children and have a very fun evening!
