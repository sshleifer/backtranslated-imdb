CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> A cell, like Antz, must be evaluated twice in order to be evaluated. When I first saw this film, I thought it was mediocre, but after watching the film made such an indelible impression on me that I decided to rent it again. I did, and I found the film to be much prettier. The cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories into quality and is a visually intelligent film that comes up with images and plot ideas that cannot be compared. The film script can be clumsy at times, like acting, but the visual effects are ingenious and bring a fascinating story to an exotic and intriguing life. Oscar-nominated cosmetics are also bold and cautious, while beautiful costumes and absolutely brilliant decorations have gone unnoticed. Tarsem Singh, who also shot music videos, is crazy about his leadership, and it works well. He has a lot of talent, and this film has a lot of potential if you give him a chance. In general, The Cell is powerful, disturbing, and avoiding being too sticky, which makes it a great, enjoyable time.
