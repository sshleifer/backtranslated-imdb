I had to call my mother (WASP) to ask her about it. Was it really that bad in the 40s in New York? Surprise, she could not remember. So I told her to watch a movie. Arthur Miller, when he wrote this in 1945, was not in a creak, but in NOVINE for a change, it was 30 years old. This is a painful image of anti-Semitism. And yet, oddly enough, at the heart of the cruel story lies the tender history of human relations (Jew Finkelstein, primarily with the non-Jew Newman). The action is competent and the cinematography is very good. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can think this does not make it big in the theater is that it is >> aaagh << debatable. I really give it ten out of ten. Maybe a little high, but it's worth a look.
