If you haven't seen it yet, you really should do it on DVD. I can not believe how I liked it! This is surprisingly realistic and believable. True, much of this is speculated, and I would like to know more about what was speculative and what was proved by the facts (there are not so many), but all of this copes quite well with the theme of “Cruel Mother Nature”, He will remind you of natural programs that you have seen on the Animal Planet and Discovery Channel. Only animals here are dinosaurs. They act naturally; they eat, kill, mate, play and fight for survival. You will really be rooting for some of them and against others. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the effects are excellent. From time to time they will look too similar to CGI, but then you will see them from a different angle, which will make them more realistic. In some cases, you’ll really be sure you’ve seen a dinosaur. My favorites were Coelophysis, predators, diplodocus, iguanadons, allosaurs and arctic bipeds. However, I was very disappointed with T-Rex, which sometimes looked too computer. <br /> <br /> In any case, you must see this work. It is educational, well done and very interesting. For what it is!
