I have seen this movie 3 times. The first time I was shocked by this film. He seemed to me a very good film. I hated this film as sentimental trash during the second viewing. However, my third viewing confirmed my belief that this is a good movie. There is a lot of emotional power in this film, especially the scenes of emotional confrontation between Mr. Kramer and Madame Kramer. There are several scenes in which Meryl Streep looks like a cruel person, despite the fact that she is a beauty in real life. Dustin Hoffman looks like a lost hero, unable to cope with his childâ€™s recent custody task. On the set of this film was even a dispute. According to the main operator Nestor Almendros, there was a snapshot in which he simply avoided being injured, as the character of Mr. Cramer, to show the intensity of his anger, decides to break the glass severely. Fortunately, nothing happened to Nestor. Kramer vs. Kramer shows the destruction of family structure. It also says how things are Miles should be saved if there are children.
