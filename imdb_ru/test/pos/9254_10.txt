HLOTS was an outstanding series, this is something that NYPD Blue will never be, on HLOTS the stories are real, the dialogue is real, the relationships are real. When HLOTS returned to the cinema, tying all the ends together, it was a good idea to bring together the whole gang, even a few deceased people (I will not say how). The storyline was dynamic, emotional and full of spirit. the series was week by week. Murder, Life on the streets, Network drama at its best !!!! 5 STARS!!!! Not bad and all that. Thanks NBC for giving us, finally, we have not received!
