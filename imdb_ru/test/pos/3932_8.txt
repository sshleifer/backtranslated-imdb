I saw a preview of this Tuesday evening with a group of friends, and we had a blast! After seeing the hidden peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Awful! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (about 6/10), I really enjoyed it! As you can see from the trailer, one knock I experienced was that you could “forget” the whole city, but this is a terrible horror movie with popcorn, so I accept it for what it is. <br /> <br /> My only main complaint I assumed that Paris Hilton would touch the wax or go down, etc., and moan “it's hot,” but they did not (how could they resist ???). <br /> <br /> NO nudity from 2 girls, although Paris looks great in her lingerie! I'm surprised they didn't put the 3rd “hot token victim” in the film for some unnecessary nudity, which is the norm for this type of click! I will not list the spoilers of death or conspiracy, but I will say that both Paris and Eliza are well broken! <br /> <br /> The characters are decently developed and somewhat cute (not like Cabin Fever, where you wanted them to die), and the film has a decent pace, although nothing happens in the first 30 minutes, like in most horror films. <br /> I give him 8/10, as he delivers good fears and blood, and I did not expect this. If you go with friends who love cheesy horror films, you will have a good time. <br /> <br /> Noah
