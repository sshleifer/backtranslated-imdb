Du rififi chez les hommes is a brilliant film that studies criminal minds and allows viewers to better understand criminals who are not fundamentally different from ordinary people like us. That director Jules Dassin shows that the criminal has families, and they care a lot for them. That is why they adhere to a strict code of honor. For them, the family consists not only of wives, mistresses and children, but also of random acquaintances and close friends. Contrary to what many may find hard to believe, Jules Dassin did not try to glorify crime in his film, as the riffi makes. It is clear that crime never pays off. This shows that all kinds of bad activities lead to human victims. In addition to the philosophical position, Rifif is worth a look at its technical dexterity. While watching one of the brightest episodes of the safe-breaking movie, itâ€™s hard to believe in the meticulous accuracy with which criminal minds execute their plans. This is a scene that no one dared to copy in Hollywood.
