Roy Anderson’s film “You Live” includes a series of more than fifty sketches, shots and vignettes set in a Swedish city. Some characters appear on the screen for only a few seconds, while others appear in numerous scenes, and sometimes they can be seen in the background, and another story unfolds. Many scenes are taken from dreams, nightmares and fantasies of strange, but believable characters who inhabit this world. This is a fascinating approach: each scene can be viewed separately, but together they contain a powerful portrait of what it means to be human. <br /> <br /> The first half hour or so: “You, the Living One” is magnificently funny. Most of the humor is focused on the brass band members, whose musical practice infuriates the neighbors in their apartment building. However, the comic emphasis is on the dinner party, which has become terribly erroneous. However, after this cheerful presentation, the mood of the film darkens considerably. Sleeping at a party becomes dismal when the unfortunate protagonist is tried for his life, setting a ridiculous intonation of absurdity and despair for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> In the following scenes the misfortune of the characters becomes more and more obvious. It is a world in which people cannot communicate with each other, where talk of dreams, nightmares and fantasies are widespread, but no one person can be comforted, even when others turn to them for help. A sad woman with a refrain of “no one loves me,” and a young girl with an unrequited love for rock guitarist Mikke is archetypal characters. <br /> <br /> The world “You Live” is also clouded by egoism. The elderly professors are called the warmth of a huge banquet to answer a phone call from his impetuous son, who is raising money; the thief stole the purse of the ruthless leader; An arrogant and impatient businessman insults a Muslim hairdresser and receives it as a gift. At the darkest moment of the film, a woman in the church talks about a long list of human sins, when her fellow parishioners move during closure. <br /> <br /> And yet, for all the dark moments in this film, the common refrain “tomorrow is another day” indicates the ability of people to continue to live, despite many sufferings. The soundtrack provided by Benny Anderson (of ABBA fame) seems out of place at first glance to be inappropriate, but it acquires more and more meaning as the film realizes this human ability to continue. <br /> <br /> “You live” possesses an extraordinary visual style. The same blurry, pale green colors are repeated everywhere, and there is not a shadow in sight; this makes the characters extremely pale and creates the feeling that human life is revealed for study. Almost every scene is captured in a static frame of the camera, as if it were photographs brought to life. The few times the camera is moving are all the more unusual; The contrast between life and the movement of the great feast creates a stunning contrast with the deadness of the scene in the wardrobe. In the most tense moments of sadness and despair, the characters stun the viewer, turning directly to the camera. they know that they are being tested, and they have a few minutes to vent their hearts on us viewers. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful human film.
