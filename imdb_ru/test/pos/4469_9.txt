Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films such as The Beyond and Zombie, was a few years earlier a master of Italian giallo (in Argento and Bava) with films such as Lizard in the Skin of a Woman and his masterpiece Do Not Do. Torture Duckling. This film contains all the elements of the Italian mystery / thriller genre known as giallo, but it does attract the audience as each key character with a skeleton is in his / her own closet. This allows you to do as much detective work as there are detectives in the film itself. Who kills the boys in the city? A young rich woman who is so bored that she sexually scoffs at possible victims, a reporter who likes to spoil the crime scene to take a better picture, a city dweller with a mentally retarded daughter, a local witch, a city idiot ... ... the list goes on and you must keep mental notes like a real game that you can play and solve. The themes in this film are very bold and made with this perfect Italian style in the early 1970s. There is no doubt that not a single American studio would even have thought of making a film with such strong content, and this is why this film is so satisfactory (despite some unusual accent options for dubbing), and there are definitely people who will discuss its meaning much later this. As they say, they no longer make them so, so take a copy and cherish such an important film as this one!
