I finally got Lifeforce on a DVD with a whole widescreen format and raised Henry Mancini's score to the maximum. After watching Lifeforce for fifteen years on film, I must say that the “uncut” DVD version was great and disappointing. The US version is much better than the DVD version (European?). The Lifeforce version in the USA is moving much faster (editing on the DVD version is awful. It looks like an unfinished cut). And many scenes that were not in the American version add almost nothing to the final problem. In fact, one “new” moment almost destroys the entire film when Kane (Peter Firth) meets a male foreigner in the cathedral. I love this scene, although in the US version. On a DVD, a male foreigner talks to Kane, and what he says is sooooo funny. This is the pinnacle of fun: <br /> <br /> "It will be much less scary if you just come to me!" - says a foreigner-man in a deep voice of the style of the 1950s. I was amazed when I saw this. It simply does not apply to the film. This scene is pure camp for the rest of the super serious movie. I'm glad Hooper (or someone else) shot this scene when the film was released in North America. There were several changes to the US version that made Lifeforce much better, and I wanted the DVD version to be on the US. Editing is sharp and insane, not annoying, and some places that were already boring in the American version are even more boring on the DVD version because of the added scenes. And the opening titles on the DVD are terrible. Much better in the US version. Thiner. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. These are mostly aliens who make a pit stop on the ground and absorb as much vitality as possible. The film has too many flat boring episodes (talk, talk, talk), but when the action goes to London, it's fun. The film really shines in these scenes. You can see Hooper finally doing what he is gorgeous: chaos, wildness, horror! The life force should have had more such scenes of chaos. These are the best apocalyptic scenes ever filmed. This is also the best movie about zombies. Zombies are hungry (for life force, not for the flesh), and they are insane, agile and terrible. Not slow moving bores of other zombie films. In addition, many people criticized the ending, but I like it. It leaves you high and dry, as one of the victims of the life force. <br /> <br /> And to think that this film was released in the lovely and pleasant 80s, when people flocked to E.T. or Cocoon, or other sweet and boring movies of a good movie. No wonder he was blown up, because he was far ahead of his time with his super nihilistic point of view! <br /> <br /> As for the DVD, well, that's not great. The image is cloudy and grainy, and there are no additions. But it's nice to see the film in widescreen format. I just hope they release a clean, fresh American version on DVD and with comments from Hooper and Dixstra.
