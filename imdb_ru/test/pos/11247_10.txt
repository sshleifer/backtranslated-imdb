I am sure that all Canadians on IMDb are too familiar with Canadian content, and how dim it is ... well, let's say, dull. There are several Canadian shows that are really worth seeing, but this is definitely one of them. <br /> <br /> A simple premise. Two guys pick up girls in a bar with certain guidelines and rules, add some ingenious and clever comments from a group of amazingly cute self-proclaimed Alpha Males, and you have very interesting programming. Every episode is solid. If the "players" do not meet the standards, then there are some awkward moments that can be experienced, and they have some light fun. If the "players" are good, this leads to moments when you just need to stand up and applaud, and some humorous praise falls on them. <br /> <br /> I think this is a pretty cheesy premise. a guy who usually takes pride in the fact that I am towering over a typical, terrible reality show, I need a lot to admit that this show is really fun and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> One thing to note is that The Comedy Network did a terrible job advertising this show. For a long time I didn’t even know about it, and all I knew was that there was some shirtless guy who “likes the cougar”. However, after I actually watched the show, I was surprised at how amazing it looks for Canadian content (despite the rather unfortunate sequence of opening credits). So give it a shot. I have not yet found a person (18-30 years old) in the target demography who would really watch the show (and not just annoying commercials) who did not like it. <br /> <br /> Bring him back for the third season, Comedy Network. He has a really good premise, unlike some other Canadian shows (cough * girls will be girls * cough). I usually reserve 10/10 ratings for “works of art”, but I just have so much fun to watch this show, and I think that my unfairly condemned many that I just needed.
