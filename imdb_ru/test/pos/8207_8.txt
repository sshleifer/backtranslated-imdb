This is a strong underrated little thriller with thrills - a lot, with a cool story, Sandra Bullock is awesome! All the characters are great, and I was surprised how unpredictable it was, because there were only a few predictable moments, plus Sandra Bullock is just amazing in that! Jeremy Northham played a terrific villain, and I know what Bullock's character is, because I'm the same type of people (I hardly ever get out), plus it's pretty well done and written for the most part, In my opinion, it should be above 5.5, plus Denis Miller was surprisingly better than expected in his small role. The scene where the North was terrorized by Bullock on his boat was quite tense and was one of my favorite moments, and I also liked the chase scene at the carnival, plus I also liked the final, as it was pretty well done, even if I did think that Northam was defeated too quickly. There are also many other good chase scenes, and sometimes this is also smart, plus there are also quite a few shocking moments. It's a small, underrated thriller, with a lot of thrills, with a cool story, Sandra Bullock is awesome, I highly recommend this one! The direction is excellent! Irwin Winkler done! working here with great camera work, adding a good atmosphere, good angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace. Acting fantastic! Sandra Bullock, as always, is amazing and amazing, she is very pleasant, strong as nails, but rather vulnerable, and I could feel her, because, as I said, I kind of like Angela, I almost never go out, I really liked her work in this movie! (Bullock rules !!!!!!!). Jeremy Northam is superb as a villain, he was cunning, unpredictable and very formidable, he was great. Dennis Miller is surprisingly fine and not annoying in his small role, and he managed to bring some comic relief. The rest of the cast are fine. Overall, I highly recommend this one! *** 1/2 of 5
