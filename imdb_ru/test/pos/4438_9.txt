What a tribute to his father! He went searching to find out more about a man he knew little about, and by the end of the road, I think Nathaniel Kahn was pleased with what he had learned and personally felt. The film is being prepared for 5 years, and a quarter of a century after his death, the complete commitment of Louis I. Kahn to his work is a constant strong desire to build buildings that are important for humanity and timeless for the whole world, his life Nathaniel proudly depicted in the documentary film “My Architect: A Son's Journey”. <br /> <br /> This film is by no means an anthology of Louis’s work. There are many books and archival materials in which there are records of the projects and buildings of Louis Kahn. This documentary works like a mystery; Nathaniel Kahn, a writer-director and co-producer, was looking for a man whom he briefly knew as his father. <br /> <br /> Movie chapter by chapter. In the movie “Heading West,” we work at the Salk Institute for Biological Research in La Jolla, California. This spectacle worth seeing is the integral concept of Kahn and the environment, which optimizes light for scientists at work, is amazing. From a former colleague who worked with “Lou” 35 years ago, we hear about his painstaking attention to detail, and also about how much he can be “frisky” - of course, his words were not criticized. The memorable scene is when the camera pulled back wide and we see Nathaniel skating off the Salk Institute Square - a tiny figure that looks like a child happily playing in the cup of his father’s arms. <br /> <br /> The immigrant segment led us to a meeting with Anne Ting, an architect who worked with Lou, and also bore him a daughter, Alex. Now that he was 80, Ting’s return with Nathaniel’s film crew to the Bath House project in Trenton, New Jersey, was nostalgic. In Go to Sea, we see the Barge for the American Wind Symphony Orchestra — all made of steel, and we meet Robert Boudreau, who was surprised by Nathaniel when he finally told him that he was the son of Lou. Boudreau was moved, he said that he had seen Nathaniel, when he was six years old, with his mother (Harriet Pattison), and he had never told anyone that Lou had a son. It was a “suffocating” emotional moment of reunion. <br /> <br /> Like his father The Nomad, Nathaniel went to Jerusalem and learned about the Synagogue project, which his father started but did not realize. He visited the weeping wall, and, seeing how his yarmulk continued to fall / “come off”, his head gave me the feeling that he did not need to be “completely” Jewish to be the son of his father. We continue to sit with his two half sisters in the Family Issues segment. We also hear him talking to his mom in Maine, and from conversations with previous office workers in his father's office, we learn how his father worked intensively and practically lived there, slept on the carpet on the office floor, on weekends and everything such <br /> <br /> “The End of the Road” led us to Ahmedabad, India, at the building of the Indian Institute of Management. A conversation with the architect B.V. Doshe was a revelation. In the end, Nathaniel found a very lively Louis Kahn, his father - his spirit lives in him. This documentary is very important to me. Most of the time I was with tears in my eyes - it was very touching, and I am delighted with the man, the architect and his son, and the women in his life, except for his famous works and buildings. Louis I. Kahn wanted to give his love to “the whole world,” juggling work and three families (you could say that there are three women in his life to support his inspiration). As Shamsul Vares, architect of Bangladesh’s capital complex (completed 9 years after Lu’s death), pointed out: Luis Kahn gave much to the people of Bangladesh, spending time in Bangladesh, understanding the culture of this place and people - and also giving them democracy through what he reached, and for such a dedicated person, usually people close to him whom he often missed. It seems the price of the great comes with unavoidable personal sacrifices. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of King Widor’s Source of 1949 (a good dramatic story in b / w with music by Max Steiner), based on Ayn Rand’s novel, with Gary Cooper as an uncompromising architect his own ideals and Patricia Neal as a parallel supportive woman in his life. <br /> <br />
