Paul Rudnik (Jeffrey, Addams Family Values) wrote this frothy fairy tale about a soft-educated school teacher (Kevin Kline), which at the Oscar awards are presented by a former student who became an actor (Matt Dillon). The rest of the film tells about the absurdities revolving around this production - about the impact on the city, its bride (Joan Cusack), about himself - and the culmination of the final "everyone loves everyone." <br /> <br /> If you are an evil gay rights activist or a naive young man who is looking for an accurate picture of a person’s fight for quitting or a “true” description of gay life, then save yourself from problems and rent something else (maybe , Beautiful Thing) or read the book (Giovanni's Room). If you are able to understand that this film was inspired by the pious speech of Tom Hanks at the Academy Awards when he won for Philadelphia and makes fun of Hollywood culture and ignorance of a small town, and you love the clown comedy of the 30s (Bringing Up Kids, Holiday , The Palm Beach Story) then enjoy! Far from being biting satire, the film attempts to farce Preston Sturges' plethora and damn close. No, he is not “deep” or “powerful” - like Romy and Michelle, 9–5, or “Young Frankenstein” - and does not claim this; it holds his tongue firmly in his cheek. It becomes too preaching and offensive for his own good to the end, and some jokes are a bit out of date (there is also a scene in the dressing room that could be cut out), but after sitting in countless comedies that miss the ignition, it’s like breath fresh air. <br /> <br /> Kevin Klein and Tom Selleck are great at playing, and Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley are great support. Joan Cusack’s award-winning work is stellar, and the great Bob Newhart, well, Bob Newhart. <br /> <br /> The fact that many were offended by In & Out is as absurd as the mentality of the townspeople, over whom he taunts; I was personally offended by Philadelphia. I will take a harmless fluff because of bigotry at any time.
