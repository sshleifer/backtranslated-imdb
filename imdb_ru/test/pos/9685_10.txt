This film was borderline in rude humor .... I absolutely can not believe that these people can get away with it. Johnny Knoxville did not cross the line ... he stomped everyone! It was better than the first ... ALL SO! What I discovered in the first film is that the machinations looked as if they were on television. show. NOT THIS TIME!!! they completely made a 180 degree turn ... the whole cast is so outstanding in what they do and the stunts weren't crazy ... but the music is mostly suitable for any situation ... GOOD WORK !!!! When you go to watch it, be sure to use the bathroom before you go to the theater, keep a strong belly and remember that your drink does not jump out of your nose ...
