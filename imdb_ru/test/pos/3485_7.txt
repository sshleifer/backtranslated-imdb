Because of its predictable, second-rate title (at least, it was so common in Italy) I did not expect much from this film. I thought it would be another cheap movie about a haunted house (“LA CASA MALEDETTA” means “Cursed House”). Well, I had to change my mind immediately after the very first brilliant scene! The constant presence of the priests and the eerie atmosphere reminded me a bit of Exorcist and some of his decent Italian robberies, but it will be something completely different ... It’s more like Hitchcock meets an Italian thriller! Very well written and directed, good actors, interesting plot ... Well, I tried not to spoil your view of "7 Hyden Park", which I highly recommend to everyone. <br /> <br /> P.S. Am I mistaken, or when Joanna crawls or struggles to get up (she is paralyzed from the waist down), are her feet and legs moving too much? (... And I'm not talking about the sequence of "bad sleep.")
