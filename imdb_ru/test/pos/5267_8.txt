Vidor shines like Judith, the only truly strong and compassionate member of a purely patriarchal family. Her brother, David, is so stunned by their father that it is amazing that he can even tie up his shoes instead of asking dad to do it for him. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers have already outlined the story, so I will not rephrase it; I will, however, point out that Nan, who is pregnant with David, is also married to him. This is not a pregnancy outside of marriage, which would be terrible by the standards of 1921. They are secretly married, but Nana's father, to whom Davidâ€™s father paid, tears up the marriage certificate. <br /> <br /> The death scene of Nana with Judith present is a truly heartbreaking experience, and very charged with emotions. This scene alone is worth watching a movie, but the plot is much broader; why are modern films not made with the same attention to history?
