Whoever loves my children, changed my heart, made me cry to the end, I cried most of all when the family had to say goodbye to the child, I cried with this the most, and every time they adopted the child I cried when they had to say goodbye to my mother , they were sad to part with their mother, I felt sorry for the child with epilepsy, I was glad that he was adopted by the same family as one of his brothers. For me, this boy, I thought, was special, because he was going into the house. I feel that I am special because I am in a world with Asperger syndrome, and sometimes, when I feel depressed, I sometimes like to cry. I really liked this movie, 10 out of 10. The real story is very good. Another film that would cause tears in your eyes, I think, would be on Tuesday with Morrie (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207805)
