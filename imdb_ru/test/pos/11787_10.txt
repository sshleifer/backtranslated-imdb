after my daughter was born in 1983, I needed to lose weight. I tried the 20-minute workout and got hooked. I lost about 50 pounds. it was the biggest weight I've ever lost in my life. I can't believe this show is forgotten. it would be a blessing if you started the cable channel strictly for the exercises and included a 20-minute workout. I think it was the best workout video ever made. I would like to buy it somewhere and somewhere. the routine was easy to learn, and you spent a lot of effort. The training they have today is too complex and too difficult to learn. Please make every effort to return this video to circulation. I pray that this will be a blessing to all who see and use it.
