As a fan of St. Etienne and the City of London, I was very happy to see this film on the list of the Vancouver International Film Festival. This film has great shots, an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting ideas about “not very famous” London. <br /> <br /> The film is completely made in “dark” colors, which I personally do not like too much. In addition, the narration was too British, and the comments sometimes became a bit flat. In addition, there are some great comments from Londoners and great shots. FINISTERRE does not glorify London, showing all the great sights of the city, but rather gives a deep understanding of what London really looks like. From the East End to the lively center with its music scene, as well as “special minor digressions” for Londoners. <br /> <br /> In general: <br /> <br /> + Excellent soundtrack + Excellent shots + excellent insight <br /> <br /> -Arrability -Remote from time to time -Very dark picture <br /> <br /> Worth seeing! I give it 7/10
