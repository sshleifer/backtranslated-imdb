I would buy it and “Thirty seconds to Toyko” today, if available. I also saw this movie after I saw Jack Webb's big billboards at the age of 12 in his Blues Dress on the highway. Always admired Jack Weeb as John Wayne and the American. Almost became a Marine only because of this film, but instead served in the Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Army Reserve for 32 years. I have not seen this movie on TV and would like to have it on DVD. At least, if it was on TV, I would copy it on VHS and use it until it appears on DVD. I also have a large collection of films about the Second World War and the Korean War, and I am always looking for new releases on DVD.
