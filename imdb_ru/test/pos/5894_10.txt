Blue ribbon banners, stars and stripes forever, decorated generals and the unconditional surrender of opponents who demanded tons and tons of radiation - this is what was the main goal of the United States victory in World War II !! Celebration in Times Square, as elsewhere in the United States, involves a national zenith !!! America on the top right! one thing, one painful and painstakingly perverted thing .. Period of adaptation !! .. The actual celebration ended when a bottle of champagne was over .. Now everyone should continue their lives ... only one problem, though .. they should get new lives ... old lives are gone forever ... Polite and pleasant smiles had fragile facade with durability of ice cubes in boiling water !! All film characters are crammed with primitive doubts and are unable to hide the pretense that nothing serious happened, for the simple reason that this is not true !!! When sergeants, generals, their wives, daughters and sons, as well as virtually all other Americans touched by World War II, became victims of disabilities, nightmares and accusations in World War II and what she really achieved, as well as denied, no one was not the same !! At the moment, social and moral issues had a vested interest ... Frederic March and Myrna Loy should have started all over again! Dana Andrews realized that he should never have married a Virginia Mayo! Theresa Wright was painfully aware of the fact that she is constructively selfish! Weasel, but not least, the character, Homer, is going to marry, and he thinks that everyone around him is also devastated by his injury, mainly in the sense that they cannot or do not want to cope !! <br /> <br /> The reason why this film is so fabulous is that the happy ending was not easy, when everyone learned of the new beginning of the new United States and the new world as a whole, the tragedy of the Second World War was recognized and things that were emotionally torn apart were taken on the run, and they were treated accordingly !! Frederick March and Myrna Loy must return to the first chapter of their marriage, Homer informed his new bride about what it takes to marry him (that is, half the time she will feel like a nurse) and Trez Wrightâ€™s participation in Dana Andrews says that entry into adulthood led to partial responsibility for divorce ... This is tantamount to learning how to drive to get a driver's license in Indianapolis 500 ... The characters in the film are typical Americans after World War II Whether a standstill due to a rude awakening violent changes in their life ... Happiness is no longer available Luxury adjective kopest aesthetic ... now we are talking about the terrible conditions and a good victory over evil by less ugly choice !! ... World War II did not just happen !! From now on, it will dominate the social models of American life !!! <br /> <br /> The cumulative catastrophe of the Second World War also reflected the feelings of most Americans regarding personal human inadequacies !! I liked this film, as well as AFI. Probably for the reason that it revealed problems that were unjustifiably forbidden in its time !! .. Bottom line, watch this movie !! Nightmares about battles, family misfortunes and / or reconfiguration dilemmas, how to cope with life when they are affected by disability, and just basically acting people are constantly portrayed today in movies and on television, BUT !! it is 1946 !! Very new to Americans then .... REMEMBER THAT !! Director William Wyler illustrated how Americans relate to the consequences of World War II in the days when the film industry left him with one hand behind the back !!! Take this into account, and you will probably realize how sensational this film was!
