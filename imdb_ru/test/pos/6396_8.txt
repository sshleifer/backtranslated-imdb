“My wife and children” is a good and funny series, which really shows the worries and problems that occur most even in the best families. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle (dad) is a person who always tries to stop his children from being engaged in adolescents, such as parties, drinking, love or making love. When they do something wrong, he corrects them right away (by the way, he likes to do bad punishments). <br /> <br /> Janet "Jay" Kyle (mother) has a strong personality and rarely agrees with her husband. She understands that their children are teenagers and they like to do the "wrong" things, unlike Michael. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle “the younger” is a stupid guy who believes in everything that others say. At the beginning of the series, he is such a cool guy and tries to be like his father, but lately, I don’t know why, he becomes a very, very stupid guy, and he is starting to be a problem guy. At the end of the series, he falls in love with Vanessa and becomes a father, or, I would say, a stupid father who does nothing right. <br /> <br /> Kadi Kyle is a typical teenager who loves to have fun, kiss and drink. She has many problems with her parents, because they too often interfere with her personal life. She has a boyfriend named Tony who is catholic and afraid of everything, so we cannot understand what makes her meet him. I remember one episode when they are ready to have sex, but Michael Kyle scares Tony, arguing that sex is very dangerous and deadly, so he decides to protect himself until he gets married. <br /> <br /> I resume this best episode in my life, and I still watch it every day after three years, so I recommend it to everyone - mostly teenagers.
