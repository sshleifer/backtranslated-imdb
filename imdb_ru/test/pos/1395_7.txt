Although the video block for many copies of this film speaks of people turned inside out, it is a complete lie. In fact, in addition to the initial segment, the film is not even a horror film. With his sunken treasure, fishermen’s legions and mad scientists, it’s more like the Doug McClure adventure film. Obviously, this film is not a work of art, but watching it is rather funny ... I’m just warning you that the beginning is rather awful.
