A few years ago, I watched this film without subtitles on television, and despite the fact that I did not understand a word about what the characters say, I still got a general idea, and the mood of the film fascinated me without end. <br /> <Finally I saw it again a few weeks ago. my heart sank when I saw the picture in the TV guide, and for 8 days, until the film was actually shown, I told everyone that I knew to go and watch it. This story reminded me a little of Alfred Hitchcock's dizziness. a slow, thoughtful film about a guy who once believes that he sees a girlfriend who disappeared many years ago. what follows is a wild roller coaster ride with memories, changing perspectives and truly ingenious twists and turns in the plot, and at the end of the film I was gasping for breath. I definitely did not get what I expected (and I actually saw the movie already!). get ready to get confused. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
