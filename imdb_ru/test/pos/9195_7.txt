Isabelle just got out of prison. She decided not to return, but the life of the former convict is difficult, especially if they are homeless, like Isabel. When she finds who her boyfriend Rufo was, she sees the light of hope, but Rufo is now not only a drug addict, but also has AIDS. This will not make Isabelle give up, because if there is a desire, there is a way, and she is going to fight for her future, lead a normal life, having a home and family. A very heavy and touching film, which most Spanish cinemas did not know about, the actors are great, and the story is very touching, perhaps the best attitude towards secondary characters would make the film better, but it's really good. I highly recommend him to watch, but keep in mind that this is not a happy Disney movie, it is heavy and dramatic.
