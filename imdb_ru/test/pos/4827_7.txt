May contain spoilers !!! In no case, the form or shape of this film does not destroy the shape of the horror film. Not at all. Nevertheless, it creates a terrible atmosphere, fairly believable characters and blood. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and does not try to turn itself as it should. A group of children died in a mine accident in the early 1900s. Since then, they have pursued and killed the residence of their small sleepy town in the mountains. <br /> <br /> Simple: they want revenge on the person who caused their death many years ago. Naturally, his great-great-grandson is in the city, and he is a freak. <br /> <br /> Along with this, the mother and her two daughters inherit the old house after the death of her husband. The eldest daughter is a rebellious, nasty ... typical teenager. The younger one is curious, he has bright eyes and communicates with ghost children. <br /> <br /> The most terrible part of this film is the apparent insensitivity of the children, and they make their way through the victim for the victim. Great acting game. It was so creepy! I mean, the movie “Children of Corn” is one thing, but it surpasses all of these (as in creepy children). <br /> <br /> In spite of this. I bought it before I saw it, and I was not unhappy. But I'm a fan of horror to the end.
