The best performance of Gary Busey in a flowing biography. Since he had a musical education, he could write his own songs, and it really works. It is always nice to see this beautiful actor Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. Best game = Gary Busey. Fortunately, Mr. Busey was nominated for an Oscar for this, losing to John Voight in COMING HOME. A rather low-budget movie that doesnâ€™t disappoint, with Mr. GREAT SONGS. Holly. I hope it did a lot of dough. Busey has never been so popular again for various reasons, but fortunately he has one great one in his resume.
