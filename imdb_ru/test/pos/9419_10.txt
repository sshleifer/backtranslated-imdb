The brilliant adventure of Sherlock Holmes starring brilliant Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Despite the fact that many other actors play Holmes and Watson brilliantly and do an excellent job with this, Rathbone and Bruce will always be the best two. <br /> <br /> Holmes brings Professor Tobella from Switzerland to London. Tobel is wanted by the Nazis. He has a scope that can win the second world war. His explosion site was divided into four parts, each of which was hidden in books. Tobell agrees to transfer his bomber to the British government. On the night of his arrival, Tobell goes to his girlfriend's house. He painted several figures of men so that, if Tobell was gone, the lady would have to hand the drawings to Holmes. On the way home, he is attacked, but the policeman stops it, and the attacker escapes. Tobell is glad that the British government is using his explosion site, but refuses to provide it to them, Tobell wants to take care of it. The site of the bomb is divided into four parts, each of which is completely useless without the other. He passes one part of this explosion to one of his fellow scientists. Then the biggest fear of Holmes happens, Tobell goes missing. Holmes is visiting a young lady Tobell since the night he was attacked. She tells him about the drawings. Drawings were stolen. She says that when Tobella left, only one person came in to fix the light bulb. The person she describes is Professor Moriarty. He works for the Nazis. Seeing how he has pictures, Holmes is ready. But he finds the notebook that he used, and using the “Science”, he manages to see what Tobell has painted, by viewing the next page on the notebook. He sees this code. He sees that it is the name of four scientists. The first three he develops the code, but the fourth he can not work. Three scientists, which he developed, were killed, and the site of the explosion was taken. Holmes cannot find the fourth scientist, but Moriarty cannot either. Disguised as a sailor, Holmes manages to enter Moriarty’s office. Moriarty immediately sees that this is Holmes, puts it in a box and throws it into the sea. But Watson and Lestrade insist that they search the box and find Holmes in it. Now it is obvious that Moriarty is free. Holmes manages to develop a fourth code, Frederick Hoffner. Holmes immediately gets to his house and sends Hoffner and the decisive fourth part to a safe place. Now Holmes needs to accuse Moriarty of working with the Nazis. He pretends to be Hoffner. Moriarty is developing a fourth code and forcing two men to bypass Hoffner. They take him back, and he comes face to face with Moriarty. Meanwhile, Tobell is not in a good way, he was tortured and tortured to get the name of the fourth scientist. Moriarty had it with Holmes now, he got it, and his death should be long for Holmes. The idea is to put him in his hospital, insert a needle into his vein and watch him die from blood loss, drop by drop. Watson runs and saves the day, though. Moriarty escapes, but Holmes was casual enough to leave Moriarty’s hatch open. Moriarty falls sixty feet. <br /> <br /> So Moriarty is dead. Not. He makes his last entry in the movie "Woman in Green", but in "Green" he is definitely dead, suicide, he jumps from the roof. It was Moriarty the second of three appearances in the series Rathbone, each time it was played by another actor. His first appearance in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes was played by George Zucco, his second in this film was Lionel Atville, and Henry Daniels plays him in the final film Woman in Green. Holmes' first three films made by All were arranged in a war, as Holmes defeated the Nazis. "Voice of Terror" was the first, then this film, and then "Sherlock Holmes in Washington." He then returned to Victorian times, with a certain relationship to the Edwardian and Georgian (George the fifth and sixth) times. This film had a close connection with Sherlock Holmes’s Dancing People story, which can be found in Sherlock Holmes Returns. An excellent film, albeit with explicit propaganda, it was a brilliant way out of Holmes.
