The Golden Door, enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (“Beau Travail”), is a visually striking tonal poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to New York Island at the turn of the century. This is a surreal, mysterious, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. The latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro), combining fabulous and symbolic images with austere realism, is similar to an impressionistic picture - an artist’s cinematic representation of what the immigration process could be for our parents and grandparents. Crealese's “magical, mysterious journey” came as a result of his visit to the museum on Ellis Island, his gaze on the faces of the immigrants depicted in the photographs he saw, and his research on the harsh policies and procedures used during the reception of the immigrants. <br /> <br /> Guided by the letters he read about immigrants sent to relatives who stayed at home, Krialets identifies himself with those impoverished immigrants who could see the positive side of things beyond their harsh ordeals. For Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) and his eldest son Angelo (Francesco Casis) America is a distant dream of which they know nothing. After climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the saints for a sign, they are rewarded when they are shown postcards to the younger son of Salvatore, Pietro (Filippo Puchillo), deaf and dumb, who portrays a new world like earth where they can bathe in milk rivers sit under a money tree or collect giant onions and carrots. <br /> <br /> After disposing of their animals in exchange for shoes and costumes, Salvatore, his two sons and his elderly mother Fortunat (Aurora Quattrocchi) went on an adventure with more hope than trembling, but soon the equation moved in the other direction. When they get into the boat and sit in their crowded compartments of the third class, the most talked about scene in the movie happens. Using the upper chamber, which shows the masses of people standing when the ship pulls away, the frame is divided into those that are on board the ship, and those who wave goodbye from the dock, and how they are separated, implies that they are being torn away from everything familiar. . <br /> On board the ship is a mysterious Englishwoman named Lucy (Charlotte Gainsburg). Krialez does not reveal his past or the reasons for which she travels to America, but it seems that she is in favor of the attack of the modern world in which they are entering. Although they look at each other with caution, Lucy is interested in Salvatore and asks him to marry her to allow her to enter the country. The journey is treacherously with a strong storm hitting the ship. Shot in almost complete darkness, the passengers in the steering wheel rush aboard the boat, and then the bodies lie entangled and curved on the floor, as in the terrible Totentants. The rite of immigration processing on Ellis Island does not get any easier, and the Kylean attack how illiterate peasants, in the name of preserving a “civilized” society, are forced to assemble puzzles, perform mathematical tasks and undergo humiliating medical examinations to prove that they are “in shape.” <br /> <br /> The brokerage ceremony looks like an auction block, and young women look depressed when compared to middle-aged men with overweight. However, this is the only way in which they can enter the Golden Door, since single women are rejected if they have no partners, ostensibly to prevent the threat of prostitution. Through the fog, immigrants barely see the land with milk and honey, and there is no Statue of Liberty asking the tired and poor, humble masses eager to breathe freely. In their imagination, however, the river still flows, waiting for them to jump into it. Although the ending is ambiguous, and one door opens onto a blank wall, another door symbolizes the rebirth of the soul and the passage that we all must take from the old world to the new.
