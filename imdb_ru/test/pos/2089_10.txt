A great movie. Every moment, masterfully led by Toyoda and his team. Actors give authentic performances everywhere. Visual effects are intrusive, beautiful and sometimes obsessively beautiful shots of Japanese country and cityscapes. Sounds courtesy of the Japanese group 'Dig' are never too harsh, as you might expect from the soundtracks created by the group. It is strangely atmospheric and well suited for the scenes in which they are located. <br /> <br /> In general, they all worked perfectly well .... Well, if they could judge history, perfection is the only thing anyone could accept. <br /> <br /> Real greatness 9 Souls is a fascinating story. A film about escaping from prison today may be a lost genre, and a film about a road trip loses its appeal because the world is getting smaller. But this story easily mixes something new for these two genres. <br /> <br /> 9 convicts are given freedom and, possibly, the opportunity to regain their place in society. society will take them? Will they really be free from their dark past? and can they stick together long enough to stay alive and find out? <br /> <br /> Every convict has an interesting story. Their crimes are as varied as their obvious fates. A sense of fraternity among them holds the story high in drama and provides it with funny comedic situations. And because of the peculiarities of their origin, violence is always what should happen. <br /> <br /> After all I can say is go and give him a watch.
