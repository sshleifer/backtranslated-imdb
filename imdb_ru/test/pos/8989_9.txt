Now I understand that most of those present here are cheating the YOUNG WARRIORS or calling it “entertainment that is so funny,” but let me clarify something: in fact, this is a high-quality film with a low rent if you are ready to watch such Cinema without a critical eye . In fact, it is much more exciting and challenging than most of the militants of the 80s. <br /> <br /> The key to the plot of the film. I always love films that are dedicated to the topic of vigilance, especially when they ambitiously explore the psyche of the characters involved. YOUNG WARRIORS may not have the intellect or sensitivity of the first film DEATH OF VALUE (and yes, I think the first one contained both of these elements), but it tries to differ from the ordinary Cannon films in that it is truly unique. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple (do not worry, there will be no spoilers): a group of pranksters-students change their views when one of their family members was attacked by a tough street gang. Students take to the streets to fight common street crime, because they do not know who is to blame for the gang. In the end, they acquire heavy artillery (machine guns and grenades) and roam at night, fully armed. However, these are not Schwarzenegger types; they are vulnerable, inexperienced novices who make significant mistakes almost every time they are going to clear the city (usually with their talisman dog in tow). They finally find out who this gang is and follow them, but by then you will not expect a standard climax when the good guys leave unharmed. <br /> <br /> In the film I was struck by one thing. Strange, but effective is that most of the first act does not give any indication that we will see any action or violence in the future, because it is treated like dumb brother comedies that you saw in the American "All Night" (where, I suppose, it was actually shown at one point). The comedy made me forget that the VHS cover shows a guy riding a motorcycle with a machine gun tied to his back. Then, when violence finally arrives, it's not at all fun and not cute ... it is shockingly disturbing. From this point on, the film becomes a full-blooded, uncompromising action thread containing amazing shots and blood. <br /> <br /> The action, although nothing special, is much more passionate than I expected. James Van Patten, who plays the main character, gives all his strength, and his play is surprisingly good for this type of film. The rest of the cast is equally invested, including the always reliable Ernest Borgnine as the father of a police hero. Cinematography is also higher than nominal, and the battle scenes are handled with a severity level that I personally did not expect. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people thought that this film was useless, since most of it was extremely dated, but these faces struck me as nothing but cool in their own right. Van Patten's character is studying animation, and his clearly early work in the style of the 80s, on display in several scenes, is a psychedelic wet dream of a retro movie lover. I am sure that most modern viewers would call these very moments in the film low points, but I disagree. In addition, the Joe Walsh soundtrack — which sounds like it could only be recorded in the 83rd — seemed particularly appropriate and enjoyable, no matter how “old” it seems today. <br /> <br /> YOUNG WARRIORS is one of my favorite 80s action films and I strongly urge anyone interested in the genre to take a look. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, it was released only on VHS, and today it is not shown on television. A good DVD presentation would make me walk across the moon across my living room with such intensity that I am sure my ankles were swollen. In the meantime, I beg you all to go to Ebay or Amazon and cough up ten bucks or something else for an old tape with big boxes. This is a truly remarkable product of an ambitious junk movie.
