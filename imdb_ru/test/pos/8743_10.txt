Traffik is an excellent mini-series dealing with drug trafficking in Europe. This is the European series of PBS, on which the film "Oscar Nominee" movie "Traffic" is based. If you like Traffic, then Traffik is what you need to see. <br /> <br /> In general, I highly recommend this mini-series to anyone who is interested in looking at drugs from a social point of view. The scenario is exciting and unexpected because it is intertwined with the lives of drug dealers, drug dealers, farmers, politicians and policemen. Unlike other films that make a drug sensation, Traffik presents it as it is.
