The king of Romania, Vladislav (Angus Scrimm) is a vampire, but a vampire of light who wants nothing more than to live in peace and harmony with humanity. But his son, Radu (Anders Howe), is a cruel creature for his heart (which is pretty obvious once you see him). Three students came to study the local folklore, but were caught up in the legends about vampires at the wrong time: Vladislav was killed. <br /> <br /> Who can say something bad about a movie with a movie from Angus Scrimm? I can not I mean that I had little expectations after seeing other photos on the full moon (in particular, "Puppet Master" and "Demonic Toys"). But, despite the really bad animation effects of demons, this film was really very well made and it was very interesting to watch. Lots of blood, a good story and background (the story of the Bloodstone was amazingly refreshing) and even a few new points of view on the vampire myths that you think are already dead. (I may be mistaken, but this is probably the first film that shows rosaries fired from a gun.) In addition to vampires and blood, you get a share of nudity (causeless but desired), and I should have noticed an excellent score from composers (I'm not sure who deserves praise, but those involved include Stuart Brotman, Richard Kosinski, William Levine, Michael Portis, and John Zeretsk). This is a horror 101 completely. Gosh, you even get two sequels, which is a sign of a real horror movie. (Of course, some bad movies also get continued - did I mention The Puppet Master?) The Romanian theme was well done, and the film seems to have even been made by the Romanians, if I guess their names are going right. And music - music - really stood out for me as a good change of pace, a very mood. I like Richard Band, but I'm glad that another composer was given a chance, because he nailed the atmosphere on his head. If you like movies about vampires and want a small variation (one of the Eastern European varieties), this is worth a look.
