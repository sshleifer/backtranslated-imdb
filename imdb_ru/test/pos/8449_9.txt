Great movie from the late 1970s. He talks a lot about corporate corruption at the expense of the average person, so that influential people can make huge profits and ignore the environment and the safety of others. <br /> <br /> After almost 30 years, this film is convincing in the power of some legal entities who, since the release of the films, have gained tenfold ability to control; This shows the need for regulating society against influential business interests, the main purpose of which is to make a profit. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon is great, while Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas are equally irresistible in their roles. This frivolous seventieth year has been cursed for many years. <br /> <br /> The film gets better after each viewing.
