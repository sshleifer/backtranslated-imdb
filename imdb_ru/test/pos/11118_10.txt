This film tells the story of nine ambitious teens trying to pursue their dreams in the infamous New York Graduate School of Performing Arts: Coco, singer, Bruno, modern Mozart, Lisa, Leroy and Hilary, wrestling dancers, Ralph, comedian, and Doris and Montgomery, actors Although they all think that they have everything they need to achieve their goals, they will need much more than their talent. They will have to face rejection, a broken heart, education, pain and love in order to achieve their glory. <br /> <br /> “Glory” is one of the most fascinating, classic and inspiring films of all time. It has everything that a teenage drama / musical should have: extremely memorable, entertaining, Oscar-winning songs performed by stunning Irene Cara, stunning dance numbers, a very attractive cast that makes you believe in the characters, and a wonderful story, including a heart-rending scene when Coco meets the camcorder. <br /> <br /> As I said, the cast is awesome. Irene Kara can really act, and not only her singing makes her shine like Koko here. Lee Curreri is very good as Bruno. Barry Miller brings a lot of humor to Ralph. Maureen Tyfee is gorgeous as an outcast of Doris, and take a look, and you will see Paul McCrane from the “ER” as Montgomery. <br /> <br /> This is a really awesome movie. “Glory” really touched me and inspired me to continue to follow my dreams as an actor and singer. Any film that touches me so much is a winner in my book. Must see! The film really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer.
