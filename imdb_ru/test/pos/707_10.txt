I read on the Internet that this film turns into a theatrical function. Finally!!!!! It's time for Hollywood to unite. Big Studios are always unhappy with the sharp stuff on which Oscar is written. Go figure it out! <br /> <br /> Jericho Mile was made ahead of time. It is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Michael Mann, a true visionary, has found a way to attract the no-nonsense audience. The Emmy Peter Stross awards are probably the best character role I've ever seen in my life while watching a movie. Any actor who touches this role will never be the same (unless the Academy Award is on their robes). <br /> <br /> The sandy multi-ethnic ensemble, the background for Jericho Miles, allows us to understand the subtle social dynamics of our world. It is about redemption without public confirmation and the power of the human spirit, overcoming all barriers. Imagine a convict jailed since he was a lifelong adolescent with no chance of parole, who doesn't know that he is possibly the fastest runner in the world. ... what would you do ?? <br /> <br /> This film makes you feel that you have not been deceived at any level. Absolutely exciting, attractive, emotional and the soundtrack "Rolling Stones", which kicked ass !!! <br /> <br /> I always thought that this would be done for a large screen ... I canâ€™t wait ...! !! At the same time, I will have to continue to revise my weathered copy of VHS, which I have had for many years.
