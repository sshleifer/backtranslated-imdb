The Hindi film version is 121 minutes. Filmed in Bengal in the early 1900s, the film (based on Tagore’s novel) draws an analogy between the British colonization of India and the subjection of women. An educated and beautiful woman, Binodini becomes a widow within a year after her marriage, but she does not accept the restrictions imposed on her as a widow by her society. The film has a beautiful appearance, but perhaps Aishwarya Rai is unable to describe Binodini’s strong character with its subtle combination of idealism and cunning. The idealism of Binodini does not occur, and as a result, the analogy between women and colonization remains somewhat submerged.
