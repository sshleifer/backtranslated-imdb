I think this film was made as good as it could have been. With only 4 months and a budget of $ 52,000 - I am surprised that it was not worse. If you don't care about computer graphics or special effects, this movie is great. <br /> <br /> Okay, the film is not so well made (I'm sure it could be, but you try to do it best after 4 months) but the story is good and the film is quite exciting. <br /> <br /> Do not believe me when I say that this film is good because I also think that King Kong of 1933 is good. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I did not watch the whole movie either ... I could quickly forward a few minutes here and there ...
