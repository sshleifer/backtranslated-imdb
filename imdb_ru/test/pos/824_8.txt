For some time I did not see how Van Damme clicked, pleasantly surprised, he is still with him, he looks older, but he is tougher, like Sly, with age getting more rude. This is a good film that prompted me to look at all the Van Damme films that I missed in the last ten years. I would like a good director to put Van Damme on the big screen with a good plot. Van Damme still has a chance to surprise the public, the last film that was watched from Van Damme was Legionnaire, and it was a good film. In addition, I looked at the history of Van Damme's early fights, and I was surprised to realize that he was a real, very experienced martial artist in his youth.
