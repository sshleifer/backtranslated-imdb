In fact, I was thinking about investing in this film when Gorman was collecting money. I liked most of the script, but I didn’t like the final. Gorman insisted that the end be what it should be. <br /> <br /> Having seen the finished film, I must say that I was amazed. Reading the script, I didn’t assume that the action (and the direction of Gorman) would be as powerful and exciting as here. The two hosts did an amazing job. They were very believable, and this film is worth seeing only for the performances of these two amazing stars. <br /> <br /> Now about the spoiler, and if you haven’t seen the movie yet, please don’t read further until you have to watch the movie first. (Actually, I wish I had never read the script, just so that I could see the film ending first-hand.) <br /> <br /> ------------- ------ ---------- SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have two main problems with the film. First of all, and I'm sure I mentioned this when reading the script, the wife had to die. If she were dead, the ending would be much more believable. In fact, we have a boyfriend who suffered because of a woman who left him "many years ago." If she left him, and he fell in love so long, he would have to be seriously mistaken. But he does not encounter this in the script. (There is also the problem of why he did not spend all this energy on pursuing his wife, whom he still loves.) <br /> <br /> Also, if the wife were dead, we really could believe that they had a satisfying, reciprocating love, and therefore I believe that the guy is empty enough for the ending to be reasonable. <br /> <br /> However, I do not buy Daphne, doing what she does in the end. I would have had a hell of a lot of convincing to believe that this naive girl (very naive for a whore, but plausible because of Bol's speech) did what she did. The character is simply not cold enough. And if she did it because of some kind of love or something else, then the whole part of the movie / story was gone. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie reminds of “Sex, Lies and Video Cassette. "I think it could be just as popular if Gorman decided to give the film a more realistic end. <br /> <br /> So watch a movie, enjoy the show. And decide for yourself.
