From the very beginning to the end, this film attracts with great performances, a great soundtrack with original Douglas Brown music and a well thought out script full of surprises. <br /> <br /> Full of new and not-so-new faces, this film demonstrates a promising talent, especially in the case of Craig Morris, who plays protagonist Eddie Monroe. Morris, who also wrote the script, demonstrates calm strength combined with a strong emotional performance, as he creates a believable character on the screen. In addition, the poignant words of Paul Vario, who plays Uncle Benny with sincere warmth, were so convincing that he made me starve when he lovingly prepared his Italian sauce. <br /> <br /> Great new faces, great new music and great new story - what more can you ask for. This film is highly recommended!
