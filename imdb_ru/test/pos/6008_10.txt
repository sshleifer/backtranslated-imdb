Ted Danson was a great choice to play Gulliver. Although his experience was basically a comedy, he shows here that he can do drama just as well or maybe even better (although there is a lot of humor in it). It is difficult to close eyes on his American accent, especially since his character must be English, but this is a minor thing. <br /> <br /> All the villains are equally well played: James Fox, Edward Fox, Peter O'Toole, Warwick Davis, John Standing, etc. Despite the fact that most of them are tiny people or giants, they 100% plausible in everything they do, and their motives are very clear, for example, the Lilliputians’s unyielding suspicion of Gulliver, Guildrig’s (giant) dwarf’s hatred for him for usurping his court jester position, Dr. Bates’s attempt to make Gulliver insane to could marry mary. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenbergen is great as Mary Gulliver (another English character from the 17th century with an American accent, but it doesn't matter). She is a deeply tortured character, because for nine years she has been waiting for her husband to return home, and when he finally does, he talks about tiny people, giants, a flying island and talking horses! Mary, despite the strong fantasy element in the story, is a very believable character. <br /> <br /> The special effects are amazing, especially when you consider that it was filmed on a television scale at a time when CGI was in infancy. It looks very realistic when we see a person growing 6 feet tall walking through a city filled with people 6 inches tall. <br /> <br /> Cameos are also great: Omar Sharif, Richard Wilson, Sir John Gilgud, Christine Scott Thomas, Ned Beatty. All the great actors who create a strong cast that complements Danson's superb acting ability. <br /> <br /> Houynhnhms and Yahoos are probably the most effective element of the satirical story: the talking horse society. who do not possess any vices that people have, while Yahoos are primitive, disgusting people who forcefully mate and appoint their leader depending on how disgusting he is. The study of Gulliver and Mistress is also very well done and shows the differences and similarities between people and Yahoos. <br /> <br /> The best version of Gulliver's Travels to date and one of the best mini-series ever,
