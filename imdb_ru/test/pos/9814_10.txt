In response to the “state of confusion”, the injuries to the dogs seem to disappear rather sharply, but this could only be a continuity error. But as for children trying to build a plane out of the garbage, it’s just a matter of imagination. These are two very young children who have an extremely active imagination, and they must rely on this imagination in order not to be exposed to the level of violence that occurs in their home by their stepfather. As for the stepfather, it is very interesting that the director decided not to show his face. It makes him seem more monstrous. If you show your face, then this character will become a person, and not just this “monster” terrorizing the childhood of these two innocent children. By showing only the consequences of his ill-treatment and not focusing the scenes on the cruel treatment, children become the main theme of the film. This film has no loose ends, but works just like a father’s story about his children. He has embellishment. This is a good American classic.
