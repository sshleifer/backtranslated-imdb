I saw Peter Watkin's “Culloden and the War Game” a few months before and was very impressed. The technique is essentially the same, or at least very similar, this film describes in detail, on the one hand, the trial of dissidents in California in the (obviously) near future, and on the other, attempts by a group of convicted "criminals" to go through 50 miles of desert to win their freedom in the government "park of punishments" as an alternative to prison. Watkins removes everything in a documentary style, which causes more than a small awkwardness or requires a strong removal from disbelief: how is it that the film crew spends more than 2 days with a group of starving and dried up prisoners, without offering help or sharing their suffering? And this is just the most obvious example. But the dubious story-telling aside, it strikes; There is no doubt that you should be interested in political filmmaking in order to truly take part, but the film does not really look like anything else from its era: it does not draw from scratch, does not offer simple solutions. Left-wing political figures, of course, are sometimes portrayed broadly, but not all of them are the same; right-wing government officials seem a bit more caricature, but even they are allowed to show at least a little humanity. In general, the film makes you wonder and leaves an indelible taste ..... 8/10 DVD rental
