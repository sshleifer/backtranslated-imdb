WARNING: MAY contain several minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to say anything bad about this movie except one thing. <br /> <br /> YOU DO NOT GET TO SEE THIS MORE !! !! Again, maybe this is because you need to be at home in the morning or at 3 am to catch it on Fox Movie. <br /> <br /> It’s a pity, because it’s another gem lost in time, Clifton Webb takes his patented sour, omniscient behavior, which he refined as Lynn Belvedere (“Sitting in Grace” and continuing), and turns "Boy of nature." <br /> <br /> Actually, it is. <br /> Webb plays Robert Jordan as the leading Sunday children's educational program that loses audience share, and the network informs him that he has to do something about it, or something else. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem may be due to the fact that the married owner does not have children. <br /> <br /> BUMMER !!! But when such things happen, the pastor of the local church needs a leader for an undisciplined detachment of boy scouts, and he finds a voluntary sacrifice ... <Br /> <br /> Problem solved, RIGHT ??? <br /> <br /> WRONG !!! There are other problems with this movie. <br /> <br /> For example, it turns out that one of the scouts is the son of his boss at a television station, which causes slight friction; Moreover, the child is overweight, he has asthma and attitude. <br /> <br /> And he is more reasonable. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is this newcomer, Mike (George Winslow), who wants to wander in the style of "homeless puppies." <br /> <br /> As it turns out, the reason is that he does not have his relatives, but a relative takes care of him, which is not much time for him. <br /> <br /> These are the things that make his job harder than expected. <br /> <br /> In general, Webb begins to understand children better, and not only keeps his show, but also gets a useful lesson, and in the end even accepts Mike. <br /> <br /> Still a great movie after all these years.
