Cooley High is such a wonderful film that even with the sound track of that time, the cityscape, wardrobe and slang ... it is still not outdated. By the way, the sound track itself is an eternal classic. <br /> <br /> Instead, it absorbs you. This is the main product of a good movie. From beginning to end, he never misses a second, and I never get tired of watching him. <br /> <br /> Its ending is unique in that it is one of the saddest and at the same time elevating all films. endings Since then there may have been a few of them (Backdraft comes to mind), but Cooley was the first and much more emotional.
