This is an amazing, but at the same time a spare version of the novel by Thomas Mann with the same name. Dirk Bogard demonstrates his best performance on the screen - he believed in it himself. The dialogue is minimal, so his face should reflect the nuances of his painful character - the composer (the writer in the short story - the only serious alteration) that travels to Venice in 1910. Visconti enjoys the image of beauty, its passage and dormant decay. Having received the title of opera director, Visconti smoothly mixes the music and the image of Mahler in his best film since “Leopard” (another stunning film that greatly influenced Sicily Coppola in The Godfather).
