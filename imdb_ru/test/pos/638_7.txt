If you like the unknown, this film is there. The fact that Marina Zudina depicts a dumb one adds to her unhappiness and increases anxiety. Alec Guinnessâ€™s appearance was pleasant, but not really added to the film. I'm not sure if the role of Evan Richard in the role of Andy Clarke was an attempt to add some humor or he should have been just an awkward idiot. I thought the cinematography was excellent. This added not only product quality, but also anticipation. The bath with water drops in slow motion was wonderful. There was also a very well made scene where the knife goes down and then switches to Andy Clark, who slices an extremely rare piece of meat. I would call it generally good fun.
