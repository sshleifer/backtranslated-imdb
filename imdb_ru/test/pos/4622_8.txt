Many other viewers say that watching this film is not good, because they believe that it is not “realistic”. As this can not be considered realistic. They feel that they say that part of incest is not easy, that it is not common. I can guarantee you that you met more people than you think incest happened. Many of them are not going to go out and say it, and these are mostly victims. In addition, many people are gay and are still in the immediate environment, because, no matter how much they want it, they know that they will be ridiculed and perhaps even abandoned. And tell me, how many children did you attend in high school, which ended in pregnancy or had an eating disorder? I bet, and although pregnancy is not incest in most cases, it is still easy to communicate with. Who can't relate to being outcast or mocking? It happens all the time. and many viewers are probably concerned about education like Marcus. to be a stoner these days quite often. so there are many things that can be addressed. Although more than everyone else, no matter how popular you are, sometimes you feel invisible or lonely, not seen or not noticed, for example, a victim of suicide, how can you not feel that you may be related to the film? I think the film may have seemed meaningless to others, but I would like to think of it as important. This is an interesting way to show that suicide is happening and to be aware. This comes from people who do not show their unhappy thoughts, this is very surprising. People who have problems sometimes commit suicide, but when you hear about suicide, as you might guess, it usually passes through the minds of most people. <br /> <br /> The end surprised me, I didn’t expect it to be a girl who, until the end, was basically superfluous in scenes, not even represented. the story, even in its description, speaks of 6 teenage lives, when in fact she was 7. My only real disappointment was that it was not one of the characters we should know about, just at first glance it seems that watching the film was pointless if some random chick was the real victim. until I thought more. It made sense to be a huge surprise, since this is what suicide is. plus, who had to choose which of the other students had more reasons than the other. <br /> <br /> Although there are some flaws in this film, there are several flaws in most films, but I would recommend this film as long as you can watch the tragic moments of watching suicide, violence and profanity, shown in this movie.
