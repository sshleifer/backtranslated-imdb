In short, if you want to watch the best films of Bert Reynolds, then this one should be included. If you don't like Bert, you might still like it. If you love Bert, this could be one of your favorite films of all time! Being from Atlanta, he really hit the house, but it's also nice to see a cop / action / drama that happens somewhere other than New York, Chicago, Miami or Los Angeles. The film is ridiculous in some moments, with a good plot and good performances of an excellent second composition (each character is real, and the bad guys are not so one-sided, they are really well thought out) fist fights (without CGI, thank God, REAL ACTIONS!) <br /> <br /> If Clint Eastwood made the best impression on Burt Reynolds’s film with the films “All one way but free” and “Anyway, how are you Maybe "then Bert answered his the best click with this type of Clint, and it turned out great!
