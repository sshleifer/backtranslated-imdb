Ingrid Bergman (Cleo Dyuline) has never been so beautiful. Gary Cooper as Clint, played as well as a laconic Texan who knows that this girl is useless. When two gazes on the French market, we know that this match will be full of sparks. When they stroll through her garden in her renovated house in the French Quarter and play a love theme, this is a dream for all of us, romantics. <br /> <br /> Costumes are beautiful; the scenery makes you want the Quarter to be like that. And that Saratoga still had that hotel with a wide veranda with all the old gossip. <br /> <br /> Edna Ferbers novel tells about revenge for old mistakes and fights for who will manage the railways in the early years in this industry. <br /> <br /> In the scenes of Saratoga, Florence Bates, like a great lady, steals every scene. <br /> <br /> But this is the scene when Cleo assumes the role of a little lawyer. Relatives from New Orleans sent to buy it, this is a magical moment in the movies. After Cleo defeated him in negotiations, he looked at her with anguish and said: "I can say you are very beautiful." And Cleo with a happy evil smile says: "Yes, no luck." Do you want to shout "YES" !!! <br /> <br /> One of my all-time favorite romantic movies.
