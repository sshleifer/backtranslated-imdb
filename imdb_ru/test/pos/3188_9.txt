This is a very cute film about coming of age, very funny, and Russell Crowe is awesome! Those who only know him from the Gladiator will be surprised to see the range of his acting abilities. Arthur Baskin (his character) is one of the best know-it-alls on the screen I've ever seen1 Watch this movie - how can we republish it in NTSC format? <br /> <br />
