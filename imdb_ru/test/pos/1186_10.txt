This could not have happened at the worst of times - just as the nation entered the years of Reagan, the boom boom of the 80s, a time without regrets, without worries. He did not get a word and opened badly. The studio threw it. But perhaps Hair is the best musical ever created - with Foreman directing and Tharp's choreography, this is an amazingly beautiful, well-played, well-written triumph that few people remember. The casting is perfect, the musical numbers are unforgettable, and even the nuance of the final does not detract from the indomitable spirit of the film. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this film, you have not seen the best musical of all time. Seriously.
