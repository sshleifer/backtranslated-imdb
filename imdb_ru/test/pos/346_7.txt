“Get to know Sherry ... for an evening of Pleasure and Horror!” “Cheap special effects, cheese lines, this is an original film of 1978” “Nurse Sherry” . <br /> <br /> The film tells about the evil ancient spirit that has a nurse in the hospital, then she starts killing the doctors one by one. With the actor's plot everything was fine, but some of them were robotic. the plot was good, but the sex scenes were just added, probably to get more views. The direction was bad, and the special effects were similar to the drawing, the effects did not deceive anyone. The death scenes were pretty good, but the director mixed there too many things that made no sense, such as sex scenes, nudity, a football player, and more. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a good film, but not the best. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
