one of the best and most inspiring films about another culture that I have seen in recent years. tragic and touching. worth seeing. maybe several times. We all know how cruel children can be. I know from my own experience and the experience of my brothers as a child, and this film hit on the head. perfectly! Kite running is just awesome, and I need to explore the reality of this event. although it is done in cgi, it is still surprising and very interesting. it is impossible to maneuver such a kite with a single rope, but they make it believable. in any case, there are many twists and turns in this film, which, I am sure, many may be easy to understand, but they hit me earlier than I did. which makes a great movie for me! when you figure out the entire movie in the first 10 minutes, it sort of destroys it. but this one does it so smoothly that it’s hard to guess, even when it happens ... I’m a guy, and I don’t mind saying that tears flowed in several places in this film.
