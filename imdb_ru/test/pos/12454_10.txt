I have seen most of the episodes of Tarzan. Of course, the rating is "X" with O'Keefe and Bo Derek, who is completely regrettable. <br /> <br /> I have seen this version several times since it was originally shown. <br /> <br /> All the actors had unforgettable roles, a magnificent performance of the episodes of "Monkey". <br /> <br /> Last night I watched the same thing on a Spanish radio station, and not just on the French dialogue, all in Spanish. <br /> <br /> Since Hudson did not want Andy in a voice, he didnâ€™t do anything until the very end. He looked through the daily newspapers and could hire a dialogue coach. <br /> <br /> It seems silly that the story of the monkeys and the man they raised says that Hudson attacked Andy. she was an American cousin. The last time I checked out Carolina was in the USA. <br /> <br /> She was beautiful in the movies, her eyes, gorgeous hair and alabaster skin puzzled all of us men. She did not need to resort to the level of Bo. <br /> <br /> She remained LADY throughout her career and should look at this film (half of her life back) as a starting point. Her performance, sincerity, made this film enjoyable, believable, because a semi-feral man could establish her inner beauty. <br /> <br /> A great starting point for Sir Richardson, he stole the film.
