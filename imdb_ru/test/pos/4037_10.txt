The Snow Queen is one of the best love stories I've ever seen: much better and deeper than Romer and Juliet by Lerman or Titanic by Spielberg. Gerda's love strikes me every time, her searches, her battle are exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the film. Kay - the poisoner of the dark forces: the temptation. This story prompts me to fight, like Gerd, for the one, for the love of my life, for Mr. Wright. Patience is one of the keywords of this film. I cry every time I realize all the sufferings of Gerda and Kay. And I would like it to end soon ... Snowkin tells, although in my life I deeply identify with the story and characters. At least thanks for Hans Christian Anderson and the director.
