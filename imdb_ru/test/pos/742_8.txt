I'm not so sure that I was so intrigued in this film. It is grainy, poorly written, discolored, often ridiculous, and in many moments breathtakingly boring (the person with whom I watched him twice fell asleep). And yet in this film there is something that fascinates me, although I am not sure which; perhaps the character of Sam, a huge former patient, who was lobtimized by the former head doctor and who constantly sucks on an ice throat), or a wonderfully played head doctor (I forgot her name). <br /> <br /> In any case, look and form your own opinion; he has one of the biggest endings I've ever seen in a movie.
