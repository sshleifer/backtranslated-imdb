I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost every day. There are good and bad in EVERY race, why make them all bad? This applies to all races today. John Harper was an educated man, he graduated from high school, he even had a year of university behind him, before returning to the reserve. How do I know this? John Harper lived with my family for 3 years when he was in high school, and he kept in touch with us a year after graduation. He was a kind and tender soul, he could love fun, and he could be serious when the time was right. When he left our house, I was not very old, but I still remember all the times when he helped me with my homework, when my own brother could not be bothered. He even taught grade 3 a year before he came to Winnipeg . None of this is mentioned in the film, and Constable Crossâ€™s suicide is an admission of guilt, as I understand it. What happened to John is unforgivable, not only in the local community, but also in the white community. Not everyone in Winnipeg thinks the same way as the police, I knew the person inside, and how he was a MAN, not an Indian!
