Hmm, is it right to compare the post by Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar "Saved by the bell"? Of course this is not right, this is ridiculous. And is it right to give this film a rating of "10"? Hahahahaha ... this is ridiculous. This film was not so terrible; better than i expected. Movies created for television are often so similar. Many of them have the same feeling. It had the same feeling, but it worked, although it was another exhausted wife who should get the main star at the end of the story. Before it started, I introduced Ms. Thyssen as the seductress of the 90210 fox, but here she was as innocent as Kelly Kapowski, who was refreshing. Eric Close surprised me by playing his role very well. With some decent writing, the director received a pretty good, convincing performance from him, without being completely stupid. Overall, it was somewhat interesting, definitely better than most TV movies. My rating: B-
