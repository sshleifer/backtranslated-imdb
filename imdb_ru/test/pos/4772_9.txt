SPOILERS <br /> <br /> As you know, in recent months I have commented on a lot of dumb short films. Now I have no idea why I am commenting on Steamboat Willie, I think I was just desperate to comment on something, so I watched it, and now I am commenting on it. This, of course, is one of the very first cartoons, and I believe that this is not the first cartoon with sound. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot. Mickey Mouse drives the steamer when Pete drops him, and he drives him. When they stopped for the cargo, Minnie Mouse tried to get up, but failed miserably. Mickey picks it up with a crane. Then the goat eats a sheet of paper with a turkey in the straw. They use a goat to make a song. When I say this, I mean that they used the goat as Victrola. Mickey plays animals on the steamer for instruments to the song. Then the evil Pete throws Mickey into the potato room, and Mickey is forced to peel the potatoes for the rest of the day. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is another stunning short film. I mean, this is the third Mickey Mouse cartoon. Yes, the third. Also, this is not the first cartoon with sound. I believe that before that there were two more. In any case, this film is really, truly innovative. Mixie was more brutal than he. I mean, he throws a potato into a bird and, perhaps, brutally slaughtered it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> Featured Movies: Airplane Crazy.
