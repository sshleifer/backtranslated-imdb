Not terrific, but a good movie that can be watched once or twice. Bill Macy shows that he can do more than just act; his letter was damn good. Great cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as a personal extortionist. <br /> <br /> The film’s greatest strength is Macy’s work, which reminds us of his role as Jerry Landergard of Fargo. He has numerous scenes where he is extremely funny as a slimy, manipulative and deceitful character. It's nice to see how he caresses, and for a while I was happy that he was doing well. *** out of four
