Many consider this film a baseball film. Such people are frustrated because it’s about a baseball player, but the film isn’t about baseball. <br /> <br /> Some people think that this film is a romantic comedy and is disappointed because the relationship is not really developed. This film is not a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> This film is about culture. The arrogant American Major Liger and the strict traditional Japanese baseball manager cannot succeed because they cannot, in fact, not understand each other. It is after they manage to overcome the cultural barrier that they achieve success. The ball player is becoming more and more Japanese in the mentality of his team, and the manager is more American, allowing individual accomplishments, and they are found in the middle. <br /> <br /> Baseball and romance obey this criticism of two cultures. Many who do not understand Japanese thinking skip this and think that this is a film about baseball or romance, and consider the clash of cultures a gentle relief of comedy. This is not --- the clash of cultures - this is the seriousness of the film. Based on my own experience and understanding of Japanese culture, I think that this film showed itself well, because it did not overly romanticize Japanese culture and did not overdo it in its image. <br /> <br /> Overall, I believe in this. This is a pleasant and relaxing film, if you know what it really is about.
