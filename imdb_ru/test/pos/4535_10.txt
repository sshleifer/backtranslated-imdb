Holy Shniki! This movie is swinging! Chris Farley and David Spade duet are great together. My favorite roles are: “Fat Man in a Small Coat, Oh God Damn, Room Service and other scenes that will be remembered for years to come. This film has a huge fan, I wonder why, which proves that even eleven years after Chris, Farley’s tragic death is still popular. He plays Tommy, which makes you laugh every time you still watch him. He is a great comedian, and they miss him. Mr. Spade reminds me of Dan Akoyroid, and Chris Farley reminds me of John Belushi. They shot more than two films together, this film must be bought and it must be in the collection of every Snl fan.
