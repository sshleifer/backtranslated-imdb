I don’t want to spoil anyone’s movie, but it mimics the reality of life in many ways, and if you’re really honest with yourself, you will agree with him in agreement at least in a few scenes. br /> <br /> Acting is not only plausible, but also convincing in a way that attracts heroes. Moreover, it is fun, not trying too hard. <br /> <br /> And yes, I truly believe that the continuation here is justified. Watch the movie and you will understand why. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, especially if you like movies that have a real message.
