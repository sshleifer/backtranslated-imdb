This film offers many joys and surprises. When Achilles and Philip beautifully sing a duet from Don Giovanni, which perfectly describes their situation in the film, you appreciate the thin layers of this excellent film. The story takes place in Jutland from the 18th century, and the use of period music played on period instruments is just another great touch. You share the delightful joy of General Levenhilm in his participation in Cailles en Sarcophage, even if you are just watching a movie - but you really want to try a small sample. <br /> <br /> Babette is an artist whose food is Wednesday. Perhaps no other art form allows the artist to directly share his creations. <br /> <br /> The main theme of this film is the potential that sharing food should change how people see each other and how they see the World, much the same as the theme of “Chololat”, but “Babette's Holiday” Don't hit you in the head with your message. The townspeople are conservative puritans, but not overly oppressive. You begin to understand and respect them and ultimately appreciate their humanity. <br /> <br /> Many questions arise for you: the nature of art, the contemplation of chosen and impassable paths, the interrelation of spiritual and physical, the influence of the environment on behavior, among other things, taking life to give life. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment for me is the speech of General Levenhilma, delivered at the height of the meal. I expected deep heart observations, but I received some vague mystical conversations. The speech had such a minimal impact that I barely remember him. <br /> <br /> But this understated film leaves a lasting impression. The heat it generates contrasts with its strict background. You will leave the theater, wanting to go out and dance under the stars.
