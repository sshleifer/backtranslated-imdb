This film is certainly well thought out, starting and ending in the dark, with an emphasis on Lily Smith / Schmidt, Julie Andrews, first singing “angel” and then notorious spy. <br /> <br /> It's beautiful! I saw the movie about 15 years ago and recently watched it again. Despite the fact that in the 70s, critics rejected it as “bloated”, “cinema vulgar” and the lack of time (among others) proved them wrong. Blake Edwards certainly created a film of almost lyrical quality. <br /> <br /> The film hovers and spins (aerial photography; Julie Andrews in motion) and captivates. You just have to assume that Julie Andrews is a spy whose mission went wrong. Watching the cool chemistry between Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson, one must assume that these are lovers who, in all their innocence, fall in love with each other. And, in the end, love is much more important than victory in wars. As well as maintaining innocence. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of understated role in the film, and the film undoubtedly reaches emotional depth, often unseen in comedies. <br /> <br /> There are wonderful comedic elements (foreshadowing French fools in Victoria / Victoria), interesting diplomatic remarks (reminding me of the Tamarind Seed, seen about 18 years ago) and a general sense of goodwill. <br /> <br /> Suspend all disbelief and this film will carry you away. Julie Andrews songs about warrior songs and the obsessive 'Whistling Away the Dark' are reason enough to turn on the TV just for the soundtrack. And the strip number is like the Jenny number in Star! works. <br /> <br /> This film, like good champagne, is well aged. Paramount should bring it to DVD as soon as possible. The same applies to the transfer of the Star laser disc! on dvd. These are both interesting parts of the meticulous, and then undervalued works of Julie Andrews.
