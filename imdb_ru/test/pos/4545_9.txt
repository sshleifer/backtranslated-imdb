Well, of course, critics hated it. This is not a film that is going to earn the recognition of critics. But the fact is that it is really very good. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you don’t like this television series Chris Farley or David Spade’s extremely dry mind, you won’t like It. But for the rest of us, the film has a lot of fun, and, for that matter, quotes, episodes, and the plot is not as stupid as in Black Sheep. The parts that should not be humorous are actually well made, not what you expect from a movie of this kind, and the game is really quite good. <br /> <br /> “Tommy Boy” is without question the best film by Chris Farley. I give him an A and I suggest you give him an idea.
