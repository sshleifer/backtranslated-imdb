When I started watching this DVD, I never dreamed that I would be completely mesmerized by him for a few minutes. The story was completely exciting and interesting. The game was excellent. The biggest surprise was how I would have been so fascinated by the love that these two young women radiated around the screen. Their first physical encounter for me was, of course, the most gentle, romantic, delightful, charming love love I had ever seen in a film. I literally stopped breathing. I could not believe the chemistry between the two actresses. Without nudity or graphic sex, they conveyed more passion and acuity than any American product ever could have imagined. Bravo to the author, screenwriter, director and cast.
