While some things at Haggard are stupid and unnecessary, the general package is good. <br /> <br /> Haggard follows Ryan Dunn and his friends Valo (Bam Marghera) and Falcone (Brandon Dicamillo), trying to play Gloven (Jenn Rivell), the former Ryan. <br /> <br /> The story is tracked and developed surprisingly well, it is not surprising and becomes an episode of Jackass or Viva La Bam, although it does have a side story that does not hurt the main story. <br /> <br /> And for all of Bam's fans (and girls) there are several episodes of Bam's skateboarding, perhaps the weakest aspect of the film. Phil makes 2 amazingly small appearances, even Don Vito got a bigger (but meaningless) throw. <br /> <br /> If you hope to see comedy and avoid the craziness of Bam, then stay away from this film, otherwise enjoy the time you spend with it, if you can find it. There are really funny scenes in this movie.
