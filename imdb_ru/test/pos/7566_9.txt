Someone definitely has something to do with Wind, and I can't believe that what I saw on the screen has to do with it. It is a better and more reliable film than most independent films that I watch all year round. Cinematography demonstrates sincere love and craftsmanship for the craft, and the casting was simply beautiful. I would like to see more of these people, especially Zika Rippi. <br /> <br /> Regarding the story and the script, I'm not sure that the negative comments preceding this post were written to inform anyone else about the film. The long addictive posts that were supposed to be several hours, and which are the only comments left by the reviewer for any film on this site, are slander directed at the producers of the film. I don't know the inside story, but it would probably make a good movie. What I know from this business is that the performances that try to make everyone happy usually end up becoming horrible, and when the director has the courage, desire and common sense to “kill children,” someone always resentment arises, this is also part of the business, and one of the best learning tools available to those who truly want to do this in the film industry. Of course, failure is nothing better than sitting at home and writing false reviews on the Internet as a form of vendetta against those who insulted them (read: they were honest and truthful with them). And this is my best guess, to explain unpleasant, unpleasant reviews. Despite the fact that there is a grain of truth behind everything, this makes sense, but these exaggerations of grains are so great that they are clearly fictional. <br /> <br /> This is not a slasher Bloodbath, if this is what you are looking for, it’s rather a psychological wait thriller that is not usually rated by the lowest common denominators. The best way to watch this movie is to try to remove any preconceived ideas, insert it and let it open - seriously, the characters are determined by their actions and words, and when you see what these people do and what they say, I don't think you can come to the conclusion that these characters were poorly developed. Perhaps misunderstood. <br /> <br /> In general, I agree that this is a good, convincing film. Perhaps I would not give 9 points under normal circumstances, but the serious negative comments really attracted me to the film (I have a secret love for a really bad movie). For me, a rating below 5 should be reserved for shocking, inept, poorly played and stupidly written films. None of this is applicable here - this is a quality movie with a real talent. I gave him nine to tilt the scales back in the right direction. Watch a movie and say I'm wrong.
