This film starts badly. For an incredibly banal monologue immediately followed by a brilliantly made, truly amazing collapse of a spacecraft. Then things go down again when you realize that all the survivors are a) bad actors (except the docking pilot and the psychopath) and b) almost all of them fit in too well with the role of the forage monster. Hell, half of them don't even speak English, not letting viewers learn characters at all. You feel as if you were watching the “Deep Blue Sea” meeting “The Silence of the Lambs”, minus the good moments. And, unfortunately, it all tries to be “broken on a deserted planet with Hannibal Lecter” during daytime scenes. Vin Diesel is a great actor, but he is not Anthony Hopkins, and he is frankly annoying as a smart, hyper-cool psycho. There is at least one very good scene with an unexpected survivor, but besides that you could just as well cut out the first thirty minutes or so ... <br /> <br /> But then everything changes. I can not pinpoint the moment, but soon the film will become much better. It also seems to be less split - the scenes actually begin to follow each other with a consistent narration, and Vin Diesel becomes much less annoying, and soon he is a show-styler. By the time the first monsters appear, the movie is actually quite enjoyable. By the time the night comes it's great. Thrilling, terrifying and exciting. And even the character development of most of the main characters is well done. If you can just accept setbacks in the beginning, great fun awaits you. <br /> <br /> In addition, the visual effects are very attractive, and I honestly admit: I like the color and tone of this film. <br /> <br /> 7/10 (it could be 9/10, if only ...)
