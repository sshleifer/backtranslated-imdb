I have been a fan of the Larry King show for some time, I think he does an amazing job as a whole, and I don't think he ever “fainted”, as many people seem to believe. He is thin Scorpio, he gets his sounds when he needs it, just as he managed to do it last night with Paris Hilton, during her first television interview after prison. <br /> <br /> As regards the whole case, what struck me was that Hilton still did not understand why Judge Sower gave her what she thought was too harsh (and moreover, MADE in fact). For all the time that she was in prison, allegedly alone 23 hours a day in her cell, she never, in her opinion, turned upside down the events that led to the fact that she was given a sentence that Judge Sawer considered expedient to impose on her. She never realized that this could lead to the appearance of a large red flag when she (1) was late in court for the initial hearing and (2) continued to inform him when he asked her if she knew that her license had been suspended , did she receive in the mail the documents that “I have people who read such things to me”. <br /> <br /> All the time while she was in her cell, she did not understand that this action (delay) and this statement — and, more importantly, the attitude — completely ignoring the court system and the law in general and her driving privileges in particular, which she demonstrated - just might have forced Judge Sauer (sorry for the pun) to spoil her. <br /> <br /> Last night, at the King’s show, after expressing dissatisfaction with how she changed forever because of her traumatic experience, how she “learned” her lesson, she answered his question: “How do you think you are got a raw deal? with deafening yes. And during the conversation (if you can call it that) she said more than once that she does not feel that she deserves what happened to her. King gently, more than once asked if she felt that she was creating situations in her life in which she “found herself”, to which she looked at him almost indifferently. Therefore, she basically adheres to the conscious conviction that in this situation she has become a victim; she does not understand how she herself caused this in court that day with her cavalier attitude towards the judge. I feel that this is very sad - even tragic, given that for some people Hilton is a huge “role model”, and in her everything she said last night about her so-called rehabilitated state turns into areas of complete and complete ignorance. , contradictions and hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> During the interview, Hilton hinted that she spent a lot of time in her cell reading the Bible. At the end of the interview, King scored the main points by asking her what was her favorite Bible passage. In response, she groped for her pathetic notes (completely superficial misunderstandings that she read on the air, as if it were Nelson Mandell or something like that) and, finally, screamed out: “I have no favorite passage.” <br /> <br /> Judge Sauer in my book is a hero, and after yesterday evening Larry King, for the subtle revelation of Hilton, who she really is.
