I finally saw the real reason why Peter Boyle became famous. It was not a monster in Young Frankenstein or the shocking Frank Baron in Everybody Loves Raymond. For young people who only know him on television, try this film, it makes Frank look like a saint. <br /> <br /> “Joe” is Boyle in his beautiful acting role, and, as someone mentioned, most likely gave inspiration for Archie Bunker on “Everything in the Family.” I think that Boyle even went back to “Joe” a bit to play Frank. (I say this because I noticed that the basement of both Joe and Frank Baron are similar.) <br /> <br /> I didn’t know anything about this film when I took it out of the library, I just knew Boyle and Susan Sarandon were shown. Yes, Susan looks great here and for a young actress a very good role in the beginning. A young hippie, who wants to run away from his parents and live with him, eventually lost a drug-induced hippie who also sells as much as he buys. <br /> <br /> After an almost fatal overdose on too many pills, she is hospitalized, while her parents go to pick up her things, her mother will not go to the stinky, broken apartment, but her father does. While dad collects his things, her boyfriend comes home and the two exchange words, and then the father does what we hear later, Joe said what he would like to do with the hippies. <br /> <br /> Joe shoots his own voice on how he hates different cultures / races, hippies and a list of others. When he says, "I would really like to kill one of them," the father (trying to look like he was joking) said: "I just did." Joe almost buys it, but then takes it as funny. <br /> <br /> Later, when the police appear at the scene of the incident and the story is in the newspaper, Joe realizes that he was not joking. Instead of nailing the rich guy to money with the help of blackmail, he actually blackmails him. Just wanting him and his wife to “get to know” him and his wife. In short, their connection is clumsy, but after Sarandon learns about what her father did, the bottom risks falling out. <br /> <br /> How it will end, you will have to watch for yourself. Although more than 35 years have passed, the ending is something you do not expect. Unless, of course, you have seen the movie before. Again, I recommend it mainly to those who have not seen it. <br /> <br /> 10 stars for Boyle is not just a game of someone completely opposite to his character, but also something that will show others that he was more than just a television set and a comedy actor.
