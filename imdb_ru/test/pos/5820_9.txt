This hot (for Cassavetes) love story is nicely conveyed by two great performances of Jena Rowlands and Seymour Cassel. Rowlands was never as beautiful as the depressed, damaged woman of the mid-30s who meets her friend in Seymour. Cassell is a powder box of energy and romantic ideas (in his words). <br /> <br /> Val Avery, in the role of Zelmo Swift, has excellent support, as well as an unusual (as always) Timothy Carey. Made between husbands and women under the influence, this is Cass's most accessible film, which should touch the heart of anyone (especially Cassavetis haters), who claim that his films are too long and heavy. He made my top ten that year and didnâ€™t see enough people. 8 out of 10.
