First of all: if you like to watch movies, I recommend you NOT to watch it. What for? After that, you will no longer appreciate any other film so easily ... <br /> <br /> In fact, I don’t want to raise any high expectations, but it’s almost scary how beautiful, intense and beautiful this work of Einar is. Gudmundsson is. When most films have at least one aspect that spoils all this, for example, good actors, but terrible dialogues or beautiful scenery, but low-budget cinematography? There is nothing so ambivalent about Angels of the Universe. In fact, everything is just wonderful, even (and last but not least) the soundtrack from the magnificent Sigur Ros. <br /> <br /> In this story about Palle, a student who becomes schizophrenic after being thrown by his girlfriend, especially dialogues (and monologues), deserves some attention: along with the plot (and sometimes in sharp contrast with him) they range from depressive and fatalistic to the exact opposite of the comic and the completely absurd. Moreover, they often (with quotes from Hegel and Shakespeare) have such poetic beauty that the film almost goes into a surrealistic realm and is preserved in the real world only by incredibly authentic actors. <br /> <br /> One of the other comments has already touched another point: this film is not banal entertainment for the evening rest. Despite some ridiculous reliefs between them, it is largely disturbing, partly cynical and bitter, and, most importantly, sad. modern poetry about crazy life with all its emptiness, rage and loneliness. <br /> <br /> Finally: when did you watch the movie? look again. There are some great visual metaphors and allusions that you understand only when you look twice and connect them with the “morality of the story.” And, of course: read the book, it contains a lot more little funny stories in between, and also makes you understand some things in the film a little better.
