First of all, let me say that this, in my opinion, is one of the 10 most underrated films since it came out in '72. I really liked this film, it is very urban, sandy, no real Hollywood glam was added to it ... in fact, you can I feel all the characters here, I like the blood here to be sprayed. Joe Peski was pretty good here, but it seems to me that he was definitely surpassed by lead character Joe Cortese, now I donâ€™t know anything about him, but boy can he really play .. I think this film is probably true Because living in New Jersey, living near Philadelphia, you are curious all the time. I think that if the film had a bigger budget and, say, Robert Deniro as boss Jerry, you would have a perfect film, but hey, who am I to argue, I was so absorbed in this film that he already in my head? , with Dastardly Streets. I would like Hollywood to return to this urbanized, grandiose film show: he would help them a lot. This film is a great drama with great actors. and I highly recommend this to everyone.
