"Do not torture the duckling" - one of the coolest Italian horror films I've ever seen, and I saw my share. Calling him giallo is a little misleading, because in reality it is not a typical murder mystery. This is more of a straightforward horror movie. <br /> <br /> Complete with one of the most brutal and bloody scenes in the film of this old, twisting and spinning film Fulci oozes with a terrible atmosphere and spirit of the old school of Italian. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously beautiful. The finale is authentic and original. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie “Don't Torment the Duckling,” you really have to wonder how the later things from Fulci became so unusual. I like all his things, but he has gone astray. Perhaps he decided that he had already done it ... Because in this film he falls into the bull's eye. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who believes that Dario Argento owns the hyallo genre. Fulci beats him with this. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 children.
