A touching story told with tenderness: an awkward young Jewish girl in World War II in America became friends with a runaway German prisoner of war who hides in her club. They discuss their lives and beliefs (he is against Hitler), she steals his food, he becomes her only friend and ally. All this reminded me of the much better theatrical film “Whistling in the Wind”, where Haley Mills made friends with convicted Alan Bates, but you certainly cannot blame a direction that is smooth or performances that are excellent. Mature in her preschool years, Kristy McNichol bears most of the picture and never falls on a fake note. Suddenly, when a prisoner is discovered (and Christy is also discovered), the film becomes very tough. Her father, shocked and ashamed that his child would communicate with "this Nazi," lies in her with a quiet rage that I rarely saw before (he tells her: "You are dead for me", which should be destructive for a little girl to hear ). The final scenes do not come out; no big reunions, no climax in the hands. The girl has to deal with the world, and at the same time she gets a bitter lesson about her neighbors, friends and family. Awesome movie.
