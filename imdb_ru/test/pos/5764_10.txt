It may not be Oscar material, however it was a very funny movie. I have always been a fan of Eddie (Edmondson) and Richie (Mayall). “Bottom” and “Young” were legendary TV shows, and it was time to make a film. Some of what they are doing is just great, from pencil to the back, to rubber breeches, as well as the infamous line that Richie says when he falls, and the candle that he carries gets into his eyes. He says to Eddie "A candle in the eye, a candle in the eye," and Eddie was a simpleton, which he is, inserts a candle, which he carries in his eye. I can not forget when Eddie is on his motorcycle, and he needs to urinate ... It was a great comedy that should not be taken seriously, but there was no funny end to the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, a great comedy full of laughter and lots of fake green vomiting. A 9/10. <br /> <br />
