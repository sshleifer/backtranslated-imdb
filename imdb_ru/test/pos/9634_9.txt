Many people make fun of Stephen Segal's acting ability. And I really understand why, if I remember Fire Down Below. Well ... well, his other films are acceptable (regarding his action!). <br /> <br /> After reading the reviews about The Patriot, I didnâ€™t expect anything from this movie. I barely passed the Fire Down Below and read a lot that the Patriot was even worse. So I was very surprised by this. In my opinion, this is one of his best films. If he had more action sequences and a couple of battle scenes, that would be better. I liked the story of the director and actor. Camilla Belle was just incredible. In the future she will have an excellent film career. Several action movies were very well made. And Steven Seagal was very believable in his unusual role.
