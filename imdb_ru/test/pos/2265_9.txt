Spoilers Jewish Frodo? Yes, this is Elijah Wood again. <br /> <br /> After the final part of The Lord of the Rings, Elijah Wood, like Frodo, is getting harder to escape from this leading role. Playing football hooligan, a psychopath, and now a young Jewish-American, Wood tried any way to avoid this typification. Now, with “All Illuminated,” he could finally achieve it. Playing a role that is not as radical as other efforts, he really penetrates the soul of his character. However, this is not how Wood does it alone. Thanks to the magnificent adaptation of the first director Li Schreiber and the wonderful performance of newcomer Eugene Hutz Wood, he found a magnificent production that spread its wings. "Everything is lit" - a great, touching cinema. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Safran Foer (Wood), a young American Jew, goes to Ukraine to find the mysterious girl who saved his grandfather and helped him. its get to america. Arriving in the country, Jonathan meets all the speakers, all dancing Alex (Hutz) and his racist grandfather (Boris Leskin). Traveling around the country, these three gradually learn more about history and relationships that Alex and Jonathan never knew. <br /> <br /> A strange feeling when the film moves to chapter two (in fact, it is divided into four as a whole). The first part, although sometimes a bit funny, is mostly serious and intense. Therefore, when in the second part we are given a brief history of Alex and his family, the transition from serious to funny is a strange step. It doesn't quite work, but as the film progresses, it definitely learns a lesson, as this mixture of humor and sadness merges better and better over time. <br /> <br /> To the final credit of all participants, as the story really continues, so we begin to fall in love with the characters more and more. Elijah Wood is great, Boris Leskin is so energetic and powerful that the question arises why Hollywood never noticed him. However, the most notable of these is newbie Eugene Hutz. Playing as a highly agitated character, Hutz is just great. He shows a split between his relatives and the real world with an almost perfect skill, and when his character communicates with Wood, you sincerely communicate with him on a deeper level. Without Gutz, the story is so strong that the film will still be great, but with it he will reach a new level. <br /> <br /> As a debut work for the actor who became director Liev Schreiber, the story is also a brilliant piece to begin with. The work of passion (Schreiber's grandfather himself emigrated to America), he manages to truly embrace the emotions of content, and, having given us truly beautiful landscapes and magnificent pictures, he really hits home. In particular, the last half hour created so beautifully that tears are not striking the audience. This is a touching story, and with the help of Schreiber, it becomes even more powerful. <br /> <br /> Created with the love of a passionate director, “Everything Is Illuminated” is a wonderful piece. The road story with a difference, it is superbly played and beautifully written. This is a film that everyone should see, and this is the perfect way for Elijah Wood to finally put Frodo to rest.
