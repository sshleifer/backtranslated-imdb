This is a long and awkward love story. The daily life of a woman of 50 years and some people around her is depicted. Her daily life is so ordinary and routine that I doubted who the main character was at the beginning. Viewers then learn that the woman and the man, who were her classmates in high school, had a very tiny connection. A woman has been doing the same job for so long - a dairy woman and a shopper in a supermarket. There are so many slopes that the delivery of milk bottles is very hard work. A man married another woman who is now dying of cancer. He works in the city hall and loyally cares about her at home. They never look straight and talk to each other, but they never forget each other. <br /> <br /> The original name in Japanese means "On some days you read books." But, of course, when the man said: “Now I want to do what I always wanted to do,” it was to hug her and make love to her. She writes to a radio disc jockey: "If God gives us time to talk, we need at least a whole day." Dreaming of that day, she sublimated desire in hard work and reading books. I personally know a woman who has loved a man for many years, even after he married another woman and died from an accident. Therefore, the plot setting is not so special. Rather, this film depicts well the unspoken romances in many ordinary men and women. Thanks to this film you will remember your novel, which has long been lost. This is a film with a lasting effect.
