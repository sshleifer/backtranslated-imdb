Once again, we were lucky to see the magnificent entrance stage, where the works of artists were completely restored, and we see this old grocery store on the corner of the street with gently falling snow. Inside there are saturated colors of all products, from products to canned food and boxes, medicines, chocolates, etc. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is a story about how products such as animals on objects labels come to life or pie, or even a pack of cigarettes. <br /> <br /> The whole “show” is told by “Jack Bunny”, imitator of Jack Benny, to the music of conductor Leopold. Stokowski, who was wearing so many Looney Tunes animated shorts, I lost count. Great humor is relevant, so you should know who “Little Egypt” is and other characters. The Aqua number of the Busby Berkeley type with bathing sardines coming out of the jar and the dance with the tomato jar were both smart! <br /> <br /> All of the above and more in the first half of this cartoon was a little longer than usual. The second half was about King Kong type, who escapes from the "Animal Crackers" box and terrorizes everyone. That part was not very good, and ended on a somewhat stupid note. So, “A” for the first half, “D” for the second, which means “C-plus” or “B-minus” as a whole.
