“Sorte Nula” is the No. 1 box-office film in Portuguese in 2004. This extremely low-budget production (about $ 150,000) opened during Christmas with American blockbusters such as National Treasure, Polar Express, Incredible, and Alexander, but quickly won the Flattery of Portuguese moviegoers. Despite the fierce competition, the small film showed itself surprisingly well, surpassing all the other Portuguese films of the last two years in the first weeks. The film is a mystery / murder with a humorous tone, cunningly written and directed by Fernando Fragata, who has become a solid guide in the European independent arena. I liked the movie? Oh yeah!
