I have seen quite a few action movies in my life, and this is definitely one of the best! There are very few films that I even watch several times, and this is one of them. Everything in this film is just right: Clint as an excellent lead actor, Rene Rousseau as his unsparing partner (this is a very rare combination - sad, but true!). Of course, John Malkovich deserves praise for his excellent villain, but let's not lose sight of the original friend of Eastwood, played by Dylan McDermott, who, in my opinion, is perfect for this role. original CD soundtrack (shame to the producers!). The plot makes sense and there is no loss of pace, the audience is constantly in awe of the outcome of the fight between Eastwood and Malkovich. I give it 10 stars!
