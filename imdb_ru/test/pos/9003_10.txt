First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so although it seemed to me that this film about rugby is interesting, it could have been any sport, and I think I would have liked it the same way. The fact that he, like in the case of rugby, did not become better or worse for me. <br /> <br /> What made this film great is the story itself, based on real events that happened in the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby Club. Coach Gelviks is the type of coach that most parents would like to have in their children, who cares more about the person than about the sport (even though they won 17 national championships and lost only 9 games in 30 years!). The more I learned about the coach and the team, the more I liked this film and its message. <br /> <br /> I saw other sports films that at first seemed great, but then I explored the details just to find it. most of these films were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with 10% fact being greatly exaggerated. Not so with Forever Strong. It may seem too good to be true, but this is surprising. If it were an invention, it would be just a pleasant story and nothing more. Instead, the film inspires and makes you want to become better. <br /> <br /> Don't miss out on this film due to a few negative reviews from professional critics. I read some of their reviews, and most of them gave horrible film reviews. As a rule, these are the same critics who delighted in films that most people hate. In fact, I would be concerned if some of these critics gave good reviews about the film, because I almost always disagree with their opinion. <br /> <br /> Go watch this movie and leave a review (positive or negative)! Currently, most of the feedback from the audience is enthusiastic positive (here, on “Rotten Tomatoes” and similar sites), and I’m interested to see if this trend will continue. Thank!
