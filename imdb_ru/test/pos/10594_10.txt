I have never seen such a movie before, nor so funny. I laughed at my damn ass and watched it many times. Infact I am watching this now. Chad from CKY is also hot. In any case, if you never liked it, blow it out of your ass, you have no taste. In the film, Rye (Ryan Dunn) just broke up with his girlfriend, who turned to Valo (Bam Marghera) and Falcone (Brandon DiCamillo) for help in figuring out what she did with Hellboy (Rake Yon), and with help from Raab (Chris Raab / Sam Raab) they do just that. <br /> <br /> The scene of the bending of the wings and the scene with the Cactus in Record Bean were hilarious.
