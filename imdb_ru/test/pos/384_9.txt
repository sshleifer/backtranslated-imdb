<br /> <br /> “Let's change the killings - your wife, my father” - a seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haynes, when they meet for lunch on the train. Guy, a solid, respectable tennis player, whose problem is that his wife, flirtatious Miriam, will not divorce him in order to marry Senator’s daughter Anne, and all this is joking. Next week, he no longer laughs. In the classic Hitchcock waiting scene, Bruno pursues Miriam through a carnival and strangles her. When he does, her glasses fall, and we see the murder gloomily reflected through her lenses. Cold-blooded and immoral Bruno, his part of the deal is completed, approaching the awaited Guy waiting for him, even forcing him to "do his bit." Things did not help when Anna's premature and outspoken younger sister appears, suspecting Guy of murdering Miriam. So accused of murder, which he did not commit and was expecting to do something else, what is Guy going to do? The strength of this film is that people represent the deadly side of their nature - and this Hitchcock does it to perfection.
