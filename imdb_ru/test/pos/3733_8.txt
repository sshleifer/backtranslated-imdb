I'm a guy, so I hesitated a lot to watch a movie, because I know that Richard Gere likes to make tears movies. I would prefer to watch an action / adventure / science fiction. I was right, the film is definitely tear. Diana tended to replay several times, like Richard, but they brought it and made it work. The daughter was a depressed girl with a great attitude, so you started to hate her. The film is too predictable, but for entertainment purposes it was a masterpiece. Rent it, see if you shed a tear. If you like a laptop, you'll like it. The beach scenes were flawlessly filmed. even though the hurricane scenes were a bit inconsistent, it was still a bit of a panic to see how they react to it.
