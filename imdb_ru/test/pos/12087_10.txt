I may be a good old boy from Virginia in the Confederate States of America, but this man does it for me. This mustache annoys me. I remember when I first saw his video. That girl he beat was amazing. The depth of his action, when they crashed into his weathered facade, was a new level of masculinity. It reminds me of the granite sculptures of our Mt. Rushmore If I could ask him one question, it would be: “If you were a hot dog, would you eat yourself?” Orhan will have a reunion tour? Pay attention to such great people as Gordon Lightfoot, true music will never fade from the heart. Vive La John Denver. Gracias, my friend, OF.F.L. (Orhan Fan for life)
