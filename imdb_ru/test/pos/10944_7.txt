Well, do not expect anything deep and meaningful. Most battle scenes are pretty decent. The two leading ladies are quite adorable, but their lack of HK background action sometimes shows. In the end, perhaps something is missing, but I still got pleasure from it. Shoddy humor probably won't appeal to those who haven't watched a bunch of HK movies, but if you are missing this sort of thing and you have a couple of hours to fill something meaningless, you could do a lot worse than this so you can do more, but .......) <br /> <br /> Of course, along with most Hollywood action films. <br /> <br /> 7/10
