At first glance, The Bothersome Man seems like several other movies / books in one person. Kafka "Trial", Melville Bartleby, "The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin" and "Groundhog Day" instantly come to mind. The man, Andreas, arrives in a nameless city, where he is immediately given a job in the office, and he finds a beautiful new girl. However, there is one catch: all of his colleagues are friendly, polite and faceless, and everyone he knows, including his girlfriend, seems to have only one topic of conversation - interior design. Welcome to the hell of modern consumerism, in which people rush out of buildings, and no one raises their eyebrows or spends days reading furniture catalogs and food, in which there is no taste. <br /> <br /> Andreas quickly realizes his predicament. and spends the rest of the movie trying to escape in different ways. Suicide is not an option, and when he finds a new girl, she is just as devoid of feelings as the old one - the restaurant has a wonderful scene where he asks her to move in with him and all that she can say is “I don’t mind.” <br /> <br /> In fact, much of what The Bothersome Man said was said earlier, and after about 45 minutes you start to feel that you really have a certain feeling of deja va. However, its meaning is probably it is worth repeating again and again: unexplored life is life that is not worth living. In addition to this, he gives a completely modern look at the eternal topic of how capitalism destroys our souls. More than one character reminded me of people I know, especially his furniture-obsessed furniture, and if by the end of the movie the filmmakers had no ideas, maybe this is not the end, if you can't find other people who share your sense of alienation.
