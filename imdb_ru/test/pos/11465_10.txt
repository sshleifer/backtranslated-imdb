This is a great horror movie for people who do not want all this vomiting and sensations. In this film, as much horror, expectation, humor, and even a little light nudity, but nothing special. Lynn Quigley is not superfluous, as in The Return of the Living Dead, where she danced naked in a crypt, but in fact she is still the same lecherous character. Katie DeWell is a virginal and chaste character before heading to Dallas, and we also get to know Amelia [soon Mimi] Kincaid, the sexy and sinister potential dark matrona at home. Because she and Linni are obsessed and take possession of the house, they will reanimate the bodies of their dead friends to scare the limits of the survivors. I heard that many people compare this film with The Evil Dead, but, if anything, this film is a competitor to the same scenario with which Freddie competed with Jason. Although this series is far superior to this one!
