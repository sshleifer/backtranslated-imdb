“One Mad Summer” is the funniest, the craziest (not necessarily the best) movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> As soon as one mad scene is finished, another appears. It never gives you a rest. Just one after another. The soundtrack is great. Songs just for scenes. <br /> <br /> This is also a clean movie. Not only is it dirty. <br /> <br /> Of course, it has a story about guys who you wouldn’t trust with lunch money, take up the challenge and beat people with lots of resources. Who wants to see it if they fail? There is a serious side that parents and children do not justify each other’s dreams. You must always have an unbiased opinion and weigh all options. This applies to both parents and children. In One Crazy Summer, parents are wrong. It is not always so.
