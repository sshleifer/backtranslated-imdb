Out of 600 or so spaghetti westerns, this should be somewhere in the top twenty. I can not believe that this has not received a single review! Gemma is great at this. Van Johnson is also good, although his dubbed voice kills a little, but this is the charm of Italian style. Beautiful photo and some great set of actions. All minor characters are well played. The seriousness of the racist sentiments of the bad guys is pretty tough even by today's standards, which creates emotional depth for the character of Jemmas in some situations. Absolutely FANTASTIC evaluation of Louis Bakalov. Watch it on the wonderful widescreen DVD from Japan. Spaghetti should be.
