A good film, but it could be removed without the full nudity of a 10-year-old boy in one of the first scenes. This film has a great dialogue; which is certainly common among foreign films. Foreign actors still know how to act, unlike American actors, who allow computer graphics, tricks, and special effects to do all the work for them. This film is just a good old acting game. Gerard Deparie, as always, did a great job. Costumes and decorations are accurate with time. My only complaint is that they had to duplicate English words in French, and not use subtitles; it may just be because I hate reading subtitles.
