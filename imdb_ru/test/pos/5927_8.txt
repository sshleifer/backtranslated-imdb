I watched this film several times over the years and always found it interesting. As a retired airline pilot, Iâ€™m interested in most aviation films, and this is one of the best. I know that Lindberg was only 25 years old during his historic solo flight to Paris, and that James Stewart was almost 50 when he made this film, but I can miss this fact because Stewart was always one of my favorite actors. and performs one of his usual outstanding performances as the Lonely Eagle. <br /> <br /> The film combines comedy and drama, as well as good memories. It also helps that James Stewart was a pilot in real life in both military and civilian life.
