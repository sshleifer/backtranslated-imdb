In the first twenty minutes, we are swept away by several powerful emotions: a suffocating and domineering mother enters a fierce dispute with her 40-year-old daughter, who currently lives; the love of the piano teacher (and the music professor) for his students was expressed in a constant critical assessment; the joy that music can inspire both the listener and the performer. During this short time, our feelings were convincingly attacked by very real characters. We are also swept away by powerfully performed music and have shown the difference between excellent and mediocre performance, paying great attention to nuances. Such material alone would be the basis for an outstanding widely popular film. But the trend of French cinema is that it goes deeper, exploring the teacher's repressed sexuality, the expression of sexual freedom and subsequent disintegration in the context of craving and the inevitable cycle of real abuse. We are drawn to her sufferings and, at least at first, we wonder how much suffering can be associated with the achievement of genius, especially among composers whom she admires. Piano Teacher contains graphical dialogues and descriptions of sex and cruelty in scenes that some people choose not to watch. Scenes are important for the dilemmas that the film is trying to raise and therefore can hardly be called gratuitous. It may be a great movie, but itâ€™s not.
