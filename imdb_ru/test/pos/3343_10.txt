I first saw it on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun game with great music. Christina was on the cover of Playboy, and, as I remember, in the center. She is very cute and funny and has a lot of charm. The film made me want to see more of her, and so I kept looking for her in other things. She’s in Steven Spielberg’s I Want to Hold Your Hand, Barbara Streisand’s Main Event and The Meatballs by Bill Murray, as well as in many television shows such as The Night Court and television films. My friends and I really enjoy it. But her main role in the film “Alice in Wonderland” is directed exactly to the place where she should be, to Christina as the center of attention, perhaps the most beautiful, hottest girl I've ever seen in a movie.
