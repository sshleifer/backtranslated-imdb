Most people who attend this film will not know about the great novel by Arthur Miller, which lies at its core. This is a novel that more people need to read in order to understand how prejudices affect and change people's lives. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Lawrence Newman is an ordinary person. His boss' glasses make him change everything for which he worked, and his whole world collapses around him, gradually. There could not be an actor better suited to present this clever presentation on the screen than William H. Macy. He is not only a talented theater and stage actor, but also projects honesty for each character he plays. He is an ordinary person in danger. His anxiety increases when he gets up and leaves work. Suddenly, he has to deal with problems that he tried to avoid all of his middle-class existence in Brooklyn in the 40s. He is a Jew, right? The cinematography in this brilliant and atmospheric film, shot with a confident hand by Neil Slavin, constantly reminded me of some of Edward Hopperâ€™s films, especially the episode at the beginning of the film, when Newman leaves the building, and at night was shot when he and his wife followed a couple of black shadows threatening and anticipating confrontation with hooligans. Laura Dern, David Paymer and especially Meatloaf, which give unbelievable depth to the bully next door, are excellent, but they are all pale in comparison with William H. Macy's stellar twist (H should stand for HONEST ..) If you haven't read the book, I would I sincerely recommended it because no one wrote more truthfully and convincingly than Arthur Miller.
