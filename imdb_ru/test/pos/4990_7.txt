The Comanche Moon had everything for it. For starters, Simon Winser, a man whose name is synonymous with high-quality television westerns. Unfortunately, the problems with “Luna” are something that even the most talented director could not solve: a bad script based on a sloppy novel. <br /> <br /> Forget historical accuracy - as any reader of the novels You, the biggest parody of the "Moon", can say, is that it does not even correspond to the information from the original masterpiece "The Lonely Pigeon". So many wonderful, rich moments in the miniseries and, even more so, in the book, are completely absent from The Moon. Taking into account the fact that most of the “Moon” viewers probably come, at least with some kind of “Dove” background, the absence of an emotional background controlled by the character is completely painful. <br /> <br /> However, the “Moon” is one of the cases when the adapted version could and should have been changed to make it more suitable for the screen. For example, the novel "The Moon" is focused mainly on the Comanches themselves. To its credit, the miniseries are trying to serve the Comanches, but in the end, gives them enough to make the viewer just feel that he is missing some important part of the story. Similarly, Val Kilmer's “Skull” is also losing here - the role had to either be expanded, so that Kilmer (and Rachel Griffiths, for that matter) really did have something to do, or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller subsidiary parts. Instead, Kilmer gets the maximum fee for a character who simply leaves you to scratch your head after his appearance in a completely strange final act. <br /> <br /> There are strange moments in the film that simply do not make sense for those who have not read the book (the killer parrot? what?) - besides, there is not a single scene that shows us that Call and McCray - something similar to the amazing Texas Rangers they claim to be. None of their expeditions to the moon (or, for that matter, “Dead Man's Path”) ends successfully, and Call and McCray seem to just miss the one meaningless mission after another. <br /> <br /> Frankly speaking, Larry McMurtry should never have written the script, and he did it only because of the praise that was being surrounded by another cowboy movie “Brokeback Mountain”. McMurtry may write good novels (although there is some disagreement about the consistency of this statement), but he has never definitely established himself as a screenwriter. This production will benefit not only from the return of director Winser, but also from the original screenwriter Bill Wittkliff to adapt the novel to the screen. Whitcliffe definitely doesn’t have a huge amount of material for his screen work, but no one can deny that he did a fantastic job of reducing the original Lonely Pigeon. With all this in mind, “The Comanche Moon” is an almost brilliant production, helped by a stunning cast, which, unfortunately, is simply not enough. Steve Zahn’s image of Gus McCray — or rather his image of Robert Duvall as Gus McCray — is dead. And while some criticize Carl Urbain for Woodrow Cal, saying that his performance does not mimic the quiet, passionless Woodrow original film, all I can say is to accuse McMurtry, because McMurtry is the one who is both on Luna "" Roman, and now the mini-series "turned Woodrow from a socially inept, clumsy, but natural leader into an unemotional character, whose facial features are just boring, and the motives of his character are clear only if you saw them more adequately in" sequel "". <br /> <br /> However, this is an actor This composition, which sparkles in “The Moon”, to the extent that I left the miniseries with the same feeling of sadness that I felt while watching the original “Lonely Pigeon” - this time, because I realized that, probably, the last time we will see these characters appear on the screen for a long and long time - and, frankly, this cast could be successful in a well-prepared full-scale network television series. <br /> <br /> In general, besides the missed opportunities with the actors, bi The biggest parody of the fact that the original novel “The Lonely Pigeon” contained so much rich background history for the characters that it would be fascinating, absolutely fascinating to see in terms of the screen. Unfortunately, all this was discarded in favor of the tedious, inconsistent and ultimately inappropriate prequel of McMurtry.
