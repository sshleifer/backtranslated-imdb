Duffy Duck has signs hanging on every inch of every available tree, declaring that this is rabbit season. But, as you may have guessed, this is really the duck season. Elmer Fadd appears: he is the only hunter stupid enough to get caught in the gag. <br /> <br /> He is even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny comes up to him and asks how the rabbit hunt goes, Elmer admits that he has not yet seen the rabbit. This is more than Duffy can handle. He comes out of his hiding place and immediately points to the rabbit: Bugs Bunny. "Shoot him now!" Duffy screams. “Be calm,” Bugs says. "He shouldn't shoot you now." Duffy insists on this. <br /> <br /> After Duffy returns his broken beak to his head, he is doomed to more arguments infected with a “pronoun problem” that have the same result. Later, Bugs dresses up like a sexy woman and flirtatiously asks Elmer for a duck dinner. Will Duffy be the last to laugh? "Haha very funny! Ha, ha, ha! ”<br /> <br /> What's so funny about this classic cartoon? Bug, frightened, bounces off when Duffy screams in his face. Bugs Bunny says "Yes?" while dripping with self-satisfaction. Duffy Duck stands on tiptoe, demanding a shot. Elmer Fadd whines that he "cannot wait for a crank." Duffy sees Bugs in women's clothes and makes this little noise with his tongue. Karl Stalling plays "You must have been a beautiful kid" during the dredge of Bugs. Duffy demands "absolute honesty" from Bugs. Disruption plays "Home Sweet Home" at the wrong time. Duffy tells Bugs that he is "terrible." <br /> <br /> In five words: every detail of this film. <br /> <br /> NOTE.
