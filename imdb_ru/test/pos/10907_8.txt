This is a really funny movie. His dance scene, made with tape, is one of the most fun scenes I can remember. I thought the “I'm gay” scene at the high school graduation ceremony is a bit surreal, although it was funny. Watching him for the third time, I began to notice small missing segments. One of them was when Matt Dillon's girlfriend, Classic Dietz, tried to use a dial-up phone that she had never used before. Kevin Klein made this film a success with Tom Selleck. It was also the first time I was able to rate Debbie Reynolds; she proved she can be funny. She confirmed this in the TV series "Will and Grace." One discovery I discovered after the third viewing was Lauren Ambrose from 6 Feet Under. She sticks out with her red bangs, but it is obvious that this is one of her first films. Bob Newhart is also very fun in high school principle.
