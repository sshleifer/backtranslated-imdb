just another showcase with a Zeppelin airship in all its glory and absolute swinging. Each band member is on his best page, Jimmy and his bow and JPJ guitar with his rattling bass bozo and roar of Robert singing like theirs, not tomorrow. I have to say that when we enter the first song in which it will sound, this is the beginning of something special. This DVD follows Zeppelin for their 11-year-old Carrie, starting at 69 in the royal Albert Hall, then at Madison Square Garden 73, followed by a much older and mature band at 75 years old at Earls Court and finally another the band on the last english show in Knebworth at 79 This DVD is a fantastic Zeppelin showcase, and if you're not a fan, you'll be after.
