Mike Judge's Idiocracy is an interesting film that his fans will no doubt find and see. <br /> <br /> Before I start the review, I would have anticipated it, saying that if you have the opportunity to watch it, definitely do it, because it’s worth seeing, and this is not the easiest movie to track in the world. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the premise - Luke Wilson is Private Joe Bowers, a military librarian who is considered to have absolutely no outstanding qualities or obvious shortcomings, which makes him absolutely average in all respects. This, along with the fact that he has no living relatives, makes him an outstanding candidate for an experimental cryogenics procedure. Also with Joe, a prostitute named Rita, who was involved in the project by Upgraded, her abusive pimp, froze. Unfortunately, a few days after they froze, the top secret project was abandoned, and they were forgotten. <br /> <br /> They wake up in 2505 and discover that society is at an impasse, following trends. Recently, everything on Earth is only a little smarter than chimpanzees. How “everyday” Joe Bowers is said is seen as “fussy”, as if someone speaking like Shakespeare would make fun of now, and the former professional wrestler is the president of the United States (actually, this is probably not outrageous) really). The best show on television is called “Oh! My balls! ”, Which, admittedly, sounds pretty good, and not only everything is written incorrectly, but it seems that the signs do not have enough space for the wording, leaving them to the end. <br /> <br /> This is a fun premise for the film, but this is a problem - apart from the original premise, the film is not that funny. By this I mean that the ideas that come to mind after reading the background of the film are probably as funny as the film itself. Obviously, this is not scary, but perhaps it could be funnier. <br /> <br /> There are several winners in the script, such as Starbucks, offering “happy endings”, and people who blindly believe in widespread misunderstanding. “Electrolytes”, but they are too few and far apart, so if you are not going to laugh hysterically every time one of the future idiots speaks shameless, profanity, containing words with minimal logic and / or intelligence, then laughter can be pretty well spaced. <br /> <br /> It's unfair that everyone compares it to Office Space, because it's a completely different movie, but like a movie, no matter what came before it, the idiocracy is a funny concept that will probably make you laugh much more in the first 15-20 minutes than in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I give it 5 out of 10 because it’s nice, but don’t don’t do enough to lift it above the middle of the road.
