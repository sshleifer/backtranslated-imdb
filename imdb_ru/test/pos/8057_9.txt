I contend that to view the fictional biography of The History of the City of Phoenix, you need to enter areas where American filmmakers rarely take risks, and director Phil Carlson received a directorial assignment in The Untouchables megahite, mainly based on Kansas. City Confidential "and this film; and it became one of the most admired and most imitated films ever made. A rare feat for American filmmakers, it seems, is a character-centered, purposeful film or crime-fighting series; I remind the viewer how the powerful producers of “Hundreds of Cain”, “Hardcastle and McCormick” and even “The Untouchable” had to work on creating anything but episodes devoted mainly to the rampant activities of criminals, and not their ethical opponents. This powerful, original and very sandy film has its own style; and his lesson seems to be attention to detail about opponents and victims of criminal organizations, as well as their gang members. The film has a twelve minute prelude, in which reporter Cleet Roberts interviews real participants from the city of Alabama, who fought with his corrupt vice gangs. The problem arose from the presence of Fort Benning across the river and the nearly 100-year existence of vices in the area. The film tells about the return of John Patterson from Germany, where he was the prosecutor. His father, defeated by the Attorney General of Alabama, refuses to join him in the prosecution of 14th Street, despite several provocations, including the beating of his son, who avenged Patterson for his tormentor. There are several well-developed characters, including Ellie, who works at one of the clubs and her honest boyfriend, leader of the syndicate, Patterson and wife of John, Ed Gage, operatives of the vice-governors and Zeke Ward, honest black man of the victim for his opposition to him. Harry Neumann’s cinematography and Stanley Fleischer’s artistic guide are filmed in black and white and are very similar to a news film, adding realistic film power. The music of Harry Sukman contributes to the film effectively. Writer Daniel Mainwing and Crane Wilbur created a fast-paced and simple story that is divided into parts. Part one illustrates the empire of leaders from inside one of their clubs, showing the fate of the victim, who is beaten and then taken to the police for a mob fee. In the second part, Albert Patterson refuses to speak out against the crowd leader, the clever Rett Tanner. In the third part, the young Patterson returns, and after several incidents, including due to the fact that he had to beat the mob's thug to avenge his beating, he decides to nominate his father for the post of state attorney general. His wife is terrified; and the mob kills Zeke Ward's daughter and throws the body in Patterson's house with a warning that his children will be next. Several more such incidents, including the loss of a lawsuit in which the Pattersons argue that the gun killed their friend who found the car involved in the murder of a little girl, and watch as a result declare death to be accidental, convince Patterson to run, and he wins Democratic across the state, despite state mob tactics - and quickly killed. John Patterson does not allow the crowd of militants to start an open war with the crowd on 14th Street and uses their voices to call the capital and demand martial law for the city of Phoenix. The clubs are closed and the equipment is confiscated, but not before the girl who killed the mob from the inside kills Patterson, and Zeke Ward must stop him so that he does not kill Tanner and not put him on trial. The end of the drama is optimistic; but the forecast for the city is less optimistic than that drawn; the crowd actually tried to return and then moved to Tennessee. In this awesome crime-fighting film, Richard Kiely is young, but very strong, like Patterson, and plays him without an accent. John McIntyre as his father is very good, while Edward Andrews as the Boss Tanner is a caliber reward. Other actors include Katherine Grant as the girl inside, Ellie, Gene Carson and Katie Marlowe as the female mob, John Larch as their idiot, Biff McGwire as the young victim, James Edwards as Zieke Ward, Lenka Peterson as the wife of John and some good character actors like city dwellers and mob bosses. I propose it is difficult to say good enough about realism and the absence of posturing in this film; This is by far one of the best directorial works by Phil Carlson. Carlson also made "The Scarface Mob", later - "Walking Tall". A sober and inspiring view of the ease with which self-satisfied citizens of public interest can accept tyranny, and how some honest people can teach them the need to fight for their rights.
