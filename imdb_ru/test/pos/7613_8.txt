Never kissed the lead with Drew Barrymore as Reporter. Josie Gellar is a sweet, extremely juicy and sometimes rather painful story about a timid woman named Josie Gellar who, although brilliant, is quiet and shy and has never been kissed by a man. She was assigned her first major news article for the newspaper in which she works - that she worked undercover, when a high school student made friends with popular cool kids and found out what really happens in the world of high school. The only problem is that Josie has never been popular. In fact, high school was a traumatic experience for her, since she was getting a lot of teasing and cruel jokes. Josie takes this task, so that, finally, "fit" in it to get a sensation - the main thing that she finds in this story. <br /> <br /> Never kissing, this is one of those films that are so full and sometimes smacking, especially in several scenes at the end, that the likelihood limits are seriously tested, and many cynics may not like this movie. This, however, is very sweetly made. Drew Barrymore is perfect as clumsy, but cute Josie - she breathes a fresh character into the character and makes her completely realistic. I also liked Lily Sobieski, an intellectual student who made friends with Josie on her first day at school. <br /> <br /> Never kissed, there are some really funny moments when Josie unravels her insane attempts to be cool. An example is a reggae scene. I also liked the appearance of Brother Josie Rob, who also returns and enrolls as a high school student, the way he helps give Josie her "dream" of final accommodation is just fun. At the same time, as Josie’s sad history of her early years in high school is shown in her memories, she’s extremely painful. You do not need to have an experience similar to what happened in high school with Josie to have her story influenced her - Drew superbly helps his hero to have a personal connection with the audience, and we adore Josie from the start. <br /> <br /> In this film, many "mean girls" of 2004, but mean girls, to be honest, were much rougher. Never kissed becomes a very romantic picture, because Josie has feelings for a certain person, and the question arises whether they will come together. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. It was really beautifully made in some areas. In some places, the film is banal, yes, the last scene - realistic, nothing - does this film manipulate your emotions in the most obvious Hollywood way? Oh yes, yes, yes, baby! But it perfectly manipulates, there are several lessons. The film never preaches, but he manages to draw an accurate picture of what the high school for the elect was like. I actually met people who had a similar experience with Josie - I met people who are very similar to all these characters - I think that many people simply do not know or can not imagine the cruelty that can exist in the world of high school, and how it can be harmful, but it is. Absolutely unreal. What struck me was the Drew gig at the prom night, when she demonstrates a “sheep mentality” that can exist as widely as in Hollywood and made up as many people think that this can be well done and very true. <br /> <br /> I do it so that I never kiss, it sounds much harder than it really is, in truth, this is the perfect movie to choose it when you want a sweet, pleasant, pleasant, sincere picture. It is sweet, sweet and just Rufus. I would say check it out. 8 out of 10.
