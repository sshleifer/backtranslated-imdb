Although Bullet In The Brain is no doubt superior to short films, overall, this is more like a short text than a movie. And a little hard to feel sorry for the teacher, when his clever ass notices that he will be shot. But after the bullet penetrates his brain, we begin to understand a little why he had become so tormented by life. This rather short film captures a huge amount of detail, and this is what makes me feel that it should have been slightly expanded - it seems that almost too much needs to be taken at once, as the details fly on you so quickly. A slightly more relaxed tempo and a less expressive narrator in the last section could help this film a little. Despite these complaints, it is impossible to deny that Bullet In The Brain is a rather colossal work compared to many short and even full-length films. Producers should be welcomed for trying to make such an essentially emotional and literate film in the current atmosphere of quick jokes and Hollywood acts.
