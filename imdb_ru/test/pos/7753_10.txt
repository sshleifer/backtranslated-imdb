At first glance, TMHS is another high school drama; but surprisingly hidden under this huge amount of depth, originality and eccentricities, which not only make it unforgettable for the viewer, but also makes it, undoubtedly, one of the best anime that production environment has been in the past few years. <br /> <br /> We see the world through the eyes of Ken, who on her first day in high school meets Haruhi Suzumiya, a girl who boldly declares that she is not interested in “normal people” in the class, and even above all off randomly invites any aliens, time travelers, sliders or espers to meet her. Kayon looks at him incredulously, wondering if she is joking or if he has a few bolts. However, challenging his inner instincts, he begins to talk to her. In this case, it soon becomes apparent that she is not an ordinary schoolboy. Soon after, she creates her own well-named school club, SOS Brigade, and drags Kyona among other extremely unsuccessful people to attend. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this anime follows the usual standard conventions, Kion The protagonist is an overly cynical pessimist and contributes a witty story to the show. Far from the usual two-dimensional male characters who seek to fill the environment. The episodes themselves are not chronological and make the viewer think about current events and how they relate to previous events. This is a brilliant move; the effect is similar to a jigsaw, as the new part is packed, we get the feeling of a larger picture. The previous scenes now get completely new meanings, and the implementation satisfies them deeply. However, this means that he feels disconnected (whatever, but not very much), the very cleverly written script bypassed this problem and ensured that it flows smoothly from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The story itself is strikingly original, but I will not go further than the simple outline of the plot I gave earlier, since it will undoubtedly spoil it for you. However, what I will mention is a plot that includes a wide range of genres, ranging from comedy and science fiction. The way they managed to do this in fourteen episodes is unknown to me, and without a doubt, this in itself is a great achievement. <br /> <br /> TMHS is a true gem, with the diversity and depth to which it will turn. almost anyone interested in anime. Watch it, rather unusual, this is what corresponds to the tremendous deception that he received - and even surpasses it.
