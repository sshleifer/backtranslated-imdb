Wildman Chief Advisor Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray in excellent mental form in his first starring role) leads various wacky high-heels in North Star summer camp. Tripper is friends with the sad and lonely loser Little Rudi (pleasant and spectacular performance of Chris Mickip). Directed by Ivan Reitman tells funny comic vignettes from the wall in a continuous fast pace and maintains an inspiringly good-natured tone. This film shrewdly penetrates the fresh essence of summer: making friends, first love, jokes, competing in sports with a rival camp, singing on the fire and, of course, the inevitable scary urban legend about a runaway psycho-killer with a hook. The feeling of joyful hoarse fun generated by this picture is positively infectious. In addition, humor is always dull and sometimes rude, but never too nasty or mean. It is best of all that the winning excess of pure heart is combined with this humor (especially the warm relations between Tripper and Rudy are really touching). The cast has an obvious ball that plays its cute characters: Murray's glorious gonzo and galvanizing presence make things constantly buzz (his crazy PA announcements are absolutely useless), plus there is an impressive contribution from Harvey Atkin as the unfortunate camp owner Morty, Kate Lynch as the cheeky Old Tripper Roxana's flame, Russ Banham as a kind Crockett, Kristin Debell as a sweet, fox AL, Sarah Trading as a nasty Candace, Jack Bloom as a cool-eyed Span, Keith Knight as a fat man go sloth Larry Finkelstein, Cindy Deving as the charming Wendy, and Matt Craven as the hardware. Cinematography by Donald Wilder gives the film an attractive, sunny look and makes excellent use of napkins. Elmer Bernsteinâ€™s lively and melodic score also does his job. This riot.
