Once again, watching movies of this kind more and more turns me into English humor, which is not so often seen on the screen since the days of Monty Python and “Man About the House”. Very sorry. <br /> <br /> Brenda Bletin (which I first saw in Rescue Grace at the beginning of the year, by the way, should see another), is simply excellent, as Alfred Molina does. The rest of the cast, although practically unknown to me, includes excellent performances. The film begins slowly and gradually gaining momentum and having fun - halfway through my tears of laughter. <br /> <br /> In general, a funny English movie, a thousand times better than the supposedly “funny” trash is from Hollywood. <br /> <br />
