When I first saw this movie on a video in a department store ... he intrigued me. Given the fact that I thought I was in love, and at the time I was the same age as this film (although I understand that they are old enough to be my parents), plus the soundtrack was written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin shortly before how they "succeeded" here in North America ... I thought that I had nothing to lose with the purchase. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Until now, I have shown this to many guys I’ve met since, and to my current boyfriend ... obviously, they didn’t find it as beautiful as me. .. I prefer to call it the movie "chick" ... but I'm still laughing and crying. This film has been greatly missed. It's nice to see that you can rent it at one of the local video stores so that other people can share the magic. <br /> <br /> So maybe this is a bit contrived ... but it gives you a carefree feeling of innocence ... and a new faith in love.
