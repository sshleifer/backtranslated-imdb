This film can be compared with “food for comfort” for the soul. Anyone who has ever tried to save a relationship could relate to this film. So many pieces of it are so much fun, and so many pieces are so heartbreakingly true. He is not perfect in his statement or even in dialogue, but the story is unique, which says a lot about modern "romantic" comedies. Luke Wilson is soft at best, but Heather Graham, in my opinion, does an exceptional job. Try it - despite the banal-looking DVD cover. Jolene's character raises many problems in our self-service culture. She asks us if the commitment is really for another person or for ourselves. Truly, it is we ourselves. Keeping promises (from marriage to a friend's errand) is a great feeling. Moreover, our word is nothing but clouds of smoke. Jolene is like an alarm clock. We must be aware of our words and commitments, they mean more than we think. At the same time, we should not commit ourselves to someone who is not able to do the same.
