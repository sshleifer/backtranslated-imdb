Jay Craven's criminally ignored film is a sober breath of fresh air in the narcissistic and derivative world of independent cinema. First, photography is a pure aesthetic pleasure that captures all the dark beauty of Northern New England in late autumn (cinematographer Paul Ryan filmed the 2nd block in Malik's Heavenly Days). Secondly, the performances are equally excellent - Noel Lourdes from Rip Torn is incredibly charming, and Bangor from Tantoo Cardinal is both sensitive and full of energy, not to mention the great cast. In general, it is a tribute to the narrative of the film, that the story maintains a strong and lively pace, still unfolding in its own time, and the film concludes, naturally and genuinely, which, however, does not seem expected. This is one of the rare cells of dignity in the independent film world, a film that explores a small piece of intersection between people and history.
