Well, it's easy not to confuse it with Stuart Gordon's lame film, called "Bed of Death", which came out a few years ago, because it is "The Bed That Eats." And how do I even begin to describe it? Well, for starters, obviously, there is a bed that eats. This is due to tears of tears, which, of course, affect most things, I think, negatively. A bed in the rooms of some old servant or something like that, and at one time she was responsible for the disappearances of many people. We have a storyteller who is a ghost who sits in the wall behind the picture and collects all inedible treats (decorations, etc.) through which the bed passes. He died of consumption, one of the few who was lying in bed, and no one had eaten him, probably because he was sick, he theorizes, because we see him hacking blood into handkerchiefs ... bluff. The peculiarity of this film is that he has a very strange sense of humor, but all this is played quite calmly. The film is divided into several "actions", I think, "Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and Just Desserts." For fans of the incomprehensibly strange and strange, well, it might just be in your alley. All I can say is that you have to see it in order to believe it, it is quite beyond description. 8 out of 10 stars.
