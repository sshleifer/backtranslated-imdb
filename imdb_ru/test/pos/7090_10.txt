Meryl Streep as Kate, a woman dying of cancer, fulfills her role perfectly. No wonder she was behind Oscar. In part, she argues that caring and caring housewives are just as important as their sisters in the business world. And the lesson she teaches about life expectations and their dissatisfaction as relationships grow, is the most important thing she teaches her daughter. We can expect too much from our comrades. Understand that there are many blunders, and forgiveness or understanding - the main components of a happy life. This dark movie, and the end, albeit a sad one, shows reconciliation between father and daughter. I'll give it ten.
