I was sent to this film by a friend. I never heard of it, but I thought it was Christopher Lampbert, so I rented it, and found out that it was not Christopher Lampbert, but Thomas Jane, who was great in this film. I like that almost the whole movie takes place in this country house. All the characters were great and the script was awesome, I really would like Skip Woods to write and make another film. In my book, Thursday, there is an impeccable story that this guy is trying to do something with his wife and child after a shady past, but then his old friend who sells drugs, and this becomes quite Thursday. This is one of my favorite movies, and it shows the real potential of Thomas Jane. But this film is very rare, but I found it in a pair of Hollywood videos on VHS. So clean out the old VCR and look in on Thursday, because he got a seal of approval from Pee Wee
