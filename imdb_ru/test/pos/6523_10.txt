"Coconut Fred Island with fruit salad!" This is a fun show that is on Saturday morning at WB. It depicts Coco Fred and all his friends on the island, and each episode is a very funny adventure. Most of the time, this is due to Coconut Fred's problems doing antics that make him funny, and other things happening on the island at the same time. The humor is great and no one on the island is very bright, which makes him as funny as he is. I don't think it could be funnier. The voice talents of the characters are superbly superior and exaggerated, which adds to the fun of the show. If this will ever be on DVD, I will get this A.S.A.P! <br /> <br /> It is strongly recommended to laugh.
