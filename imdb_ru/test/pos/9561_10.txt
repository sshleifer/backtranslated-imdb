This film was even better than Waiting for Guffman. The great strength in these two films lies in the brilliant character played by Gest and the small second urban troupe Levi. If someone finds this film boring or meaningless, help them God, they just did not understand it. This layout, what the guest and Levy have a genius for. At the end of the film, where a dog lover in the south tells us that in order to relax after the show, he went to Israel to work on the “galley”, or when he told us that ventriloquism is an ancient art, and we see a hieroglyph. <br /> <br /> Ancient Egyptian, holding in his hand a tiny ancient Egyptian, realized that such moments make life worthy of life. Thank you Mr. Just and Mr. Levy, and God bless you.
