The son of Hercules is seriously injured during a hunt for lions, which goes awry. Hercules (a solid and exciting performance by the muscular Reg Park) has to go to an eerie and dangerous alternative dimension, ruled by the evil and vengeful Goddess of the Earth Gia (a deliciously evil image of Gia Sandri) and fight various monsters to save his son's soul. Meanwhile, the equally nasty son of Gia, Antaius (completely hateful move by Giovanni Chianfrilias), portrays Hercules from himself and captures the whole city as a cruel and ruthless tyrant. Directed by Maurizo Lucidy tells a fascinating story at a steady pace and maintains a serious tone throughout. This film starts a little slow, but really starts cooking as Hercules enters the foggy and dangerous underground spiritual world: the main points of rage include Hercules fighting the humanoid lizard beast, Hercules climbing up a giant, gnarled tree, and Hercules attacking a bunch terrible rotting zombies. Moreover, the strange spiritual world just smells of a creepy atmosphere (must love this constant thick swirling fog!). The tense, rough, difficult man-man-large physical confrontation between Hercules and Antai also completely collapses. Of course, we also get a great climatic eruption of a volcano mondo destructo. The clear widescreen cinematography of Allvaro Mancori gives the film impressively wide coverage. Hugo Filippini's strong, inspiring account has an excellent stately cast to him. So, this film is an obvious cheap cute job, which uses abundant shots from Hercules in the Haunted World and Hercules and Captives, but itâ€™s still a very lively and exciting joke.
