I have never seen in the book "The Desire for Death", nor the "Desire for Death" (film). However, Death Wish 3 was a very interesting movie. The famous warrior Paul Kersey tried to visit his friend Charlie, but he visited him only a couple of minutes before his death, because Charlie did not defend the huge and shameful underground gang headed by Manny Franker. After some quarrel while in prison, Kersey learned that Franker, with whom he fought in prison, had his own program of turning New York into hellfire (as well as his influence), sending his minions to establish a crime every time, everywhere and everyday. Because of the chance provided by Insp. Richard Schriker, who knows his profile well and loves him very much. Kersi decided to start a war with Franker and his gang. <br /> <br /> I agreed that Death Wish III was one of the most straightforward and extreme fighters I have seen in the past. This film used a very straightforward way to tell a story. No cumbersome stories and less unnecessary scenes that were one of the merits of the film. In the next release, "Violence" was widely used in the film. I believed that many viewers would like a scene from the movie “Wish for Death III” because it showed rude, extreme and explosive acts for every minute of the film, especially the film’s climax scene and the death of Manny Franker, which, it seemed to me, was the maximum scene of action. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, I think everyone was good and coped with their role. Charles Bronson made everyone believe that he was as great as Paul Kersey. He did not look like a “big old cat,” but as a great retainer. Port O'Herlihih also performed his work well. His main role as a villain in the film made him look disgusting and look like a big bad guy. However, the role of Catherine Davis in this film was pathetic. She was not like the main character. I thought she only appeared in two or three scenes before she was killed by Franker and his follower to warm up Paul Kearsey. She could have more role. <br /> <br /> In my commentary, straightforward style and extreme violence made this film great for fans of extreme action films. Due to the fast pace in the style of "back" and "Forth" this film is very interesting to watch. However, in this film there was some kind of stupid scene and some kind of hole in the plot. First, the scene when Insp.Shriker first met Paul Kersi. It was very banal, because you attacked your pet before you wanted him to help him, it’s like you hit a guy before trying to lend him some money. Haha it's like a joke! Although I liked the plot twist, when Insp.Shriker later showed that he helped Quercy, because at first Shriker looked like a villain because of his deed with Quercy, but when the movie reached a climax, it became clear that he was Quersey. plans. <br /> <br /> In another case, the final scene of the film confused me. It stumbles upon all the senses, because it ended too easily. Franker's gang members looked incredible after they discovered that Franker was dead before his girlfriend and other followers decided to flee. Finally, Insp.Shriker allowed Paul Kersey to fly out of his city before the police caught him. I thought that this style of the final scene can be found in many Cannon Film films, but I don’t like it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I agree with Death Wish 3 because of my explanation, which I printed first. The cast and the action were very good and so extreme, even there was a scene that I didn’t like. Straightforwardness and extreme violence can be the best short description of this film.
