Quaint, vulnerable, rude, honest and pleasant looking. I am not here to give a summary or overview of the film. I just want to congratulate this little movie with a BIG BIG HEART. I take off my hat to the director, and this is a great cast. If you want to know what happens in the movie ... then take a look. Michael Parness, a writer / director, was engaged in a very delicate and emotional plot of "Suicide" with great compassion, comedy and sympathy. I see an excellent career for Mr. Parness. This movie works. Right from the outrageous opening sequence to tender, honest moments between David Krumholz and Natasha Lyonne. As in every movie, we need to suspend some disbelief, but I found that with MAX AND GRACE I can easily transfer and be completely convinced of his “surrealistic moments”. I would just like them to push some of these points even further. Mr. Parness "pulled out" some great performances from this already talented actor. For example, Guillermo Diaz’s performance as a patient in a shelter was hysterical and moving. Colossus Ralph Möller, the former Mr. Olympics, like a scared patient ... perfect. I can go on and on ... This independent feature possesses the star power of a big budget Hollywood film, however, you forget about STARS on the screen as you go along with this wonderfully written story. The real star here is a brilliant script. I look forward to meeting the writer / director Michael Parness.
