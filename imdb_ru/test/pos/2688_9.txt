I think the problem with this show, not receiving the respect it really deserves, is that it comes after Seinfeld, after ELR and after Friends. These three sitcoms were star shows of their time. <br /> <br /> KOQ came at the end of this special time on television. <br /> <br /> But don't let that discourage you. <br /> <br /> King of Queens is just as good, if not better, than two of the three mentioned. <br /> <br /> Seinfeld everything started and was and is a classic timeless. I have never laughed so hard as in Seinfeld. But KOQ is very close. <br /> <br /> When it comes to laughing, I have to put KOQ in second place after Seinfeld. ELR should be the second, although character creation and interaction with them is more attractive. <br /> <br /> In any case, KOQs are the top ten in the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The only other worthy comedy mention is now - Two and a half People who do not really hold the candle to the other four, but all that we have left.
