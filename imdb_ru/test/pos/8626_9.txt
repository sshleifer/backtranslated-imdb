I grew up on films about Abbott and Costello, A. because my father grew up with them, and both of our last names are Abbott, so we must respect the deo, I did not realize that this film and other people receive. It was really classically due to the fact that it was funny, because Abbott and Costello were always the same characters, but it was sooo funny, now I like Jack and the beanstalk that the love story is completely boring, and this song the prince sings, oh my god, terrible, but I like the way they took up love, history, the couple should get married, because in one kingdom money runs out, they meet in a prison cell and fall in love, because they both pretend that to be royal and they end up that were a couple, such a happy ending, I don't think it was the original version, if they were to cut it out of this film, but I think it was original, and I love it. but watching it sucks, laughs, also when the film is really playing with giant + Abbott and Costello, it's sooooo funny. when the giant knocks Jack on the door, and Jack shouts “OPEN DOOR, OPEN DOOR”, this thing is really funny. And this is a joke once, when Jack starts screaming, the prince, the prince and all these dogs jump at him. kind of damp, but really original. I would like them to at least try to rethink it, although I received these African cries / jacks and the beanstalk, and I don’t mind the qualitative reason that I had it on the tape, it was of poor quality, so that I did not think. the beginning is a little funny, the middle is really very funny, and the end is not funny at all, but I'm 19 years old, and when the movie, shot at 52, makes me laugh so hard, it's amazing, this movie is really funny. I love their style. also chapters suck. also the part where Jack climbs a beanstalk, and they all sing a song about what a probe is and that they kill him, it's pretty funny
