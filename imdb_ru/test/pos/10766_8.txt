I thought it was a very good movie. Someone said he was “sick,” so they couldn't watch him. I think that if you understand his R rating, you will be ready for nudity and drug use. This is a good story, and the game is amazing. Just can not be a hypocrite to appreciate it! This is mainly about mom who uses drugs and wants to clean up, so she calls a very rich old friend, and he delivers them to his estate, and crazy things happen. I think this is a drama. I'm just so tired of people who don't like movies because of curses or nudes. This is the world in which we live. You obviously don’t feel comfortable if you don’t see things like this movie. And this is a rating of R. So, this should tell you from the very beginning that these are not all peach happy rainbows. I like it. I think you too!
