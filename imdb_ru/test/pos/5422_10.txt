I saw it only once - in 1986 in the "artistic" theater in Minneapolis ... but I remember it as if I saw it a thousand times this morning. Jolly (Sawing for Teens, playing Scrabble with all the e's), beautifully animated (tearing eyes, shaking them, and then putting back) and sharp (end of the world, pettiness is a bit) ... > <br /> Viewing is required for the human race. Calling it just a cartoon is just the same as calling BIG GATSBY an elegant set of text.
