Very funny movie with some of the best Swedish actors. This is all shot in black and white with a true 40 year old feeling. For most of the film, you hit the train heading for Berlin in 1945 among a mixture of characters from refugees to two gays and two nuns. I really recommend this movie if you like to laugh.
