I rarely write reviews, but this film simply requires more attention than it receives, as it contains the most hysterical kidnapping that has ever been made comically. <br /> <br /> I only saw this once and found it in the funniest movie. I have ever had the honor of watching. I laughed from start to finish. It is a pity that it is not on DVD or video. <br /> <br /> You can only compare his cinematography with the film “This is a crazy, insane, insane, insane world” or “Promise her something”. Only this storyline is not as complex as "Mad World". <br /> <br /> I hope that in the near future this film will be released, as it would be a shame to lose such a pearl of comedy among the darkness that we currently have.
