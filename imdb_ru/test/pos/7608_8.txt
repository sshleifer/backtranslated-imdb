Of course, really experienced reviewers who like things like Star Wars and professional crap will definitely pull this film and make really bad comments about it. But in fact, this is a pleasant youthful comedy with a terrific story and good acting. <br /> <br /> Josie Gellar (well played by Drew Barrymore) is part of the news team, and she was offered a ') job - she must go back to school and find out what teenagers look like these days. Well, everything is going well, until Josie remembers her terrible time in high school and is not scared. But she was never fashionable, never been cool, never enjoyed popularity until now! <br /> <br /> Relax and enjoy Never Been Kissed! <br /> <br />
