This movie kicks ass, without exception. Bam and his cruel man made with this film. Since I received a DVD (4 days ago), I watched it three times, and each time it gets better. I can't wait for Grind to go to the cinema. If this is something like Haggard, it will be worth the wait. <br /> <br /> Thank you, JTcellphone
