“I struggled with death. This is the most uninteresting competition you can imagine. It occurs in impenetrable dullness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around, without spectators, without noise, without glory, without much desire for victory, without great fear of defeat in the painful atmosphere of cool skepticism, without much faith in their rights and in less degree to your opponent. If this is a form of higher wisdom, then life is a greater mystery than some of us think is true. "Marlow in Joseph Conrad's" Heart of Darkness "<br /> <br /> It is difficult to make lyrics the subject of death in any work of art. Nevertheless, recently films have made bold attempts to humanize him to such an extent that he is perceived as part of a cycle of all sentient beings, and it can be chosen, not legally. “The Chosen One” is the operational word for the “Sea within Alejandro Amenabara”, based on the real story of the Galician sailor Ramon Sampedro. This drama is about euthanasia without prejudice to love, poetry and friendship. If this sounds like "Barbarian Invasions" (2003), in which a professor specializing in cancer, says goodbye to friends for life and loves before committing suicide, you are right. In fact, the Sea is better because he spends more intimate time with the main character, before he leaves, a wonderful feat in which none of these moments is the least boring or uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem, because Ramon has expressive eyes and a commanding voice for the romantic paralyzed, a combination hard realist and poetic the sufferer Belen Rueda plays disabled lawyer Julia, who becomes Ramon’s imaginary mistress, and her radiance intensifies as her life degenerates from illness. In the already almost accustomed soap opera, Lola Duenas was added in the role of Rosa, a visitor to a blue collar, who initially tries to dissuade Ramona from seeking death, but quickly falls in love with him. Talk about the romanticization of disability. This guy has incredible luck, attracting respectable women, and he cannot lift a finger. But he can talk, proving a final argument about what women want: love that speaks, and not just compels. <br /> <br /> I will refrain from mentioning the main motion picture, which is now awaited by Oscar, which culminates in euthanasia. so as not to spoil the experience of newbies. It is enough just to say that both films successfully open on both sides of the subject matter, without forcing a specific point of view. A religious right has the right to complain that a former film and barbaric invasions mark suicide; he has no right to blame the perfectly balanced Sea within the same. <br /> <br /> “Living in this state has no dignity,” says Ramon. The irony is that he behaves with the greatest dignity that causes anyone to doubt his determination to end his life. “The Sea Inside” is a grand record in the Oscar nomination for the best film in a foreign language in 2004.
