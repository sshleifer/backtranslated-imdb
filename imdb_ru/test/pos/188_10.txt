I am tired of the current cinema, especially American cinema, and I tried to see Oscar-winning foreign films. That's when I stumbled upon this gem. Slowly starting, it begins to develop well after the declaration of war. Basically, the old-fashioned story about girls awaiting their return from the war, performances, cinematography makes it much more. Why Tatyana Samoilova, being a young woman, did not become an international star after being outside of me (although she remained successful in her own country). You go on a journey with her: a young, daring, impulsive young girl who as a result of the destructive action of war becomes a very sober, gloomy woman who retains a glimmer of hope (her last scene is destructive). We love her just like the camera. And the camera work! Was it a pioneer in working with hand-held cameras? It really adds immediacy to the story. And the beauty of it (for example, when Tatiana's character runs up the stairs and next to the lattice fence). I am humble and grateful to see this film.
