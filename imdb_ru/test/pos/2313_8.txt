I can't explain it, but I find this film not only funny, but also so enjoyable that I feel compelled to watch it again and again, or at least I did it when I had cable television. I always felt that it was a really bad film, but perhaps it was because I was watching it on cable. I plan to get a DVD with this film, so that it really looked honest, but, more importantly, just had a good time watching it. I liked the plot and idea of ​​the film, and I especially liked the cast. I always wonder if the actors like to act in films in which they participate, and this is no exception. This film deserved a better fate than it had received, and Kelsey Grammar deserved at least one love scene with Miss Holly. Who wouldn't? The characters in this film were the guys with whom I could identify myself when I was in the army, and Zenicism was accurate. Nice gathering troops.
