I found it to be an interesting story about the difficulties that an independent director might face (which I didn’t even think about). The film supported my interest all the time, and I even laughed more than once! I'm not a director, so I don’t know anything about technology, but I thought it was well edited and tells the story smoothly. As a disclaimer, I contributed to this work after providing music for the soundtrack, but I did not participate in the making of this film, and I could not tell you anything about Repo Man, except for what I remembered I saw it when I wasn’t really a science fiction) I liked the comparison of a movie made from punk rock files with punk rock music. My wife went with me to watch a movie, and she knew nothing about it, and we had a great time.
