When I started watching Surface for the first time, I was hooked. It was all that I wanted, in show-waiting, action movie, riddle, a great storyline and a great cast. My family loved to watch the show. It seems that when a great show is shown on TV, the network usually cancels it, as they seem to have done with this show. They use the Nielson rating system, which, in my opinion, is stupid, because there is a lot of garbage, which they seem to be watching, on which the networks are broadcast. If everyone had a way to vote for the show, then perhaps a good show would not be canceled. When I watch TV, I watch only good shows, so now it's not so much. I hope that the network will return the show, but when they decide to make a stupid decision, they seem to stick with it. I hope that many people will feel the same.
