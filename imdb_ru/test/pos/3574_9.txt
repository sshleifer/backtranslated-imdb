An intelligent and well-received film is worth exporting! <br /> <br /> In this fascinating and truly intelligent film, filmed entirely in Bogota, you can feel the full meaning of the word “Bluff” (although this is a Colombian film, its name is in English); ! <br /> <br /> The story of Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who discovered that his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) has an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), the owner of the magazine; after that, Nicholas was left without a friend and without work. Nikolai Mallarino's revenge is to follow him and get his photos with his new novel Alexandra (Karolina Gomez) to blackmail Mallarino to get money in exchange for not showing pictures to Margarita. <br /> <br /> The story is really intelligent and well connected, so much so that you fully understand the meaning of the title, the film features a thriller with a lot of comic scenes and characters that gives real pleasure to someone who enjoys movies focused on a good script. <br /> <br /> I stand out here in that this film is different from typical Colombian films, which show some dark and cruel depiction of our beautiful country, which is really refreshing. Some critics say that this story does not show a typical Colombian way of life, so you can spend it in any part of the world, I do not agree with this: (1) the film is completely made in Bogota, so you can see the streets and images of the real Colombian capital ( I hope some Americans and film producers watch this so that they stop showing Amazonian jungles or Mexican towns in Bogota, as in some Hollywood films), (2) characters, dialogues, emphasis (with the exception of Nicholas, who is from Argentina s), hence fully, Rosemary (Veronica Orozco) has a distinctive accent to Kali, (3) you can also see the social and cultural differences from ordinary people in Bogota. I hope that all this, plus the English name, will encourage people from other countries to see this Martinez masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Great game by Veronica Orozco, Luis Eduardo Arango (Detective Wilson Montes), Felipe Botero, outstanding detective Ricardo Perez and a good game of Mallarino, Catalina Aristizabal and Federico Lorusso. <br /> <br /> A film that should be exported, and which people from all over the world will surely understand and enjoy! Do not miss this movie 9/10!
