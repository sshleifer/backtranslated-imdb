This is probably one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. He has an action, but not this bullet, the good guys are the bad guys, Van Damme is an action, but a quick, realistic and nervous action, he has a plot, because until the very end of the movie you donâ€™t know how it will end, he there are characters, Hassan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley are just perfect, and he has the suspense, this film just won't let you go until you see its end. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that there are only a few characters, it was not difficult for me to focus on the story, and as for the story, it is basic (not too complicated, but simple and rough) and realistic. . <br /> <br /> If you need a movie with a good story, action, and a great game, watch this, and I promise that you will not leave until you see its end. The very end of it.
