When I was younger, and today Mr. Bean is a great job. Three times nominated by BAFTA stars, Rowan Atkinson, as an almost silent (imitating) person looking like an alien, fell to Earth, causing chaos and harm wherever he went. He tried to pass the exam, put his pants on in front of the blind man (he did not know that he was blind), went to church, tried to dive into the pool, cooked dinner on a park bench, saw a scary film, dressed in his car, made a picnic with an obsessive fly, spent Christmas with his girlfriend (Matilda Ziegler), looked after the child in Portsmouth, visited the 426th room of The Queens Hotel in Portsmouth, won a pet contest with his Teddy rode over his mini on a new chair and even met and knocked out the queen. Guests included Rudolph Walker, Richard Briers, Angus Dayton, Nick Hancock from the film “They Think It's Over”, Caroline Quentin, Today Today, David Schneider, Richard Wilson, Eriel Maynard from Fast Show and Vicar Deeble Roger Lloyd -Pack. He was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Comedy (Program or Series) and Best Light Entertainment. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 in "The 50 Greatest British Actors," he was number 24 in the comedian "Comedians", and he was number 8 in "The Beloved Comedian of Great Britain." Fine!
