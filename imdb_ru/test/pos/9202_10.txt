Honestly, I just like to watch James Caan. Wonderful actor. With such simplicity, you know exactly what he is thinking. True professional. <br /> <br /> I watched the show from the very beginning and found it great - this is something that is unique in Hollywood - a new idea, not a third version of the current hit show - <br /> <br /> I also find the show is fun and exciting - I like the tempo - you never get bored - I especially like the mystery in each episode - the way it unfolds. I am a big fan of secrets and have read many great mysteries, but I believe that the stories in the series are well written, and the result is rarely obvious. Also extremely interesting to me, probably because I'm not a player, are the various disadvantages that come up with "players" - I was fascinated by the number of schemes that people thought up to rob in Las Vegas. Music: I like music on top of the show. Absolutely perfect for the show ... Sets the tone and atmosphere. Just amazing. And of course, there is James Caan.
