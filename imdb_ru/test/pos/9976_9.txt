When you think of golf movies, you think of Caddyshack, but what if there are children around? Go straight to this movie! Disney uses a proven formula to make a film that adults and children will love. The acting in this film is, in my opinion, quite good, and the main cast is, for the most part, very young! This film is also shot very well and uniquely, seeing all sides of the game of golf. I think that this film should be awarded some academic awards for editing films or something like that, because the entire flow of the film is top notch. Although the finale may be a bit predictable, the film succeeds on its own! It also shows that you do not need curses, nudity or violence to make a great golf movie!
