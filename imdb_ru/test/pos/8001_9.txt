The Return of Batman is a really dark movie that shows Caped Crusader fighting against Penguin and the sexy catwoman (Iâ€™ll come back to them later) Michael Keaton behaves well like Bruce Wayne, showing that he is a good actor. Tim Burton manages this picture well, and the location of the film is impressive. Villains: Danny de Vito is threatening like a Penguin. A cruel but worried man who had a really difficult childhood. But Michelle Pfeiffer is stealing a picture. She is the BEST Catwoman ever! She is menacing and very sexy. There is a scene where she kisses Batman, like a cat that only heats the film. Active scenes are also good, and the ending is dramatic and tragic, perhaps the best final movie about Batman. Tim Burton shows that he can really manage the movie about Batman (he showed it with the first Batman), and also gives Batman a more somber character. As much as he is.
