“Eighteen” (2004) tells the story of Pip Anders, a depressed and extremely cynical young man who is alienated from his dysfunctional family from the upper / middle class and lives on the streets of Vancouver. On his 18th birthday, he gets a tape and player from his recently deceased grandfather, telling about his memories of his 18th birthday, spent in the British army in France, trying to help a mortally wounded comrade avoid being captured by the occupiers. Germans. While Pip is listening to the tape (Ian McKellen provided his grandfather's voice), we see scenes that he describes as memories alternating with daily scenes from Pip's life, as well as later memories filling a dark secret why Pip left home and finds it impossible to trust Anyone who is nice to him. <br /> <br /> The second ambitious film by writer / director Richard Bell (“Two Brothers”), with a sophisticated appearance, excellent photography, well-developed stereotypical characters (with equal to gays and straight people) and commendable efforts in emotionally and physically demanding roles from some talented new actors (especially Paul Anthony in the role of Pip and Brendan Fletcher as his grandfather at 18). There is also a remarkable turn of Alan Cummings as a priest who tried to help Pip, and a small supporting role played by Thee Jill (“Queer As Folk”). The complex story - according to the director himself in his comments on the DVD - is intended to set in motion a "whirlpool of emotions" that pushes Pipa to his critical point, and, of course, she achieves this. My only criticism is that the overall effect is too “damn” or artificial for the audience to truly identify themselves, much of the supportive dialogue (and ending) is too contrived and predictable, and the direction should be sharper to reduce careless replay in some scenes. I recommend it, 7 stars out of 10, including extra points for a remarkable effort.
