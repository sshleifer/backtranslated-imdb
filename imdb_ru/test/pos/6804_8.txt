During the 13 years of study that I took from kindergarten to high school, there was only one day when my class went on a field trip. When I went to school, you went to school from 8:30 to 3:30, and the declared trips were not conducted. But for some reason I could not remember in this old age, we went to see the film - National Velvet. I do not remember the film, so on the eve of my 57th year I decided to return to it. <br /> <br /> This is a film about time that no longer exists. A time when people trusted others and did not lock their homes. The time when people were given the benefit of doubt. It was a time when the family was the most important thing. This film shows all this and more. It shows the love, trust, care and kindness of people. <br /> <br /> For each family, it would be nice to watch this movie from time to time and discuss its message. <br /> <br /> It was a pleasure to see young Elizabeth Taylor, Mickey Rooney at her best, Academy Award-winning Anne River, Angela Lansbury before Murder, She Wrote, and Donald Crisp, who spoke for almost sixty years. /> <br /> What a movie!
