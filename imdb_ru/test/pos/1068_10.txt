From the perspective of the hectic modern world in which we live, the so-called “good old days” always seem much more serene and innocent; an idyllic era, to which we have only memories and shadows that linger on a silver screen, as in “Christmas in Connecticut”, a warm and sweet film directed by Peter Godfrey. Barbara Stenvik plays the role of Elizabeth Lane, a popular journalist-type journalist “Martha Stewart,” who writes about life on her favorite farm in Connecticut, always with the latest recipe in the center of history. One of her biggest fans is Alexander Yardley, played by Sydney Greenstreet, the publisher of the magazine she writes for. Yardley never visited her farm, and in response to the idea expressed in a letter to nurse Mary (Joyce Compton), he decides to spend an old-fashioned Christmas with Elizabeth, her husband and child, and as a special guest, a certain Mr. Jefferson Johns (Dennis Morgan), a sailor who has just recovered after fifteen days in the sea on a raft after torpedoing his ship. Elizabeth, of course, cannot refuse her boss, but there are problems; important is the fact that it does not have a farm and writes its column, without leaving the high-rise building in the city. This creates a dangerous situation both for her and for her editor Dudley Beecham (Robert Shane), since the only thing Mr. Yardley demands from her staff is complete honesty. This is followed by a charming and delightfully romantic comedy that takes the audience back to a seemingly simpler time and place to share the Christmas past, dominated by a warm hearth, good food and kindness. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stenwick absolutely Elizabeth sparkles, with a smile and a presence warmer than what the greatest hearth could provide, and absolutely convincing, like a city girl, completely outside her element on the farm. Morgan also feels well, like a somewhat naive sailor, whose trust in his neighbor is admirable. Even though deceptions are being played out around him, he is one of those guys whom you know will somehow get back on his feet, and in the end, you really feel Elizabeth. However, one of the true charms of this film is Sidney Greenstreet. His Yardley has a rough appearance, but under you is no doubt aware that he is a man with such a big heart like Texas. This is a direct, honest image, and it's nice to see how it works; the most memorable scenes in the film belong to him. <br /> <br /> Supporting roles: Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), terrific Una O'Connor (Nora), Frank Jenks (Sinkevich) and Dick Elliott (judge). Crothers). The movie “Christmas in Connecticut”, which is especially good during the Christmas season (it works especially well at any time of the year), is an unforgettable film that is never taken too seriously, gives hope and leaves you in a good mood. a warm place in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world a good place to live. This is a real classic that you do not want to miss. I rate this 10/10. <br /> <br />
