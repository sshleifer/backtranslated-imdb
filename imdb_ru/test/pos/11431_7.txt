Based on the best-selling book “Sacking,” “The Lost Star,” the latest film by the famous Italian director Gianni Amelio, talks about the growing friendship between an elderly Italian maintenance technician and a young translator whom he hires in Shanghai to become his guide to China. Vincenzo Buonovolonta is a maintenance manager for a steel mill in Italy, which was closed and the blast furnace was sold to China. When Vincenzo (Sergio Castellitto) discovers that the control unit in the furnace is faulty and potentially dangerous, he goes to China to find a steel mill where this part was sold, in the hope of preventing a fatal accident. <br /> <br /> The film, of course, is about traveling, and not about the destination for using familiar clichés, and on this journey we are introduced to an attractive look at China with all its great beauty and complexity through the outstanding cinema of Luke Bigazzi. The film takes us to Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, Baotou, and a trip along the Yangtze River, showing coastal areas that are planned to be flooded when the Three Gorges dam is fully operational, a Chinese megaproject that has displaced 1.2 million people. The trip puts travelers face to face with poverty, overcrowded housing and children left to their fate. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the relationship between Vincenzo and translator Liu Hua (Tai Lin), who first meet in Italy, where his impatience with her translations at the lunch meeting makes her lose her job. When he tracks her in Shanghai, she works in a library and resists Vincenzo’s approach. Considering his offer to help him in his travels in China as a no more than a well-paid job, she reluctantly agrees to accompany him. Their relationship, however, grows as they move from city to city, and her interpretation skills are largely indicative of helping the bewildered Vincenzo, who does not have a mobile phone. <br /> <br /> When they slowly open up to each other, they reveal each other’s vulnerabilities, and the film delves into their past and present life and how they achieved their current situation. We meet her son Liu (Lin Wang) at her grandmother’s house. In the “one child in China” policy, he is one of the unwanted children who have been “hidden” since the boy’s father left the family. Although the meeting between Vincenzo and the boy is casual, their relationship becomes central to how the story unfolds. <br /> <br /> Castellitto is a great actor (although in this role he longs for the young Enrico Lo Verso). However, he is emotionally distant throughout the entire film; his expression rarely changes from the far-away executioner. Despite the fact that Ty Lin brings a lot of attention to this role, her relationship with the much older Vincenzo never seemed real to me, and the end seemed to exist only in a reality known as movies. Although Amelio is one of my favorite directors, following the brilliant Keys to the House, “The Lost Star” is disappointing.
