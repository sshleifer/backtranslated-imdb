Thirty silversmiths and a kiss for good luck. This was another completely unexpected gem. Usually I'm not even a fan of the obscurity / thriller. This satisfying 100 minutes has more twists than a pretzel boardwalk. It has a fascinating erotic romance reminiscent of “Body Heat” in many ways than one; there are policemen and criminals in it; political intrigue and just a little bit of daily soap. It only has the right touch to the brutal violence that any professional criminal work should hire. Emma Thompson, (AIC FBI), performs her role with grace and humor and gets my vote for the best fake southern accent from Limey. Alan Rickman (local policeman), who always seems to steal the show, is excellent but not powerful. They work well in pairs. A lot of the wrong direction of the plot, which never gets out of control and consistently linked at the end of the film. And who is this amazing woman, Carla Gugino? I want her to give birth to my children. Carla, if you're there, let's make lunch
