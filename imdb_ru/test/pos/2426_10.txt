First of all, let me say that this film is not for everyone. He has a very strange subject. Spinster, who lives alone and lives a dull life, discovers a young man in a park across the street from her mansion. She notices him sitting in the rain and invites him to dry out and warm up. The man does not speak, but the woman assumes that he is deaf and dumb. However, she is fascinated by him and is sexually interested in him. He finds her strange and remains silent, although we later learn that he is not at all dumb and that he tells his sister everything that happens between him and the woman. I will not distribute the rest of the plot. If you can find this movie, watch it. You cannot take your eyes off of it. What makes it so interesting? Well, it is completely unique. I have never seen anything like it, and the two of them look very uncomfortable. Especially when you learn what this soft, boring, obsessed spinstar is capable of. You will not forget this soon.
