Shameless Screen Entertainment is a relatively new and British (I think) DVD label specializing in dirty and excessively cruel cult films. mostly Italian - from the glorious eras, when everything was possible, namely from the late 60s to the mid-80s. The label selection looks like an intersection between the works of "Mondo Macabro" and "No Shame" (they probably even borrowed the name of the latter), and they have already released really rare sick Italian puppies, such as "Ratman", "My Dear Killer". "," Killer Nun, "" Ghost of Death "and" Thors. "The" scared woman "was completely unknown to me, but since fellow reviewers from around the world, whose opinion I greatly appreciate, described her as one of the greatest and most bewitching psychedelic films about sexual sexual activity in my era, I didn’t hesitate to raise it.This is a very strange film, and probably it doesn’t work for about 99% of viewers who love movies. However, if you are part of this remaining 1%, you will find truly unique treat. Style, atmosphere and sod Holding is similar to the "Succubus" by Jesse Franco and "Venus in Furs" by Massimo Dallamano, but both of them are widely considered classics, while "The Frightened Woman" is almost unknown. I think the whole thing is profiling and good marketing. (he lives in a gigantic secluded mansion, owns many vintage cars and has a very impressive collection of pretentious relics, including his exact replica of a life-size mannequin) with a quaint and slightly unusual attitude towards women. He regards them as a threat to the survival of the male race and thus spends his days abducting, humiliating and sexually abusing random people he picks up from the street. Then Dr. Sayer kidnaps the ambitious journalist Maria with the intention of completely suppressing her feminine spirit, but he slowly falls in love with her. Simply, he begins to believe in true love, she strikes back with a vengeance. This is not really for everyone, but if you can appreciate the dark and ominous sexual atmosphere, fancy decoration toys and psychedelic touches that seem completely implausible and surreal, you can consider this as the best recommendation. Is it slow, stylishly sloppy and completely crazy? Shameless entertainment, all right!
