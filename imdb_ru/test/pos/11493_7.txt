Jolene (Heather Graham) married Carl (Luke Wilson), and after about five hundred, and after a few days, Karl was very upset and left her, expecting to “clear the fog” in his life. Jolene considers his marriage an important obligation until the end of his life and decides to look for Charles in Texas. She is greatly supported by her brother Jay (Casey Affleck), who meets her on the border of Mexico. There, Jolene encounters a bewildered Carl and realizes that she cannot change his decision, while Jay knows Carmen (Patricia Velasquez) and begins to meet with her, and in the end "life goes on." This film is very unpredictable, with a completely different story. I believe that this is an independent production. In some parts, this is a bit slow and boring, but there are certain dialogues that make this film worthwhile. I liked it, and my voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Rebeldes Até o Fim” (“Rebel to the End”) <br /> <br />
