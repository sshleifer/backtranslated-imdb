The film directed by Mikhail Kalatozov “Cranes are Flying” (“Cranes are Flying”) is a magnificent film work. From the script of Victor Rozov, based on his own play, Kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the sufferings of those who stayed at home. The theme itself is littered with countless war films showing us the front and the carnage. However, this Russian pearl shows how the story of difficulties can be told differently; Speaking to us, right from the soldiers' mouth, how everyone hates the war, that they hope that those who died have done this for the cause that will ensure peace and the end of the war, we will see a new vision of the Second World War. We have young people who are voluntarily ready to wage a war for peace in order to ensure the safety of their families and loved ones at home, and not draftees fighting in a battle in which they do not believe. With such hatred for our current situation in the Middle East and how people die for no reason, against their will, it’s nice to watch a film that shows how self-denying and heroic these soldiers are, as well as those who are awaiting their return. <br /> <br /> Communist Russia shows how involved everyone was in the war. While Boris may have volunteered to go to the front line, his father is the head doctor of the hospital, helping to restore the wounded soldiers, and his sister helps him there as well as his girl Veronica, doing everything possible to divert her attention. that from her love did not come a single letter. The whole city goes to let the boys go on holiday. Even the factory, which Boris and his friend Stepan work for, sends representatives with gifts of thanks. Is it all a glorious look at Russia at the beginning of World War II or not, I do not know. There are no protests or curses from these boys, risking their lives for the sake of the country, it’s all praise and thanks. Some in America could learn a lesson from this, because, whether you agree with the current war or not, protest and chaos in its name only spoil what these men and women sacrifice every day. <br /> <br /> top-level acting is everywhere, but some deserve to stand out. I really liked Antonina Bogdanova in the small role of grandmother Boris. She is the only member of the family he can trust, and her sadness at his departure is very evident on her face and in the language of her body. Vasily Merkuryev, as Patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich, brings perhaps the best performance. As stated at the end, about fathers who need to hold back hidden tears, Merkuryev embodies these feelings. He puts on a tough appearance, especially joking and riding his son when he learns about his volunteering activities just a few hours before he should leave. But when Boris goes to the gathering station, we see the real pain of a man sitting in sadness at the table. He loves his son very much and, although he may not show him to him, his actions throughout the film express this to the audience. Alexey Batalov acts like Boris, a careless young man and an idealist, doing what he thinks is right, and Alexander Shvorin is good as a villain Mark, staying at home thanks to his talented piano skills or maybe just stealing his cousin's love. This love, played by Tatyana Samoilova, really attracts the audience to her grief, despondency and a faint glimmer of hope. The real star of the film, she has to endure a lot of emotions in the journey in which she goes astray, she needs to turn back, hoping that she did it soon enough for Boris to return. <br /> <br /> In addition to the realism of the story, as well as not being afraid to use tragedy to convey the theme, I also liked the visual style of the film. Sergey Urusevsky’s cinematography is amazing, especially considering that the film was shot in full screen. It's one thing to create awesome compositions in a widescreen panorama; It is completely different in a square frame. From the very beginning we get a beautiful static snapshot of the winding path along the water, the bridge in the background above, when our two lovers skip their way up the screen and into the distance. There are several cases where the camera is behind the barriers, but still allows you to see the action, creating a unique spatial depth and interest at any time. Sharp corners are used, as well as neat locking to take into account overhead images and exaggerated matching of characters in the frame together. <br /> <br /> However, real skills are cases of a long throw. Well used at the end to follow Veronica through the mass of returning soldiers, this is great earlier when she wanders among those who say goodbye to her loved ones while she searches for Boris, her own farewell to be said. The planning of this picture must have been extensive, because while she lags in and out of people, the camera focuses on the kisses of couples, people shouting at each other, and moreover, everything is intentionally in the frame at certain moments while the camera is moving. . Everyone needs to accurately hit the target, and this will lead to a brilliant cinema image. This is just part of the overall masterpiece of tone and style; Flying Cranes show how successful the placement and ability to show the audience what they need is as simple as possible. The composition and professionalism of the actors and the film crew can work wonders, adding something that the huge scenery and special effects can never do.
