I saw this movie on September 19, 2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Beagle is just a couple of short memories. It’s all about Darwin’s life from 1841 to 1859, when he was settled in Kent with his growing family, more than 200 pages of Origins had already been compiled. and he wondered whether to complete the book. <br /> <br /> The script is based on Randal Keynes’s Annie's Box (Annie, Charles's daughter, died when she was 10 years old). This is basically a family drama, but includes sex scenes - however, the participants are married, both on the screen and behind the scenes. Not too exciting, not too scientific, but well-made film, which is nice to watch and press the necessary emotional buttons. Actually, a little bit of a romantic cry. I believe that you can conclude that you can be an agnostic and free-thinking scientist from the family of atheists and still be an emotional romantic and a great father. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters and Darwin himself say or wonder if he “killed God,” but the viewer may doubt this. Without a doubt, given the deadly struggle for survival and the network of predators on the meadow bank (well known before Darwin and absolutely indisputable) and the failure of Darwinian prayers, is that the idea of ​​a good, providential god who loves "his being is untenable." br /> <br /> I really don’t see many Americans really objecting to this.Some of them may have problems with the title, which is probably the most controversial thing about the film, or the fact that Bettany has no horns, tail and pitchfork.
