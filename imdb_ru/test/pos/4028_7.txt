This film is an amazing remake of the original with the same title. The film was awesome, even though I hate new ones! The whole cast was awesome. He has a great cast and amazing plot !! The main plot - the person is poisoned, and he needs to solve his own murder, eh? ?! Dennis Quaid is a person who is “DOA” (in other words, Dead On Arrival). He finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect !! Dennis's character has a few hours to figure out who poisoned him. The film is quite fast and rich. You can see two other big stars in “Meg Ryan” (“City of Angels”, “Courage under fire”) and Daniel Stern (“Home Alone”, “Very Bad Things”, “Great”) cool remake of a classic movie !!
