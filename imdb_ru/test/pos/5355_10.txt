I really refused to watch this movie. I refused to go to school, and I refused to go with my parents. Just looking at the trailer for me everything looked silly. One of my friends wanted to take me to the cinema that day, and he offered me two options: "Dukes of Hazzard" or "Wallace and Gromit: the curse of the werewolf rabbit." It took me 17 minutes to solve. Time is running out. I had to choose. “Few” appeared on the screen, as in the few remaining tickets. By the time we had to line up and get our ticket, only one of us could enter. I desperately wanted Nikolai to come in to see it. But he made me. I crossed my arms and was very sullen and disappointed that I was going to see this childishness. I entered, sat down on the only place that was available and prepared for the film! I must say, I was very surprised that I went through this masterpiece! It was wonderful. I don't know what I was complaining about. The clay animation was by far the best I've ever seen in my life. The story was brilliant. About the rabbit destroying and falling carnival, which was planned for more than 500 years. Mostly Anti Pest Control protects people who participate in the vegetable contest. Anti Pesto, known as Wallace and Gromit (who is responsible for this matter), tries to keep rabbits away from the Vegetable Carnival. I won't talk anymore. This is too good to say. I admit that the whole idea of ​​a werewolf rabbit is incredibly incredible and childish, but Nick Park adds to this the essence that makes everyone love her. I mean, there will be no 10-foot rabbit in freedom, and definitely not an 8-foot werewolf, as stated in Dog Soldiers. Again, werewolves and werewolves are not real creatures. But in any case, it worked very well. <br /> <br /> Jokes were also more mature. Children will not get some jokes. It goes over their heads. There were a lot of British jokes. If you like British humor, this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> I also liked the cast and voices. Everything in the film is made incredibly well. The direction and step was absolutely ... Fantastic! I recommend it to fans of old shorts Wallace And Gromit (and no, I haven't seen them yet), and I recommend it to fans who liked Shrek and Shrek 2, and most importantly, I recommend it to people who love Clay Animation . A great movie! 10/10
