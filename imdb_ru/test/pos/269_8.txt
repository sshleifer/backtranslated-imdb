"Prime Suspect 4" continues the exploits of the incomprehensible and persecuted truth and justice seeker, Detective Superintendent Jane Tennyson; the first of three mini-series (PS4, PS5 and PS6) with a noticeable absence of the founding writer Linda La Plante from the credits. Infused with the same harsh reality of the first three episodes, the second three episodes put evil forces on Tennyson, coping with middle age, loneliness, negligence, many personal and professional problems and solutions that are sometimes not perfect. PS4 conjures two stories, while PS5 and PS6 are separate episodes, each of which discovers that Tennyson is seeking justice in the name of the cruelly offended, waging war against institutions that are willing to sacrifice the interests of their victims for the greater good. In other words, to win, Tennyson must overcome both evil and good forces, which makes the gray scenarios of the PS series even more gray, and the wars with Tennyson are no less important than the search for murderers. Very good stuff that gets better from series to series. (B +)
