Soul Calibur is more durable than ever was ... with the creation of a new character and the chronicle of the bad sword regime in the home version. <br /> <br /> The arcade version is more complete, although the list of characters is smaller than the home version, this version is definitely prettier, excluding all the "dull / unreal" fighting styles that are in the home version. If you are somehow disappointed in the home version, or you may have thought that this is “too much,” you can find a much more pleasant and direct Soul Calibur game in an arcade game. Do you think you have everything to become a legend?
