A sweet, entertaining story about a young 17.5-year-old boy controlled by a powerful religious mother and reticent father, and how he finds himself working with a retired, eccentric and tragic actress. Very well played, especially Julie Walters. Rupert Grint plays the role of a teenager well, showing that his talent will last longer than the Harry Potter series. Laura Linney plays her ruthlessly strict mother without a hint of redemption, so she has no place to like at all. But the film is very interesting, filmed by the British in the style of Keeping Mum and Calendar Girls.
