This film is a funny little detective story about not making them anymore. All this is: Tom Conway - a suave detective named Falcon, Goldie Locke (which is in the title) - his clumsy clumsy chum, Louise Braganza - a girl in distress, and, of course, there is a girl, a professor with a secret formula, a bad guy who wants a formula, and a police inspector who pursues Falcon. There is a murder, and Falcon is involved. The scenery is night clubs, expensive hotel rooms, a luxurious train, a suburb and beautiful cars. Go look at this little pearl, when you see how it passes by the afternoon television!
