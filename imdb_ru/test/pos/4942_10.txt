This game was one of the main reasons I got a PS2. I remember playing Soul Edge (sometimes called the Soul Blade) that day, and it hooked me. <br /> <br /> I played the original Soul Calibur, but I never had the opportunity to play a huge amount of it. of time. I, however, bought the Soul Calibur II version for the Gamecube, and this was what really attracted me to the series, and I was thrilled when I heard about Soul Calibur III. This game still gives us classic characters such as Mitsurugi, Cervantes, Nightmare and Taki. However, he also adds several new characters, such as Zasalamel, Tira and the unplayable Night Terror. (TRUE Tales of Souls boss) The Sword Chronicle mode based on strategy is a new feature that I really like, it can be quite complex in later chronicles, but it is a good addition to the series. <br /> <br /> In Soul Arena mode there are several missions in which you must fight a certain opponent in certain circumstances. (The exception is the “Final Battle”, in which you just have to defeat the “Night Terror”). This is another nice touch that makes the game even more exciting. <br /> <br /> In some scenes in “Fairy tales that you are”, press certain buttons to get a different result, this may be to dodge / block an attack or get a better ending. (Each character has two ends) In general, this is a great game, and I would recommend it if you are a fan of fighting games.
