This is a story about how three brothers came together in difficult conditions and lost and learned that family, love, trust and forgiveness are really important things in life. The entire cast is able to achieve powerful performance, despite several lousy one-lined. A great movie for fans of real life problems that plausible families face. Also worth looking for fans Dermot Mulroney or Sean Astin. They both do amazing work, often leading you to tears. Take my word and rent it today!
