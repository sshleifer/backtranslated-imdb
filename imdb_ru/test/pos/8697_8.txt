Absolute capture of the film, and given its age, was ahead of its time. I first saw it that week when my dad came home with a neighbor's TV, which the guy threw at the dump. Dad had everything electric, dad worked for two days. It was July 1955 ... and then probably only the third house on the street to have a television! Almost the first thing we saw on this grainy and shimmering old 12-inch screen was ETA film. “It's pretty old, dear,” recalls my mom, telling me about it. <br /> <br /> Almost 50 years have passed, and it seems that she is not older, but rather like World War I in this regard! A terrific little fantasy about a London omnibus carrying thirteen passengers, which falls, killing one of their number. Then, in the memoirs, we learn about the lives of these people and what made them find themselves on this bus that day. <br /> <br /> Returning to the catastrophe at the end of the film, the identity of the victim is revealed. Perhaps this inspired the 1960 film "LIST OF ADRIAN MESSENGER." <br /> <br /> If you ever meet this little gem, I advise you to watch it!
