Derived from characters previously developed in a series of highly regarded shorts, “Rabbit Rabbit Course” is about as far from the usual “family fare” as you can imagine: well thought out, with a witty dialogue and clever In essence, this is a film that like almost every family member. <br /> <br /> The story concerns Wallace and his dog Gromit, who live in a village obsessed with growing large vegetables for the annual fair and who run Anti-Pesto, a humane solution for all those pesky rabbits who torture passionate gardeners everywhere . Business is a big success, but Wallace is too smart for his own good. When he tries to “rehabilitate” rabbits from their vegetative methods, he unexpectedly releases the ancient horror of legendary proportions: a werewolf rabbit! And suddenly no vegetable in the city is safe! The film is full of crazy inventions, unexpectedly clever dialogues and references to everything: from KING-KONGA to HUMAN-WOLF - more than enough to seduce even a weary teenager - but the real charm of this thing lies in its characters. The magnitude of the personality that artists and animators can extract from pieces of clay is striking: they seem as alive as any actor from flesh and blood. The DVD release (and I recommend widescreen) also includes a number of informative and entertaining additions. Highly recommended! GFT, Amazon Reviewer
