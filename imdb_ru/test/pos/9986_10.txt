I am not a fan of golf in any way. On May 26, at about 10:30 pm, the film began at the end of the 1800s. I like old films, but not golf, however, in the first scene a young man (Harry Vardon) is awakened by men's voices. He goes outside to ask what they are doing, and he is told that they are going to build something for golf ... So, I turned off the TV, but something excited me and it turned on again. The film is great. Then we see that this young boy is now a man; a professional golfer who pursues visions from his childhood. Then we come across the true focus of the Francis film and the decisions it makes for golf. You meet his mother and father, who want to protect him from the cool things that are so obvious in that period. Then there is little Eddie Lowry, his buddy with encouraging words and little jolts that contribute to the victory of Francis. I do not want to give too much. I was up to 2 am This is great, please watch the movie.
