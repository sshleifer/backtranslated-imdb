Unlike many who posted here, I am not literate in movies. I accidentally stumbled upon this film (surfing through the channels) and could not put it down. This is truly an incredible film, worthy of all praise of critics and those who loaded it on this site. The actors are awesome. Tatiana is beautiful and innocent. Her fiance Boris is sweet and patriotic. You could not but feel the irritation and grief of Father Boris, when he reproached his son for such stupidity as the desire to serve in the Great War. <br /> <br /> Others summed up the film so well, so I Just mention a couple of the scenes that touched me the most. When Boris’s brother tells his family that he has broken trust with his brother and “must marry” Tatiana, Tatiana’s crooked mouth shows her aversion to this betrayal (although her role in infidelity could be raped). You are afraid that the rest of the film may correct this mistake by visiting just destruction for Tatiana and brother, or, even worse, will show that Tatiana is destroyed by an immoral fall in the decline of cigarette smoking. Since this is not a "French existential film", the latter does not occur. Luckily! <br /> <br /> Another scene that breaks your heart is when an unnamed soldier-musician, saved by Boris, returns to tell Boris's father about the death of his son. He involuntarily reports news to Tatiana. I cannot describe the grief of this scene ... Nevertheless, Tatiana finds a straw to grab it, and hopes that Boris will return home. In the end, the musician actually never saw Boris buried. <br /> <br /> I will not mention more scenes, but I want to note that the touch of Soviet political correctness does not detract from the film. Boris's brother is revealed as a pianist, playing an anti-Soviet slacker, what should someone be who steals his future wife. No doubt he will get at least ten at the end of the film! The final, when Tatiana finally finds out for certain that Boris is dead, still manages to finish cheerfully and full of hope for the future. You do not even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept the theater when the survivors of this war, referring to their own losses, saw this film for the first time. <br /> <br /> Incredible. Go look.
