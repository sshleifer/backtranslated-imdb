We went to see Manna from heaven, my husband, two friends, and I, and we all liked the movie. The characters are funny, the story is funny and very similar to real life. I think this is what I liked the most, just seeing something believable, no killing, no fiction, just good, pure fun. This is something that you could take with you your children or elderly parents and not worry. How many of them are more around !!
