Babs Johnson (Divine) lives in a trailer with her son Crackers, her daughter Cotton and her mother Edie (Edie Messi). She competes with a couple named Connie and Raymond Mrumbles (Mink Stoul, David Loughary) to be called the dirtiest man in the world. The film shows their attempts to outdo each other. <br /> <br /> This film is not for everyone. It is in your face that there is no forbidden attack of bad taste. Crackers have sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while his sister is watching; marbles collect women hitchhikers, saturate them, keep them in chains in the basement and sell children to lesbian couples; The Divine and the family have a party that includes cannibalism, etc. And so on. This is disgusting, but, in a sense, not observable. This is REAL and so shameless about it that it is a little fascinating. As director John Waters would say, this is a bad taste, made well. Itâ€™s also fun to watch - acting is so terrible (especially Messi) that you just look with disbelief. A friend laughed out loud at how bad Massey was (she improved in later photos). <br /> <br /> This is NOT for people who are easily offended. Even if he is over 30 years old, this is VERY shocking. However, if you have an open mind and you can behave extremely, you definitely need to see it. The only thing that really was too much is what the Divine is doing at the very end.
