This movie is just awesome. It's so fun. While skating and other installations are played out, the comedy itself is amazing. Raab and Brandon Dikamillo are funny. There will be times when you can't breathe, you laugh so hard. In addition, there are scenes that you can watch hundreds of times and still laugh. This is one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen.
