I didn't catch Gilmore Girls when he first came out, so I still had some guesswork in the first season. I read most user comments, and as for negative ones, I have to ask, what kind of show are you watching? <br /> <br /> This is a classic show, great lines, characters and good acting. And, best of all, itâ€™s NOT your standard formula for the show, always with a random turn in history. There are probably more women who see themselves reflected in the Lorelai / Emily relationship than the Lorelai / Rory relationship. People and storylines are not PCs, but they are real! <br /> <br /> If the dialogue annoys you, I advise you to tape it so that you can reconsider those parts that do not understand.
