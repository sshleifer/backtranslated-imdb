I did not read the book. and I don't care. the film was a wonderful romance, and I think women will enjoy it. No, it was not the movie "10", but it was nice. women, if your man is bored, like me, then see for yourself. It hurts remarkably, as a philosophical doctor who utters a thoughtful monologue on the theme of "in love" and "love." <br /> <br /> If you like Nick Cage, he was awesome and fun. I liked to watch the developing novel. <br /> <br /> Also, if you like Christian Bale - look at him in balance. This is a science fiction movie "10". <br /> <br /> watch this movie. ignore previous user comments. <br /> <br /> one - especially ladies !!
