Although in this film there is no darkness of books, in my opinion, this is a great film. This is great entertainment with a beautiful Stuart Townsend as Lestat. He may not have blond hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book, but, frankly, he would not look good with blond hair, and Lestat definitely wants to look good. He moves like a predator, which I always thought Lestat would be. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are pretty good, and the soundtrack is just awesome. This is not an Interview with the Vampire, so do not try to compare them. The interview is the story of Louis. This is a cut and paste version of Lestat. Anyway, I highly recommend.
