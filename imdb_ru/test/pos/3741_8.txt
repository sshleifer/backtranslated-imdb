NIGHTS IN RODAN return to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in just a beautiful story about a man and a woman who are hungry for something more in their life than they currently have. The chemistry between Lane and Gear is magical from the first scene in the film to their last hug. The places, the beauty of their attraction to each other, when they unfold, when they first meet, and the story that follows, and when they begin to recognize each other with the attraction that they feel towards each other, is real, it is a romance that is projected to the audience with tender care. James Franco in another micro role is just what you need, and Lane's elegance combined with the beach house is a real film of the fall of 2008 that needs to be remembered forever, as it was in the LAPTOP.
