I really like this film, I first saw it when I was working in a video store. when I went to buy it, they told me that it was out of print, and I could not order it, so I only today thought I would look. and then I found it, they released it in Spain on DVD called "Algo Mas Que Amigos", and you can buy it in English and Spanish on DVD .... hope this helps ..... I know how It's hard to find films that we like, but not released in the US market. good luck .. Oh, for more information there is one place to look .... http: //www.zonadvd.com I think it will cost $ 10 on eBay also.
