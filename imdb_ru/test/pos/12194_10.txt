I have seen this movie counting down the time now and still canâ€™t be fed up. It's like a drug. I know that many do not like it, but there is something in it that simply attracts me. Each performance is impressive, but Aaliyah is the one who steals the show. She not only played the role of Akasha, she became her. Her body movements and beauty were captured exceptionally well. It is also nice to see that the black girl was chosen for the role of the Egyptian queen (no, I'm not biased against white people, I'm alone). True, it is unknown what color the ancient Egyptians were, but it was a pleasant change. Stuart Townsend completely made me forget about the portrait of Tom Cruise about Lestat, and Margarita again struck. In general, it was a good time in the movie. For those who have not seen it, be sure to watch it with an open heart and do not take it too seriously. I mean, this is a movie about a vampire who becomes a rock star. Take it that way.
