This garbage version of Romeo and Juliet is being held in Manhattan these days. Romeo (Will Keenan) is a furious member of the Qu family, and Juliet (Jane Jensen) is a sexy (with beautiful legs and breasts) and a bisexual girl from the Capulets family. The scatological situations that this romantic couple will face are very funny. Being a cult film (inclusively shown at the festival in Rio de Janeiro), it is not recommended for all viewers. If the viewer is a fan of the former Peter Jackson films (Brainstorming, Bad Taste), Toxic Avenger, Melt Body, and other thrash films, he will surely enjoy this movie. Otherwise, he will hate it. Since I belong to the first group, my voice is eight. <br /> <br />
