In this unique film, the themes of the end of days and Satan against Jesus are dealt with in a new way. Jesus does not want to open the last two seals, and Satan is thwarted in his attempt to drive another soul to hell ... Armageddon, Armageddon and Jehoshaphat turn out to be company! hard to open. <br /> <br /> What is remembered in this film is the oblique image, defocused shots and lighting effects that are effective, but sometimes annoying. And, of course, Donovan is great as a disappointed Jesus, trying to come to terms with what the world and his people have become! So, look if you have the opportunity!
