Although I saw this film dubbed in French, so I am sure that it lost something in translation, lack of accents, etc. It was a great, fun movie for a lonely night in a hotel room - a real choice - exactly and positively portrayed the complexities of individual sexuality, gender role, and finding a place in the communities to which it should belong - male, gay, urban, 30-year-old, etc. I was very proud of French television to show such an honest and positive image of the gay community . Although the fact that a gay character behaves somewhat "straight", after all, is slightly disappointing, this is life, and this happens sometimes. This is a great movie, whether alone or with a date! Really enjoyable experience.
