I saw this movie at a special show. At first I thought the movie would look like a typical Amanda Bynes movie, but I was wrong. The film is based on Shakespeare's book "The Twelfth Night". This film tells the story of a girl who lives to play football. Well, when the women's team is reduced, it must go to great lengths to join the guys in another school to get revenge on the selfish team of guys in its old school. Along the way, she falls into a long tangled web of love, lies and deception. This film is the age of mean girls. I think he shows some great new acting skills, and there are challenging stars in this film.
