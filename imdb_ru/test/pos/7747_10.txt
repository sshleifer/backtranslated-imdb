I thought this movie was fun. I have never seen old movies before, and it was a really great first date movie. It was warm, heart and spirit. It was a bit silly, but in today's film industry it's cheesy cute. I gave him ten, and I highly recommend hiring, buying or watching a movie. Gene Kelly was very dreamy and a little sarcastic, and you knew that the character thought he would succeed. The female leadership was perfect because their two personalities had a spark, and you wanted to hold on and see what would happen. Grandma in the film was priceless. A great addition to the great old movie. I like the fact that he was black and white, and Gene Kelly is so cute with all the children in the film that you can't help but love him. See it.
