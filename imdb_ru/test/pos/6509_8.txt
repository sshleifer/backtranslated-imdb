-That's the whole soundtrack for this movie. I just saw this kid at the Munich Film Festival, and he shook the house. Director Doug Pray was never seen in this documentary, and I think that he was not even heard, but he very carefully studied the life and history of the “mixer”. He smashed his film into eight chapters, and then his motley group of enthusiastic interviews will be split everywhere according to what they are talking about. I have never been keen on scratches, but the film does an excellent job of keeping the elementary for those who know little and pouring in jokes for those who are experts in this field. Mix Master Mike from Beastie Boys is in this film, but only after the film I could name a few strong players in the industry (DJ Shadow, Q-Bert, etc.). The extraordinary charm of these players from these talented and bizarre DJs is manifested in their explanations of what their music means to them. The film also sheds some encouraging light on these guys (and one woman), which can be categorized as musicians. Prayer does not allow its film to remain inactive, and if there is a slow scene, it soon becomes charged with hardly ever ending music. If nothing else, this film will increase your slang vocabulary. I have to go back to “digging,” so I’ll finish this review. Look, it will be interesting. Good stuff man. A good thing.
