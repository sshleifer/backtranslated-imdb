Looks like an Anglo-Irishman, I assure you, this reviewer is not biased at all. But I assure you that this is a very Irish film, and not English, as it seems from the last comment. This film was written by Neil Jorden and Conor MacPherson, and the director, Conor MacPherson, is both Irish. Cast almost entirely Irish - he was shot dead in Ireland with an Irish team. Even Michael Gambon was born in Ireland - I remember how he joked about it in an interview about this film. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine was obviously brought in to raise box office abroad. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, I just wanted to fix a completely ignorant comment! <br /> <br /> Now with a review - I loved Dylan Moran, he was always a fan, Michael Kane himself formed a surprisingly good double act. It was great to see Morans as an actor, as he plays several different made-up characters during the film. I would recommend this film to anyone interested in comedy - as it represents a fresh, bizarre and inventive twist on Irish feature films. I laughed a lot. What more can you ask for?
