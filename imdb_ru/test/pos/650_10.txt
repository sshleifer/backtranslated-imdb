A beautiful film ahead of its time, <br /> <br /> I think so, In the eighties, everything was about victory, Greed - is that good? Remember this? I saw this movie more than 20 times. For me, this is a real film about a desert island, I keep on watching, because there is always something else to learn about these evil characters that I just love, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronin are wonderful. Besides, Beverly D'Angelo, " Beau Bridges "come out in the blink of an eye, don't get me wrong, there are still many great performances in this film, and it also, as it is written, made it for me, and I hope, you, the film that you will want to watch again and again, I think television shows such as Northern Impact, and Now “Earl” owes much to this film. But remember, this is not a Tom Cruise movie.
