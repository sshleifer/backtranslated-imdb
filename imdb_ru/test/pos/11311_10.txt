Julia Brown cheerfully ruins Madonna's attempt to create a rock composition with stunning humor and truly original and memorable songs that compete with Madonna's own. Cinematography and scenery at the highest level. <br /> <br /> Kathy Griffin and Chris Elliott offer their own comedies that enhance and complement this film. The appearances of Bobcat Goldthwait and Wink Martindale, as such, are an added bonus. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to say whether Brown’s speech is intended to insult or playfully tease Madonna, although I hardly think that Material Girl will find humor in him. <br /> <br /> My favorite line is: “Why don't you come here (to the Philippines); all they eat is a dog, and I am a vegetarian. ”
