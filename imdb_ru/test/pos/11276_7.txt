not quite sure what to do with this movie. very strange, very pretentious, not the film that you watch, because it has a convincing plot or characters. more like a movie that you canâ€™t stop watching because of the terribly exciting things happening on the screen. although, for the first time when my wife watched this, she could not go all the way ... too anxious for her to work a little long, but still worth a look for those interested in very dark movies.
