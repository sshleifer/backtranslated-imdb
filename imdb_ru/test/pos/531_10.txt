I just got back from watching this awesome movie! I have so much to do with it ... It reminded me that when my sister had to go to college, we had to move from place to place, and my mother behaves like Adel August! Boys may not like this film because it causes tears in their eyes. One of the best real movies I've ever seen !! and Natalie Portman rules !! 10/10
