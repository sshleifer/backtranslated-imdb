My children, DD 7 and DS 10, enjoyed the film so much that they wriggled in their places. It was good, old fashioned, Rated G, family fun. This film was made for children .... someone really understands them. <br /> <br /> It was funny to see Julia Roberts, Bryce Willis, Garth Brooks and other stars who appeared in the cameo. <br /> As a person who lives in the city, on the model of the fictional "Big Texas" I can say that he made an honest and accurate image. Children were like children, not superstars. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone will support this film in order to send a message to Hollywood that we need more such films. Go look, and then spread the word!
