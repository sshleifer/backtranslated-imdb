I grew up in New York, and every night ABC showed the movie at 4:30 am - Saratoga Trunk was one of the first films I remember when I watched as a child. I liked this movie and it stays with me for many years. I recently watched it again and still thought it was great - maybe I was just a romantic - but I thought it was well done. I don’t want to say that this film was good only because of the main actors - I really didn’t know who they were when I first saw this film - I think I just knew how to play well in childhood. Both Bergman and Cooper were excellent. I especially enjoyed seeing old New Orleans during the period of this film. If you ever have the opportunity to visit New Orleans - you should watch movies that show the city during this period of time - when you see some of the old houses in the French Quarter (not just on Bourbon Street) or in the upper part of the city, you you can truly imagine life as it was 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I love old movies - for me this is a good movie!
