I find this film exciting, but deceptive, because it seems so simple and clear: a Vietnam survivor tells a heartbreaking story, and part of the story is recreated on the spot. Reviewers sometimes even claim that Herzog’s presence in the film is minimal, but how wrong they are. We know that all documentaries are to some extent “mediated,” and this film covers Herzog’s slender hand, especially in stunning music, an incredibly expert choice of archival materials and managing cascading images. The defiant power of this film is astounding, starting with its title, the introductory title card from the book “Revelation” and the initial dubbing. This is a film that can be watched repeatedly with growing surprise, rather than a simple product, which is swallowed by a favorite drink on the way to the evening news. This is one of those films that can resonate with you for life.
