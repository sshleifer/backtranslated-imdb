I really love this show !!!!!!!, basically this is an improved version of The Simpsons from Fox (so let's face it: â€œThe Simpsons are very dry if you are over 9 years old). They are political, irrational and irresistible. Anyone who says that they do not like, that he lies, everyone has his own character. Peter, Stewie, and Quagmire are my favorites. Peter, because he is rude, disgusting and just gives no shit. Stewie, because of his amazing intelligence and how he amazes you with something that an adult will say when you least expect it. And the swamp, because one of the guilty pleasures is dirty jokes. There is also an episode for everyone too. If you are a political type, then Mr. Griffin is going to Washington (Vol. 2, SEASON 3). If you prefer sexual and bodily humor, emission is impossible (Volume 2, SEASON 3). (VOLUME 1 SEASON2). I basically say that when you watch this show, everyone has a sense of humor that separates the parties. GIGGITY GIGGITY GOOOOO!
