The success of SCREAM spawned a new wave of horror. I am pleased with this as a big fan of horror, and I liked most of these new horror films. BOC - one big pack of horror. Colorful, fast and original. I see this film more like the discovery of a new trilogy (very much like Episode 1 and “Aliens: Resurrection”), as he comes up with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the relationship of the little doll boy-killer, we have a twisted film about couples. We have cute young lovers, unlike killer-sized crazy lovers. Very ingenious!
