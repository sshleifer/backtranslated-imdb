I wonder if the loss of the ability to speak clearly was the first on the road to disaster? <br /> <br /> John Romer deserves not only his excellent work, but also his joyful enthusiasm for the topic that is most refreshing. <br /> <br /> Not recommended for Americans who love political correctness.
