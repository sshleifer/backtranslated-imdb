This is such a revered and studied film, a classic among Hitchcock's many, and you don’t have to persuade him to watch it again. Nevertheless, you think: can it withstand it even when a huge (and clever and amazing) plot trick is not surprising? <br /> <br /> Yes. <br /> <br /> And for a start there is a beginning, deeply beautiful and smooth, telling about the whole story, its essence. Two taxis, two men are shown with their shoes, each goes to the train, then sits opposite each other, and, oops, a mistake, a little push, and the conversation begins, and we see the men themselves. They are interchangeable. <br /> <br /> The tone here is characteristic of Hitchcock, as in many horror and obscurity films - funny and bright. However, we know that this is not the case in the film, therefore we are already concerned. What, after all, can go wrong? <br /> <br /> A lot. Truly, Hitchcock is a completely innocent person (almost always a man) who faces injustice, being trapped in circumstances that threaten what is most valuable to him. The innocent tennis player Guy Haynes in this case is played with innocence, which is believable - his student courtesy in this first scene, for example, because he understands that the other person is a little cuckoo, this is what you or I could do. A not so innocent person is a self-confident and frighteningly intelligent spoiled child, Bruno Anthony, whom Robert Walker plays with absolute brilliance. (This supernatural performance is equivalent to the performance of another Hitchcock fool, played by Anthony Perkins in the movie “Psycho.”) So, from the first scene, on the train (and on the train, really great!), We have two leads, and we have reason. stunning and completely simple and ultimately destructive plot, from the first novel by Patricia Highsmith, who also wrote books after Mr. Ripley’s two films. And it doesn't hurt that the script was written in collaboration with Raymond Chandler himself, who knows something about economics and smart dialogue. And a crime. <br /> <br /> And of course, this is not only the first scene. What to note? It's good that the clever daughter of the senator (I thought she was awesome) is Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, who is still with us (as of 2009; she also had a role in Psycho). And there is a characteristic attraction for the key scene in the film - the tennis courts in the Hamptons, known to us as the US website Open. The fantastic last full scene with the carousel is the only place where Hitchcock moves in a kind of slow and steady installation, creating tension, making it surreal. Fear becomes positive from the laughter of children, and the old man crawls under it all. And when he falls into accidents - all of this is projected back onto the set, one of the most naturalistic uses of the director, known for not worrying about the realism of his back projections. <br /> <br /> Photography is the perfect solution. Hollywood is awesome, not becoming so stylized (as in some noir films) that he is an object in itself. Look again at the first scene or at the shooting (and editing) of Haynes, entering the house, for what the audience considers a murder. This is a complex structure. When we are not completely surprised that it is Bruno in bed, this only proves that the director keeps us in good shape. Something unexpected is always expected. <br /> <br /> Are there any glitches? Who knows? It depends on what kind of lie you can accept (or accept) as a beautiful style. The scene where Bruno is strangling the old woman at the party is gorgeous (the woman played by Norma Warden, the caricature is so believable that it is breathtaking) and is clouded by the fact that he looks at the senator’s daughter and turns into a deadly trance with her glasses and her resemblance to his former victim. This is the idea of ​​the psychology of the mid-20th century, which invades Hitchcock's many efforts. (The end of “Psycho”, for a start.) <br /> <br /> The Wikipedia movie article skillfully emphasizes the consistent doubling of things in the film - from the main characters to the murder victim and the senator’s daughter. It echoes many little things: two men lead him to a tennis court, two accompany the victim to an amusement park, and so on. Too much can be done from this, but it provides an aesthetic consistency above and below our consciousness. Do not forget that two murders must be committed - it is the absence of the second murder, the inability to create a doubling in this case leads Bruno to a clue. <br /> <br /> Walker actor He had emotional problems, and he was legalized a year before this film was shot, and right after that he died from a drug reaction, used to calm one of his outbreaks. Although he appeared in other films, “Strangers in the train” easily become his tourist power. Farley Granger had a long career in which he had never seen real glory, although his style may have a special nervous sweetness that really works, especially in “They live at night”. <br /> <br /> And if you watch it for the first or third time, look for a frightening and funny scene in a tennis match where all the heads of the crowd move back and forth in unison - with the exception of Bruno. He looks, not moving his head directly at us. As they say in the movie trailer, after this film you will not talk to “strangers on the train.”
