It was a very accurate picture of the life of Lewis in the mid-50s. The dialogue on theology and banter with his followers was exceptionally good. In Michael White’s book “K.S. Lewis: Creator of Narnia ”this time frame is considered very parallel. Joss Ackland's acting was excellent at catching the unemotional Lewis. The film tried very hard to present in the exact English setting. It was nice to watch the development of a strong bond between Jack (his favorite name) Lewis and Douglas Gresham, son of Joy from her previous marriage. The film escaped the unpleasant element of Lewis' s "Warnie" drinking problem (older brother Jack), but this would not reflect on the history, so it’s better not to take it into account.
