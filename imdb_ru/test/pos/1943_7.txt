I was flipping through the channels and had to stop and laugh when I came across this movie. It was so obvious about teenagers in the early 80s, and I called my mother "hahaha, turn to show this and that, the child looks like my father was a child." Yeah. It turns out that this film is about my father and his friends. <br /> <br /> Even though it is based on my fatherâ€™s childhood, I would say, watch this movie! <br /> <br /> It's just ..... strange, to say the least, apathy was grafted on adolescents even then. This is a good "human interest" and demonstrates some strange aspects of the psyche.
