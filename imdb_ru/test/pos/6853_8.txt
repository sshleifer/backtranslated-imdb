(spoilers?) <br /> <br /> I heard some complaints about the special effects. But it should distract from the film. A movie is a waiting movie. And this is very good. So from this point of view, this movie is awesome. Franke is swinging. Enjoy your plastic heart. So no complaints about this movie. If you do not see English dub, which is a complete farce. This creates the illusion that this is the movie "B". <br /> <br /> One of the complaints I have is a music video on DVD. It does not say who sings it. I'd like to know. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Repeat: 5/10
