The influence of other sci-fi and thriller films and stories is evident throughout the film. The films that immediately come to mind include “Aliens”, “Aliens” and “Star Troopers”. The story itself is fairly straightforward, and not all is an original journey into hibernation in space, an emergency landing on a planet without visible life, and an “abandoned” geological expedition - except when the lights go out, forcing different types of people to work together, mutual survival, while while the amount of body is growing. This kind of movie always tends to be fun, as long as it's done well. I believe that Black resin was made well. The characters are interesting, and you want to know more about them, the longer the film lasts, and I think people will be surprised by who does it and who doesn't. <br /> <br /> Vin Diesel plays Riddick, a condemned offender with a suicidal past, physical prowess, a high tolerance for pain, and comfortably seeing in the dark. You know that he will eventually do the right thing at some point in the film, because throughout the film he is hinted that he may actually have a conscience in things. <br /> <br /> Cole House plays the addict bounty hunter, who is probably in many ways a really bad guy compared to Riddick, as his character is evident throughout the film. Most likely, he is the most courageous when the chances and firepower are in his favor. A very mercenary character who eventually gets what he deserves. <br /> <br /> Radha Mitchell plays the co-pilot on the doomed ship, which vomited out of deep sleep, because the ship passed through a swarm of meteors. or tail comment. Having found the dead pilot in his bedroom, she is trying to land the ship, which leads to our discovery of a potentially fatal character flaw - the fear of responsibility, responsibility and being a leader. Her character in the short span of history probably grows the most, because she actually acquires some conviction, takes responsibility and does not sit idle, expecting her to be devoured by the nightly pursuing aliens. In some strange way, she associates with Riddick's eternal human side, which, in turn, ultimately respects her for choosing and for adhering to them. <br /> <br /> The story in some cases sounds like you expect it, but I think you'll be slightly surprised at the characters that will endure this painful experience. This film is an interesting train wreck in a train wreck to watch. Go look! <br /> <br />
