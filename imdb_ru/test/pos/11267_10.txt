I had the pleasure of seeing Saltimbanco live before watching the video version of the show. Although nothing compares to the actual presence, the people behind the video did an amazing job capturing the taste, sensations, sensations and more. The wonderful performances of the amazingly amazing Saltimbanko troupe are perfectly captured everywhere. The video is as smooth and clever as the production itself. Wonderful experience.
