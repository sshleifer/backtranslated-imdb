Like all the earliest films, this “film” is very, very short - it lasts about a minute! Thus, because of its brevity, it is in fact impossible to compare it with more modern films. But for its time, this is truly a wonderful film. This is largely due to the fact that the engravings were painted by hand, so Annabelle looked red and other colors when she performs her amazing dance. I actually saw two different versions - one where it is red and the other where it changes color everywhere. I think the red pictured on the Great Train Robbery and Other Major Works DVD is the best of them. The dance itself is very hypnotic and very similar to a work of art. And, unlike other minute (or less) films of the day, I often saw this film - it is just visually irresistible and strange. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch it online, the 36-second version in Google Video (enter "snake dance").
