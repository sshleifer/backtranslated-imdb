Writing about something so beautiful is completely difficult. In fact, to describe the features of this film is almost impossible. It’s an amazing story about sex and gender, and it’s almost unbelievable that we don’t have to deal with obscene sex scenes. Feeling, this film was created for people who love to feel and just feel life in all its complexity in a magnificent simple way. We look at it, and something begins to grow in our minds, even in our hearts: it is a pure poem. I watched some “gay” films, and I almost always got really unsatisfied with unnecessary sex scenes, not because I dislike the sex scene, but in general they are so pornographic that I have to think that the director or the producers or The author of the script believe that homosexuality means a perversion. Nagisa no Shindobaddo is completely different from these. Three main characters. We have Ito, Yoshida and Aihara, two boys and a girl in a special love triangle. Ito loves his best friend Yoshida, Yoshida loves Ayhara, and Aykhara loves Ito. Can you imagine that this could turn into untrained hands? But, on the contrary, Khashiguchi makes a magnificent story that fits deeply into the philosophy of life, adding a question in our mind that made me wonder at the end of the film: why? And so it expanded in many ways within my brain and within my heart. The scenes, which in fact sometimes tend to be boring, are moments of the most delightful poem that we can feel, but we cannot write at all with words. And perhaps because of this we cannot understand the question at the end of the film. I'm sure this movie was not made for us to discuss every part of it ?? Some people want to understand the film, almost dissecting it. Others are so accustomed to the usual "American gay" films that they cannot appreciate the real value of this masterpiece. Look, close your eyes in the credits and feel everything, feel yourself, feel a wonderful song. For all this and much, much more, I give nine. And I just don’t give ten, because ten out of ten is perfection. But I confess, I almost did it.
