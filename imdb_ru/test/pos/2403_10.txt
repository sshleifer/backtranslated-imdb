“The Next Child of Karate” is an outstanding film full of adventure and new surprises. He has a wonderful plot and moral, which tells a wonderful story. Hilary Swank does an incredible job of achieving the role of Julia. I have seen the actor who plays Mr. Midi, and this, in my opinion, is one of his best performances. The film is funny and charming, and I can not stress how interesting it is. I definitely gave this movie 10 out of 10. I offer the movie to anyone who loves a good movie.
