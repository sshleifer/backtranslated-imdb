Lyric Bobbycrush Cam Archer boldly reflects the disorienting kaleidoscope, which is a teenager's wish, with a lush rendering (beautifully photographed by Aaron Platt) that sounds more than it tells. Somewhere between a documentary and a dream, Bobbikrash recalls the ingenuity of early Todd Haynes and the vivid hyperrealism of Gus van Sant. With a grain of sand, glamor and heartbreaking, it’s like the movie “Sonic Youth” playing pop bubble song.
