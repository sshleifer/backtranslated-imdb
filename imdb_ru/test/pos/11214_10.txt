Uzak (2002), a Turkish film shown in the US as “Distant”, <br /> <br /> was shot, shot, shot and shot by Nuri Bilge. <br /> <br /> Ceylan <Br /> <br /> This film is a dark and gloomy version of the clash between Mahmut’s “urban mouse”, played by Muzaffer Ozdemir, and Yusuf’s “village mouse”, played by Emin Toprak. <br /> <br /> Both men are excellent actors, and the plot allows them to demonstrate their acting skills. (Unfortunately, Emin Toprak died in a car accident shortly after the film was completed.) <br /> <br /> In most tales of the country's cousins ​​and cousins, the contrast between rural and urban lifestyle is depicted with humor. In this film, little humor or even warmth. Both men <br /> <br /> have lost touch with human society. Mahmut’s job as a commercial photographer for a tile company does not bring him satisfaction. He divorced a woman whom he clearly still loves <br /> <br />, and he does not have a satisfactory human relationship. <br /> <br /> Mahmut lost his job because of the closure of a factory in his small town and he didn’t have enough skills or energy to find work in the city. His human interactions are mainly reduced to the silent observations of other people who cross his path. He is clearly a warm and caring person, but he cannot express these qualities in an urban environment. <br /> <br /> The cousins ​​have a bad attitude towards the world and do not relate very well to each other. None of them make efforts to act in such a way as to ensure the possibility of rapprochement or rapprochement. <br /> <br /> In a sense, this film represents a lost opportunity. <br /> <br /> Perhaps each cousin could provide at least a part of what was missing in the life of another. Instead, they run parallel miserable courses. These two are far from each other, as follows from the name of the film. <br /> <br /> One of my friends mentioned the skill with which Ceylan builds the details on the details. These details ultimately tell us more about the characters than we could learn from a simple exposure. <br /> <br /> Uzak was shown in the series The Labor Film about Rochester. This is not a “work film” in the traditional sense of this genre. This is a work film, because it demonstrates the harmful effects of poor work (Mahmut) and unemployment (Yusuf). <br /> <br /> This is a quiet, fascinating, dark film. Although it does not bring joy from viewing, I left the theater <br /> <br /> and realized that I had seen a truly creative and important film. This film is worth finding and watching!
