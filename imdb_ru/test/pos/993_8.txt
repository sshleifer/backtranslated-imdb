I did not expect to enjoy it. in truth, I watched it because a friend knew that a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but was not credited. knowing Dylan Thomas and really appreciating his poetry, but knowing and rather embarrassed by this man, I did not feel that I needed to see your adaptation of his lame bohemian life exposed. and that was not the case. critical and yet grateful it was. it makes me cry. Keira Knightley was gorgeous, even with this slightly stretched Welsh accent, and this is a sad story they tell. Dylan Thomas is not a hero, as, unfortunately, he has not been throughout his life, and in fact this is not the so-called "furious woman" pr-ra. This is Killian William from the movie. the man who leaves the woman he loves, to wage a war that they ignore. his task to reunite with this indifference is what really interests this film and what a wonderful presentation of this actor. I think this film is undervalued because it was sold so badly. Fans of Dylan Thomas will expect something more from their very spoiled hero and get less, and thatâ€™s how it was sold. This is not a film about Dylan Thomas, and for him it is much more interesting.
