One word for this. Fun. I have not watched such films for a long time. In some moments of the film I completely forgot that it was a film, I just felt that I was watching Viva La Bam again or even watching, say, my own friend is going through something similar. It was realistic, and I liked how Bam, Ryan, Raab, Rake, Brandon, and the rest of the guys didnâ€™t really try too hard. They, for me, just behaved like their famous idiots. There were several scenes that I adored more than others, like Raab in my heart, saint, I was laughing like that. To be honest, he was probably my favorite character, except for Bam. He really, in my opinion, made the film a little more fun. This is basically a must see for fans of the CKY team:]
