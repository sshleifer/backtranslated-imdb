I saw various Hamlets, and I taught the play. Watching Jacobi, I feel like thinking that he is as smart as Hamlet himself, he is so alive to feel all the nuances of this character. He deepens and does not solve every riddle concerning the character of Hamlet. He illuminates line by line, word by word, illuminating this sparkling mind. At the same time, however, we are squeezing the horror that Hamlet feels when betraying - much more than with any other actor - because Jacobi feels pain deeper than anyone else. And we shudder at Hamlet's own betrayals, because Jacobi is not afraid of the meanness with which Hamlet can come down. In short, Jacobi gives us Hamlet in full, and Hamlet in full is the greatest character in literature. That is why I am satisfied that Jacobi’s “Hamlet” is the best performance I have seen at the actor.
