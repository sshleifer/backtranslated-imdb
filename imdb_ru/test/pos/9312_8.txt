The first time I saw this film, he flew between Guangzhou, China and Los Angeles. It was a real horn, and the trip went with much less discomfort than the usual 10-hour flight. I tried unsuccessfully to find a copy of it, until I found it for sale on eBay. Having watched it twice, I recommend it as good fun. My only real criticism is that the choice of English translation words for subtitles does not meet the standards, even by normal standards. In addition, the subtitles little by little, too often fit into the film and often travel too fast to be read well.
