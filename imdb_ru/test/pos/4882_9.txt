Finally!!! Good movie, filmed on the craziest serial killer in history. For those less familiar with Ed Hein, he was mostly crazy, who was known for robbing graves and taking off the skin of his victims (which most horror fans had ripped off). Filmed in the style of the era, which perfectly reflects the bleak plains of Wisconsin, this is by far the most atmospheric horror film, which depicts Hein and his terrible murder. Kane Hodder (Jason from Friday the 13th series) and Michael Berryman (Hills have Eyes I & II) demonstrate amazing views on this serial killer opus, which Gein easily leaves behind. So far, I would say that this is one of the best horror films released this year (Turistas = 0).
