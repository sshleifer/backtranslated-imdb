Nothing is sacred. Just ask Ernie Fosselius. Nowadays, everyone has a video camera, and the film is unlikely to come out before the parodies start flying, they will quickly write and remove it, and often upload it directly to the Internet. The meanness is hot these days, and we try our best to keep filmmakers from their very own importance. 25 years ago, when the first Star Wars were made, it was a different world. Filmmaking was a platform for the elect, and the parody was very rare. Then God gave us the hardware wars. It was taken down to look cheap (or was it just cheap?), And the audio was obviously recorded after the fact. Does it take away from experience? DAMMIT NO! That's what makes it so wonderful! He was raw and flawless and ruthlessly hit some of the pretentious moments of the original film. From Fluke Starbucker, waving around a flashlight instead of a lightsaber (I did it when I was young!) as any of the real Star Wars films. Rent it. Buy it. Borrow from a friend. And let Fars be with you. Is always.
