Gregory Peck and Gig Young compete for the same girl, and after Peck sends Young with a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck performs the almost impossible task of defending the fort, where the Indians outnumber them. Peck chooses the soldiers for this mission, whom he considers the scum of the earth, and the actors who play these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Cheney, Jr., Neville Brand and others, are excellent. The script is taken from the novel by Charles Marquis Warren, a Westerner, writer, director and producer. The idea of ​​using this type of people as heroes inspired many films that came out later, including The Dirty Dozen, which was shot in 1967.
