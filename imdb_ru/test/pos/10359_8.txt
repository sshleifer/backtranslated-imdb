This is a slightly uneven entrance with one sequence of prominent people, including a brigade behind a hill, reminiscent of a diner that once - thirty years ago - was their shelter; one Hu-Hum duolog between two aging rock music; The Nurish abduction turned upside down and the opening episode (plus the epilogue) involving the robbery of the artist, copycat Edward Baer and the current “hot” property of Anna Magloulis, which has its own moments. Not a single film in which Jean Rochefort appears can be thrown off lightly, and here he shines as one of the quintets behind the hill, indeed, the movie is worth seeing only for Rochefort, but there is something to offer in each episode and it is definitely worth seeing ,
