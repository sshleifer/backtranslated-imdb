William Wellmann, who shot one of the most exciting silent films ever made, Wings (1927), returns to the sky with another amazing story about flying brave devils. Wellmann was an air ace in World War I, and no one knew biplanes like he did. Here they are, flying with tricks, rumbling, exploding in the air and everything you can think about, as well as a fascinating glimpse of commercial air operations in 1932. And there is a good strong story, excellently played by the gloomy Richard Barthelmess (the dumb star who made several films with D. V. Griffith), Sally Eilers and Tom Brown. Eilers is a real sisler. What a relief to see a real woman with real fire and character instead of one of the Botox dummies with photos who play movies in modern Hollywood and everyone looks the same. The story is sad, with genuine pathos and well-directed. By the end of the film, there are several extremely exciting scenes of danger and rescue, and what should be the most inventive blind landing in the thick fog that has ever been thought of. I do not dare to give ingenious aspects of this particular episode. The character played by Bartelmess is very similar to Wellman himself, a truly wild rider in the air. Anyone who loves early aviation will love this film, and it will be very useful for everyone who loves good fun entertainment, love, tears and nonstop action, taken together as a delicious Wellmann omelet.
