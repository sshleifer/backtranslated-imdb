Long trailer? whoever said this should joke. this should be one of the deepest backstage or creating a documentary film ever made. How can this be a trailer when a few minutes tell viewers how the film was conceptualized and then presented in the studio? This documentary also talks a lot and a lot of time about how tricks were performed and new technologies were created to achieve them. He then shows us how the Wu Ping team came up with battle scenes along with block tapes, which pretty much disgraced the actual scenes with the actors. there are mentions of a reloaded matrix, but in fact there is nothing. if you are a real fan of the matrix, you should see this documentary. The original DVD documentary is good, but incomplete compared to this. for example, it never explained why in the original documentary film Keanu wore a neck brace, but this is explained in Revisited. The revised DVD also shows that Carrie Ann Moss sprained her ankle during the scene in the lobby and was very upset because she thought she was letting the team down. and this is just the tip of the iceberg. so ignore this “just a long trailer” review and see for yourself. You will not regret it. random matrix fans should not be used ...
