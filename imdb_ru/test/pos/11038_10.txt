There were some very good shows in this Popeye cartoon from World War II, and it is clearly above average for its genre. It was also well drawn, with some large angles, good detail and ... well, lots of interesting sights. <br /> <br /> What this means is that Popeye went out to sea in his little boat and ran by chance. in a small Japanese boat with two guys on it. (By the way, why were the "Japs" always depicted wearing large round glasses and with teeth?). <br /> <br /> In any case, these seemingly innocent Japanese sailors want Papay to sign a peace treaty. Oh, boy, the gullible Papay thinks, "wait until the admiral sees this!" In one of those wonderful paintings that I mentioned above, we slowly see how this little Japanese ship is in fact a great destroyer ... and Get into the deep ... water! “Why, you cross the Ja-pansies twice!” Shouts our sailor. <br /> <br /> It’s interesting to watch how he gets out of this situation.
