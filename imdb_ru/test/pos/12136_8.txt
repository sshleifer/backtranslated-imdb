<br /> <br /> A very good 1970s film about Mafia operations in New Jersey. When the gangster "crazy" does not play by the neighborhood rules, sooner or later it is time for an exception. <br /> <br /> Joe Sands was loyal to his character - sleek and cheerful. He only recovers with age. His face and today's glory should not have been used on the cover of a DVD for the sale of this class B film, as he was only the third star with the announced score. <br /> <br /> Dated 1970s shirts with wide lapels and low-quality background music are distracting. Nice to see the big cars of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> However, acting is good. <br /> <br /> The nudity from Ann Jones was not necessary to make this crowd story work. And it does not appear in the database, as each is shot again in any film, except this one. Very bad; she did a good job! <br /> <br /> Moral of the story: do not be discouraged because of your "Don". <br /> <br /> If you want to see something else, when you wake up in the middle of the night, then watch this DVD. He was part of a special film, Three Movies on One, worth $ 5.88 at a local discount store. <br /> <br />
