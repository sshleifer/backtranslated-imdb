This DVD will be taken with indifference by millions of fans of classical rock music around the world, because Rush is simply not cool. It is a pity that Rush had to overcome the mocking contempt of most North American and British music journalists for his thirty-year history, because it deprived many people of the opportunity to get into this group. Each of the past four decades is well represented here, and what is this catalog of songs! We have the original “2112”, the magical “The Trees” and the lyrical “Tom Sawyer”, interspersed with energetic, challenging genre pieces from their latest album “Vapor Trails”. The musicality is almost flawless, the stage show is spectacular, and the Brazilian fans are just crazy (at some point they sing along with the instrumental!). Each member of the group plays at a level that challenges real masters performing art. If in doubt, try the instrumental "La Villa Strangiato" or "The Rhythm Method" for size - and yes, the latter is a drum solo (what you need to see to be believed.) <br /> <br /> Sound and vision production as high as the Rush experience, and you also get documentary and polygonal downloads. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing performance and a tribute to Canadian rockers and all serious fans of classic rock. have a copy
