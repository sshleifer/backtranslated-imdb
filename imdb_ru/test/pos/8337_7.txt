... Our grandfather hour. <br /> <br /> More than gangsters, this is a detailed description of the American family around 1930: a father proud of his work who worries about his son who left high school, a mother everyone would like to have, a daughter who forgets dinner on the hands, and the twins, who are very loving ("Do not sleep first, please!"). <br /> <br /> And there is a grandfather who plays the Yankee scribble on his flute. Have you noticed that this melody plays the same role as “Door Day” of “Que Sera Sera” in “The Man Who Knew Too Much” by Hitchcock (1956)? Finally, the bravest man in the family. So he doesn't even tell you about his age, but he is proud of his country and opposes the hated blackmail of the gangster. <br /> <br /> Good movie Wellman.
