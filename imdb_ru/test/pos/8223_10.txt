Bill Irving’s Regard of Flight and The Clown Bagatelles are some of the funniest (in terms of physical comedy, verbal and visual jokes) performances I've ever seen. My father recorded it on tape when it first aired in the 80s, and since then my family likes it. We quote this back and forth quite consistently. It is a pity that copies are not always available for purchase. I have a bad copy of VHS, which I purchased from a specialized distributor a few years ago, but the performance of Mr. Irwin deserves proper handling of the DVD with the restored version of the original performance and interviews with performers / producers, as well as many examples of modern clown. <br /> <br /> Bill Irving's talent deserves more attention from a wider audience than it did in his limited speeches. I often share the “Flight Rules” with friends, and although I am always met with a little skepticism when I mention that it is a mixture of clownery and vaudeville, I have yet to have someone go to see him without loving him. , In case the credentials that will ever occur in this IMDb list, please consider publishing this and other works of Bill Irwin.
