Could this be one of the earliest color films? This is actually the second. This is a very beautiful piece of film created by Thomas Edison. It was one of his many other films. <br /> <br /> I think this is the most beautiful movie from Thomas Edison films. It depicts a girl dancing and moving her dress, which blushes from the film. This is just great. <br /> <br /> You watch the story when you watch it. You see what has become to make the movies of the day gorgeous! It may not have a plot or something very interesting, but this is the second color film in the history. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone, especially if you are teaching students how to shoot or something like that. You have to show them that you started color films!
