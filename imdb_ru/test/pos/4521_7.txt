This film is about the deadly poison that is contained in the little glass balls used for the kill. Apparently, this is done in order to hide the spy ring, intending to steal plans for the new American bomber. Now most of this story has been repeated in Chan's other films, Jade Mask and Docks of New Orleans. In addition, it was first used in MR. WRONG, DETECTIVE - everyone had exploding glass balls - an element of the plot that was obviously over-used. In Murder Over New York was interesting, but in these later films it was pretty fleeting. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the rest of the film was fresh, and the plot was very successful - with a clever conclusion, where, of course, the culprit reveals himself. However, no aircraft could fly like this one - especially in 1940. Such extreme dives and quick ascents were pretty stupid from this already outdated aircraft. <br /> <br /> By the way, in the small role of the doorman, you will see Frank Coglan Jr. - the same actor who played Billy Batson in the TV series CAPTAIN MARVEL. According to IMDb, Mr. Caflan is 93 years old, and he left the film industry.
