The idiocracy felt that Mike Judge took my thoughts on society and captured them in the movies. In fact, the film is a social commentary. At times it seems almost a documentary. Luke Wilson did a great job playing the boring middle Joe (as in most of his films). <br /> <br /> Of course, idiocracy was the extreme of the current state of society. But this is what makes most comedies ridiculous, extreme in any situation. Fiction is not much different from reality. <br /> <br /> Children praise the hip-hop materialistic culture and are proud to not know. When people feel useless in life, they multiply. Giving them a goal in the world. And it seems that only the worst people breed the most. I can understand how others dislike it. This does not help, most of the jokes were the humor of the 2nd class bathroom. Not much different from Kevin Smith movie. <br /> <br /> The idiocracy rejects logic, reason, reason (for good reason). <br /> <br /> Mike Judges â€™return was a knockout.
