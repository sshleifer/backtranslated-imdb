This is a really great series. I like the show, and I'm so glad it hasn't been canceled yet. he has really good humor and he shows a realistic connection between a young mother and her daughter. oh yeah for girls gilmore! it's very cool they are such a sarcastic joke. they do everything together, like my mom and me. I'm for girls gilmore. I run out of queues. but I like the way Luke and Lorelei finally get along. they so needed to be together. and I just adore Suke St. James! she is so cool and the show would not be anywhere without Michel. All shows are dry humor, sarcasm and life in a very small town where everyone knows each other ... especially Gilmore Girls
