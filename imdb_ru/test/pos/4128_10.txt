The Buddy Holly Story shows how a famous singer started in Dunk-Lubbock, Texas, before his fame, before his tragic death in a plane crash. Backed by the fact that Gary Busey, like Holly, plays on his own instruments, this film is a biopic in its purest form. There are some things that seem a bit beaten, namely, the Lubbock people who think rock and roll is the devil’s music, but the performance workshops outweigh any weaknesses. If there is only one thing that is surely in our big world, this is what Buddy Holly’s music will never become outdated. Whether it is “It Will Be a Day,” “Peggy Sue,” or another song of his, they still sound great after all these years. He remains one of the greatest singers in history. <br /> <br /> To show what Lubbock really thought about their most famous son, they called the street after him only 37 years after his death! What a bunch of crazy!
