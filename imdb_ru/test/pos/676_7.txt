We are in a small town, the home widow (Ida Lupino) hires a wizard (Robert Ryan) to look after her house. Soon she begins to regret it, since Ryan is becoming erratic with every passing hour, it seems that she is taking a dangerous schizophrenic, and now she cannot escape from her home. <br /> <br /> Carefully, My Lovely Adapted from the History and Mel Dinelli's play “The Spiral Staircase}“ The Man. ”The film, consisting of one film and two characters, boasts two magnificent central productions and offers an interesting look at mental illness. However, one should not deceive oneself into thinking that this is a violent and nervous picture, because it is not. From the very beginning it becomes clear that Howard Wilton Ryan is a person with dangerous problems, but this is a completely different film of “danger.” who throws another bias on psychosis and thus complicates the hatred of our dangerous protagonist. <br /> <br /> Ryan and Lupino are a great combination, they also made an excellent, and much better on the Dangerous Earth this same year. So both actors are clearly comfortable together, it reveals a character's finely tuned story based on the boundaries of a single house, re: prison. Ryan is especially strong as his character breaks into insanity, some scenes are strong, sometimes cause fear, and others cause deep sympathy. The direction from Harry Horner is safe (to tell the truth, he doesn’t have to do anything except letting his actors run with him), and George E. Cantano’s cinematography contains some clever and impressive visual touches. From one tree trinkets are remembered immensely. Beware, My Lovely has something in between good and excellent, and that’s enough to recommend it to fans of frontier and easily accessible Film-Noir. For fans of Robert Ryan, this is something of a must-see, oh yeah, and then something else. 7/10
