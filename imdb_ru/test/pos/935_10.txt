See three colors: blue and three colors: white. They are both great movies and will add an extra dimension to the Three Colors: Red Finals. Red is a fantastic movie. They can be enjoyed in one view, and indeed, the culmination of the film is very strong when you first watch it. But look again. Once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this film, you will see new things with each viewing. From the first viewing you understand that the film is the work of a brilliant mind. With each additional viewing, you discover that you discover that this is truly an ingenious work. Red color should symbolize the brotherhood in the French flag. History reverses the theme of fraternity so that it can be viewed from angles that no one suspected. The aspects of fraternity, shared by different characters, are as deep as anything you want. If you are accustomed to blatant "symbolism" in most mass films, you may find red a little slow. You can look at the screen, filled with intensity that you do not understand ... and yawning, wondering what kind of excitement it is. This is not a meaningless, vicarious experience. You did not explain everything. You have to think how you look. You should see ... not just watch. A wonderful film ... that was supposed to appeal to a wonderful viewer.
