"How can a name, not even a real name, break your heart?" Here is how. There were few versions of the film of the famous novel that would have done better justice to their source material than Anthony Minghellaâ€™s film about Charles Frozen's Cold Mountain. If you read the book, you can feel how most of the main scenes of the soul are amazingly recreated. I personally cried many times while reading the novel, and spent most of the evening watching a movie through tears. <br /> <br /> Awesome scope, beautiful words, great game and great music. In an interview on the DVD accompanying the film, Minghella talks about several layers of the story. They all work. One of the best films I've seen, and an invitation to one of the greatest novels of the past ten years.
