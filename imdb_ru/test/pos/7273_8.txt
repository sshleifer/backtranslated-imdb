** HERE WILL BE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Summary: Macklin (Miller) witnesses Plunkettâ€™s (Carlisle) robbery, which goes wrong. Partner Plunkett will be shot (and killed), but only after he swallows a large ruby. Plunkett and Macklin meet at the cemetery when both are trying to get hold of a ruby. Unfortunately, they were caught as robbers and sent to prison, but only after Plunkett swallowed a ruby. Ruby is their key to freedom, and as soon as they become free, they form a robbery partnership. Macklin should pretend to be a gentleman and find out who to rob, and then just rob him (and rob them stylishly). But Macklin falls in love with her niece / daughter (?) Their first victim, Lady Rebecca Gibson (Tyler). And Mr. Chance (Stott) wants to catch them, and his methods are not very good ... <br /> <br /> Comments: Good action with comedy and adventure. Carlisle and Miller make a good team, with lots of friction and friendship. And then there is the relationship between Macklin and Rebecca Gibson. The ball scene is very good, especially the (anachronistic) use of music. In addition to these interesting characters, Cumming plays the best of them all, Lord of Rochester. And the character and acting star and some of the best in the film. In general, the film works very well, a good balance between the plot and special effects, the thriller and comedy. Very interesting. <br /> <br /> 8/10
