When the “Network” was first advertised, the ad looked ridiculous. Then, when I saw this, it was actually pretty good. Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) spends her days at work on the computer and has never recognized her neighbors. Then, as a result of a series of events, her personality is erased by a bunch of dark people, and she cannot prove that she exists. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the film are a bit contrived; You probably know which parts if you saw the movie. However, this is a good view that the existence of the Internet may have affected unsuspecting people. I recommend it.
