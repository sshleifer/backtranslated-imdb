Emergency surrender is a frightening practice that, surprisingly, under Clinton, allows the US government to seize and hold any suspect, apparently for any reason, of terrorism against the United States. This is a very sensitive issue, especially after September 11, because supporters of this practice will always criticize the opposition for taking away from the US the vital force necessary for an effective fight against terror. Supporters of fanatics will call the opposition terrorists on their own. <br /> <br /> But, as in a recent film in which the death sentence was used on a similar level of humanity, “The Life of David Gale”, “Transmission” shows us the history of the abuse of extraordinary transmission or, at least, ease with by which it can be used and falsely applied. The story tells about Anwar El-Abrahimi, an American chemical engineer who was born in Egypt, and on his way back to America, he grabbed a lecture in Egypt. The reason is that he called the famous terrorist. There is no evidence (or necessity) that Anwar called that his phone was never stolen. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Anwar's extremely pregnant wife, Isabella, is returning to the states, desperately trying to find her husband, who boarded a plane in Chicago, but obviously did not. The fragile explanation that he has never been there evaporates when she discovers that he made a purchase in flight using her credit card. <br /> <br /> Recently, I have been studying modern Chinese history, in particular the history of the surprisingly selfish and cruel dictatorship created by Mao Zedong, and I’m more than afraid to see the similarities between the extraordinary performance and some of Mao’s brutal intimidation tactics including his public executions (which people were forced to observe) and the widespread use of torture, specifically used to obtain "confessions". <br /> <br /> It is very disturbing to note that Mao specifically did this in order to create an atmosphere of fear in order to achieve obedience from the Chinese. To say that the Bush administration did not create an environment of fear and continues to milk it for everything that is worth it would be naive to the extreme, and although emergency execution was not created under Bush, it is clear that it does more harm than good. <br /> <br /> Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal), who works at the CIA table and has little field experience, is added to the thickness of the film until his boss is killed and he suddenly doesn’t find that he controls torture which he quickly comes to doubt, is something to open. The daughter of Fatima (boss Freeman) also plays a key role, as does the assistant of the senator, played by Peter Sarsgaard, who may play the most satisfactory role in the film. Meryl Streep is also quite cold and clinical as a cold senator with dogmatic support for the necessity and practice of execution. <br /> <br /> As a political thriller, the film is wonderfully thought out and sustained. But the worst thing about it is that all this is real. The purpose of the film is to make people really think about what is being done in the name of America, especially when they claim to have done so in order to prevent the same things. Carrying out terror in the name of preventing terror does not bring us sympathy, nor is it about obtaining confessions through cruel torture, which is the main form of criminal investigation. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we are gradually moving in this direction, doing more, not less. The terrible question is what kind of event will happen at some point in the future, to convince us to stop and go another way, to civilization and the world, or we will just continue to go to military dictatorship until we finally reach there?
