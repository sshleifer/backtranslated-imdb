Realistic masterpiece. thirty years later, the photos may look a little old, but in reality, this is just the exact effect of the fist in the face of the film. I have never seen such a film in my whole life. When I first saw it, I didn’t know if it was fantastic ... And it didn’t look like that ... This film is a masterpiece that everyone in the world should see. This is the best film ever shown to society. The best film that demonstrates that the system is down. And the system has not changed much in thirty years. I think this film will need to be viewed as an educational film.
