The world's first fully synchronized sound cartoon, Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, will debut on the screen in an exceptionally interesting animated series "Steamboat Willie". Mickey is working on the steamer under the supervision of Captain Peg Leg Pete (or Pete, as he is later called). Mickey sits on his longtime companion Minnie Mouse on board the train while they frolic while Mickey tries to impress Minnie. This short was wildly cheerful and positively entertaining. The animators Ubbe Iwerks, Rudolph Ising and Hugh Harman helped Walt create the short film. Steamboat Willie essentially marks the beginning of the success of Walt Disney.
