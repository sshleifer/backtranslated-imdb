I really liked the movie and the story! I saw the original (I think, 1939) and enjoyed both of them. To truly appreciate the history, you need to know the English culture and customs. The professor (Peter O'Toole) was dedicated to his school and the “boys” in this school. It was an English “public” school, which we in the USA call a private school (EG Andover). He is a very ascetic person and at first glance seems tough, sultry, indifferent and weak to the extent that she is effeminate. He is strict in his educational standards, because he cares about “his guys,” that is, he does not want them to receive cheap or weak education. He meets (through the introduction) the "dance hall girl" (Petula Clark) and is completely amazed. At that time in England, the mention of the “dance hall” was tinged with extreme sexual promiscuity and was definitely “lower class”. We find that the Professor is actually a very tough and brave person, and also devoted to people and institutions that he loves and / or respects. Clark is becoming more than a lover and wife ... she is "stirring up" his personality and allows him to grow as a man and a man, largely due to his favorite school and his own happiness. The first film was set before the Second World War, this film takes place in the Second World War, as well as in 1969 (we had the "British invasion" ... Beetles, etc. Clark had hits, and then he was very popular ... still it is for me), the music is excellent, color and the photo is excellent. I think O'Toole played a great character! There are loyal people, such as "Chips" ... everything around us, but many do not receive recognition. Very nice movie and story!
