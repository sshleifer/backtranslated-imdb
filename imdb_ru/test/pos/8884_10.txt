Was it with someone who raised you since you were young? Do you just want her to go out of your life? This woman is your mother. You must respect her, you must respect her, whether she is ill or good. But this at times, it can aggravate. Especially when she becomes very domineering. This is how Owen (Danny DeVito) had to deal in "Throw Mom before the Train." His mother (Ann Ramsey, 1929-88) is one of the worst. He tries his best to be a writer, and she does everything except gratitude. He calls it "clumsy turd", "larda $$", as well as "fat" and "stupid." For his friend, Larry Donner (Billy Crystal), he has problems with his own woman, his ex-wife. She is trying to discredit him. So what did Owen do? Push her overboard. What does he do? Help return the service, get rid of Mrs. Lift! I liked the kitchen when Owen called Larry "cousin Patty." And mom said, “You don't have a cousin Patty!” And Owen shouts “You lied to me!” and El Cabongs Larry with a frying pan. Then the fun begins when they get on the train and try to kill Momma Lift. It is ripped off and she kicks Larry from the train. Well, everything returns to normal, the former wife lives, but my mother herself kicked in the bucket. Maybe she should have seen the mistakes of her power paths. It's a fun movie, and the cast is great. Classic! 5 stars!
