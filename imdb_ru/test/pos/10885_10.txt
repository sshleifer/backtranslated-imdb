Since I first played it in 1998, GoldenEye has been one of my favorite video games. In fact, I recently bought the N64 solely so that I could own it and play more often! The game is almost perfect: single-player mode copes with immersion in the skin of Bond with a variety of tasks, convincing weapons and great level design. Although the artificial intelligence of enemies by today's standards is fairly simple, it only adds to the appeal of GoldenEye. The method of getting cheats (passing levels for a strict time limit) was also innovative when the headline was released, and even now I still haven't cracked some of them! <br /> <br /> The game comes with a wonderful Multiplayer mode for four players, and although itâ€™s not as advanced as a combat simulator in the sequel to the Perfect Dark game, it still makes you incredibly happy when its opponents smash into RC -P90! ;-)
