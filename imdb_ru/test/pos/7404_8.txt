Sometimes good things happen by chance. <br /> <br /> I never heard of the Silver Wing before the end of 2005 - I switched channels and accidentally saw something on Toon Disney with bats at a sawmill that owls attacked, I had no idea what it was, but I was motivated to stay up to date - it was difficult to wait for an advertisement, so I could find out what it's called! <br /> <br /> Part of what intrigued me was the appearance of bats - first, they did not use the popular agreement to give bats “extra fingers” where their thumb claws should be. Rather, they have palms that look like human hands, but their fingers are longer and there is a web of skin between them. <br /> <br /> Also, faces - they look like people (in fact, once I thought, they were once people, but turned into bats). I usually don’t like it in animated animals, but it worked here - the story is a human story, although it’s about bats and other animals (not unlike the Lion King). <br /> <br /> What I saw on TV is the last two parts of the “trilogy”. I missed the very beginning of the first, “Tower of Fire” (the second as a whole), but for the most part I saw all of them. However, I caught myself wanting to understand what was happening, since the first part was not included, and I still would not have caught it. <br /> <br /> But I realized that it is based on the book by Kenneth Oppel. How fortunate that I noticed and wrote it down - I was very disappointed when I learned that the series is NOT AVAILABLE! Even recently, it did not make sense, because it made sense so that it was not yet available. <br /> <br /> However, I did find not only the Silverwing book, but also two sequels of Sunwing and Firewing. When I read the first book, I was wondering "Is this all?" Not only because much of what is in this series is missing from this book, but even if I had not seen the animated version, the book “Silver Wing” (otherwise a good story) does not end as much as it stops. Only one free end is connected - Shade and Marina meet a colony of Silvervings in Hibernakul. <br /> <br /> In fact, Silverwing and Sunving should (in my opinion) be published in one volume, because they make for the full story together, but not separately. <br /> <br /> In fact, the animated version takes some elements from the Sunwing (for example, Orest, lifting the ban on seeing the sun), and some were completely original. It is not perfect, but definitely very nice. I like both versions of the Silver Wing saga. <br /> <br /> So I am glad that she will finally appear in June. It's been a long time, and it's worth it.
