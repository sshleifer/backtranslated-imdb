From time to time, one can come across a film that makes one rethink the reaction of society to people who are different from the definition of normal. <br /> <br /> Mitty, the victim of non-social elements, was left alone to cope with her tragedy and retreats into her idyllic world .... one that she believes is the real world ..... /> <br /> Surreal (Mitty's world) is superimposed on the real (her family). <br /> <br /> Mitty, who suffers from schizophrenia, forces us to reconsider our priorities in relation to attempts to rehabilitate such “patients” as they are. Are we right to bring them back to our reality, when all that we can offer them in our life is pain and suffering? What we have the right to deprive them of the source of happiness? What right do we have to deprive them of joy when we cannot help them in their grief? 15 Park Avenue is one of the best social films that shows us that every patient needs empathy, not just sympathy.
