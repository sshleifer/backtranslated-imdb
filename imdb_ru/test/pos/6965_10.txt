The sixth (and last) film in boxing. Well, it looks like I saved the best for last. Guli IV. I originally did a review for this back in February, but I decided to make a new one. Ghoulies series is very cool. I know that there are people who do not like them, and this is normal. This is my favorite show. Yes, I know that real ghouls do not appear and are replaced by 2 guys in suits, one of whom is Tony Cox from Bad Santa. Now about the film. <br /> <br /> In the center of the film Jonathan Graves, the protagonist of the first film, played again by Peter Liapis, who is now a police officer in the Los Angeles police and put his past occult behind him. During the first part of the film, we meet Alexander (played by the very hot Stacy Randall), who talks to a demon named Faust, who is the dark side of Jonathan. Faust asks Alexandra for a red gem, and something goes wrong, therefore, releasing the ghouls from the beyond. <br /> <br /> I think Jim Winsky coped well with directing. And Chuck Chirino's music is also fun. (SPOILER FORWARD) At the end of this film, Ghoulies say it will be Ghoulies IV, Part 2, or Ghoulies V. I still hope that the sequel will be made, and I especially hope that Jim Winsky will return to directing. I agree with GimboTheGhoulies on this.
