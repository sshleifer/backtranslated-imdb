I saw both films, and I, no doubt, saw that the remake is the best, I know that many people will not agree that those who became fans of the original will most likely not love this remake, but I thought it was well thought out and definitely scary, it was so good that I would see it again tonight, the original scared me because they kill children, I mean, who does it in the cinema anyway .... but in this children have at least half the chance ... The only bad role in this film is when the nanny (Jill) goes to the sounds that She doesn’t hear, and runs into the bushes to check someone, obviously, no one in her right mind will do that while looking after the children, so this is the only thing that I found wrong in the film, and even that, probably had to put it there to create anxiety, I don’t want to give up too much for all those who didn’t see it, I recommend that you, instead of listening to all these people say that this is crap and worse than the original, be the best film for teens as it shows things that most of us are afraid of, but Yes, I was in the movies, there have been at least 10 adults aged over 70, who watched it and they liked it if they like it, I think you will! I give him 9 out of 10!
