I saw The Cure when I was a kid, and then I liked it. Now, years later, I almost accidentally took a copy and looked at it again. As a child, you do not have the opportunity to acquire for yourself what you want, it is usually the prerogative of your parents - but when I looked at it again now, I felt sorry that I didn’t do more to get a copy of this film, and therefore , almost forgot about it until today. <br /> <br /> This is a really beautiful film. It tells about the unlikely friendship between a witty, inappropriate child who takes his cues from his terrible, abusive mother, and his neighbor, a slightly younger boy with AIDS. <br /> <br /> That's right, you say. Another one of those. Cheeky tears. Bucket cinema. Moral tail. Yes, I know, I hate them too. Only it is not. This is one of the very few films I have seen that demonstrates a very rare trick: it conveys a really sad story (and yes, a story about morality), but without a single moment when it feels like a senseless one, forced or some other . Another way is "Hollywood". It shows a REAL relationship between two REAL boys who interact as REAL children. And thanks to this interaction, the good-natured, loving character of the older boy, Eric, begins to shine through his "tough guy" when he takes on a kind of fraternal care for Dexter, his HIV-positive younger neighbor. Together, they set off on an adventure to find a cure - which to Eric seems to be just around the corner - so that all these stupid problems with AIDS disappear and they can be friends forever. <br /> <br /> Production at the highest level. But, of course, what this film really carries is the performances of the two main characters - Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello. Especially Mazzello, which is simply amazing - he does convey the feeling of weakness that a sick boy needs, but at the same time he manages to make Dexter a truly energetic and determined character. He shines in the scene where the boys confront Pony: his desire to protect his older friend makes him say what he says - and only then does horror appear on his face when he realizes that he himself said is true: his blood is toxic. .. Renfro also has his moments, in particular the scenes with his mother: he perfectly shows how this macho, street child, remains completely frozen and numb when confronted with his offensive, storming mother, and cannot say a word contradict her since she forbids his relationship with a sick boy because of her fear and ignorance. Annabella Sciorra also gives an unforgettable insight into the role of Dexter's mother, who in a sense becomes, in a sense, the mother figure for Eric. <br /> <br /> I watched this film for the first time when I was at school in America. and loved it - not at all given to films of this kind. But the behavior of the children in this film was so real that I could easily connect them with them. Ironically, the teacher who showed us this film (wonderful woman, I'm still in touch with her) got into trouble because of this, as some worried parent complained about the scene when two boys were watching Playboy ... pathetic. Seriously, the Americans will someday overcome this ridiculous phobia, I don't know. The film was a subtle snapshot of the playboy cover, so it wasn’t shown in schools ... how sad. Children should see this movie. This is more inspiring and informative than all the “official” extracurricular events put together. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing. I know that I chat, but nevertheless ... Account. It's great. I am a musician, and therefore I know Dave Grusin from his records: he is a well-known jazz pianist and producer. Up until this film, I really did not know that he also starred in films, although when I later checked out, I discovered that I unconsciously watched several films that he had worked on. Indeed, there is a wonderful job. <br /> <br /> In general, a dozen. I would recommend this film to everyone. And I'm definitely going to see this with my younger brothers and sisters — they can use watching a movie like this among all the standard hysteria with special effects that they usually see.
