A warning to potential viewers of this experimental film: the nature of the image and the effects are such that it is one of those types of films that you really need to watch on film. Digitalization pixelization sucks up a lot of depth and adds a lot of noise to an already abstract and grainy film. However, since this film is virtually unavailable in any format, I believe you will have to do what you can. <br /> <br /> In any case, this most beautiful artistic endeavor is due to the guy who eventually give us the shadow of a vampire. This is a dark and dirty film about the origin of the elements (as far as I can tell by the names of the characters) through a terrifying and surrealistic process. “Birth” is a very good example of what is known as obscene art, a stylistic approach that seeks meaning through an intuitive more than a thematic one. <br /> <br /> And intuitively describes it. Technically, there are not so many things in the film, but the levels of emotion through which he will carry you are incalculable. The very repetition of some images creates a fascinating catch over the senses. Sound editing, and in particular, the score is perfect, and serves images incredibly well. <br /> <br /> Fans of this film would be nice to get acquainted with the collections of short films released on the Other Cinema DVD, Experiment in Terror I II and III. Such films make me more and more confident that the realm of true horror is in abstract, disgusting and not narrative, and not in creepy stories about ghosts and ax murderers. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
