Zeppelin is my favorite band, so when I heard that this double DVD was coming out, I was really excited. Iâ€™ll just go to this chase and say that if you are a Zeppelin fan, you need to run and buy it right now! It is absolutely exciting! He blows "The song remains unchanged" completely out of the water. Why this material has never been released before is incomprehensible to me. The footage presented here really shows Zep at the peak of their game, which I never felt like Song did. Jimmy Page is undoubtedly the best of all, and thanks to these performances Jimi Hendrix looks like a fool! Be on the lookout for lively White Summer Jam ... like this! <br /> <br /> Viva Jimmy Page! <br /> <br /> Viva Led Zeppelin! <br /> <br /> 11 of 10
