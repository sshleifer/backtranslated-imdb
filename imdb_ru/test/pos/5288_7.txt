Hayao Miyazaki captured the imagination of viewers, young and old, around the world, and his latest cinematic work is Ponyo, a children's fairy tale borrowing elements of the story from The Little Mermaid. Of course, like other classic Miyazaki works, such as Spirited Away and his latest film, Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo is full of creativity that only adults can truly appreciate, but this is definitely more children's story than these efforts. This is a magical story that is best described as beautiful and sweet, which seeks charisma, not conflict. <br /> <br /> “Ponyo” is the story of a child of the same name with a cross-eyed fish, daughter of an underwater sorcerer, who dreams of escaping from the sea and becoming a little girl. When she does, she quickly makes friends with a little boy named Sosuke. In the process, she acquires strong magic and unconsciously brings the world out of balance between land and sea, and a giant storm floods most of the city on the top of a cliff, where Sosuke lives with her mother, and threatens to end the world. /> <br /> Like Moving Castle Howl, Walt Disney chose Ponyo for the American release and voiced it with an impressive selection of western voices, even choosing homegrown products from the younger brothers and sisters of the Disney group The Jonas Brothers. (Frankie Jonas) and Miley Cyrus (Noah's younger sister) are voiced by Sosuke and Ponyo respectively. Also voiced characters are Liam Neeson (Fujimoto, Pono’s father), Tina Fey (Lisa, Sosuke’s mother), Matt Damon (Sosuke’s father), Cate Blanchett (Ponyo’s goddess of the sea) and a trio of cheerful older women played by Betty White, Cloris Lichman and Lily Tomlin. Efforts are definitely aimed at making this film attractive to the American audience, and Disney is coming. <br /> <br /> But voices don't matter much in Miyazaki’s visual arts film. The fan of the transformations and animations of the movement of fluid and liquid, creating a fairy tale that takes place partially under water, should have been a joy for Miyazaki to work and, perhaps, even his entire motivation to choose this story. Highlights include the water drops that Fujimoto sends after Ponyo, which move like living waves, as well as many other magnificent sea creatures and breathtaking storm scenes make Ponyo as terrible as any other Miyazaki movie. <br /> <br /> However, as a children's story, “Ponyo” focuses its efforts on being charming. The discovery of true friendship and love between Sosuke and Ponyo is very encouraging, even if Noah Cyrus cries like a child when Ponyo excitedly embraces human life, it can be a bit annoying. But no matter how delightful are many figurative elements and love relationships, antagonism or danger is very small. In past films, Miyazaki has obvious villains, but the conflict in Ponyo is actually compressed as the story progresses. Sosuke believes that once he lost his mother, and in the background is the idea that the world is out of order and that people should be ashamed of the pollution of the sea, but “Ponyo” is mostly stress free. The most striking is that its climax proceeds without incident, despite the fact that, in general, all the characters are cute. <br /> <br /> “Ponyo” will certainly satisfy Miyazaki’s fans with all his imagination, and beginners will still be amazed by its simplicity, but visually. an ambitious story, but this is clearly more a children's film, best suited for families and those who love fantasy, regardless of its form or target audience. This is not exactly what you expect from Miyazaki, given his recent work, but this will surely be remembered as another of his favorite stories. ~ Stephen See <br /> <br /> Visit my website at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
