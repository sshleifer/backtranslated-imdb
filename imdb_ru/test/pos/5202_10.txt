Such films do not appear too often. I'm surprised it took 9 years to finally see it. Politicians and civilian hawks should look at this before making decisions about how to destroy nations. I watched it the next day after watching the TV version of the Uprising about the Warsaw ghetto. Even with this fresh one, I felt sympathy for the German soldier. I sympathized with all parties that this tragedy could occur. It will take some time to thaw from it. I’m surprised that they didn’t make a film based on the Forgotten Soldier by Baja Sagera This film shares the chill with the book. Both will haunt me for the rest of my life.
