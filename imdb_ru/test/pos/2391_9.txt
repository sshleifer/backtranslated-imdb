The film seemed very interesting to me. I really liked the movie, the actors were great. It was fun. Benny's uncle was beautiful, he was real in his character. The ending took a wonderful turn. I would recommend you see this. Eddie Maurice's girlfriend reminded me a bit of Sandra Bullock, she was as sharp as a nail. I also like the little girls in the film, she was very convincing. Benny reminded me of a friend of mine who really lives growing up in Brooklyn. I liked the scene where he tried the sauce in the pan, because that's how most people cook lol. I really watched the movie 2 times and found out more the second time.
