“Murder by Numbers” Barbet Schroeder with Sandra Bullock in the lead role is a solid job, though not particularly convincing. I'm a big fan of Sandra Bullock, and she works here as a judicial investigator, Cassie Mayweather, who is not very pretty and broken. However, there is a sense of detachment inherent in the structure of history. This is a perfect murder committed by two pampered teenage sociopaths, Richard (Ryan Gusling), who is awesome, and Justin (Michael Pitt), who is a sympathetic fan. In fact, Richard and Justin kill a young woman because they have nothing to do at school. They are very smart and very arrogant, which is usually not bad, but it just does not work here. Tony Geyton's script does a great job of detailing the mystery murder investigation, and it's really by numbers. We have these two punk children who boast about their superiority, and we just want them to fall. <br /> <br /> This is not a great study of the dark side, like Schroeder’s “Change of Fate” about Klaus von Bülow . There are some interesting turns in Numbers. The film is not so much a thriller, as a study of the character of Cassie. Sandra Bullock balances Cassie's bravado, her fear of letting people enter her and her secret past. Bullock brings courage and strength to the suffering character. Her partner and something of a love interest, Sam (played by Ben Chaplin), is rather a hidden conspiracy than a real character. Although Chaplin makes astonishment very well. Another nice touch - Richard and Justin are involved in a strange sexual attraction. The most interesting thing about Numbers is Pitt and Gusling. <br /> <br /> A lot of fascinating turns take place throughout the film. Everything is done very well. I saw the movie about a week ago, and, looking back, I like it a little more than when I saw it. However, this is simply not an inspirational job. Sandra Bullock and Barbet Schroeder deserve much better, and so do we.
