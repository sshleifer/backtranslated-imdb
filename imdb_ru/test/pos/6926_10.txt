I know that this film was rather rude to critics, but I must say that I really liked it. The real star here is the fantastic Dylan Moran. He never ceases to be at the same time cheerful and persuasive in all his various guises. He also manages to radiate a sweet charm that goes against his outrageous slips. Special mention should be made of Michael Gambon, who plays for the sake of laughter with a brilliantly precise and at the same time comedic accent of the Dublin city center. The only weak link is Kane, who, obviously laughing at this, loses the least interesting and most non-sympathetic character. He probably won't play so well abroad, but still worth seeing.
