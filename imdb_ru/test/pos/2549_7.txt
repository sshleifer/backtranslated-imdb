I liked Ramina Bakhrani's “Men's Cart”, and this film is equally good. This piece of life is almost a documentary about how life lives on the edges. <br /> <br /> Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzalez do a great job with the work of a 12-year-old brother and a 16-year-old sister who live in a small room above an auto shop. There are no parents; they survive on their own. Ali replenishes his income by stealing auto parts, selling DVD bootlegs and selling candy in the subway. Izzy supplements his income by working on a food van, selling himself. They are trying to make money, but only on their truck. <br /> <br /> Someone is inclined to express outrage at the fact that these two children are left alone, and, of course, you can be very upset about Izzy. sells his body to truckers who want it, but the fact is that it exists today in the richest country in the world, and not in some undeveloped country. Save the ugliness and do something.
