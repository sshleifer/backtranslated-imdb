<br /> <br /> `<br /> <br /> 5 years ago, if you watched an Australian film, you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories about wars, transvestites, kangaroos and koalas and Australians in general , he is represented as a madman, living outside the country, uttering words such as “cober” and generally being a classic loser. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the Australian film has evolved over the past couple of years and produces modern time ?? classics ”, such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Boy Yolong and Samples of People. <br /> <br /> In this evolution of the film we also find “Two Hands”. <br /> <br /> In Sydney on Kings Cross, “Two Hands” is a black comedy about crime and survival in the harsh end of the city. Pando, played by Brian Brown, is the boss of Sydney Mob. He is the king of organized crime, wearing a thong, carrying a short man and helping his son with his origami. He is vicious, but real. Like his "mob", he holds a gun on someone's head in one scene, and then plays board games in another. They are respected, and if they ask you a favor, you do not say no. <br /> <br /> Enter Jimmy, played by Heath Ledger. Jimmy is your average Australian boy of about twenty. He is a good guy who wants to make a name for himself, without becoming someone else’s bad side, so when Pando asks Jimmy to bring in $ 10,000, Jimmy accepts. <br /> <br /> Everything starts to worry when two teenagers manage to steal money while Jimmy is on the beach. So now Jimmy gets $ 10,000 from the main mafia boss. From here, we begin to see all the interconnected stories with Jimmy and his attempt to rob a bank to return money, Jimmy and Alex (love interest played by Rose Byrne), Pando is trying to find Jimmy and, of course, two teenagers and their new ones have found prosperity. The concept is deepened by the narrator, Jimmy's dead brother, Michael, who was killed by Pando and his gang several years earlier. <br /> <br /> In the end, all the plot lines are really well connected with the unexpected turn of shock and stunning. lecture hall. I really liked it. <br /> <br />
