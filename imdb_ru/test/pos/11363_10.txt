My acquaintance with the lifelong love of Shakespeare. My brother was 5 years old, and I was not 7 when WTTW in Chicago broadcast "The Age of Kings". It became a family ritual to watch, including repetitions. In the fall series, my father bought us a rare treat for the Midwest - grenades; and my mom will bake corn on the stove. A wonderful game of actors whose names meant nothing to me then (although I will never forget the aching young Sean Connery as Hotspur), but do it now! And they published scripts in paperback so that we could follow and figure out the language. I managed to memorize most of Richard III. So glad it comes out on DVD! Highly recommended for all ages and any level of familiarity with Shakespeare or English history.
