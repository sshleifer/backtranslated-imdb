This episode of "TFTD" from the first season under the ironic name "Answer Me" is a pretty well-made and memorable episode, and at the end it takes a shocking turn. You have Jean Marsh as a god and a washed up actress from Los Angeles who moved to New York to audition, and she lives in an apartment provided by an old friend. Strangely enough, every night she didnâ€™t sleep from the ringing phone from the next apartment, but, strangely enough, the dwelling, where the ringing phone continues to ring, is not occupied, since the guests have been dead for many years. Finally, she had to surrender, only she had to follow her and not answer the phone when no one was at home, because it was bad to be wrapped in a phone with a life of its own! In general, a good episode is strange, although it is still tense about a supernatural phone and it twists well at the end.
