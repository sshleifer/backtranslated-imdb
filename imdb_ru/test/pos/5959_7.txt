Just watched the movie, in fact it's pretty good. The trailers left me with the impression of either another Dujardin “Man-show-turned film” (“_Brice de Nice_”), or an expensive, stupid French comedy. Surprisingly, it is not. The secret agent OSS 117 is stupid, but at least he knows it in some way, whereas I always found out that James Bond was stupid, but he acted like a clever ass. The dialogue is witty with a lot of mocking humor that one would expect from a British, not a French film. Women and music are beautiful. A refreshing journey into the past, when the bad guys were former Nazis or Soviet cattle, cars were brilliant, and in France there were colonies!
