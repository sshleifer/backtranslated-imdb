Robin Hood: "Men in pantyhose" (1993) - a very necessary parody of Mel Brooks. He has an appointment to forge Robin Hoodâ€™s legacy and a couple of films about the mythical noble thief of English folklore. Carey Elvis plays the role of Robin Hood. He is looking for several good people who will join him in his quest to overthrow the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rhys) and win the honest hand of Maid Marian. Robin also deals with Prince John (Richard Lewis). So good. Tracy Ullman acts as a personal witch, Prince John Latrin, who looks at the sheriff. <br /> <br /> Will Robin be able to find his funny people? How far will the prince go to throw his weight in the absence of his father? Why does the sheriff hate Robin so much? To find out, you have to watch Robin Hood: Men in pantyhose! Look at the merry cameo House De Louise, which plays the Duke of Jersey. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
