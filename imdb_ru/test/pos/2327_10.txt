Scenarios of fine comedy have no analogues in any film of recent years. Characters are interesting, albeit slightly predictable. The comedy time recorded in the script is more than enough to catch up. When you are sure you know the ending .... SURPRISE! Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set probably won't appreciate some of the more subtle links, they will certainly appreciate one scene in particular! A great movie!
