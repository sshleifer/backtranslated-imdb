This show does not stop the fun. The first joke will make you wet your pants. And this is probably the weakest joke of all. I started watching it when the second half of the second season began. and immediately. I sat down. only 2 weeks after i started watching. I downloaded the episodes and bought a DVD. Repeated clips like “Test Ad Road” and “Current Affairs” are pretty funny. Then there is an announcement that they shoot “Use emo. Use your own tears for better use. ” Also funny in politics. There is nothing wrong with doing this. it's funny. Any Australians who do not find it funny. Do not complain and do not look. ALL Aussie tunes on Wednesday at 9 on ABC
