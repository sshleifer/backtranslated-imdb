I was a fan of Mario for as long as I can remember, I have very pleasant memories of how I played in Super Mario World as a child, this game brought back many of these memories, adding something new. Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing Mario franchise. This game is very different from any other Mario, although the main elements of Mario still remain, the first noticeable difference is that the story unfolds in space. <br /> <br /> The story begins a lot As in any other Mario game, Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach, in which he invites him to a celebration in his castle in the Mushroom Kingdom. Upon arrival at Peach Castle, Mario discovers that Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) attack the castle with their airships. Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach, and then raises his castle into space. In the midst of lifting the castle into space, Mario falls and lands on an unknown planet. Mario was found by a talking star named Luma and taken back to Lumaâ€™s house, the floating space station, where Mario meets many other Looms, and also meets their leader, a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser took the Space Station Power Stars and scattered them all over the universe, and Mario must help Lumas find them and save Peach, so the adventure begins. <br /> <br /> The way you play the game, flying from a space station to other galaxies, each galaxy consists of a multitude of planets that Mario travels through the levels through these falling stars to get the Power Stars. Mario can walk around the planets many times without losing gravity; some planets are small and others are large; many planets are like the classic Mario environments. The best thing in the game is control, all such things as jumping and the like are the same, but wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. You shake the remote control, Mario will perform the rotation, which is used as the main attack in the game, and also activates the shooting stars. You can also point the remote at the screen and use a pointer to shoot starbats at enemies or objects in the environment. In addition, there is graphics, at the moment it is the best graphics on the Wii, it's just very difficult to describe how great this game looks, you can even say that it looks as good as some other games. <br /> <br /> The only thing that bothers me is that some addiction is required for the turning effect, and the story is rather weak. The worst thing is that you lose all your lives when you turn off the game, no matter how much you had, when you last exited, you restart for 4 lives. However, with the exception of these minor problems, this is an excellent game that is very interesting and very difficult. This is the game we were waiting for on the Wii. <br /> <br /> Ideal 10 out of 10!
