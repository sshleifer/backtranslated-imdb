I read Ash's comment and thought that they must have looked at a completely different picture! <br /> <br /> I just watched the movie this morning and was quite surprised. <br /> <br /> To respond to Ashya's comments: <br /> <br /> Trail Street is a very well-made western. <br /> <br /> And Randolph Scott was in him quite a bit! <br /> <br /> Gabby Hayes was funnier than I had ever seen him! <br /> <br /> As far as I know, the bad guys had very good success. <br /> <br /> Plus: <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see Robert Ryan as a real good guy — usually he is so slimy. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good western, very well crafted and written. <br /> <br /> I liked the pre-history of Kansas and the "winter" wheat, which supposedly helped her become a state. <br /> <br /> I thought the girl who played Susan was beautiful — I can't understand why she didn't become a bigger star!
