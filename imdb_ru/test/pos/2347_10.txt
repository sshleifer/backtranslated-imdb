I am a big fan of Naruto, although I did not watch every episode and did not read every manga. <br /> <br /> I really liked the first Naruto movie, and, frankly, I was a little nervous that this one would not be as good (or action) as the first (mainly because this one in Australia had only PG instead M, which is PG-13 US or 12 UK). But I was wrong (fortunately)! The animation was more improved (although some of the character drawings in the points looked hastily) and was very good, especially in the battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Speaking of this, let's talk about the battle scenes! Animation and action in the battle scenes was spectacular and very interesting! I especially enjoyed the battle of Gendzyutsu with Kankuro and the fight against Gaara fighting the mutable warrior women! All the characters you want are here! Naruto, Sakura, Gaara, Kankuro and Shikamaru! If only Temari was in the film, Shikamaru could save her dramatically from female warriors! And maybe they could have a passionate kiss! In my resume at the top, I say that it qualifies more as part of a movie, and not just an extended episode. And it does! The action is very cinematic, and the quality of the animation looks very beautiful, especially during the battle! In general, this is a great anime movie that you definitely need to visit any Naruto fan! 5/5! 10/10! 50/50! 100/100! Ok, I'll stop!
