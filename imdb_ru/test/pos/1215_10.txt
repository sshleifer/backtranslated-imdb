This movie is awesome. You will never laugh harder. This is the goal. No, I think it is ... yes, it is ... BOOK! This film becomes funnier from the second - as when the character Jackie Chan finally dies in the final battle scene. This film is very sophisticated, like trash! Congratulations if you buy or rent it. You will never return it, in my opinion. I did not, and I have not found it in the store since. I watched this movie once, and I was always in love with the Kung Fu action movies. If you are looking for an amazing movie with a huge production value, a good or even mediocre game and good special effects ... this is NOT that movie. If you are looking for laughter and eternal surprise, take it for a dollar, and you probably never let it go. With friends, popcorn and drinks, this is the perfect evening.
