One of the best films of the main director Alfred Hitchcock is a story about an American and his family (James Stewart, Doris Day and their little son), who rest in North Africa. Stewart is a doctor, and Day is a world famous singer. They meet a Frenchman who speaks his native language and helps them get out of the accident on a local bus. Later, a Frenchman whispers something in Stewart's ear after he is attacked and dies. The rest of the film is a mystery, as Stewart is trying to save them and solve the mystery. The film is saturated with mystery and strangeness from exotic places to strange incidents. You never know what happens in this film, why people appear to the end, and even then you are not sure. The final scene takes place in Albert Hall and is one of the most famous in the movie, which lasts 12 minutes without dialogue. Hitchcock originally made this film in 1934.
