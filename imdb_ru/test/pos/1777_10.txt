It would be great if the discussion of this medium-length film began with a brief story about the hypocrisy of Hollywood people. In 1988, Chuck Norris saw this film at the Cannes International Film Festival. He made a silly remark, saying that the meaningless murder depicted in Dekalog 5 is much more effective than the murders that were filmed in his Hollywood films with him as a powerful action movie star. He spoke of an innocent taxi driver, whose face was brutally disfigured in a Kislovsky film by a reckless psychopath who beats him cruelly with a big stone. There should be absolutely no excuse for violence and its perpetrators in a decent human society. That is why the statement of Chuck Norris looks like a cruel joke that protects violent means in a society that is becoming increasingly restless. An honest reviewer would not have made a mistake if he or she stated that Kieslowskiâ€™s film "Dekalog: Dekalog, Piec (# 1.5)" has a universal meaning. This is because the Events described in Dekalog 5 can occur in any part of the world. The best lesson that Kelowsky gives us concerns the levels of violence acceptable in a fair society. That is why the brutal murder of an innocent taxi driver can lead to a feeling of disgust in us. We will not experience the same hatred of murder when they appear in films with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damme, because they seem too artificial. It is easy to understand that the special effects and modern methods of the studio can only enchant babies, but it does not make any sense for serious film fans. Kieslowski also protects the helplessness of people in saving their fellow human beings from the clutches of death and suffering. This is particularly interesting because it has been repeatedly proved that strict laws and capital punishments could not prevent a murder.
