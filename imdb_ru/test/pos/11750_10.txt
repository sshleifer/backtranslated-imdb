I just watched this movie again and I can only wonder if we will see more such films? Eternal music, the tender voices of William Holden and Jennifer Jones make this adult person cry through joyful, romantic scenes, and I am not the one who often cries in life. Where have our William Holden gone, and will they make these wonderful films? It's sad to know that they probably won't, but don't think about it, just try to block it in your mind. Despite this, there will be no Holden, and he will not appear on this hill again. You can only enjoy this movie and watch it again.
