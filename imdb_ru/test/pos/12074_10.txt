Ann-Margret did the best job she ever did in her filmmaking history. I felt as if she was Mrs. Frey. There may be one or two Ann-Margret films that I haven’t seen since her debut in the movie “A Pocket Full of Wonders” with Betty Davis in 1961. I feel that she was completely undervalued in the industry. Although she was nominated for an Emmy Award for this role in the film “Who Loves My Children,” she was not noticed. As if she was nominated for an Oscar for her role in Carnal Knowledge and Tommy, she was insulted. In general, I think everyone has done an excellent acting job, including all the children in the film Who Will Love My Children. Yes, this is a sad film (as far as truthful stories can be), but it's worth it. Thank.
