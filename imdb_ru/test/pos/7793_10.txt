The first time I watched it was when it came out (1994), and the last time I watched it, it was just before writing this review. It still makes me laugh at my brain ... after all these years, it does not disappoint, Truly the smartest Bollywood comedy. This is one Indian film that deserves its place in the Top 250 IMDb. Amir Khan and Salman Khan, probably in one of their best performances in comedic roles. What makes this film less classic is its comic time and excellent editing ... Jokes are refreshing and not cheap ... This is one film that is really ahead of its time. If you have not seen this yet, LOOK NOW !!!!!!!!!
