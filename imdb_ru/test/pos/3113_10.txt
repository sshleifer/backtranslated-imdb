George Kukor, known as a female director, could not count on two more talented and beautiful women for his latest film. This film, which itself is a remake of the “old dating” by Bette Davis, written by John Van Druten, is definitely outdated, but still amazing. <br /> <br /> Bergen and Bissett sparkle like best friends who compete in everything but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a “serious” writer, intelligent and elegant. She meets her best friend for life Merry Noel in an exclusive school for girls, and they begin life is not always friendly competition. Later in their lives, when Liz is “promising,” but the serious fiction blocked by the author, Merry decides to try her hand at writing, which infuriates her because of Merry’s random approach to the craft to which she herself is perhaps too seriously . <br /> <br /> Much to Liz’s chagrin, Merry’s trashy novels hit her hands, and ultimately, her old friend Liz is judging her novel to receive the National Book Award. Bergen plays on the show as a haughty writer of paired bestsellers, who plans to put together the broken pieces of her life, combined with her ultimate literary triumph, but alas, it's not that simple. <br /> <br /> The cast includes David Selby, whom you may remember as the tragic Quentin Collins from Dark Shadows, Hart Bochner and, of course, the delightfully young and mercurial Meg Ryan in her first movie role after leaving the soap. <br /> <br /> Rich and famous - sly, polite, witty and wise. The culmination of this is the New Year fiasco, which emphasizes the enduring nature of true friendship, and I never miss a year, despite this on New Year's Eve. Look and you will understand why.
