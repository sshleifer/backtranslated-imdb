“Wallace and Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit” is an animation of the same type created by the same creators of Chicken Run, but now the story is different: Wallace, the inventor who loves cheese and his clever dog Gromit, who always helps Wallace in his problems, he tries to keep rabbits away from all vegetables, as the annual competition of giant vegetables is held in their city. But when Wallace tries an invention that he made for rabbits to avoid vegetables, he will be damned. Before watching this film, I did not know that these two characters already exist and were famous. I loved Gromit, and I think he is one of the coolest dogs I've seen. <br /> <br /> aka "Wallace and Gromit" - And Batalha dos Vegetais "- Brazil
