I was 19 years old when I first saw this film in the theater. I have vivid memories of another ending. Not quite different, but significantly. I just watched the movie last night, and I was wrong, so I think the following can't be called a spoiler, because it never happened. The end I remember was that the boy was hiding in the house completely naked, Francis Austin found him quite easily, and after she ran into him, she slowly knelt and fell on him from the camera. Only his face was in the frame, and it was quite obvious that he allowed this to happen, albeit against his will. But nothing like this appeared in the film. Sandy Dennis was 32 years old when she starred in this film, Michael Burns was 22 years old. In the film, he complains to his sister that Francis is doing too much for sex. Yeah? Well, then, so go to sleep with her dude, and get it over with. WTF?
