Where to begin. Should I say how good the cinema is. Do I praise certain scenes that show directorial creativity. I'll tell you how realistic the scenes on Ellis Island are. Is it worth mentioning that for a change we do not have a cliche to view the Statue of Liberty. (Now immigrants, looking at the statue from the railings of the ships, is a cliché). <br /> <br /> What I don’t like is two main things, one of which is a modern song score and not even suitable for download. > <br /> The second and almost deadly film is boring, it moves so slowly that it would be better to watch the paint dry. <br /> <br /> Duration 118 minutes is too long, but the film seems unfinished. We do not see scenes of this family in the USA. Our hero mentions that he wants to find his twin brother, I would have liked the scenes of his useless, perhaps happy search, and not other lengthy scenes. <br /> <br /> There’s almost no film. <br /> <br /> Ratings *** (out of 4) 81 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
