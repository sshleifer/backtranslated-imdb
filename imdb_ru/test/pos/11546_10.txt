When I first watched this movie, I thought it was a very strange movie. But I know that the director almost always has a goal when he makes a film. So I decided to watch it again. The second time I saw him, I realized that Albert Puin is a very talented and very original director. At the beginning, the viewer was told that the film took place ten years after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. But they had clothes and cars with designs typical of the 1950s. They had plutonium, which I think is a symbol of futuristic trade. I think this means that the real time of the movie is not indicated. The music in the film creates a long music video that tells some parts of the real story in the lyrics, especially for entry and exit. <br /> <br /> Albert Puyn uses a red and blue background color when he shows symbols of communism (red) and capitalism and the western world (blue). You can see that Ice-T has the name Mao (communism) and that when it is in focus, the back color is red. American policeman starring Burt Reynolds is always shot with a blue background. The club where Mao and his gang hang out also has a red color. Mad Six is ​​between red and blue. <br /> <br /> The white little dog that Mao had at the beginning symbolizes, it seems to me, the controlling force. In the beginning, Mao had a dog, and in the end a policeman. I think this symbolizes the fall of communism and the replacement of the capitalist thinking of the Western world in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I think that “Mad Six” is a very well-made film. Albert Puin creates a science fiction / action movie with political depth. This is another, but very special film about the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing another exciting film about Albert Puyne.
