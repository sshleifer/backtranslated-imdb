The storyline for this game is very sharp, when it seems that the authors of the games were trying to find ways to justify how the character appears in certain areas of the world map in Tales of the Soul. At the same time, this is the only thing that I feel for the game. <br /> <br /> The beginning of FMV is impressive with breathtaking scenes and new interesting devices, such as the ability to create and create your own character and your own. Discipline martial arts. There is even a second story mode, which compensates for the clumsy storyline design of "Tales of Souls." <br /> <br /> Parts of FMV during the "Tales of Souls" are also interactive, where you can decide the fate of your character. a certain degree, which is an interesting feature. <br /> <br /> With a variety of character combinations that you can create, in a variety of ways that you can explore in Soul Tales and Sword Chronicles, this game Any Beatem up / RPG fans have some fun !
