This is not what can be called a happy fairy tale. The titled lead character (Edmund Purdom as an Egyptian) does not get a girl - although he (?) Obviously gets the “last” word, otherwise the main tragic figure (Michael Wilding as a politically short-sighted pharaoh) ends tragically, and not that guy ?? even if it is Victor Mature, all the marble wins. Peter Ustinov may have gotten a better role (Kafka) and may have possibly stolen some, if not most, of the film, with the exception of Gene Simmons with top scores as somewhat smarter than the average barmaid (Merit), who just more on the ball ?? intellectually and spiritually than everyone else combined. <br /> <br /> The pensive and pessimistic doctor Sinuha (this is Purdom) is portrayed as a dark, cynical, exhausted soul who spends the whole plot ?? his life, seeking the meaning of "life." (By the way, paraphrasing John Lennon, “Life” is what happens when you make other plans.) I apologize for the lack of philosophical depth in the preceding comment in brackets, but in the end the story unfolds to reveal just that! <br /> <br /> And speaking philosophically, as if things are not so gloomy and not negative enough, John Carradine (like an unnamed grave robber) appears as a cameo in the midst of a film. that Life, in principle, does not make sense and is worth living as a bad alternative to a possible final disappointment. <br /> <br /> So here we have over 200 words, and I really didn’t have a kind word, so why the hell did I rate it so highly? Well, this is a lot of Shakespeare's tragedy and a lot of moral values. There are ethical contrasts, true friendships, true and unrequited (almost) love, and - despite the limitations of the production capabilities of the 50s, it works very well (sounds), pleases both the eye and the ear, and develops very well / evenly . The game, for the most part, is equally very good. Considering that this is a costumed drama of the 50s, and the interactions are plausible up to the fatal flaws of the characters - which are plentiful, and in this pay tribute to the best Greek tragedy. <br /> <br /> There is some atonement, sinuhe opens and hugs his son ?? played by Tommy Retig, who, despite Ustinov’s best efforts, really needs Lassie to cope. Several other "lost" souls get their desserts ?? Nefer (Bella Darvi) 'alien' meat sweat apparently in Egypt on a visa to get a job for carnal exploitation, which had previously been cruelly even mercilessly rejected by Sinue - \ and \ - dikei princess Buketamon (Gene Tierney as sister of Faroa Wilding) was known a deep dark secret about the origin of sinuhe, and then tried to use it to turn him against his friend, her brother Pharaoh ?? Good people, yes. <br /> <br /> Purdom performance is truly something to see. It takes dirt well enough, so somewhere before the end of the pixel you want to hit his pussy, grab his lapels and say: “Look, you fool, pull yourself together, the glass is not half empty, it is half full! "and then discovering that you are personally disappointed in Horemheb - indeed Sinuha's best friend (Victor Matre, the main soldier of Faroah), because he has that lack of character that prevents him from succeeding in achieving something positive. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the secret of the entire film is that it reaches very quickly and then withstands the necessary “suspension of disbelief” and at the early stage makes you understand and worry about the characters, taking care that you really feel sorry for them and their lost chances of happiness; happiness that was in cial is not too far from their understanding. <br /> <br /> ?? I can not understand why this is not on the DVD, and I hope that it will soon fix.
