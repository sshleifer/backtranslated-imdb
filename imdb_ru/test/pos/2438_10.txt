Well, I don't know much, but I liked this movie. In short, it was creative, with humor, simply and sincerely. In other words, it was all that was intended. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds around the girlâ€™s first love (as the name implies), and I certainly must warn you: do not expect anything challenging or provocative of the subject here. I mean, this is a children's cartoon. This is actually just a simple story, but it is well told, and it holds your attention well. <br /> <br /> In the end: it's short, it's funny, it's cute, it's simple, it's good.
