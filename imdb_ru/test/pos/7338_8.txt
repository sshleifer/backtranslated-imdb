"Gymnast" unfolds in short frames and short scenes, revealing his characters and messages over time. Backup editing is accompanied by a beautiful, simple score. This intimate approach is perfect to feel that you are on the path of discovery, as well as the characters. <br /> <br /> Inconvenient approach is also its disadvantage; There are several scenes that are confusing because they do not have enough context. There are some decisions made by characters that seemed rather unexpected, until I looked at the interviews that were in the bonus material. I'm glad I did, because the descriptions of the actors of their motivation gave me a more comprehensive understanding of the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> In addition to the story itself, it was great to see women so comfortable and strong in their bodies. The shot was tasteful; very factual. It feels like you see a love story and an unfolding life story, not a movie about voyeurism. The physicality of the athletes - their realism - contrasts strongly with the sometimes ethereal character of the plot. <br /> <br /> Not a film that I will need to see soon, because the storyline is simple but its delivery is powerful enough to stay with me for a long time.
