Virtually no experience in the movie can not be compared with a good thriller with a sense of humor. Gina Davis is a schoolgirl-housewife suffering from amnesia. She even on PTA! But then a car accident awakens the woman she was before, and she is HOT! Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious, like a low-rent private eye who is trying to help Davis to find her past, only to find out that he is on his way. Davis also has some fun lines, and the interaction between her and Jackson works surprisingly well. <br /> <br /> Look for Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lechter, and David Moors finally managed to get rid of his television image in St. Elsewhere. The director of the film is Davis' husband, who seems to have built the whole film around her, but it works. <br /> <br /> I take out this DVD and re-record it often. I still love the makeup scene. Gina hot or what?
