All reviewers make one big mistake. This film could not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It was created for children and teenagers of the late 80s or early 90s, and therefore it really was a film of its time. If you hated this period or love the first film so much that you can’t even joke about it, then it’s rubbish, but only because it’s not meant for you. The low budget here and the failure of Beastmaster 1 at the box office (which lacked up to four million with a budget of nine million) were obviously reasons for discarding the seriousness of the original and delivering it in our days. You can complain about history, dialogue or logic, but again this was done in order to run and not win the race. If the film tried to take himself seriously, it would be a complete failure, but he did not do it for a second (in “our” world, Dar sees the cinema advertising The Beastmaster 2, enough is said). To paraphrase Clint Eastwood from the Filthy Harry film: this film knows its limitations. This is more comedy / parody than ordinary adventure. The soundtrack (at the time) was also great. The actors also do not take themselves seriously, so even the usually annoying role of the “spoiled rich guy” (which young Kari Urer played very well here) turns out to be good. <br /> <br /> So, if you feel nostalgic about the cheese culture of the 80s / 90s or you liked the first part, and you do not mind going for a piece of cheese, you will get great pleasure from this attempt to revive Dar in 90s (literally). This is not the continuation of the first, and do not watch it if you want it. It is rather a fantastic sequel to what if. <br /> <br /> With regard to the question “why a different dimension, and not just another time?”: When in history, we had such tall winged humanoid creatures that sucked a flash of a bone (from the end of part 1)? By the way, the film ends at the zoo due to an attempt at a cheap (cash) big finale. This is supposed to be the best place where Dar can show all his movements (he is an animal manipulator).
