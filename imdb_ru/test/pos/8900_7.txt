I was a big fan of Asterix comics when I was a kid and watched everyone. I had never heard of this movie when it was released, but I watched it with my children last night. I remembered the comic well enough to know that much has been added to the story of the film. Some of the changes I thought were a bit commonplace (for example, the “modern” dances of my nephew and the daughter of the Viking chieftain - almost everything in her), but most of them seemed pretty funny to me. Most importantly, seeing the reaction of my children, they confirmed that the film was liked by its target audience. As a family film, it works better than other Asterix films that I have seen. Many of the titles that were not in the book that I found had the same appeal as those that were. Overall, a pleasant family movie, regardless of whether you are an Asterix fan or not.
