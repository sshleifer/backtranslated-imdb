This is a very moving film about life itself. The problems faced by a person with disabilities in a country that expects perfection, are highlighted so that everyone can see and, I hope, understand. This should teach the fanatics of society that we are all people, and although some of us are endowed with the mind, heart and healthy body, there are decent people in the world who are not so lucky, or maybe we are not lucky. We do not always see beauty in the world, because we are immersed in our "blind" ambitions, and we see it only in one light, "what this world can do for me !!!". Maybe we all want us to be like Radio, a loving happy person ... who loves everyone.
