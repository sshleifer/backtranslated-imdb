Peter Strauss, by the nature of appearances in mini-series and films created for television, often receives an unjustifiably large number of bad reviews - usually from casual viewers who watched the ten minutes of the movie, jumping into the channel halfway through. Well, I just read all the other 20 reviews of this film and I am glad that I have not said a single bad word about the "Mile of Jericho" - this should be enough for you to blow it up to buy this film !! <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss received an Emmy for his role in this film, and watching it even once shows you why he deserved it. <br /> <br /> In an effort to be objective, I tried to criticize this film. Instead, I found myself arguing with each of my possible quibbles. This is what is true, realistic filmmaking. This is not your typical Hollywood sensationism, when everything is overestimated - it is so realistic and believable that people think it is based on a real event !!
