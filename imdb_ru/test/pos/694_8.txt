The submarine used was NOT Varyag! In fact, they were two boats, the P614 and the P615, both built for Turkey by the Vickers Armstrong in Barrow-in-Furness, but held by the Royal Navy throughout the war. The P615 was sunk, but the P614 was eventually delivered in 1945. <br /> <br /> No doubt there was confusion because someone looked at P61 (like me) and found Varangian! When in fact the last figure of both the P614 and P615 was actually only shaded ... <br /> <br /> There are some very realistic moments in the film. These Turkish boats were very similar to the S-class. Since not a single S-class submarine has survived, their footage (like P61) and the depot ship "Forth" are now part of an interesting recording, as well as a great movie.
