Who would have thought suicide could be palpable for everyone? I saw the movie on SXSW at its premiere, and it turned out to be the best to date. Yes, it is distorted and strange, but it makes sense in the world that the director creates (Michael Parness). If you didn’t laugh (most people did), then you just don’t understand, and that’s a damn shame. Of particular note is that Guillermo Diaz as Hector steals a bunch of scenes, and the chemistry between Natasha Lyonn and David Krumholz is intense. The film resembles one of Harold and Maud, but not quite, it requires one strange turn after another, and they all make sense in this crazy mixed world in which we all live. I stayed (like most) for Q & A afterwards, and what was great was to hear that the same things that I thought in my head as to why things “happened” are the reasons they did . I don’t think you can say a lot of bad things about a movie, unless you understand it. I think I got it, and it seemed like most others did as well. The film is called a suicide comedy, but it has a lot of hearts, a lot of laughter and a lot of hope, but it also does not shy away from the horrors of suicide. A cute little film that should attract attention when it comes out, which I hope will happen sooner rather than later.
