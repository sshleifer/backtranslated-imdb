In childhood I was tormented by nightmares with the participation of Sesame Street and the Muppets. I liked the programs, but when I was sleeping, I dreamed of dolls that did not look like the ones on TV ... but not exactly the ones on TV. <br /> <br /> They spoke gibberish, laughed and sang while they were eating each other and killing each other. They bit their pretty flesh felt, and it was torn apart, accompanied by arterial bleeding. FINE! But it was in the past ... I love this show! I saw Peter Jackson “Meet the Feeble” a few years ago and wondered why there was no such work there. Well, here he is, like a sick, perverted and somehow socially powerful gaze of the old Hobbit. <br /> <br /> If you like this show, and you haven’t seen MEET FIBL, buy it on Amazon or any such film source. Waiting for you treat. <br /> <br /> By the way, Clarence completely kicked Triumph's dog ass.
