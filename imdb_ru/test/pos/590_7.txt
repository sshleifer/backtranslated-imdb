If I appreciate the film, maybe a little high, you can blame it on feelings. This is one of the first films that I remember and watch with love. I saw it at the entrance here in California in the late 70s. I was already a big fan of “Muppets” on TV, so I was interested in the film, and the film did not disappoint. In fact, he takes the whole absurdist appearance of the Muppets and transfers it from a vaudeville to a road film. Kermit Frog is in search to become famous; not because he wants to take a bath with champagne and ride a private jet, but because he wants to "make millions of people happy." Of course. <br /> <br /> Along the way, he picks up all of his beloved mappet friends, especially cute Fonzi-Bear, whom he meets in a dirty bar and makes himself standing. They sing "Movin 'Right Along", a song that has always fascinated me with its raised melody and theme of friendship and joint discovery. He also meets enough Hollywood movie stars to play in the Stanley Kramer film, including comedian celebrities like Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen, Milton Berl and Mel Brooks. Brooks, in particular, is a bit boring, and you have the feeling that Henson could have cut a few such cameos if he had not been afraid to offend the stars. In any case, as it should be in a film about a road trip, the very first person he meets is House Deluxe. <br /> <br /> The Finale is one of the strangest examples of the literal destruction of the 4th wall, which you will find in any “children's” film. The Hollywood dream seems to be crumbling around them when the real rainbow permeates the Hollywood set with its genuine joy and mystery. I’m sure this should have been related to some of Jim Henson’s personal or spiritual experiences. <br /> <br /> This is the best film with Muppets in general. If you or someone else wondered why dolls were so popular back in the 70s, considering how bad the films have been over the past few decades, I think this film is at least old enough to give a hint .
