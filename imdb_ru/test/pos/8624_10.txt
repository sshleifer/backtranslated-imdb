with what they had. John and Caroline were very private, so the writers had to put together everything they could. I really liked Portia de Rossi as Caroline, but Jacqueline Bissettâ€™s voice annoyed me. She had to use her usual voice. I would prefer the whole film to focus on John and Caroline, rather than on paraphrasing what we already know about John.
