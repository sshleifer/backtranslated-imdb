Mute Witness is a modest, but very solid thriller, which never received proper attention and good comments. Film ?? written and directed entirely by Anthony Waller ?? tense, action-packed thriller with black comedic aspects and terrible influences. No meaningless chatter or endless plot twists - just a mystery. Mute Witness talks about the vicious topic of “snuff films” and is effectively deployed in Russia *** SPOILERS *** Since production costs are cheaper there, the American film crew temporarily moves to Russia to make a horror movie. Old hangar is used as a place to shoot a movie. The female makeup artist of the team is accidentally locked at night and, trying to find a way out, becomes a witness to the recording of an authentic snuff film! She is caught and tries to escape, but since she is mute, she cannot cry for help and cannot explain that she saw the police properly. The girl's life is now in real danger, since there is a whole network behind these films and they don’t want the witnesses to be alive ?? *** Final spoilers ***. Mute Witness contains many extremely exciting action sequences and is quite bloody. Some of the mysterious clues are kept secret until the very end. Regarding a similar theme, I would say that it is definitely better than the better-known 8 mm, directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Nicolas Cage. The acting game in Mute Witness is not great, but the leading actress (herself Russian) looks very cute. Sir Alec Guinness also looks special. And very cool, I can say. It is surely recommended with guaranteed fun and frightening.
