Many of the comments made by others were very informative, and I join their calls for the release of the film Porgy and Bess, the 1959 film. <br /> <br /> In my early teens, I joined a record club, and this album was one of the free ones I chose to join. I knew that some voices were dubbed, but only Robert McFerrin was recognized on the album. I think my daughter recently bought a CD from Austria. The quality is excellent, so it bothers me why it is available in Europe by CBS Records, Inc., when I was not lucky in local stores. <br /> <br /> Actually, I have never seen the movie, but for many years I asked local video stores to get it. Now I know why he was never available. <br /> <br /> I add my voice to those who recognize heirs of property and rights, and that they agree to release it, no matter how imperfect they perceive it - the beauty of music and history has reached many of us who have never experienced have this. <br /> <br /> Trudy
