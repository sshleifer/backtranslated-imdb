Who are the people who play the main role in this thing? Never heard of them !! But this is one of the funniest comedies I've come across. This should win the Puck Puller prize for parody. The absurdity begins with the fact that Dr. Jakle sniffs his powder and turns into a sexual villain. At the beginning of the film, he is haunted by a nurse, led by a libido, in one of the funniest scenes in the film. Note the PA hospital system in the background; rather like a system in a mesh. In the final scene, where Hyde accepted the award, I laughed for years. Oh ... and the "Busty Nurse" is Cassandra Peterson, who later became Elvira, the Mistress of Darkness. <br /> <br /> If you liked Mel Brooks’s classic films (“Burning Saddles”, etc.), I suspect you will like this movie. <br /> <br /> Damn, shame, you can't make a DVD anywhere. <br /> <br /> Now it is available on DVD !!!!! Good thing the dvd doesn’t wear out !!!!!
