I'm not a great TV man ... but when I saw the main episode of Greek, I could not wait for the next week! I don't miss the show ANYTHING! <br /> <br /> THANKS GOD for the DVR! LOL I'm in love with Cappie ... he behaves like a bad boy, but he is so cute ... Everyone has his own character, so we have almost all types of people. You can still add Latino and chubby people. <br /> <br /> I did not go to school in the United States, so I never liked the idea of ​​fraternal houses and similar things, so when my husband told me about a show that I didn’t pay attention to until he asked me to see him, and since I had nothing better, I agreed. I laughed so hard the first night when I just needed to keep watching it. <br /> <br /> So ... I'm with other people who voted to continue this show! I will hope for a second, third, and who knows how many more episodes! This is a really good show, very fun and interesting!
