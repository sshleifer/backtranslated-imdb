Some of these Soviets predicted that all this was dreamed of the main character’s best friend, although a friend whom he had not seen for 20 years. I do not want to dismiss it out of control, but it raises some viable questions. Why was the telephone engineer - or the shoe seller or the butcher for that matter - WANT to create a mythical world and weave it around a friend who inhabits it in the process with a set of equally mythical support characters. With the imagination of what is good, a friend should write, not dream. To dream or not to dream, and the obvious candidate is director Paolo Sorrentino, who created a very watchable world in which Toni Servillo makes silence a visual art. We are asked to believe that Titta La Girolomo (Servillo), who is more than forty years old, “upset” the mafia several years before we met him, and as austerity he is actually a prisoner in a small Swiss hotel, from which he goes every week to a local bank with a suitcase containing nine large-sized mills in used banknotes. In addition to this weekly trip, he can do whatever he likes, and what he likes to do, is to smoke, play cards with a man who is deceiving, and with a wife who reminds her husband of how far they have fallen in society, and ignores Olivia’s friendly suggestions. Magnani, who spent two years trying to get a smile and / or "good evening" out of it. For the most well-known reasons that are incompatible with a person who is not interested in anything or anyone, Servillo spends a certain amount of time every day, putting his stethoscope to the wall of his bedroom and listening to the personal conversations of his card. playing partners. In the end, he responds to Magnani - he must do it, or they will not be a film. This is plot 6f: the one about Destri, who never carries a weapon, or Sean (Duke Wayne), “The Quiet Man”, who refuses to rise to the provocation and fight to the obligatory scene where the gun is tied and his fists are cocked. - but instead of contenting himself with a polite arrival, he takes out 100,000 of the suitcase and buys her a car. The final discrepancy arises when Magnan tells him that the next day at 16:00 he will take him by car and they will go to the mountains to celebrate his birthday. We found that she lives locally, so for some reason she was seen when she was driving from somewhere for many miles, ignoring a police checkpoint to drive off the road and knock over the car. In addition to these inconsistencies, it remains an excellent part of filmmaking with excellent lead characteristics and a very good support.
