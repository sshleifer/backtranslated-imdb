This show came to Canada through PBS in the mid-90s, and then I really enjoyed it. Even 10 years later, watching various news networks, I cannot help thinking about the cynical manipulations that occur in the name of ratings and various “show ponies” that we all see on TV, as depicted in various episodes of Frontline. The scenarios are carefully written, and all the actors have impeccable comic rhythm, and none of them are burdened with the idiotic laughter track. There is a lot of fun stuff here that’s really well done, and we don’t have to say when to laugh and laugh at something. I do not understand why this show has never been filmed in North America as its real pearl! I was really excited to see the available DVDs, although they are in PAL format. I decided that I would copy them to my computer and then look at the converted files. I took a chance and ordered it from ABC ?? After 6-8 weeks I had all 3 seasons. Even better, he worked on my NTSC DVD player. I suspect that any player bought in the last 2 years and using xvid / divx will play them. Quality goods! After 10 years, all the episodes are kept very well! You do not need to know anything about Australian politics to get humor, since all this will be familiar to Western audiences. My wife and I had a 10-day Frontline festival, and we still laugh weeks after watching all 39 episodes.
