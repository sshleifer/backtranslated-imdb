<br /> <br /> My favorite science fiction, an incredible trip through distrust and distortion of reality. Probably the best performance I've ever seen is played by Jude Law. Incredibly original, with interesting events in the character and storyline that unfolds and unfolds so quickly that after the film is fully aware of its genius, it takes several minutes.
