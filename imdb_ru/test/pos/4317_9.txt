Watching the last 2 episodes, I remembered the TV supplement from my childhood. He showed a wild west, very dusty and dry, and there is a small salon, a man enters the bar / lounge, he feels thirsty like hell, cracks in his lips, etc., he just passed through the Nevada desert and did not drink water for several days. He croaks to the bartender: "Give me a bag of potato chips." While he eats him, we can feel how much he craves, in the background there is a voice saying ... "Continue to build up this thirst, build up until you can" hold it still ............. then take it down with a TEAM "A person drinks a TEAM (soft drink) Feels like a few dozen bags of potato chips, the thirst is so strong that I can no longer hold on, season 2 has more turns than the 1st season. Final answers to many questions, but asks many more questions, I hope we will find out the answer in the 3rd season, but Iâ€™m in doubt This is because I feel that LOST has a momentum going much further than 3 seasons if people behind the camera continue their good work. <br /> <br /> I, for example, will continue to watch. <br /> < br /> From Pakistan with love
