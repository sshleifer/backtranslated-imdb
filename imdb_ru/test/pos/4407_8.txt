I saw Knowledge for the first time during the Thames TV Marathon at a local independent station in Los Angeles when it was new. I really liked it along with the danger of UXB. <br /> <br /> The fact that the film, which I saw more than twenty years ago, should be so well remembered in my memory, is evidence of its originality and quality of performance by the actors. <br /> <br /> I searched for a copy of the DVD here in the US, and found none. I finally played and bought a British DVD from Ebay, and was pleased to know that it does not have a region code. So those of us who would like to see this little gem can get a copy.
