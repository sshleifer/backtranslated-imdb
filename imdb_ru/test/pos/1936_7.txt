This relic before the “Code of production” and “Office of hay” appeared - this is fun, not great, but exciting. <br /> <br /> Based on the Rogers and Hart song, which was a huge success at that time, the story Around the dance hall is the girl Barbara Stenvik, who is supported by rich businessman Ricardo Cortes (who was indecently handsome), but whose heart belongs to her book neighbor Monroe Owsley. She and Owsley get married, but keep it a secret until she dismisses Cortes, who still gives hope. She helps her hubby to get a job with Cortez, but married bliss quickly turns sour when Oosley develops a taste for high life and goes out with her beloved student and plays gambling on the high-stakes bridge (Yes! I know, this is pretty funny .. ..). In the end, he assigns $ 5,000 to Cortes and is about to leave when his faithful wife goes to Cortes ... and I will not say anything more, although the final, of course, was unexpected. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is the best thing in this film; in one of her first roles, she quite reached. Owsley weak spot; he is unattractive and whimpers, while Cortez is surprisingly courteous and sexy, while his playing is serious, but unremarkable. <br /> <br /> Although supposedly a drama, it is full of laughter, many reckless, because some elements of this film are very old bad. But there are many good witty lines; At some point, Stanvik says to Cortes: “My brains are in my legs, and you have in ...”. This is damn impressive for 1931! In this film, many wacky and suggestive things in recent days before the Code approved and all whitewashed. Funny antiques, a good reminder of how far we have come in 70 years ... this story can be very easily changed to fit for 2003, but it could keep the main story with the original ending in place.
