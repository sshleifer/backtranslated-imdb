This picture is an interesting saga about the struggle of the pioneers led by Daniel Bun in the Cumberland Gap Desert when they are threatened by hostile Indians. The treacherous Frenchman is the cause of all the problems between the settlers and the red people, while Boone is trying to convince the Indians that the pioneers only want to build houses and live in peace. The film has a certain appeal, because it is not a polished production, but there are good action films, albeit somewhat cruel for its time. The cast consists of actors from Group B, but they are all good, especially Lon Cheney as an Indian leader. Bruce Bennett is fine, like Bun, but too harsh and soft to be believable like a border guard. The dialogue is fairly banal, but the scenery lends itself to the realism of the Kentucky bush.
