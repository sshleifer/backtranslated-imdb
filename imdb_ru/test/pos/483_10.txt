I first saw it on TV in the Thames and loved it. Subsequently, I saw a horrible article written by someone who, of course, did not watch or listen to it. So, I bought a copy, and then I bought another copy! The only thing sad is that it is not available on DVD PAL VHS or Region 2. The Australian version is great, but this one is better! I could buy another .............
