The House of Dracula was created by the end of the Universal horror cycle in the 1940s, and I saw it a couple of times. <br /> <br /> Mad Doctor, Edelman breeds plants for whey that heals people. Count Dracula arrives to cure his vampirism, and Lawrence Talbot then comes to see if he can cure him of becoming a werewolf in a full moon. Then the monster of Frankenstein is discovered, and Edelman returns him to life just as the villagers descend into the castle and set it on fire. Talbot, now cured, and one of Edelman's female helpers safe. <br /> <br /> As in many similar films, we have a hunchbacked helper and a thunderstorm to keep moving. <br /> <br /> The actors included the horror generals Lon Cheney, Jr. (Wolfman), John Carradine (House of Frankenstein) and Glenn Strange as a Frankenstein monster. Also starring Onslow Stevens (“They!”), Lionel Atville (“The Vampire Bat”) and Martha O'Driscoll. <br /> <br /> “House of Dracula” is a must-have place for all old horror fans. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
