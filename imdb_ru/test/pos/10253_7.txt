In the early 60s, in a dramatic film about coming of age, in Chicago, we will follow a group of high-class friends who will experience the highs and lows of their lives. The two main characters are Leroy "Preacher" Jackson (Thurman) and his best friend Richard "Cochise" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs). Both of these boys have a promising future. Propich is a great writer, but a lazy student, and Kochiz has just received a college scholarship in basketball. When they don't hang out at a local diner, shoot dice with their friends, hang out at a friend's house or chase girls, they skip school, ride trains through Chicago or go to weekend parties. /> <br /> Something goes wrong when Prop and Kochiz make a mistake by contacting two hoods and setting off for joy in a stolen car. The police are chasing them, and they are arrested. But thanks to the efforts of an interested teacher (Garrett Morris of SNL) they were released. But these two hoods are not, and I swear to take revenge on Propich and Kochiz, thinking that they blamed it all. <br /> <br /> This film is very episodic, but it still works, because this is what life is, a series of episodes. Some funny, some sad, some romantic, some weird. The film is never boring, because all the characters are so well played and realistic, and the situations are all believable and comparable. For example, Prop romantically pursues a beautiful girl or party that becomes violent when an asshole decides to start a fight, or deals with a silly younger brother or sister. But even when the situation does not correspond to personal circumstances, such as guys pretending to be police officers working undercover, lure money out of themselves so that they can invite all their friends to the film, it’s still funny. <br /> <br /> “Kuli Khai” became the basis for the classic 70s sitcom “What happened!” which was broadcast on ABC from 1976-1979. Despite the fact that the series is best known for the character of Roerun, he is not in this film, nor is there any other character like him. The humor of this show was very broad, but still funny. Humor “Cooley High” is more believable and therefore more interesting. <br /> <br /> Also, the soundtrack is wonderful. The classic songs of the period from Diana Ross & The Supremes, The Temptations, Martha & the Vandellas and Smokey Robinson sound throughout the film, adding to the fun, youthful, exuberant tone of the film.
