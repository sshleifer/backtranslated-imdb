When I first saw this film, it was around 1956, and although I saw it again recently, I did not change my mind about it. I think it was the best film by Robert Ryans because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real life (my father), although he never killed anyone, but he suffered more during the Second World War, which made it worse. It was so appropriate to be necessary to him in humor just to pass and live the day. (My mom and brother had to do it). When I saw Robert Ryan depicting this type of person, it was a very good imitation of this type of person, and I was impressed.
