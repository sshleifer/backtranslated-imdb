How can people give this film a low rating. Incredible. The performances of Wilkinson and Watson are so full of dignity that I can only imagine that these slanderers were brought up on blockbuster and porn. (If this sounds bad, it's because I just wiped my original version 400), I was so impressed with Tom Wilkinson. Everyone greets the guy. This is a performance of considerable subtlety and massive craftsmanship. His development as an actor from Full Monty to this performance masterpiece is amazing; one of the best things that have happened in filmmaking over the past ten years. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson is somewhat less imperious because of the shine in her eyes, which says: “Do you see me? is that cheeky woman here? You can't guess what I'm going to do next, because I don't know either! It seems that she can not show us in every role, but, nevertheless, she is an actor of amazing abilities and presence. She is very sexy here, as she should be, and honestly play with her for it: this is the quality of the screen, which I usually do not have in previous films. <br /> <br /> How are you? It is quite possible that Rupert Everett demanded to play something at the end of the 30s of the upper class that can give teaching aids at the Ph.D. to hell because of total egoism. " He is so skinny here throughout the film, however, I’m worried about him. The housekeeper, Linda Bassett, is also excellent: a small role, but with a big plot twist, it makes you wonder how many talents we have in Britain in terms of acting. I want to see more of her. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the storyline; This is quite an interesting story, considering that no one in the cinema seems to be trying to convince Joe Public that there is nothing new under the sun, although in the last “video” he does not go to the melodrama of the 40s. But never mind, this is an amazing 80 minutes worth of anyone with half a brain money. Congratulations to Julian Fellows with his first directorial work: o how we need more such films. He shows a lot of skills in terms of adaptation of the original novel, tells the story with great efficiency and subtlety. And also congratulations on the witchcraft of Mr. Tom Wilkinson. What kind of freak. <br /> <br /> T.
