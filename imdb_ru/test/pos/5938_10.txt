If you liked the series "Diagnostic Murder", you will love "Murder 101". It's great to see Dick Van Dyck again in the secret of murder. If we are lucky, this film will be the beginning of a series or at least a series of films. <br /> <br /> In this film there were definitely remarkable and prominent actors playing roles. But it was not like the "face" of the movie. It was really a story that made you forget about the glory of those on the screen. <br /> <br /> I guessed the finale and was so pleasantly surprised that I had to watch it again! This is a must see for any secret lover or Dick Van Dyk lover!
