“Regard of Flight”, written and performed by Bill Irwin, is a real classic theatrical piece that is very well translated into a small screen. Full of quick and sparkling dialogue and some of the best physical comedies of the decade, he is a cut above 99% of Comedy as it is presented today. I am sure that one day he will take a worthy place in such wonderful shows as Fantastic and Waiting for Godot. Why it is not on DVD, while the mystery and tragedy.
