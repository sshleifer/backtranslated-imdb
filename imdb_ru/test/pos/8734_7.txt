When I saw Lauren Bacall playing CACTUS FLOWER on Broadway, I never dreamed that one day I would see an actress like INGRID BERGMAN who would play the role of Bacall on the screen. But here Ingrid does release his hair for some good comedy moments, as the dental nurse pretends to be Walter Mattaw’s wife, so he can continue the fiction he told Goldie Hon. <br /> <br /> This is a story that is played for a laugh from beginning to end, a good-natured material that never runs out of dry humor and wit during the whole time. There are a lot of one-liners or jokes that are far superior to the usual comedic plots that everyone hears on TV - the lines ring true because they blend so well with the characters and their motives. <br /> <br /> Like Duffy, who considers (first) suicide because of her unfortunate affair with Mattau, Goldie Hawn (only after she became the star of the TV series “Laugh in the Film”), she plays the stupid role blondes It's easy to see why she won this Oscar Supporting Actress. <br /> <br /> Ingrid surprisingly plays a rare comedic role, although there are times when she seems too stupid for this role. In any case, she is an amazing choice to play as a nurse, who arranges freezing in the office, but lags far behind the work. <br /> <br /> Being a Goldie’s neighbor named Igor, Rick Lenz feels great and fits her in this final scene. <br /> <br /> Mattau plays the role of a character who became his share in the trade, in all those Neil Simon roles he had, an attractive guy who was caught by his own turmoil when he tells a lie after a lie. <br /> <br /> This is such an awesome comedy in which you will laugh out loud at some of the funny lines that Abe Burrows and IAL Almaz managed to put together, based on the French farce.
