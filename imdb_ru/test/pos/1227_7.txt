Good, boring or bad? Good. Is it worth your money? If you can save it on a ticket, of course. Better than a trailer, it seems? Yes, strangely enough. <br /> <br /> There is nothing special in the script - the guards working in the armored truck company spend huge sums of money. The guards see the opportunity to resign as millionaires, one of them is too honest to agree with all this, and a well-thought-out plan goes to hell. <br /> <br /> This could be a poorly executed Reservoir Dogs ripoff, but the skill of the cast and the directorâ€™s ability to do something tense pull him out of this world and put it on a solid foundation.
