I cannot tolerate people who comment on this program or other HBO programs as “too graphic” or “excessively graphic” or that they contain “unwarranted nudity / violence / sodomy, etc.”. <br /> <br /> Guess what? Prison life is not PG-13. “Unwarranted” graphic content is the REAL LIFE of this situation. The prison contains rapes of prisoners / murders / drug traffickers and showers. If you do not like it, do not watch the program. Of course, I am not a fan of prison rape, but if he were left out of the show, I would be surprised and gave the show less confidence. If the prisoners did not curse, it would be just silly. Of course, this is obscene language, but it is REALISTIC. <br /> <br /> The show is good, some viewers ... not so much, I suppose.
