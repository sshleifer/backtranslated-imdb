Hitchcock's excellent thriller with Robert Cummings, proving once again that he can really break out in a storm. <br /> <br /> This time, he is a defense plant worker who finds himself in a terrible conspiracy when his best friend was killed at the factory. <br /> <br /> Priscilla Lane is a girl who suddenly becomes interested in Cummings when the plot thickens and is being chased from California to New York. <br /> <br /> The rich group of the 5th is contemplating the devilish conspiracy Columnists destroy from within. It is known that Hitchcock played in the higher echelons of society, involved in chaos, during his long career as a director. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the film is falling apart at the very end. Although we see what happens to the guy who killed Cummings’s friend, we don’t see what happens to the rest of the gang, again, many of whom represent the top of society.
