The gentle and ingenious film seems to have lost sight of the triviality ... and, frankly, the story is a bit shaky and light as a drama ... but I feel simple surprise and joy in scenes depicting the first impact. The new art of an alien and skeptical society has a radiance and the naturalness that captures the age-old romance between cinema and the audience is better than any film in recent years. Extremely sympathetic performance from Jared Harris (who seems to have inherited the full charisma of his fathers ... hopefully without Richards' poor tendency to ascend and rudeness) ... and Yu Xi's charming unusual appeal from the costume come together to make it a real warmer. The shining photo of the location (including the glowing beautiful scenes at the Great Wall) and Ann Hu's empathetic guidance give the film an extra effect. In short, the need for anyone who has ever been fascinated by the shadow, flickering in life ... and doing magic in the dark.
