This movie is really a classic movie of the 80s! Must be in any collection of films of the 80s! Weapons, Bad guys, CRIPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and other CREATIONS !!!! <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the best movie Death Wish. Tons of nonstop action! <br /> <br /> And in the continuation of the classic film of the 80s, the “bad guy versus the good guy” - this film is about anything, but not about the norm, and about weapons and CREEPS! We see Bronson mow down the thugs and creeps with the help of the 30-caliber machine gun of the Korean War! HEAVY DUTY MACHINE! When Charlie runs out of ammunition for a heavy machine gun, he runs to his crib and picks up his long-range pistol! This gun can stop a monstrous ELEPHANT, and Charlie with his help makes holes the size of a cap sleeve in the bad guys! And if this is not enough, Charlie also packs an anti-tank grenade launcher, which, by the way, is good only if he can put CREEPS together. <br /> <br /> In this film, "ha." “Excellent,” and there were many actors in the film (mostly playing CREEPS)! The film is loaded with memorable plots and plots! Damn, my favorite scene / scene where the leader of CREEP confronts Brozon in prison and calmly explains to him: “Tell you what I'm going to do ... I will kill the little old woman ... just for you! ... catch it on the news in six hours. "<br /> <br /> Is this movie violent? Damn it, yes! But you will laugh and juggle all along !!!!
