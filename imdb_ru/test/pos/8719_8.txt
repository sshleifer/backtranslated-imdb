Another “old but kind” one, at about the same time as Out of Towners, is Cactus Flower, with a great cast: Goldie Hawn, in her first film (Preliminary Faces), Ingrid Bergmann in one of her later. and always funny Walter Mattau. This story is about a dentist who pretends to be married to make excuses for not marrying his girlfriend, which leads to the need to come up with a fictitious wife for proof. He persuades his secretary (Bergman) to take on this role, which leads to numerous comic disasters and amazing romantic twists. It's in the same vein as the Doris Day / Rock Hunter comedy. Fans of those - like me - will love this movie; if not, do not worry.
