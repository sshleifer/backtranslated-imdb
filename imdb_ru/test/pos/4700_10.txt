Helen's Sister is an excellent documentary about a tough, intolerant, dirty, bitter, flattened (peaceful) nun who runs a shelter for drunkards and drug addicts in a very rundown area in the south of the Bronx. All but one of the 21 residents are drunk / drug addicts. Robert, the only middle class? He had a real job, a house and even a bmw ??? regrets that she died before he could reprimand her. What for? <br /> <br /> Robert, like six residents, was released on parole. He complained that Helen was holding a huge stick over him and constantly threatened to surrender him if he did not drive her to the cow. In an interview with "extras," he said that Helen ran the center to compensate for the death of three men in her life ?? her husband and her two boys. <br /> <br /> Husband was an alcoholic and died of a heart attack at the age of 55. One boy died from a heroin overdose, and the other was stabbed to death at 15 years of age. Helen had one daughter, from whom she left the center to run. Daughter was not happy. She wanted her mom. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is how little Helen changed. Outwardly, it seems that she made a huge change in the sea. But after watching this exciting and disturbing video several times - once with the directors' stories - it became clear that Helen replaced 21 drug addicts with the post of chief to replace her three dead men. <br /> <br /> Helen admits that she ignored her children and spent every day in bars. But her authority, intolerance, and a sharp tongue did not appear at the age of 56. Living with her must have been extremely difficult. Even Robert says he stayed clean despite Helen. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the fact that Elena cruelly humiliates a person who wants to live in a shelter. Supposedly, she is showing her street wit. On another occasion, she publicly humiliates Mel, her “helper,” who hasn't bathed in a whole year. Then she waves it with a dirty pillow in the air. The film is viscous with Elena, threatening and humiliating people. Her author's song "My Way". Her favorite phrase: "I will be frank with you." Often, people using such phrases are opposed. <br /> <br /> Residents are really not in themselves. Only Robert has any market skills besides pushing a broomstick. All of them desperately need a roof over their heads, and Helen, since she controls this place herself, has the right to accept or evict the one she wishes. She does not have a governing board to answer to, and she does not receive government funding. This is her show. <br /> <br /> Helen believes in a sad approach to sobriety. She stopped drinking cold turkey, which means that everyone else can, too. She blames drugs or drunkenness for substance abuse, and not the main problems that made men drink and take drugs. She is not a psychotherapist, just a housewife who dyes her hair, wears a habit, has full power over her tenants and quit drinking. <br /> <br /> Helen also manages her prisoners, demanding urine tests (she says so, urine) on request. Twice the major, a very solid and respected long-term elderly citizen whom she trusted, did not pass the exams. Elena was furious and evicted him. The major stood his ground and said that the results were wrong because he never took heroin. Helen did not give up and could not understand that a mistake could be made. This was particularly disturbing, as she had known the Major for a long time. Yet she devalued her relationship with him, suggested that he was a liar, and relied entirely on the results. The major eventually discovered codeine in cough syrup, which appeared as an opiate. Helen never apologized publicly, but allegedly made up with the major in private. <br /> <br /> Helen also had a very bad reputation in her old neighborhood. She tacitly confessed to Robert that she hadn’t slept one night to trim someone’s bus. The person offended her and certainly deserved to have his / her tires cut. She was not a good woman. So, in the end, she decided that the only way to keep Travis's name (her last name) alive ?? since three men Travis died ?? should have started the Travis Center. <br /> <br /> For some residents it was very profitable. They submitted to Helen and in return received a cheap, safe, sober and structured place to live. One, however, said he preferred prison. Drug addicts and drunks do not need to be treated like children. Elena used the "old school" methods that were discredited. However, no one was forced to stay in the center, and for some it was definitely a positive experience. The Travis Center is not a treatment center. This is a place of residence for alcoholics and drug addicts who need to fix something. <br /> <br /> To get the full experience of Sister Helena, check out all the additional interviews, as well as the audio version, in which two directors share their experiences of living with Sister Helen and her guests.
