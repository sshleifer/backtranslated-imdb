Twenty years after watching this movie, I'm still quoting things like “Look between two giant melons,” or I will start singing “Pabst Blue Ribbon Theme”. On the other hand, 20 years later, I can now understand the "Meat Machine", as there are still many similar stereotypes that they used for this film. These are signs of a good movie for me. I could say that this film stands the test of time, which I cannot say for many 80s films. I continue that this film is still on the list of many people's favorite films when it grew up in the 80s. If you like games, and you dream of becoming a “Master of the Games,” or you can’t wait to go through 80s films to relive your childhood, you need to watch it. In addition, it is sometimes sarcastic and funny. But one thing is certain about this film: if someone ever invites you to “Great Night,” it doesn’t mean X or an acid trip party, so prepare for Midnight Madness! Oh, you will see. Everyone will die to play! hehehehheh.
