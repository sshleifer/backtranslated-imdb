I agree with many other reviewers here. It was a great film and an even better novel by Robert Fish. Unfortunately, I believe that the author died before he saw the film. All performances at the highest level, with three principles (John Glover, Ben Cross and Veronica Hamel), it would seem, created for their roles. The exteriors, both in Europe and in Israel, seem very authentic, and the 4-hour mini-series was just right for telling this story. Fortunately, I REALLY recorded it when it was on TV, and since then I have enjoyed watching it. Without hesitation, I can say that this is true to this day. I gave him a grade of 10. If you havenâ€™t read the book yet, you really need to find a copy of it. It will be an outstanding film that will be released on DVD with additional material that can easily include interviews with actors.
