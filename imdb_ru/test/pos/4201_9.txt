Whoever plays the role of J. Douglas Williamson on the strip poker scene, he does a wonderful job. Apparently, he did not receive credits. Very sorry. <br /> <br /> All the children from the impasse do their job well in this 1939 record. It is strange to watch them in a western setting with their Brooklyn accents (I think it should be Bowery). They even show some swimming skills. <br /> <br /> I think there are many special scenes that can be left with the viewer of this boxing / love / crime story. My favorite is now on the fight scene at the end of the film. Busby Berkeley shows his dance film experience when John Garfield shifts his legs, and when we watch this movement, the camera rises to his face. I will not give up why or when, but the expression on his face at this moment probably put the 1939 spectators on their feet in theaters. <br /> <br /> Some will think that John Garfield is very similar to Frank Sinatra in many scenes. Just his face. In fact, Frank has not yet made films, so perhaps Frank looked like John. A boxer named Smith in the film looks like a clone of Ed Begley Jr. <br /> <br /> Now I have to tell you something that is not a spoiler, but if you watch a movie, look at the hands of the grandmother. May Robson performs well. It seems her hands wander a little. In the scene where she and the crowd enter the boxer (John Garfield) locker room, watch her touch the lying John Garfield when he wears only his chests. <br /> <br /> Great finish. Lots of great characters. <br /> <br /> The best line could be at the gas station: "... eight gallons, that's twenty-eight dollars ..." Tom Willett
