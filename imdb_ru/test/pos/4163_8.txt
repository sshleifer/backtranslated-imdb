I never thought I would say this about a biographical film, but there is almost an excess of characteristics (especially regarding Kenji Miyazawa’s emotions) and too little about the literal occurrences in his life - by the end I’m not sure if he will die (he should) or his sister will finally die (she should), or if the director has spent too much time on the Galactic Railway (this is an internal joke, in case you missed it - Miyazawa wrote a children's book called “The Night on the Galactic Railway”. Nevertheless this glimpse to the writer's mind, who “drew poetry and fairy tales from his imagination,” is very clever, creative, interesting and emotionally powerful. <br /> <br /> All this, despite the fact that everyone is animated like animals (as in many Miyazawa’s stories). <br /> <br /> Some of the visual effects are truly striking, especially considering that this was done for a television film. Seriously, some of them (as a sequence with birds reaching for blue light) compete with parts of Fantasy . However, I still can't stand computer animation when it is mixed with people animation. CGI trains are terribly obvious - even more so than Anastasia's trains. <br /> <br /> 8/10
