This film was one of the best I've ever seen. Just the other day I was reminded of this movie something on TV. It came back to me like a dam flood. I have never been so touched by a movie like this one. After the film ended, I could not cry for more than 2 hours. No movie ever touched me like that. I was 15 years old at the time of the film, and I have not seen it since then, but I hope that I can find a copy to buy it to watch it at any time. If someone offers you to watch this movie with them, GO ... you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Peggy Fries
