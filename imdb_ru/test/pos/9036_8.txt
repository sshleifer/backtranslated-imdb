I described this film as amazing ... it's true in many ways. Thematic material (a black person is wrongly accused), characters (people whom you expect to be stereotypes, often demonstrate uncharacteristic views during the film), production ... <br /> <br /> All these factors create an unusually refreshing character of the film , especially for its time (1949). The only possible spoilers are sometimes a foolish dialogue and sometimes a high moral position. <br /> <br /> But if you come across this, when you donâ€™t plan to watch a movie, you may end up like me - stay up in the middle of the night to see what happens. <br /> <br />
