I really liked this movie, it definitely keeps you on the edge of space. It was very well directed. I think it was important that they show the life of another couple, as well as Terry and Bobby, and show them as people with emotions. Because this film was supposed to show Bobby as a cold and vengeful man. <br /> <br /> I agree with another review that it was sick love, not true love. He did not need to commit murder to give his wife a child. He had to be honest with her and tell her that he was barren and decided to adopt a child together. Some reviews say that she was naive, I think she was when it came to adoption, no matter how good the actors were. Great movie to watch!
