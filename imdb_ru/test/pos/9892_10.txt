When I first heard that the subject of Checking Out was a suicide suicide party, my first thought was how painful, tasteless, and then comedy. I was skeptical, but I was completely wrong. I really liked it. Cast, funny liners and especially unexpected finale. Suicide is a delicate matter, but it was handled very well. Funny yes, but gentle, where it should be. Checking Out also deals with other common problems that I believe many families may face, and this is connected with tact and humor. I highly recommend checking out. MUST SEE. I look forward to his release to the public.
