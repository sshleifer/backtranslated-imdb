You can say that this is the first sentence of the Director (who also wrote it), but you can also see the potential this guy has. This is clearly a low-budget film in the spirit of “The Boondock of Saints.” Of course, the Boondock Saints came out a few years after that, so you can look at it as a diamond that needs some polishing. The game was good - if you're looking for De Niro or Michael Madsen in a crime drama, remember that these are young guys playing young guys trying to be criminals. They are not going to be "super cool" (tm) like some of the veterans. I would really like Justin Pagel (Joe is the main character) to continue making more films - he was great at it. Good movie - 3 stars out of 5.
