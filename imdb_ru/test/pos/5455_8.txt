*** SPOILERS *** This film shows the brutal bloodshed caused by the resignation of Johnny Carson to determine who will be his successor. The imitations of David Letterman and Jay Leno are performed by John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck in a satisfactory manner, although the performances were not very good. Renee Santoni is the best execs performer (he plays John Agogliu from NBC), and Warren Littlefield (played by Bob Baliban) comes second. I was shocked at how Littlefield impatiently discussed the question of dismissing Johnny Carson. It was Johnny Carson! This scene demonstrates the unreasonable world of television "what you have done for me lately." Kathy Bates presented the best performance of the film as agent Jay Helen Kushnik. Another commentator claimed that Leno was portrayed as a simpleton in the film. I disagree with respect. Relationship with Kushnik bordering on something similar to domestic violence. She orders him to tinker, and when he eventually turns against her, she tries to play a sympathy card (mentioning her dead husband and son); however, when Jay breaks off their relationship, she becomes violent again, shouting, “Don't leave me, you two-faced bastard!” before breaking the picture on the floor. In general, the film is funny, and I would like it to be shown more often.
