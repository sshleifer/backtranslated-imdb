While many give it up for movie B, this is really a first class comedy that is well written and played. Red Skelton is great in the role of Wally Benton, better known to hams as The Fox. Ann Rutherford is as lovely as Wally Carol Lambert's fiancé. Konrad Weidt is a very well-abandoned criminal gang. I read one story about this film, which says that Vincente Minelli made this film, unless he changed his name to S. Sylvan Simon, who shot all three films from Fox. This is a very interesting film, shot when imagination is encouraged. Therefore, if you have one, overcome your black and white prejudices, sit back and enjoy a truly magnificent comedy. It was also Red’s first lead role. Notice the climax of the reference to the Orson Welles broadcast of The Wars of the Worlds.
