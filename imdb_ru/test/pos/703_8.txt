Probably because it is Columbiaâ€™s first color film, the colors look different, especially indoors. They seem stronger, sharper, and the result is a bit unreal, but very pleasant. Randolph Scott is the sheriff, a good guy, but the real star of the film is a very young Glenn Ford, a criminal who wants to change. Evelyn Case is the woman who begins to fall in love with Ford, and Claire Trevor is the countess who runs the salon. There is a funny character called Nitro who does not think twice before blowing it up. I especially liked the two moments of the film, one of which is a terrific crush on a horse, and you see thousands of horses, at that time there was no computer to help, so I guess they collected all these horses, not an easy task. Another point - the final shootout, technically very good. There is also quite a fist fight. Seeing this Western, made in 1943, with such magnificent battle scenes, you come to a sad conclusion: they no longer make them. Can they if they want? I have doubts.
