A surprisingly well-played, well-written film about hard-rock-but-decent young man who received such a welcome ticket for fame: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their vocalist. Not contrived, the film tries to keep things in perspective and does not go beyond; it certainly makes you think twice about those old teenage fantasies about being in the music business. But the script, in spite of a solid dialogue, follows a proven, formal pattern and is frustrated by its own cliches in the final act. I enjoyed it much more than the “Almost Famous” sweet down ball. It has a good, bitter edge to go with its heavy metal demise, but a stronger finish might have made it more memorable. ** 1/2 of ****
