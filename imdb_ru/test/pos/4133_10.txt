Gary Busey was great at rock'n'roll legend Buddy Holly (1936-59). He has spittle to man. Being a garage group in the 50s is definitely different from today. In those days, having a group of three is usually easy. I bet that Buddy Holly (Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, then it was just a quiet provincial town. His parents were Christians, although his mother was an active supporter of her son's work. This is one of the reasons why he did not act like Elvis. He adhered to his good ways. It really makes it good! When he went to Tennessee, he saw how bad the producers were. They hated rock and roll, which distracted Holly very much. Getting used to a different atmosphere was a problem for Holly and his friends. He got on tour with Sam Cook, went to the famous "Apollo", which was quickly accepted by the African American public, I liked it! And Sam Cook made sure that Holly and his group received some kind of service. This is what I call tolerance. It is sad that he, Ritchie Wales and J.P. “Big Bopper” Richardson lost their musical career as a result of a plane crash in 1959, at least their memories will live in our hearts. I don't understand what inaccuracies were in the film, all I care about is that Buddy Holly overcame the obstacles of music and politics at the time, and the music is almost perfect. For Gary Busey he was perfect in the role, as well as in making music. GOD BLESS YOU GARY BUSHI! 5 STARS!
