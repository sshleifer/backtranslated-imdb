A few thoughts before I get to the bottom of the film: 1) I had never seen so many bare breasts in a film shown in so many non-sexual scenes - it was strange; 2) Joseph Fiennes, where have you been? You fascinated us in “Elizabeth” and “Shakespeare in Love”, and then left for a while. Mainstream American wants more! Well, I'm an English teacher in college, I've read this play many times, and maybe this is the best version of the film I've seen. While some aspects of other productions may have stood out, this is a general package, compiled well. Pacino is not Olivier, but he doesn’t need it, so accept it! The cinematography of the film is amazing, and not only because of the naked chest. Venice is depicted amazingly, and you really feel that there really is. Portia Residential Island is strikingly beautiful, and the lighting is always tinted for the correct mood of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Anti-Semitism in this film / play is difficult to discern, especially at the end. Pacino falls on his knees and squeezes his religious artifact, perhaps his most powerful moment in the film since the “Godfather III” * (when Michael's daughter is shot on the opera steps). Is the game anti-semitic? Of course. * Othello * racist? Of course. Take it for what it is: a commentary on the Elizabethan era, not a comment to date. <br /> <br /> Fiennes is underused in the film, but it's still nice to watch. With women in the film, everything is in order; here no one really stood out, but they are in perfect harmony with the landscape. Jeremy Irons and Pacino are excellent in the two most juicy roles, opponents to the end. I always felt that Irons was underestimated (I still feel the chills when I hear his voice from the “Lion King”), and Pacino - Pacino.
