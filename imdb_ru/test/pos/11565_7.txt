This is a cute little French silent comedy about a man who puts another, who can not stay in this castle for an hour due to his pursuit. And, as soon as the guy enters the house, it looks more like a crazy happy home or maybe the consequences of LSD !! While there are ghosts and skeletons, there is a strange menagerie with strange special effects and gags. It's terribly hard to describe, but only visual effects make the film worth seeing. HOWEVER, understand that the most indulgent director also had a lot of “funny jokes” that completely failed and damaged the film. His “camera stunts” were not so cunning, but annoying and stupid. IGNORE THESE AND CONTINUE LOOKING - everything gets better. The film is dynamic, fun and worth seeing. In particular, I really enjoyed watching the game and robbery of Max Linder - he was so expressive and funny! It is a pity that today it is almost forgotten. For an interesting but very sad reading, see the biography of IMDb on it.
