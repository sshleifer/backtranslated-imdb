Being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange", I certainly had no doubt that I should have seen it. However, I put it off for too long, because some of my friends refused it with comments like “extremely boring” or “nothing happened”, “a complete waste of time”. But when I saw on the Internet images of the mysterious black monolith, I was allowed to see the exquisite experience of 2001: Space Odyssey. I had no doubt that I was going to make this film that evening. <br /> <br /> This turned out to be the greatest visual experience in my life. Of course, watching a very good picture or a picture can be wonderful, but watching a film created with the same virtuosity in each frame adds a completely new dimension to it. My God ... I really like my friends, but it’s a pity that I can’t share with them the very thing that makes my heart jump with excitement and makes my spirit fly like a bird in the sky. That, my friends, is beauty. As this film shows, beauty is terribly undervalued in our technologically advanced, intellectually small, consumer-oriented Western fast food societies. This does not mean, however, that I reject these rapidly developing societies or look down on them (like Kubrick), but only that they can be much more if only people stop for a moment and spend a little time absorbing the beauty. the world in which we live. And what is the best opportunity to do this if you slow down to the elegant pace of this film and allow yourself to be in this place between waking and sleeping. <br /> <br /> When we go to this place, we can get the so-called “natural maximum”. This is what our spirit can do whenever we meet with pure and boundless beauty. And never in my life this “natural high” or “spiritual orgasm”, as some call it, or “samaddhi”, others have not shown so intensely. Yes, it is more intense than a normal orgasm ... in fact, several times more intense. Many religions claim that this particular feeling proves that they are right. They are right? For me, a direct answer to such a question would only diminish the impenetrable fascinating secret of the universe. In my opinion, the film is trying to convey the same riddle through the image of a black monolith and states the following about it: “With the exception of one very powerful radio emission aimed at Jupiter, the four millionth black monolith remained completely inert. Bowman is experiencing the same thing as me when I look at these gorgeous visual effects. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that the mystery may disappoint those who need direct answers from fast food to large ones. ontol geological questions. But instead of giving us consolation, we are constantly irritated by the awareness of the simplifications contained in these answers. Doubts and discomforts that subsequently arise will make us point to our deeper intellectual activity as the source of all these troubles, as a matter of fact, we only have our simple answers, but this film shows us that when quick ontological statements give rise to only doubts, we can always rely on phenomena to give meaning to the world. From the moment you realize that beauty is something that can really be presented to us as a phenomenon, and never as a “thing in itself,” the mysterious black monolith no longer bothers, scares or irritates, but instead becomes charming, charming and perhaps even comforting. We do not need an answer to what really exists to get in touch with one of the greatest forces in our life. When we can let the secret become what it is, even embrace it, we can finally put our souls in order. I am almost certain that a film in which there is so much beauty and philosophical and artistic depth will never surpass. Especially now, when the greatest director who ever lived is no longer with us.
