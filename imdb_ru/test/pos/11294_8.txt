I saw The Born last night, and I have two opinions about the film. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I appreciate him for completely reversing the film of Michael Bay. No dialogue, highly stylized, grainy black and white photography, some of the worst images ever created for the film, and a very convincing use of sound (which, it seems, no one has noticed). This is a reflection on the topic, and she dares to go where most filmmakers do not only in terms of images, but production and concept. This is a movie that most people do not understand, and if you read these comments, you will find many people whose inability to understand this film leads them to cry for “pretentiousness” with the rumble of gibbons. bars his cells during feeding. It really shocked and shocked me, and the last time the film was able to do it some time ago. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is a thirty-minute short, which stretches for an hour or more than half. I understand that there may be an artistic advantage in using repetition and monolithic stimulation as a baton, but in this case it simply does not help everything to be held together. Imagine that a battered person is approaching you on the street, who grabs you by the shoulders and says something that completely confuses the core of your being ... but then, instead of leaving you broken and loose, he just keeps talking and talking and talking. By the end of the film, I looked at my watch again and again. <br /> <br /> This is not entertainment, folks. This is entertainment. Here's how you deprogram the people who just watched Glitter. If you watch movies for fun, it will upset you, confuse you, and possibly annoy you. You do not come to the “Born” as a chocolate cake that you want to eat, because it is delicious. You approach this, like something on a menu you have never heard of before, something you see with secretive glances through the kitchen door, something dark, glistening and jerking on a dish; something you order is not because it will be delicious, but because you just need to know what it looks like.
