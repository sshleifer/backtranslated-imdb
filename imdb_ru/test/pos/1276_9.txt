The maze of Chris Nolan, like noir about voyeurism and identity, is striking from beginning to end. The first film is as complex as "Memento" or "The Prestige", although it may be a little harder to understand. Nevertheless, it smells of originality and creative aspiration, and possesses a “twist” both intellectually complex and realistic. Few filmmakers have used their editors so well and the attention to narration that Nolan has. The story of a bored writer who likes to follow random strangers down the street until he follows someone who has noticed that he is following others and followed him in the tern, from there the complexity increases and identities begin to be rearranged. More naturalistic and realistic than Nolan’s later works, but as sharp as a razor.
