Chaplin enters the trenches of World War I in this energetic comedy that never diminishes the horrors of war. Rain, mud, explosions - all this is present, but Chaplin, it seems, strangely does not notice them all. He is in France on the one hand: to fight the Germans, something that he does with incredible success. <br /> <br /> This is almost like a long ego trip for Chaplin - very funny, and to the last minute when it rises to a new level of acuity, and everything makes sense. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is what all soldiers dream about before the start of the war.
