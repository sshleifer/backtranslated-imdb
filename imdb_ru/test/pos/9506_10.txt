As noted in other reviews, there are several missing videos from this collection, but what is on this disc is staggering. There are two separate soundtracks, the original recording and a completely reworked new version of the performance. Any new music from Residents is welcome, and I suppose for the first time a listener, the new version may be more comfortable for the ears, but I prefer original recordings (probably just because they are “originals.” Production of this DVD all this is interesting, the live video is probably the least interesting of what is offered (although fragments of live recordings hidden as Easter eggs are most welcome). This is not a tenant, this is a collection that you must have. Enjoy.
