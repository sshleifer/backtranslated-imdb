I like Tom Hanks, and he is one of the few actors who will drag me into the theater, despite any concerns I might have about the film. I’m worried about Mr. Hanks’s return to the “light comedy”, because it was in this arena that he switched from television to film - remember “Big”? Well, "Charlie Wilson's War" is not an easy comedy. This is a political satire, and at the same time an extremely well-written political satire. The screenplay is the star of this film, and Aaron Sorkin’s blacksmith’s work is one of the best deals this year. <br /> <br /> Mike Nichols spends the whole escapade together, presenting a film that penetrates a very fast 90 minutes (time is all in a comedy, and there is nothing funny if it delays). The choice of Nicolas in the sets and the lighting also very much resembles the TV of the 70s and 80s, this step was deliberately used to take root in the story. <br /> <br /> Return to the use of model work and stock photography has ended. digital special effects also increase retro-look and credibility. A note for designers when choosing material for video: I know the difference between the F-16 and MiG, as well as Bell and Hind. But it could also be part of the joke. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in Philadelphia. It was interesting to watch and listen to the audience, NOT to receive historical links to their history. The story tends to repeat itself because repeat offenders have forgotten what happened the first time. Kudos to both Mr. Hanks and this chameleon Philip Seymour Hoffman. Sorkin's script is brought to life by these actors, and the entire production team is at the top of their game. <br /> <br /> I wholeheartedly recommend.
