Much has already been written about the film itself, so instead of adding noise, I just want to say a few words about the two actresses. <br /> <br /> This should be a stunning prospect for any actress. in a sense, to play a major role in comparison with the spectacular Monica Bellucci, but Roman Beringer does this for sensational purposes. The film with Monica Belucci in the main role, where I fall in love with another girl ?? This should not be. <br /> <br /> This was said a thousand times, but Monica Bellucci amazes the saddest person in modern cinema. I have never seen such innate sadness before. She would be out of place, breaking the heart of Lon Cheney.
