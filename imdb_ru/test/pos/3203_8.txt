Killing Yard is a great movie, though at times uneven. Morris Chestnut makes a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and convicted prisoner, and the presence of Alan Alda as his protector is nothing more than a genius. Emotions and rough reality, depicted in the scenes of the "memories" of this film, are able to put the audience right in the center of the events that they depict. I was not even born when the riots in Attica took place, however, thanks to extensive research, I discovered that the Killing Court made the history of all its fair judges. I definitely recommend this film for viewing by any educational or activist group as a very necessary educational tool.
