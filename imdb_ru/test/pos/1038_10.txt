I recently published this series on IMDb, giving the snail's e-mail address in the commercial department of BBD, where you could write an appeal. I wrote to this address, mentioning Sam Waterson and his popularity. I just received the following reply: <br /> <br /> From: emilyfussell@hotmail.com Subject: Oppenheimer Date: May 14, 2006 13:44:00 MDT To: kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> < br /> Dear Kate, <br /> <br /> I work at the BBFC, the British equivalent of MPAA, and we classify DVDs and videos, as well as films in this country. Anyway, at the moment I am in the process of issuing the certificate of the 1980 mini-series Oppenheimer. Exploring the work on IMDb, I noticed your post and thought that you might be interested to know that the work will be out soon (hence the need for a certificate). <br /> <br /> I don’t know which company is distributing it, but keep your eyes on it! <br /> <br /> Regards, <br /> <br /> Emily +++++++++++++++++ <br /> <br /> Cheers! <br /> <br /> I also want to contact Netflix for a second purchase. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew <br /> <br /> kk2840@earthlink.net I recently sent a BBC email asking if their awesome Oppenheimer series ever came out on video or DVD. I could not find it. I received the following reply. If you are writing a BBC, be sure to mention that Sam Waterston is very popular in the USA. You can also enter "Oppenheimer (1980)" on amazon.com, and also find a field to select the checkbox to request an owner release (BBC) and receive notifications about its release. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrewu kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> <br /> Here is the BBC answer: <br /> <br /> Dear Kate <br /> <br /> Thank you. for your email regarding Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> I was interested to read that you would like to receive a copy of this program that you liked. I checked the BBC Shop and online stores and cannot find a record of its availability. We currently do not know about plans to release this program on DVD. However, if you want to make a proposal, can I invite you to submit it in writing to the BBC Commercial Division: <br /> <br /> Commissioning Editor for BBC Worldwide Ltd Woodlands 80 Wood Lane London W12 0TT <br /> < br /> Let me thank you once again for taking the time to contact the BBC. <br /> <br /> Regards, <br /> <br /> Elaine Hunter BBC Information ______________________________________ <br /> <br /> - ---- Original message ----- <br /> <br /> {Comments:} I'm trying to find a copy of the BBC's amazing Oppenheimer, a six-part series made in 1980 with Sam Waterston from Peter Prince's book / script.
