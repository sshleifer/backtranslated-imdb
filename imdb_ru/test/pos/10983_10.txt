If Hollywood had a good mood for the audience, we would see 20 films a year with the virtuous strength of the spirit behind this film. There are a few examples of personal growth in this film, and although the characters are still very human, even the lessons learned are not that greed will benefit you or do others what you want, as long as you do — well, no, this what our sad, desensitized life needs, more sense ... more love ... do more with others, as you would like to do - you ... more HOPE. (thanks to Ursula!) There is a clever mind in this film, not “your mother’s” cracks, which are spread in so-called comedies. People should feel good. This film will make you feel good and may inspire you to improve your life and the lives of others. sidenote Every person counts when selling tickets. This is a truly independent film. If you want more quality films, you must support them.
