I laughed out loud several times during this movie, although I gave him a quick glance and you would think that it was something completely different. I love the pace and the way it burns slowly in you when you are presented with these stunningly beautiful tables. Andersson gives us something else here. Shows us something that I have not seen since his last movie. He is unique in terms of composition, and because of his way of fixing the camera and letting action act in front of us, it opens the door to humanity, and we look into a place that reflects our own life, our little life. This is a powerful stuff. It is the simplicity with which it allows events to occur that creates the opposite sense of complexity. Everything in front of the camera is not easy at all. Andersson's attention to detail is extraordinary. I believe that most, if not all, scenes are decorations created from scratch in accordance with his designs. I can not recommend this film highly enough. For me, this led me to some place, and I came out of it, seeing the world shabby and beautiful, starched and painful, fruitless and gorgeous. Immediately alien and familiar. This film is brilliant and life-affirming. I know because I came out with a smile, feeling great. It took him seven years. If he only made this film, he would still be there with the great ones.
