The Twins Effect is a vampire martial arts film available in Cantonese with English subtitles. This is Jackie Chan's production, and he does appear as a special guest, although this is not for those who liked Shanghai Noon / Knights and other recent Hollywood films with which he became known, this movie is much more special than this one. br /> <br /> Originally it was called The Vampire Effect, but as the very popular Chinese pop duet called The Twins (Charlene Choi and Jillian Chung) took two main roles, the name was changed to earn their fame. <br /> The film will appeal to three types of audiences: those who love martial arts movies, those who love vampire films, and those who do not like junk movies that Hollywood usually produces. <br /> <br /> The premise for the film is that vampires about and secret society seek to hunt them down before we all become snacks for the undead. This bloody job is done by some martial arts masters who drink some vampire blood to give them the necessary edge, well, it must be a thirsty job! Things go mainly in the course of events, until one particularly unpleasant European vampire finds out that if he gets a set of keys owned by all the vampire princes, then he can walk in the sun, etc. and in general there is, when he wants. More talk about the plot would spoil the pleasure of watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Twins consist of one designated vampire killer (Chung) and sister (Choi) of the other. These are the twins who really make the film; with some of the most fresh and fun acting games. The fighting scenes they perform are quick and furious and well posed with a mixture of genuine athleticism and wire work. To add cherries to the cake, the twins are also very cute to watch. <br /> <br /> The direction is clear, the script is clear. There are only 3 things that let this film down: makeup for vampires is pretty scanty, Jackie Chan seems to be pretty damn in the film and adds nothing to its content, and some of the comedies are a farce from a male vampire hunter rather lame. Fortunately, the twins save the day, bringing originality to the film, usually found only in European films. The best scene for me is one of them (Choi), communicating only with a shout, her ability to convey her thoughts through this medium was comic delight. <br /> <br /> There are many other original features in this film - I especially liked the coffin with the stereo sound and the TV screen! And many original touches and acting skills of the film do not allow him to get tired of the old failure and turn him into a film that you definitely need to watch.
