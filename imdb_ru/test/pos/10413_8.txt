It was one of the best half-hour horror / suspense / fantasy eighties shows, without a doubt. Of course, in each episode of the show it was hardly able to play, and it smelled as much as the production values ​​(i.e. sets) went, but, damn it, I have to give him credit for being bold with the plots. I mean, the plot of each episode was quite sharp, and even I, the seasoned horror film, the shock film and amateur art of the 70s, got a little sick and crawled out. Great show, just great, no matter what other reviewers said here. My favorite episode was called “Bug House”, yes, I think that was the name? In any case, it still gives me the will every time I think about it to this day, almost 20 years after its first premiere. Other shows, such as Tales from the Dark Side, Outer Limits and (of course) The Twilight Zone, were certainly better in terms of production, but, in my opinion, they have nothing to do with storylines. compared to this sick little show! This definitely paved the way for an even more graphic cult classic phenomenon - “Tales from a Crypt”.
