Recently, I was an adult in the Magic Kingdom with my mom, her best friend and my adult sister. Disney World is often mistaken as a place only for children, but when you see quality shows, such as Philharmagic Mickey, you understand that Disney magic is for everyone! It was such a great show that we left the theater, turned around and stood in line again. And then for the third time. It was absolutely exciting. I would advise everyone who goes to Disney World to watch this show, which is not just a show, but a world wind, an exciting trip with Donald, as he once again allows his character to cause him trouble!
