Thirty years before the film “The Deer Hunter” appeared, it was a great meditation on the consequences of the war caused to the American family, as can be seen from the war heroes and their wives. The truly ironic name “THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE” is something different, but since those times have disappeared in still images, and everything that remains remains an uncertain future for those involved. <br /> <br /> Truly, the cast, despite the top of Myrna Loy's Billing, BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE, focuses more on the stories of men. Al Stevenson (Fredrik March) returns to a family that has irrevocably changed as his sons grew, although he finds support from his sweet wife Millie (Myrna Loy). Fred Derry, having returned, cannot find a decent job, despite the fact that he is a war veteran, and he is trapped in a marriage that he does not want with Marie, a happy girl who wants more from life and who hates him more and more Homer Parrish, on the other hand, is experiencing big problems due to the loss of arms in the war and feels that the whole world - including the girl he loves and her family - thinks he is insane. <br /> <br /> With a length of almost three hours, the film never seems long and stretched. Even in small moments, there are so many emotions that the story passes by; due to the lack of editing, nothing is displayed and not displayed on the screen. The performance does not sound false, although Dana Andrews as Fred Derry, Harold Russell as Homer Parrish and Virginia Mayo as Marie Derry are outstanding. Even then, each character has a moment in the film, and it is time to talk about all the pain and suffering that had not been seen in American films before (including those that were filmed during World War I, which did not play around with such topics). Although there is never any obvious violence, all of this is present in the frequently occurring facial expressions of the three male leads, in the area where the planes are now ready to turn into garbage (and, therefore, oblivion), in cynicism shop owners who could not bother these dumbfounded men who saw the battle or, even worse, made them wonder what it was worth. This is a film in which "Coming home" and "Born Thursday July" are required. At a time when America was running away from war films, to come up with it, when the end of World War II was still fresh, was necessary in order to make the film more honest.
