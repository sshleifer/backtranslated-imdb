Remember Greg Bunny? It was this show that began on the Independent Channel, but turned into a full-length comedy series on Fox. My cousin and I thought it was pretty funny, except for the premature idea that puppets are taking stuff for TV PG. Dolls that kill occur in the same universe where puppets live in the same world as humans, and, like us, are engaged in work and their own lives. Let's just say, if you didn’t cope with this, then don’t worry about the PWK, as this show is a profile of 4 puppets who have fallen out of the grace of society due to drug abuse, hedonism and violent criminal offenses only half home. violence, sex and obscene language (so she never gets on American network television). As if the sociopathic puppets were not enough, the fact that this is happening in Canada makes it even more alarming (by the way, the government is paying for it), and I think any American viewer would require a crazier feed for cable television, like this one. I do not know where you can get it in the USA, except for additional satellite television, but I would advise you to try it. Really fun stuff. (Comedy Network in Canada)
