I do not know if this film strikes my heart as it is, because of the feelings of friendship, love, intimacy with others, or the warmth that Babette’s cooking creates, but when the holiday begins for the rest of the film, I often suffocate. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a well-being film, but without a drop of insanity and superficial sentimentality. Please note that plot elements are discussed. The holiday Babette tells his story with restraint and care, and he allows us to discover the values ​​of grace and love. All we need to know is that Babette Harsan (Stephen Odran) was a French refugee who was given shelter by two aging sisters in a tiny community on the coast of Jutland. The sisters lead what is left of their father's flock. He was a pastor of convictions who taught that salvation comes through self-denial. The sisters brought their sacrifices in debt and faith. Those who still remain honor the teachings of the long-dead pastor and his spiritual leadership. However, when they grew up, the tiny community became controversial and controversial. Sisters do what they can. On pastor’s 100th birthday, Babette wants to make dinner for a small group that the sisters will invite. The sisters reluctantly agree, but when they see the supplies Babette ordered, they and their guests feel uneasy. They are accustomed to the usual food of the community - dried cod, boiled and soup of bread, water and a small amount of ale. Although Babette achieved improvements over time, what they see now seems close to godlessness. There will also be a visitor at the dinner, General Lawrence Lowenhilm, who several years ago chose ambitions because of his love for one of the sisters. <br /> <br /> What are we experiencing? There is the severity of the faith of an aging community and stone, swept by the wind cottages in which they live. Warmly by candlelight the little, crowded dining room of the sisters. And then there is Babette's transforming power of mastery, when we watch her cook, watch Eric, the young boy who helps her, serve and pour, and watch the old worshipers, with the help of good wine and exquisite cooking, gradually rediscovering for yourself a community and love and friendship. The general serves as our unexpected guide, because he is the only one who knows what unusual dishes they eat. The general tells the story to his confused interlocutors, the story of a famous woman who was an exemplary cook in the famous English cafe in Paris. "... this woman, this chef, was able to turn dinner into a kind of romance ... a novel in which there was no difference between bodily appetite and spiritual appetite." He also turns into a person who will accept what he has become, and yet will always know the value and love of what he has long decided not to accept. An old couple kisses. Two old men remember past friendships. And Babette, who spent everything she won in the lottery at this dinner, had the opportunity to become an artist, whom she had once been in France, an opportunity that she accepted with love and friendship. <br /> <br /> Babette, now as poor as she was when she arrived penniless years ago, will continue with her sisters. The general in the carriage with his aunt returns to her estate. And older guests leave the house of the sisters to return to their cottages. They stop and look at the clear night sky and the stars above their heads. They spontaneously hold their hands in a circle, dance and sing this hymn ... <br /> <br /> "The clock strikes and time passes forever. Let's use this time to try to serve the Lord with the heart and mind. So our true home we will find. So we will find our true home. " <br /> <br /> They are smiling at each other. Everything was agreed. <br /> <br /> Babette's Feast is a wonderful film, full of restrained emotions, unspoken understanding, wisdom ... and, of course, food that will leave you with a growling belly when you leave the theater. If you win the lottery to afford what Babette did, and have her skill and skill, this is what she served: <br /> <br /> Potage a la Tortue (rich tortoise soup) served with Amintillado stern Bllinis Demidoff au Caviar (small buckwheat pancakes with sour cream and caviar), served with Veuve Clicquot Cailles en Sarcophage champagne with Perigurdin sauce (quail bone stuffed with foie gras and truffle in a puff pastry with truffle sauce, enriched with Madeira), served with Clos with Closse, made with Made-dei-flavored puff pastry and truffle in a puff pastry with truffle sauce enriched with Madeira; , a Gourmet burgundy salad Salad with cheese and fresh fruit Baba with Rum with fruit and fresh figs Coffee with fine brandy
