Crack House (1989) was one of the few films during the 80s that falls into this genre. What should be an anti-drug film turns out to be nothing more than an exercise in the corruption of white people. There is nothing wrong. In the video presentation there is even an anti-drug message from one of the stars of Richard's “The Apostate” Roundtree, <br /> <br /> The film tells about two young lovers in high school. One of them is a quasi-cool guy, and the other is his girlfriend. One of them is received from a mutual friend, while the other is given a trip to the helmet, and later he is given a chance to return to his former friends. Jim Brown appears in the film as “Mr. Big”, he is one bad dude who can still beat someone, and a very sadistic guy who loves to hit his heels and beat the pitch out of those who are trying to defy his word. Luke from the general hospital also became a star as a guest. <br /> <br /> If you like a rough and dirty lifestyle, then this film is for you. Unfortunately, Hollywood does not make them anymore, and when they do, it does not exploit or entertain. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of meanness.
