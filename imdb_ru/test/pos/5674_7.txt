Black Water is a film that in some way surprised me and definitely exceeded my initial expectations. “Black Water” is really a very well structured, unpredictable, exciting, well directed and very creepy movie. The plot is actually somewhat original, and will certainly be intrigued by you. One thing I love about this film is the direction, because basically it’s how it exceeded my initial expectations. My initial expectations for Black Water were that it was just a filmed, acting, directorial, tempo and boring film. It really was not. Well, acting is nothing to praise, because there were times when I felt that they didn’t show enough emotions, and there are some lines that feel just like that written. However, I love the direction, because all its frames seem predictable, but it is not. For example, when you watch a camera slowly take off the water and it goes quiet, you are like a crocodile, ready to attack. However, the crocodile attacks are very unpredictable (which was bad for me, which is not well versed in such films), and this makes you jump. Besides, I just like that this is one of those horror films that does not make you jump, not a sudden strong sound, but a real movie. I also like the fact that the story of people trapped in these trees looked very realistic and definitely did not take my eyes off the screen. I must say that I did not think that the first 20 minutes were good, and I think they made the boat a little harder than it would be in real life. In addition, I did not like how they tried their best to make the situation with the characters look completely hopeless, although in reality this is not so. Once again, I just don’t think that some of the characters’s actions were realistic. For example, I would not go to the water, knowing that it has a crocodile, not to mention the killer. However, these problems are not really so serious, and I could still enjoy the film. In general, as far as films are concerned, I have seen them better, but as for horror films about animal attacks (a genre in which I am easily afraid), this is one of the best films you will see. And of course, it is not perfect, but this does not mean that it is not worth it.
