The slasher subgenre was pretty much exhausted — in fact, even by 1979, just a year after the alleged first slasher, Halloween (released seven years after Blood Coot) was released; the subgenre was far from exhausted; but the tourist trap is one of the most original excursions. The film follows the same basic formula as most slashers - that is, a madman kills many children, but its originality is based on the fact that the madman is shown from the very beginning (unlike an invisible attacker or a masked man), and we get a glimpse of his character. The fact that this killer also has telekinetic abilities, including the ability to control the wax mannequins that fill his house, adds originality. We start with a great introductory episode in which a young man is unable to descend on a flat tire after he was at the horror gas station. The scene is amazingly creepy, as wax mannequins mock him and things fly off the shelves - and this gives the audience a great idea of ​​what is going to happen; namely, a very creepy horror movie! <br /> <br /> Acting authority does not exist as well as one would expect from a slasher of the seventies, but, to be honest; not so bad. The girls look hot, the boys don't matter; and Chuck Connors plays the role of a psycho more than creepy enough. He is not exactly Anthony Perkins; but still, good enough. The star of the show, however, is not acting, and, as you might expect, the eerie atmosphere gets this prize. Wax models, as proven by House of Wax (Vincent Price's version ...), are very creepy; and the film makes the best use of this fact. There are very few things in the movie that can scare just by being there, but wax statues are definitely one of those things. The killer’s special abilities could easily interfere with the atmosphere, but the film makes the best use of this fact, even when various things fly out of the shelves, and this goes well with the rest of the movie. Overall, this is a very good movie. While the Tourist Trap may not be absolutely necessary to view; It is worth a look, and I can recommend it.
