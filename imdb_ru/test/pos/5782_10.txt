The End of Suburbs (TEOS) is a very useful film. It is also important and provocative. It seems that there is no intermediate level with either the film or its main source of entertainment, the anti-expanded Meister, James Howard Kunstler. <br /> <br /> Although I am not a big fan of New Urbanism, I criticize him because of his small vision. In the case of the New Urbanist Peter Calthorpe - another talking manager - you finally hear what is somewhat obvious in and among the special added results of TEOS ... Calthorp simply does not understand peak oil. <br /> <br /> I used this as a teaching tool in economics to understand the importance of land as a factor of production - a fact that has long been weakened in the neoclassical economy, and also as a tool for learning: the peak of oil production, the use of land out of the ground, global warming, food production under threat, public transport - our compromised future <br /> <br /> Move through South Park! .... Made by Toronto Canadians for $ 25,000 and released in May 2004, this video has sold over 24,000 copies by October 2005. One major DVD rental provider recently ordered nearly 400 more copies. <br /> <br /> The End Of Sales in the suburbs actually increased a year and a half after its release, and from September 2005 it will also be available on one of the main online video services. <br /> <br /> Work on the film Escape from the Suburbs is continuing. with possible release by August 2006
