Eve opens her eyes, because we hear magnificent landscapes and man-made music in the background. This film shows a good aspect of the human body, which is God's creation, and if you take it into consideration, viewers can earn respect for the legendary story about Adam and Eve (if this is true or just a fairy tale, depending on what we believe). . Actress / model Inger Ebeltoft imitates Eva so well that there is no good word to describe her performance, and I cannot imagine that Eva was another actress. This film is very useful for me to treat stress. We would never be so relaxed from watching this movie. This film is a masterpiece, God supposedly wanted this film to be made first! <br /> <br /> Mr Razbin!
