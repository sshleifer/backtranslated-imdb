This is a great movie, I watch it since 6 years with my older sister. This is a type of film that you can watch again and again, and still laugh, smile and cry every time you get bored, like in other films. This is a film that will live forever through the generations of the family. I love it :), appreciating 1-10 in my case, I would rate it easily 9.9 each time. <br /> <br /> This is a film about changes in the relationship between a girl (child) and her first boy (Johnny) in the family, about changing the child’s and Johnny’s view of the world during their relationship. br /> <br /> Dirty dancing will live forever like classical music. thank you, sorry, but only for a short comment.
