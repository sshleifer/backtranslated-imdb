I play this game exactly after watching a trailer in an old magazine advertising a CD ... <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting and gloomy atmosphere (absent from modern games / movies). The game takes place somewhere in the mid-90s in a creepy mysterious mansion. You play as Adam Randall, and your task is to free the soul of your father who has fallen into the trap of death. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the game is similar to doom, but it is a completely different type of game. In this old classic game presents a lot of action, various puzzles, quests, mazes and many more interesting locations and characters. <br /> <br /> The game will work only on Windows 98, and there is no XP patch for Windows.
