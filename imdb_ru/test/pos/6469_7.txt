John Cassavetes is on the run from the law. He is at the bottom of the pile. He sees Sidney Poitier's Negro as his equal, and they quickly become friends, forming a kind of alliance against the master hooligan, played by Jack Warden. <br /> <br /> As a person who worked in the warehouse himself when I was younger, I can tell you that the fighting in the warehouse, complete with falling packing cases and slamming hooks, is as realistic as possible. I myself participated in similar battles, although no one was killed. <br /> <br /> The representation of the widow Sidney Poitier is a variation of Shakespeare's Shylock "Am I not bleeding?" This is an anti-racist film that was very necessary at that time. <br /> <br /> All three main characters - Guardian, Cassavetes and Poitiers - are excellent, and Guardian is the most prominent of the three.
