This is one of the greatest documentaries I have ever seen with Dark Days. I skated for about an hour all my life, and I still love this movie. Peralta and his excellent editor perfectly captured this feeling and atmosphere, partly helped with some incredible archival footage. Tony Alva is one of the coolest personalities in the world. Love these sporty striped knee-high socks, rock, Tony! <br /> <br /> This film is not only a visual feast, but the soundtrack must be one of the best in history, if you are into rock of the 70s Buy a DVD, you will not regret it.
