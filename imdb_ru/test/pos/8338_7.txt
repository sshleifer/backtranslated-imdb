Charles "Schick" Sails is absolutely amazing because the only member of the Leeds family is ready to testify against the gangster they saw, the killing policeman and the informant. He fought in Bull Run during the civil war, and his patriotism intensified, even after his son-in-law was beaten, and one of his grandchildren was abducted by a gang, intimidating all the other participants. Fear of the death of his grandson does not justify, he says. In any case, he would not want his grandson to live in a country ruled by gangsters. In this Oscar-nominated story, the conflict between civic duty and personal security ends abruptly. Walter Houston also stands out as a district attorney who threatens the family with perjury if they do not confirm their identity as a murderer in court. The rest of the cast, including Ralph Ince's sloppy killer, is all excellent, and the film is quickly shot by William A. Wellman. There is a good expectation, as sales disappear as soon as the process begins.
