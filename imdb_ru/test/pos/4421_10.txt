Ok, so I used to love Rachel Ray, but now I adore her! How innovative I like that she has a cooking section - I admit that sometimes I miss this part just because it makes me too hungry. But I also like that you can get the list of products the next day on her website. I like the fact that she has permanent assistants and that she made some of her viewers become her permanent ones. I like how she is personable and how creative she is. I also like the way she makes her mysterious guests. She seems much more sincere than many other talk show hosts. She still freezes from time to time, and I like it. I like the fact that she talks about her personal life and reminds people how happy she is. She even mentioned the tabloids before, and it's so funny! She also has the funniest stories! In any case, I am a fan of life. Even my 2-year-old knows who Rachel Ray is, and he loves her too!
