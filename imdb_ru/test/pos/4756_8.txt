A team of brutal fraudulent New York police officers led by hard, hard-nosed Buddy Manuchchi (superbly played by the always-excellent Roy Shader) pursues a group of nasty gangsters involved in the abduction ring after one of their number is killed by them. Directed by Philip D'Antoni, producer of “The Bullets” and “French Communication”, skillfully creates a powerful, rough, sharply amoral, nonsense tone, maintains a constant pace everywhere and sets scenes of action with considerable roaring energy. Don Ellis’s inspirational score further enhances the intensity of the unprocessed sound, while the steep locations of the Big Apple and the coarse, grainy cinematography of Urs Furrer greatly reinforce the general ugly realism. Moreover, the fine line that distinguishes police officers from criminals becomes frighteningly blurred in this picture: the title squad uses the harsh, cruel and morally questionable tactics of a strong hand as a means to achieve the goal of enforcing the law, and, of course, there is no code among bandits honor and the thieves who inhabit the miserable city belly, which is vividly depicted in this film. Tony Lo Bianco's good supporting performances as a worm, whimpering Snitch of The Undertaker Vito Lucia, Richard Lynch as the evil psychotic bully Moon, Bill Hickman in the role of the equally cold-blooded partner of Moon Bo, Jerry Leon in the role of the flatfoot Mingo and Jy Jo Jyo Jyo Jyo Jyo Jyo Jyo Jyo and Jo JoJo. Extremely wild and exciting long car chase "the heart in your throat" is considered a specific event. Climate shootout also delivers interfering goods. This sensational little winner.
