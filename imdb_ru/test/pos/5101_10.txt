I wish I had first encountered this in the cinema when it was first released, as some of the commentators did. This is truly a treasure. Honestly, I haven't seen any other goodbye version, Mr. Chips, and I don't want to. For me, this is a great version. I first saw it on TCM many years ago and never forgot about it. I had the pleasure of watching him yesterday with my girlfriend, although I recorded it with TCM a few days earlier. There were parts of the film in which we both were with tears in our eyes, this is really a touching film. <br /> <br /> And isn't this what films are about? <br /> <br /> The music is beautiful, the film was shot wonderfully. The game is top notch. And the story is delicate and timeless. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite films of all time.
