I think there was too much action at the end? You don't think so, either? There was a romance, an adventure that was just like I said to put 9 on this film, but the scene was too long. I liked Rive a bit. I did not understand why he had to die. I thought that one of the girls would die too, but I was lucky! None of those I liked, died! What about you? What did you like? I saw the movie twice actually. And after that, I bought it too. It was worth it! Who did you like the most? The book was really very cool. Both actresses and actors too. Everything was perfect ....... What was the name of the song at the end? Someone also answer my questions ... PLEASE, please, please?
