In order to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own films, he took a film in Colombia for the Gene Cinema MGM home theater. The cover girl also became the author’s Rita Hayworth film for servicemen and their fantasies about movie stars during World War II. <br /> <br /> Kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn, where Rita is a popular dancer and Phil Silvers is a comic. Of course, Kelly is digging herself a little there. <br /> <br /> Hayworth refers to the millionaire Otto Krueger when it turns out that Kruger loved and lost his grandmother Hayworth. In some episodes from gas-lighting memories, Hayworth also plays his grandmother, and Jess Barker plays the young Kruger. You may remember that Jess Barker was the husband of another legendary on-screen red-haired Susan Hayward. <br /> <br /> Broadway producer Lee Bowman is also fascinated by Hayward, but he is not interested in nostalgia. He wants her to get a Siegfeld Fallis revue, and in fact the largest number of Cover Girl is the title song of the film. It is beautifully made in the style of folly. <br /> <br /> Hayworth will also sing A Sure Thing in the gas era number and in the only song in the series not written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, Hayworth also performs the old song. English Music Hall No. Poor John. When I say to sing, everyone knows how Rita says the words. Nan Wynn sings here. <br /> <br /> The biggest hit of the series is Long Ago and Far Away, presented by Gene Kelly. It was one of the greatest hits of the Second World War era, and one of the biggest sellers Jerome Kern ever wrote. In fact, it happens that this is a favorite aunt who, together with my uncle, will celebrate the 60th anniversary of marriage in September of this year. Long Ago and Far Away were nominated for Best Song, but lost to Swinging on a Star. <br /> <br /> What really distinguishes Cover Girl and what makes it a landmark film for Gene Kelly is the two numbers that I put the Test and the Alter Ego number on. Harry Cohn decided to do what Louis B. Meyer refused at MGM to give Kelly creative control over his own material. Later, Kelly said that the number of alter-ego was one of the most difficult things he had ever done in his career. In it he dances with a pale reflection of himself, and the choreography is dazzling and intricate. <br /> <br /> In fact, after the next Christmas Holidays film at Universal, Louis B. Meyer never rented Gene Kelly for the rest of his time at MGM. And since then he has gained creative control. <br /> <br /> With this dazzling technical cinematography, Rita’s red hair and Gene Kelly's boundless artwork “The Girl from the Cover” was and will remain a classic and forever remain so.
