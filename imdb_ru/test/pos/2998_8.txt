I do not do so many comedies with “robberies”, and I would not give a damn about it if it were not for the actors, when they were made, and when I FIRST saw them (just a few years later). It is almost too similar to what is happening (although this is obviously a much less serious comedy than the one in the film) - the mafia figure takes on its own kidnapping, or rather, completely changes direction. Of course, Raquel Welch didn’t play such a sharp character as Faye Dunaway in “Happening”, but it also doesn’t make him a sexist film - she practically played an ordinary character, almost HIS version of “mole”! But I’m completely biased - this is one of the first films I’ve ever seen with her, and at the time I saw this, you couldn’t turn around without seeing her poster (fortunately). I think that Robert Wagner was really right as the not quite likeable or unattractive group leader, like Edward G. Robinson (naturally) and Vittoria De Sica. And Godfrey Cambridge, the actor who always managed to be funny.
