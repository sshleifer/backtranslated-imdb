Brett Piper again makes a very good film, which was crushed by the so-called "experts". it's low-budget but fun, and the leading lady is very sexy. I wish I could see more Irene Joseph. Enjoy watching, fun. I bought a DVD and enjoyed it. Special effects are motion stop animations, and they are much better than computer nonsense, which they call effects today. I always like Brett Piper films, and if you like it, I recommend Bite Me, Screaming Dead and everything else he did. I look forward to see more of his work, as well as more of Miss Joseph. I just can not understand why this woman was not in other films, because her acting is excellent.
