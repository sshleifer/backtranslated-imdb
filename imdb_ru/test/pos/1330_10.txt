With such an actor, I knew that acting would be awesome. Nevertheless, I was careful, as always with the sequels. Will this feeling of the first film survive? Could they reproduce the tension and thrill of Ocean's robbery 11? We will never know, because they have not tried. At least not the way I expected. Instead, they made an easy and really fun parody of the robbery genre. If you want an exciting, logical robbery, don't watch it. If you want to laugh, with a witty dialogue, bizarre characters and an absolutely ingenious scene where Julia Roberts has to impersonate herself, then you will like the 12-year-old Ocean.
