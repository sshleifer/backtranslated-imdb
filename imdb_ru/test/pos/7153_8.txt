It is always nice to see characters in the film who are kind and benevolent, even when they are surrounded by those who are not. The filmâ€™s moderately foolish premise is that the conservative, religious Franklin family (mother, father, teenager and girl) had an accident in which parents and brother survive the death of death, during which they meet Jesus, a pleasant but somewhat irritated soul which removes from them the burden of "original sin." When they return to their lives, many of their views and attitudes have changed, much to the dismay of their daughter, who did not share this experience. The religious side, I think, is presented with a good balance, from the good (Jesus) to the terribly awful (those of his "followers" who are obsessed with the sins of others and do not notice their own). This is a movie that makes you think, gives you some laughter along the way and leaves you with a pleasant feeling that the world might be better than you think.
