Women will like this movie better than men. Of course, women love all romantic comedies more than men - on average. I generally like romantic comedies, but I thought it was 5.5 for the first 50% of the movie and about 6.5 for the next 40% and about 9 for the last 10%. So, reluctantly, I will rate it as 7. I tape and save all films with a rating of 7 or better, and none of them that are 6 or worse - at least that's my goal. I have more than 1,200 films, so why keep dogs. <br /> <br /> My wife liked this film more than me, although I donâ€™t know why. I'm a big fan of Drew Barrymore than she is. <br /> <br /> The essence of this film was about a young woman who is returning to high school (under cover) to write a story about school experiences in our day. She was a jerk in high school for the first time and must learn to be calm the second time. Her journey toward the cold, and also falling in love with the teacher, is a story. <br /> <br /> In the first half of the film, it was just how much she looked that drove me crazy. I wondered why they chose her for this role, until I realized how much she could look like a dog. So much so that I really don't think I want to see her after 15 years when she gets up in the morning. ARGH! Naturally, by the end she had become a rather attractive (sweet) woman, and she became very popular. <br /> <br /> The end is about 9.9 points on a very nice scale, so you, sappers, will like it. Otherwise, it is not very memorable and easily overlooked.
