Venice, in 1596. Jews are separated from good Christians. Bassanio, a young but poor Venetian, loves a fine portion, a rich heiress. Therefore, he approaches his friend, a merchant named Antonio, for three thousand ducats, to go to Belmont and offer Portia. All the ships and goods of Antonio are busy at sea, so he turns to the usurer Shylock, a Jew of faith. Shiloku does not like Antonio, because he spat in his face. He offers Antonio a three-month loan in no interest, but if he does not pay the money at this time, he will own a pound of his flesh. Also, Shylock's daughter Jessica runs off with Christian Lorenzo. The Venetian merchant is based on a play by William Shakespeare, which is believed to have written between 1596 and 1598. I read the play last summer, and now I saw the film, filmed in 2004 by Michael Redford. I liked the play, and I do not quite agree with the accusations that it is anti-Semitic. The Jewish character does not appear as an inhuman monster. Although he is ready to cut a piece of flesh by Antonio. There is a lot of depth in his character, and all this is manifested in his speech, where he asks: “If you prick us, won't we bleed out?” And so on. In the character of Shylock, there is much more humanity than in the hero Antonio, who spits on a good Jew. Al Pacino is unbeatable like Shylock. He demonstrates such strong qualities. Jeremy Irons is just as awesome as Antonio. Lynn Collins The most beautiful and brilliant in the role of Portia. Zuleikha Robinson copes well with the role of Jessica, and Charlie Cox as Lorenzo is also very good. Chris Marshall plays Graziano, and he does an excellent job with his work. In the role of Nerissa, we see Heather Goldenhersh. Mackenzie Crook plays Lancelot Gobbo. As in Shakespeare's plays, as a rule, this one also contains the most brilliant dialogue. The film paints a fantastic picture of the era. He deals with some great problems in the style of Shakespeare.
