I saw this movie at Christmas, and what a wonderful movie it was! He tells the story of Custer (played by Errol Flynn) during and after his graduation at Westpoint. Although I heard that the film is not very historically accurate (Hollywood never happens), I still liked it, because I still did not know much about real events. <br /> <br /> I thought Errol Flynn was great, as Custer has since become my favorite actor! His game with Olivia De Havilland was great and the final was fantastic! This brought me to tears when he and Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) were driving to death on a small big horn. <br /> <br /> I always knew that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor because he was my dad's favorite actor and I grew up when I watched his films as a child. But only when I watched this movie, I realized how good it really is. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie 10 out of 10 !!
