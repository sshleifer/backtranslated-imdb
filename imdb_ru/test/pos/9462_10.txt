This film is about Viola (Amanda Bynes) and her desire to beat her school team Cornwall boys after they kicked out the girls' team. So she goes to rival school Illaria and joins the boys team, while falling in love with Duke (Channing Tatum), who thinks she is a boy and loves Olivia (Laura Ramsey), who loves Viola as her brother. <br /> <br /> I was in the version of the 12th evening, and the beginning was very modern. So I knew the play well. I was very excited to see this film, and when I saw it, it exceeded my expectations. It saved a lot of my favorite lines, and I could see great connections with the game. Although it was like a play, it was not so difficult. It was also more than I expected, but it was good. It was very funny. It pulls you into a bunch of crazy love stories and lies. You saw how alto (Amanda Bynes) misconceived the thoughts of guys and her difficulties in life in the world of guys. You also see her roommate, the Duke (Channing Tatum), the impression of this. I really enjoyed seeing the characters portrayed in a modern style. He also tells the modern theme of “Follow your dreams,” but this time she has a turn. I think this film was a great film about a girl who loved football and was fond of herself, her family and her dreams. I think this film will be a big breakthrough for many stars.
