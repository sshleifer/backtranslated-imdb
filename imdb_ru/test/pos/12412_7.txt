I can understand why others reacted rather unpleasantly to the climax, leading to a turn that is really difficult to take seriously. I think, however, that building up to it works pretty well. The music, quite threatening and tingling of the spine, really creates a terrible aura, combined with the inexorable sound of a constantly ringing phone, which confuses the struggling English actress Joan Matlin (Jean Marsh). She lends a pleasant apartment to a friend, trying to start her career in New York (... city buildings outside the window look as realistic as that of David Letterman), and is unceremoniously welcomed by a noisy phone that rings very little and then with loud pops on the wall. Looking for answers about who is responsible for such disregard for her sanity, Joan discovers that no one rents this room and that the former tenant actually strangled himself. Without the help of a manager, Joan decides to find out for herself who hurts her so much. Joan discovers that the room is empty, and a telephone with a special female voice that will haunt her. <br /> <br /> I think this episode is the acting force for Jean Marsh, a show for one woman. She is the only visible actress, and we follow her through the crisis, which slowly destroys her, the telephone and the knock from that other room, causing her much suffering, which turn into fear. Instead of leaving, Joan stays, so shocked by the noise and to the limit, where she just wants the phone (or whoever is calling) to stop. The episode provides a possible answer about who is harassing Joan and why. A character named Beth enters the story rather late, as Joan tries to find out whose female voice sounded through the line that knew her name on this terrible phone she found in the room opposite hers. The fate of Beth may simply tell the viewer why Joan is injured. I think that this episode is an exercise in spirits, not in likelihood, some did not particularly like it, but I certainly liked it. I admit that the phone, as a physical threat to "crawl" towards Joan, is difficult to take seriously, not to mention that he attacked her, but I thought that an intensive opening twenty minutes before it was enough cool to make up for it.
