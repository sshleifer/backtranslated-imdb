Merry comedy from the best director of all, Oz Scott. The list of eightieth television icons goes on and on. Milan (Who is the boss), Yoters (Family ties), Stone (Mr. Belvedere), Robinson (Night trial), Jackie (227), D'Abo (Wonderful years), Walston (Mr. Hand !!!) movies in history. Excellent plots, senseless plots, cheesy, bad game. We are talking about a group of schoolchildren who need to pass an exam for drivers. The Night Court Mack requires that they pass the final exam, otherwise they will fire him. Great performance of Brian Bloom as tough guy Rico Conner, but nothing compared to B.D. Kiki Wong (pronounced chi-chi). Great movie for all ages, so bad it is good.
