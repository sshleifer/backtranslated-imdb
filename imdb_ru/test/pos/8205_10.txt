This film is a warning for all people sitting on the Internet on a typical day at the office. I warn you: do not tell too much about yourself, 2 Be careful who you intersect with !! There are spies on the Internet. I thought it was so scary that this combination of man and woman made poor Angela Bennett, I didnâ€™t realize that someone could take their lives with one click of the mouse. Angela, I thought, did an excellent job to outwit Jack Delvin and this horror. Girl, my question is: why does this computer make this noise when it works? like the sound of a click of mine does not do this or that. This film also tells about fraud on the Internet. Why Angela could not make a program to destroy viruses in Internet cafes? I also thought that, like on all computers, the transfer rate to disk was low, which is correctly shown in this film, when you save the program to a floppy disk, the panel moved slowly !!! I really liked Angela's house at the beginning of the movie. Why no one believed Angela ???
