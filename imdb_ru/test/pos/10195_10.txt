The combination of amazing special effects and Oscar-worthy actor makes Vindicator one of the most important science fiction films of recent years. For some reason unknown to me, this gem was found in a trash can, why some worthless person thought it right to pollute modern classics, referring to the trash can, beyond my understanding. I have never been so scared by a man in foil and occasional flashes of fire. Forget about the Terminator, Robocop, Aliens and other films that have clearly ripped off this masterpiece, the Vindicator is an unstoppable force.
