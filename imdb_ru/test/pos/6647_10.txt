I do not remember the film, which so deftly shows the emotional destruction of war, reflected in one marriage. The focus of the film is the union of Ullman and von Sydow - they are in every scene. Throughout the film, they are experiencing a change of roles - one has the power of survival, and the other has an emotional escape through dreams. Both will lose the measure of humanity, but one more than the other. Characters and the viewer go through periods of hesitation regarding proximity - the camera moves away and disappears, the sound disappears, words are lost, only so that the camera returns to the picturesque close-up of its expressively expressed stars. Confusion and hesitation may make this film difficult for some viewers, but all this is purposefully under Bergman’s master-hand. I think that the use of a “fake” war makes the film timeless, just as relevant today as before, and, focusing on human relations during the war, makes the film relevant to everyone. A couple can be anyone. The film is not based on place or time, but rather on emotions. A unique and effective war film, unlike any other. Bergman's films are virtuosic in representing human relations — that he will bring this into a film about war, masterfully.
