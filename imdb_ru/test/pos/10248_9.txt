Do you want a movie that takes you space? Well, this is a good choice. If you were a teenager in the era described in this film — Motown’s hay — or if you want to step back and see what your parents were making so much noise, I advise you to take this film and look at it. With the risk of cliché sound, you will laugh, cry, recall and recall. You will be back at a time when school violence was a fist fight. You will lovingly remember your best friends from school. This is a good film with a sense of fear, pain, and realism — delusions, loss of friends, a decision about what to do with your life. I think that everyone, regardless of race, age, socio-economic status, can extract something from this film and really enjoy it. So take a couple of hours from a lazy day and watch this movie; There are much worse ways you could spend your time.
