Upon learning that her sister Susan is considering a divorce, Kate decides to go to the distant country house of a distraught woman and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, Susan is nowhere to be seen. This is because someone killed her and put her body in the trunk in the basement. When a storm rages outside, Kate tries to figure out where her sister could go, and puts her life in great danger ... the killer is still in the room! Elizabeth Montgomery demonstrates solid dramatic performance in her first car after BEWITCHED. The telecast of Mervin Gerard is based on the story of McKnight Malmar. The story of Malmar was first presented on television in 1962 as an episode of the anthological series Boris Karloff's Thriller. THRILLER held very close attention to the story, which is a bit unfortunate, because it could stretch a bit. Of course, Malmar wrote a moderately creepy number, but Gerard (the creator of ONE STEP BEYOND) adds some clever ingredients that increase tension and tension.
