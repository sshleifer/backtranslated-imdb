This is one of the best action movies I've ever seen. Gina’s tough, nail-like image of Charlie / Sam’s tender mother was superb, and Samuel L. Jackson just makes you laugh until the end, with his classic single liner. Of course, there were several holes in the real story, but this fast pace keeps you on the edge of the seat to the end. <br /> <br /> I felt that Gina was the perfect choice for the role of Sam. / Charlie and her versatility as an actress is evident due to her role as a mother in the recent film “Stuart Little”. Samuel and Gina were well supported by David Morse, Brian Cox, cute baby Yvonne Winter and newbies, sexy Craig Bierko and Melina Canacaredes. This film emphasizes the growing tendency of a strong female character and deviations from traditional male / female stereotypes, when we see Sam / Charlie (Davis) and Mitch (Jackson) rushing from one disaster to another. <br /> <br /> Although I and many others loved this film, it would be fair to say that there will always be people who do not do this, and this is good for everyone. I highly recommend this movie to action fans, for its funny scenes and dynamic action.
