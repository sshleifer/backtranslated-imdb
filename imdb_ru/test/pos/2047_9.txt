Rent it, I have a DVD, I got it for 9.99 dollars. Theft is so underestimated. Of course, there are better films. Films with fewer holes or without them in the plot or action. But I do not have this problem with this film. For me, if the film remains true to itself, honest and exploiting its flaws (and advantages, obviously!) In the name of entertainment, then it has fulfilled its goal. I made me take care because its creators took care. The whole film is ridiculous from beginning to end, but its creators took the whole undertaking seriously, and I did not feel that I was being forced to take the film seriously. And this is so true, because I want to take every film seriously, but many, oh, so much, let me down. Despite all its absurdity, this film is almost perfect and absolutely interesting! What a fun script! This has also become particularly relevant in the light of the events of September 11. I am in no way trying to minimize losses. But this film involves the tragedy of the collapse of the WTC before it happened, and we will never see if the film was shot after these events. <br /> <br /> "... he either disappeared forever or stay here."
