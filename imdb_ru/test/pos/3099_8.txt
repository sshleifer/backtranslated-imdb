It’s like the first of Ma and Pa Kettle’s films. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in everything she does. It's funny to see Ida Moore in the role of Emily, the oldest old woman on the train ... God, she ALWAYS was old; she was in "The Desktop Set" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents." Their new home is also being removed along with it - this is the home of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa doesn't care about. LOVE for painting gag. Follow TOM ... he starred in the film "Nanny and Professor." Unfortunately, he died very young ... oddly enough, his last role was in the TV series "Cruise of Death." strange. Directed by Charles Lamont, who not only made several films about The Kettle, but also starred in the films Abbott and Costello, so he probably knew something about the comedy. Fun story, simple, simple humor. Even the release date was April Fool's Day of 1949. The story begins with the fact that we show how backward and country people they are (neighbors are even Native Americans), but as history develops, we feel sympathy and respect for them.
