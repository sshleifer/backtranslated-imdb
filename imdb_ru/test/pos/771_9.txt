I felt that Rupert Grint has many promises from the role that everyone knows him to do. Therefore, although I had never heard of this film before, when it appeared on my cable television listings, I immediately switched to this channel. I'm so happy I did! <br /> <br /> I read from other reviewers that they don’t like adulthood stories at all; I on the other hand quite do. I am one of those who always come of age; I was 12 years old, now I’m 52, and I’ll probably continue to 92 years. Coming of age is no more than a sudden awareness of the possibilities that another day brings. The suddenness of awareness, its magnitude sometimes confuse us. If we try to protect ourselves from this, then yes, I see how adulthood may end. But if we just shake off and move on to a new direction that we discovered, then we suddenly find ourselves on a new path, and we are as alive as yesterday, only stronger, brighter, and I dare, more interesting. <br /> <br /> So what this movie is about. It was the story of coming of age; Young Ben, his father, father Robert and, of course, Dame Evie ... all went through a wonderful transformation. In fact, so is Mr. Fincham, isn’t it ?! I suspect that all of this happened, with the exception of the actual mother, despite her great opportunity to do this, provided by the events of the end of the film. One has the feeling that she will continue on the same path that she walked, perhaps only with another supporting actor. <br /> <br /> So an excellent film that could not have been made in America is extremely depressing to think about it, but, thank God, we have a constant supply of films made in other places that we sometimes see. I really wholeheartedly recommend this film, as long as you don’t mind scrolling through parts that are too familiar to us all and grinning in everything else.
