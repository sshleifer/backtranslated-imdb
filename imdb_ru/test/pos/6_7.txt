I was lucky to see this movie at the premiere last night, and although I didn’t expect it, I really enjoyed the movie for the most part. Watching salvation and sea effects was amazing, and it definitely provided moments of tension in the seat, probably all the more knowing that there are guys who do it for life. The weaker parts of the film revolve mainly around the use of stereotypical scenes. I'm not going to spoil the film, but it really follows the principle of “Officer” and “Gentleman”, and these moments give it a bit of a wacky aftertaste. <br /> <br /> As I said throughout this movie, it's pretty good and worth checking out until you can go through the cliches.
