Indispensable viewing for those who watch television news, as this can help to become a little more skeptical or even cynical. As for me, I remember how several years ago I took the course for an interview for television - what to do, what not to do. The teachers of the course made an impression on us that the television news was "a branch of show business." This depressing look, which is probably even more relevant today than when it was made, is supported by this film. Never mind journalistic honesty, the ability to look good and smile is important. And make sure you don't sweat in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the three main characters forms the central part, each of which has its own ambitions, abilities and beliefs. Brooks takes these differences and sets them in an unstable television news studio environment and adds more than a pinch of love interest to the mix. The result is a complex, albeit somewhat excessive, image of how we compromise every day in order to meet our ambitions and take others with us. This is always interesting, although the final scene was perhaps unnecessary, considering everything that happened before.
