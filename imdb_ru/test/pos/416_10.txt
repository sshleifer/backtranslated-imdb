“Aah ... I didn’t order any amazing hit shows” ..... “We’ll have one” Hack is just the greatest television show ever made. Little died for me when I clicked on the TV. one Friday night to catch little hack and he wasn’t included. The show went deep into the key social problems of our culture. I found that at the end of any episode I was watching; I left, being both entertained and informed. Now I'm actually dumber when Hack is gone. I no longer want to help those in need and less fortunate ones. Since Haka was gone, I see them as an eyesore and an unnecessary burden on taxpayers. So for the love of God, we need to get Hack back!
