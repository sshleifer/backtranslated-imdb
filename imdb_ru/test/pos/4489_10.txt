This is one of the classic episodes of TWILIGHT ZONE, where in the simplest situations the viewer was drawn into seeming symbolic conflict only to find a solution unexpected and strangely acceptable. Five pieces are inside the container / prison: a major, a ballerina, a piper, a clown and a tramp. They are certainly a strange choice of types to be in this isolation chamber, but they are all in it (nonetheless), and they are trying to figure out why they are there. What do they have in common? No one can understand this. But gradually the major organizes them to put, standing on the shoulders of each other. And the major who goes to the top of the line of numbers really reaches the entrance, and ... I will leave it like that, although one of the other critical articles in this topic actually shows the story. <br /> <br /> The title seems to have been suggested by SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF THE AUTHOR, the famous play by Pirandello. The question of whether the goal of the show was to fake this play is questionable: the characters of Pirandello analyze their roles and relationships with each other. But the five characters here, while they are trying to understand their situation, are in total darkness - they are not in the situation of the six characters in Pirandello who know their current situation. This uncertainty about what is happening allows viewers to think that this is an abstract drama. <br /> <br /> Actors, in particular William Windon as Major and Murray Mattonson as Clown, give good reviews about themselves. And the conclusion, whether fake or not, is quite effective.
