It was a terrific movie! I like to watch it again and again. The actors were awesome. The film kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this film to everyone. I would like Lifetime to release this movie on DVD. I would definitely buy a copy. This film only proves that you must be very careful about who you are associated with. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter watched a movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is that I will watch this movie every time Lifetime broadcasts it. This is a movie that keeps you up to date. I want Lifetime to remake the film, but use the same actors and bring it to the big screen.
