Speaking about the features of the competition at the Split Film festival, we have titles from all over the world. China, Korea, Canada, USA and Australia, and many of these stories indicate that the world is indeed a valley of tears. Modern love ... that's for sure. <br /> <br /> In this film, Alex Frein, two young men and their boy drive from the city to the coast to visit the grave and the house of his uncle, who raised him long ago and who died in mysterious circumstances. The coastal village is like something in an American horror movie, where the village is strange and people are unusual mutants. But the episodes in Alex Frein's pastorella cannot be described as horror in the usual way. In fact, this is an extremely interesting drama, where we see relationships and horror through memories and more. In this story, and through the clearly psychological aspects of the actors, we are shown a film about the charming eccentric Australian film industry. This is the case with Frein. Always something new and fresh. The visual intelligence and unique sensitivity of some Australian directors is amazingly good. Movie frane super. In the Australian landscape there is something so special that we see in the films FRAYNE Modern Love and RAY Lawrence “Lantana” and “Jindabyne”. <br /> <br /> Looks like Alex’s future films will be the same. Frain.
