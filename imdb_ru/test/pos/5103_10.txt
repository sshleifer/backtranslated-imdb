Peter O'Toole, one of our best actors, is great as a low-key school teacher who devoted himself to teaching boys. He meets a girl show and falls in love. This is a story of love and devotion. Petula Clark adds spirit and sensitivity, not to mention a wonderful voice. You will love this movie, although the final may not be happy. I enjoyed it.
