probably the best horror movie in 5 years ... there were unsuccessful remakes, attempts to make you get scared (when all they are forcing you to do is to leave the theater) and films that you just shouldn't have made. but this one is worth it. the only reason I didn’t give her 10 is because Paris Hilton is in her (but her death scene compensates for this, believe me) .. <br /> <br /> .. here they are ... SPOILERS of all scenes of death in the film. <br /> <br /> 1. My favorite death scene is Paris Hilton! After finding his boyfriend Blake, lying on the ground with a knife sticking out of his neck, Paige begins to run. Well, walking speed is more respectable. she finds it like a garage with all these cars in it. then (one of) the killers cut her ankle from the bottom (all this time she was holding a HUGE metal spike), so she throws him and runs and hides behind this machine. the killer picks him up, and when she looks out the window, he throws him out the window, and it shoots in the forehead ... I NEVER WER SO SO excited or laughed so hard in my life. <br /> <br /> 2, Page's boyfriend Blake stabs a knife into his neck, and then the killer comes up to him (while he stands on the ground) and steps on him, pushing him further down the throat ... then he dies. <br /> <br /> 3, Elisha Cuthbert (Carly) (one of the hottest girls EVER) does not die PHEW, but she really glued her lips, punched her face and chopped off a part of her index finger (yes, I felt that heaving up) 4. Nick Carly, a twin brother, also survives, but not without a blow to the ass and stabbed in the leg. <br /> <br /> 5. Knicks best friend Dalton falls down the stairs, and then beheaded. his body was dragged away, and we see his eyes blink ... then he becomes covered in wax. <br /> <br /> 6. Wade (Carly’s boyfriend) gets the Achilles tendon with a massive scissors knife and then is attacked by the same scissors. he does not die, but he is covered in wax, and in 2 cases his skin is accidentally removed, exposing his nasty bloody flesh. Yummy. <br /> <br /> .. so here it is. Definitely worth your money.
