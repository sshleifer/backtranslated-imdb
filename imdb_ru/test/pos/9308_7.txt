It was a fascinating story waiting to be told. The fat man and the little boy accept us during the trials and tribulations of a group of leading American scientists who committed a high task during World War II: to beat everyone else with an atomic bomb. Sequestered in a carefully guarded residence in New Mexico, brain agents are slowly turning an idea from an ambitious concept into a tremendous reality. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY is one of those films that requires your close attention. This is a film of a really thinking person, not only from the scientific point of view of developing seemingly impossible weapons, but also from the point of view of morality conducive to mass murder. Characters are constantly torn between this reality and their military duty as Americans. The film never preaches about, however, leaving us free to wonder at the enormity of the internal turmoil these people face. The performances also deserve special mention. Paul Newman performs one of his great, understated performances as General Patton, who is responsible for supplying the final big stick for the Allied forces. <br /> <br /> Where Fatty and Little Boy lose most of their traction, in the unnecessary romantic component. Dwight Schulz, as the leader of a research group, struggles with his attachment to his family and his tireless obsession with his big project. Director Roland Joffe obviously felt the need to explore more human aspects of this story, but romantic overtones are mainly a distraction. In addition, it is the interaction between scientists and their military hierarchy that allows us to better understand the thoughts and feelings of these brilliant people. <br /> <br /> However, it is difficult not to recommend the Fat Man and the little boy. This is a largely forgotten gemstone that puts a human face on one of the most intriguing stories in human history.
