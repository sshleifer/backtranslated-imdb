Like NIGHT STALKER, and then X-FILES, the show created a fantastic situation, and the main characters had to figure it out. In contrast, the heroes did not stay with an empty bag at the end. They usually had tangible results. It also became clear that the "good guys" are engaged in the dirty profession, where they sometimes have to pull some unpleasant things. Imagination, wit, acting, which did not always take itself too seriously ... I miss it. One of the reasons for this is that it’s hard for me to think of too many shows - other than BANACEK - who also did a good job of distracting the viewer and getting his attention from the very beginning. The authors succeeded in creating extremely incredible, if not completely impossible situations that the characters had to find an explanation for. explanations, which often took 90 degrees, turn into obviously unexpected, but still make sense. I also agree with another reviewer that the character Anabel was somewhat underestimated, but when she was on the screen, it was not just because of the sweet. She was quite competent in her own right and confronted two men when she felt that she was doing it justifiably. Rarity in those days. Sullivan? If he had not been in the Department, he would have worked for the KGB or the CIA. He is such a cold-blooded, ruthless type. He knows how the world works, and he understands what is needed to do the job. King? This is clearly a game for him. The one in which he succeeds and in which he puts forward ideas for detective / spy novels, which he writes as his supposedly “real” work. He is probably the funniest of the three, although everyone has his own moments and often also. However, I agree that in a possible additional series involving only his character there was no interest in the original.
