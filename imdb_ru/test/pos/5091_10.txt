This is really a wonderful love story. I liked the songs, however, even if you donâ€™t, you have to love the story. Peter O'Toole is at his best, and Petula Clark is doing well too. I first saw it when I was about 13 years old, and then I liked it. I'm in my forties now, I'm still enjoying it, maybe even more. Still makes me cry, laugh and feel good. This is a movie that can only be watched with a guy of a new age or with himself, as this is a movie with chickens. But what's wrong with that? Need a little romance and maybe a little cry, try this movie. <br /> <br />
