I do not pretend to be a big fan of Asterix, seeing only one other adaptation of the film and reading only two of the comics, but still it was an excellent film. I saw only the English version and found that the voices are ideally combined with the characters - Brad Garrett in the role of Obelix and Sean Astin in the role of Justforkiax. The story itself was both interesting and truly funny (especially the conflicting endings of the names — all Viking names end with “af”, while all Gallic names, of course, end with “ix”), with a little novel added in this (I, though) improved the story, although it burdened the entire production process with unnecessary clichés. <br /> <br /> The plot is as follows: the Viking chief Timandhaf was tired of walking around the raids on the villages, and then finding them devastated. Thus, he consults with his “sage”, a cryptographer, whose entire repertoire consists of old proverbs, and the cryptographer tells him that “fear gives the wings of the villagers”. Taking it literally, Timandahaf believes that fear actually allows people to fly, and goes on an expedition to find the Defender of Fear, an expedition that, of course, leads him to the village of Gaul, where Asterix and Obelix live. <br /> <br /> The couple are now very upset - they are trusted by the cowardly, pacifist nephew of chef Vitalstatistiks, Justforkiax, so that they can teach him to be a man, and the boy does little. When Justforkix involuntarily confesses that he is “afraid of everything” in the presence of brainless Viking Olaf, he is considered the “Protector of Fear” and is kidnapped. Asterix and Obelix go to Vitalstatistix to save Justforkiax before his father returns to the village to bring his son home. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is a great film, which has several flaws, in addition to clichés, and sometimes Defective dialogues. I thoroughly enjoyed it, despite the fact that it was not true of comics.
