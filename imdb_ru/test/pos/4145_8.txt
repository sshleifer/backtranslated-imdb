if filming is about vision and real life, then this film is quite perfect: NUOVOMONDO talks about immigration to the United States from Italy in the early 900s, but also says now that emigration / immigration is still in the spotlight. <br /> <br /> You do not need to be rich to be a visionary film. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gainsburg is a star playing at an additional level. A good challenge for Oscar 2007. <br /> <br /> After the first attempt by Criles, Respiro, an emotional but overly intelligent film, this film took a lesson from Fellini and Taviani to name only two Italian masters. <Br /> <br /> The plot argues, precise direction, maybe a melodrama will be a little more effective. <br /> <br /> If Volver (challenging the Oscar award next year) Almodovar was a mature film Always a brilliant director, NUOVOMONDO deserves it more, because he put a lot of effort into becoming a European film for the American scene . <br /> <br /> And that's it!
