The Argentine music poet, Atahualpa Yupanqui, once said that some folk music works in the same way in every country in the world. They look the same, but they all consider them to be their own folk music ... <br /> <br /> This film, in my opinion, is about the same music that is repeated throughout the world at some time in the history of each country, First, some listen to the game and try to make others hear it. Then some believe that they hear it, but they do not. Then no one says anything, and some people seem to listen to it. And others admit that they heard it, but did not think that others could hear it. Finally, everyone listens to the same music, and suddenly it stops sounding ... <br /> <br /> Love and poetry are like real nationalism and the fatherâ€™s legacy for his children ... <br /> Why did he call the movie "The Dead" when no one dies? The Spanish translation of the name refused to follow the same rule, and we called it the Dubliners, following the name of James Joyce ... <br /> <br /> A good Ireland postcard from 1900!
