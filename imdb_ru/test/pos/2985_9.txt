I am sure that people from the United States do not know anything about the rest of the world, but I think that they should not talk about what they do not know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocritical as the United States. The only places where consent to sex between adolescents is illegal is the United States and the Islamic nations. For example, in France, the age of consent is 15 years. In Brazil - 14 years. In Spain - 12 years. So teenage actors, 16 and 17 years old at the time of production, do not do anything illegal. Nudity is not considered a big problem in almost all civilized countries. And only a freak could consider the love of adolescents as the corruption of children.
