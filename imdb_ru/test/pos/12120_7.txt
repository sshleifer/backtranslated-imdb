One of the early works of Fuller (the combat veteran himself) is of average quality, but definitely affects many conflicting aspects of life in post-war Germany. The main character starts the film in April '45 as a sergeant with C Co, 157th Inf, 45th Div, who really ended the war in Munich, as in the film. (The same unit actively fought in Aschaffenburg the previous month, and then freed part of the facility in Dachau). For the uninformed, the film may seem confusing if you switch between showing good and evil to the German people. But anyone who was there or, at least, well read about it, would know that most of what is depicted in the film are things that really happened in the 45-47 years in Germany. The only inaccuracy I noticed was insignificant: during a sea cruise on the Rhine, passing by the remains of the Remagen Bridge, he comments that he crossed there. But his unit really moved to the south from there - north of the Worms of Germany.
