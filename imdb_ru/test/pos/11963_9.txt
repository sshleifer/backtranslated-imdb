In the eighties, Savage Steve Holland released three films, two of which are classics of what seems like a very small genre of absurdist youthful comedies. The third “How I went to college” does not correspond to the level of “Better Off Dead”, and this is mainly due to the absence of John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong (with the exception of a tiny cameo). <br /> <br /> One Crazy Summer is an underrated film, with lots of great features and fun stuff. As far as I remember, Steve’s films were desecrated, because at that time they were mentally retarded, and after three films he was on children's television. We could use more movies from people like him.
