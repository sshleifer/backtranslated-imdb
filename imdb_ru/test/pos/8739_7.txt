Ingrid Bergman, who plays the faithful dentist registrar Walter Mattau, who feeds a little love for his boss, is absolutely remarkable in this film. She appeals to the witty respondent in a script with aplomb and steals a terrific scene where she and Goldie Hawn are talking in the record stand (Ingrid's monologue is in front, but her face tells you that she believes it with all her heart) Mattau is a strange choice for a leader (he is too old for Goldie Hawn and too undefined for Bergman, not to mention that he is too focused to be a dentist), but I liked the way he tries his best to please Goldie and stumbles trying to break free. himself from lies. Hawn (who won the Oscar of Support) is as fresh and playful as she is today. This bedroom farce is not very complex (and, moreover, a bit like "Any Wednesday"), but it is a pleasant relief from the noisy teen-oriented comedies they release today. "Cactus Flower" is a great sigh! *** from ****
