* Maybe spoilers * Without a doubt, one of the best dramas, if not the best in the genre I've ever seen. Prot - an alien or just a crazy bastard? This is a question you will ask yourself throughout the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is awesome, as is Jeff Bridges. You can't beat this kind of acting and a little bit of humor. Some of Kevin Spaces’s actions in this film are very funny. For example, when he was on a tree and talked to the mentally ill “queen”, the way he hid half of his face around the wall and just watched. <br /> <br /> Simply put, it hooks you right from the start, and if you really love drama, you won’t be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Solid 85%.
