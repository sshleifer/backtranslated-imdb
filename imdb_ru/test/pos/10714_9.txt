What can I say about Kramer vs. Kramer? At first glance, this is quite simple, but under it we are dealing with emotions that transcend life itself. It delivers a lot of fantastic moments, makes you laugh, makes you cry. You sympathize with the characters and take care of them. Many films fail in this, Kramer vs. Kramer is a success. <br /> <br /> I think everyone will agree that the game is great. When you watch Kramer vs. Kramer, for some time the action in most other films begins to feel plastic and unemotional. The actors seem to get along well with their roles, and the characters really live on the screen. There is some beautiful chemistry in between. I think the best performance in the film comes from young Justin Henry. He is different from any other child actor I've ever seen. He is amazingly natural. <br /> <br /> In Meryl Streep there is also some kind of neurotic beauty. And Dustin Hoffman provides one of the best performances in his career! The story is very well written. It's simple, but difficult at the same time. Concept - the simple part, related feelings - the difficult part. <br /> <br /> If you havenâ€™t seen this movie yet, you will definitely miss it! Take a look now!
