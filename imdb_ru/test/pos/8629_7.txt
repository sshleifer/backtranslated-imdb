So I guess that Bad and Lou just loved messing around with classic stories (although they had some interesting results). In this case, they are sitting with a bad boy, and Lou tries to read him Jack and the Beanstalk, but falls asleep and dreams that he is a butcher of Jack and Bud, and they climb the beanstalk to save the prince and princess from the giant ( Buddy Baer). <br /> <br /> I think my favorite scene was when Lou tried to make an omelet from a giant, and ... well, I'll show you what's going on. Since it was an Abbott and Costello film, they had some unnecessary songs, but other than that it was pretty funny. For other interpretations of the classic story, "Enchanted" and "Gilligan's Island" both had episodes depicting it.
