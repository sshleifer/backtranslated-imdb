Have I been putting off buying it since the release of its DVD ?? on the one hand, because I was somewhat overwhelmed by the two other horrible titles of this director (SQUIRM [1976] and BLUE SUNSHINE [1977]), but also by the fact that the film itself was said to be slightly trimmed with caked blood. Media Blasters / Shriek Show 2-Disc Set! I now accidentally stumbled upon this as a rental and glad I did ?? because not only is it superior to previous attempts (at least in relation to this preliminary assessment), but I also found that the film is one of the best imitations of Texas chain killing (1974). This factor, however, only helped me recall that I have yet to check another such example? Wes Craven's classic “The Hills Have Eyes” (1977), whose edition with 1 R1 disc from Anchor Bay I bought some time ago, but in the end, Halloween time is fast approaching ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, does the film rule the wildly disturbing atmosphere of a dense forest (was it shot in forest and mountainous areas of Oregon) ?? with a lot of effective free-riders everywhere, but fortunately not too much violence (even if the last of the villains goes pretty outrageous!). The main young cast here (one of them being played by Jack Lemmon’s son, Chris) is not as disgusting as the ones we usually encounter in this type of genre proposal, despite the fact that the person is free to engage in frauds, he is associated with teenage films that , by and large, persist to this day! George Kennedy appears as a sympathetic Ranger; although he had nothing to do, his characterization was greatly improved, and he became a lover of plants and animals. Among the locals, the familiar character actor Mike Kellin is also known in the good role of a drunkard, who for the first time comes in contact with the killer duo of the story ?? his warning to adolescents, of course, is not taken into account, but he may later lead to Kennedy. <br /> <br /> The hermetic family, which teenagers face in the forest, eventually discovers that she hides the skeleton in their closet. While one of the girls shows sincere curiosity in the presence of intruders, are the others openly hostile to them? and, in the case of fat and uncouth twins, respectively, eerie (one of them is even prone to manic laughter during his riot); at some point in the narrative, the Ranger even offers an interesting explanation of the nature of their aggressive and generally uncivilized behavior.
