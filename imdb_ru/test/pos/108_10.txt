The film is really about choice. In the depressed state of affairs, which can be seen from the Fire, when good women had to be obedient and do what was right in the eyes of tradition, it seemed that Radha and Sita had few options. However, given that this was not their only option. What is life without desire, Radha asks Ashoka. Yes, it is true that life provides us with several options, but how much we can take depends on a number of external factors. When your world is limited to a small Indian home, being the obedient daughter-in-law of a silent but observant and still powerful matriarch, obedient 13-year-old wife of a man who took a vow of celibacy because of your inability to have a child, a man who wants you to lie next to , to prove his strength in eliminating his desires. I felt that the ladies had no choice but to find solace in each other’s company. I assume that the fact that so many women applauded Mrs. Mehta was caused by the fact that she gave them the opportunity to think for themselves. The ability to do something that might have been unacceptable. Lesbian scenes that I felt just underlined this point. Each scene in the film from the first one in the Taj Mahal to the last one in the mosque was captured in my memory. How unpleasant to be a prisoner of your feelings and desires. Feel that you had to give up human touch in order to be an obedient wife only because it is expected of you. It is necessary to suppress all your desire and crave human touch. What then does the meaning of our existence mean? In the scene where Sita cries alone in the room, and Radha enters to console her, their lips accidentally touch each other, and this awakens the feeling in them. Something they both lacked. <br /> <br /> Bravo Mehta, who so clearly expressed her vision. I especially like the memories of a young Radha trying to “see” the ocean. This is a metaphor of freedom. Freedom of choice, freedom to transport ourselves to places that we normally cannot reach. In these scenes, we are gently told that her sense of duty is also transmitted from her mother, who, I believe, lives in accordance with the rich Indian tradition of debt in marriage. The film is beautifully filmed and supplemented by the musical score of A.R. Rahman. After the film, I became an ardent fan of two leading actresses and a director. I look forward to more future works of Ms. Deepa.
