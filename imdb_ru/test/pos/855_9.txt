This movie is a mystery. It's not scary, it's creepy. You will probably jump at some points, and for some of them you will scratch your head to figure it out. He reveals his secret through the main character Eve and her psychotic college project in a mad haven, Don. He needs her to look for some clues to justify herself from killing her mother, and as soon as Eve agrees to help him, she opens the Pandora’s box completely and reveals some very strange things, including Malachi. I will not go into Malachi, but I thought that the way played was a complete genius. I know that movie lovers will not view this film with the same prestige as other classics, because there is no one in it who would become famous for it (Angelina Jolie's brother was great, but maybe he should have asked his sister It’s just that the film can get some recognition), but I think that how the ending of Malachi works has something to talk about. I recommended it to my friends, definitely worth the price of a purchase or lease.
