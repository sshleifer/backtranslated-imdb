An interesting companion for real documentaries by John S. Holmes. Unfortunately, this has nothing to do with what Holmes ultimately killed, and it certainly could benefit from it. Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg received a lot of praise for it, but I felt that the true stars were Julianne Moore, like cocaine sniffing mother imitator, Don Cheadle as a black man struggling with identity as a porn star / stereo-seller in some wild getups and William X Macy, whose wife is a real whore. Not to mention the almost unrecognizable Alfred Moline. Macy's New Year's punch and Chiddle's chance for a better life after the robbery of the donut shop went wrong, it's probably the two best scenes in the film, or at least two best shots. What this film does best is to show how power can easily be corrupted in its various forms. However, none of the characters obviously learn anything from their dark downward spiral when they all return and return to their normal lives.
