I am the directors nightmare ... especially the mega buck multiplex. Until I studied art, I still have a high threshold for suspending disbelief and buying in the director’s vision if I can find it. That is why such a gem as “You are One” is such an exciting find. Intimacy and rhythm attracted me and never let go. Jessica Bol and Richard Brandage give thoughtful nuances, and director Gorman Beshard demonstrates a clever hand, imagining what is truly an alarming day in the lives of two terribly affected people. <br /> <br /> Spoiler below <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD version and shared it with several people. The reactions were different: from disbelief in Daphne's ability to perform the task for which Buddy paid her, to the inability to watch the entire film, because it was too real and emotionally destructive. As a compulsively skeptical viewer, they should grab me by the collars and pull me out of the ride, or lift and seduce the director. This film chose a later path for me, and by the end I was so involved that I felt the horror of Daphne and the pain of her role in Buddy's demise. My reaction to this film reminded me of watching “The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover” by Peter Greenaway many, many years ago. By the end I was fascinated and repelled, and absolutely could not take my eyes off this film. I watched this film several times and truly appreciate the eyes and ears that the director demonstrated. I am familiar with other work he has done, including a couple of bold films “Galactic Gigolo” and “The Attack of the Bimbo Slayer” and the mixed bag “The Kiss”, which I recently found out, was killed in the cradle by the producer and does not really represent the director's vision. It’s a pity, because I loved the previous two films and even found Kiss interesting, but I wanted Kiss to be available in a directing performance with all the original concept and tactful music. I look forward to the future work of this interesting director and presenter Jessica Bol and Richard Brandage.
