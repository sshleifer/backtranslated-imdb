Where the Da Vinci code introduced us to Dr. Robert Langdon and his ability to solve puzzles, Angels and Demons raise the stakes, providing a huge puzzle with an 8-hour limit. <br /> <br /> With a set of award-winning actors, Ron Howard does a good job of directing a story that was easy to follow and even easier to accept. The Da Vinci Code threw so many angles at you in such a short time that a quick break in the bathroom would leave you confused when you return. I did not feel that it was with Angels and Demons, the plot was straightforward, and the action maintained the level of interest at the peak everywhere. <br /> <br /> Cardinal Strauss (Armin Muller-Stahl) was easily my favorite character in the film. His portrayal of the elite, but misunderstood title of the Catholic Church was very good, and in combination with the victim of his treatment Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), you will find that you choose the parties immediately after joining. The time of Tom Hanks is not so much, as the film focuses more on history than on character development, which is good for me, since I had more than enough of the presentation from the first film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I Vitoria Vetra, the character Aelet Zurer, turned out to be an unnecessary assistant in the quest, since her lines were a bit limited and seemed like a bit of a late thought. She plays a key role in the beginning of things, but she soon disappears amid the fact that Langdon is “familiar” more than the necessary partner. <br /> <br /> The plot as such, one of the organizations that the Catholic Church, offended in the past (there were many), tried to take revenge in the most artistic way. Some men of the church are abducted and must be executed at a certain time until the final end of the church itself occurs. Doctors Robert Landon are invited to help decipher the clues and unite with the beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who witnessed the death of a colleague at the hands of the enemy of the church. <br /> <br /> Music that remains relevant, and cinematography Fine, I could talk about these damn things, but what makes Angels and Demons absolutely work is their conclusion. It was one of the most amazingly amazing endings that I saw in the film, and I was amazed at how offended I was when he hit me. Like everyone else, I appreciate the excellent results, and this film wraps him pretty tightly and throws a nice bow at him. It goes without saying that I left the theater a satisfied movie in general. <br /> <br /> If you are religious and not sure if this film will offend your Catholic principles. I can say that where the Da Vinci code depicted Catholicism as a hidden group of covering sadists, Angels and Demons paint them with a much lighter brush. The church is shown as a collective of good people who are forced to suffer for the sins of evil and misinformed people who wore their colors, and even those who penetrated into their modern ranks.
