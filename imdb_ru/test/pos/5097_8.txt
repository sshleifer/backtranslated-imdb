“Goodbye, Mr. Chips” is a beautifully written and photographed musical version of a classic 1939 film. In addition to the wonderfully controlled and understated role of Peter O'Toole as a pedantic school teacher who finds love and changes from her, the film contains hundreds of stunning visual effects, from Greek ruins to London lanes to lengthy editing in the countryside. Leslie Bricuss’s music and lyrics were criticized as boring or unsuitable for musicals, but they are used to improve the story, not to tell it. Many songs are used to emphasize montage or scenes; the few that do not belong to the show business numbers. Thus, the songs do not interfere with this delicate story, but emphasize what the characters think or feel. “Where has my childhood gone?”, “Walking around the world with me” and “You and me” are especially effective. Fascinating, brilliantly played, directorial and written film.
