Much more vigorous and less scenic and limited than previous efforts of Gene Sachs “Barefoot in the Park” (67) and “Strange Couple” (68), “Cactus Flower” is not a work of art, but compared to most tired farces from the 60s years: “Apartment”, “How to kill your wife”, “Farewell Charlie”, “A Guide for a Married Man”, “Divorce”, “American Style”, “To Any Wednesday”, “Kiss Me, Stupid”, “Night On Boys ”, this is a masterpiece Director Saks and writer I.A. Diamond effectively "uncovered" the Broadway hit by Abe Burroughs, and the film benefited greatly from filming in New York and great performances by Ingrid Bergman and Goldie Hawn. Bergman is charming, looks great and shows talent for comedy. Hawn in her Oscar role has never been better and more attractive. Mattau is fine, although it's hard to believe that Houn's character would have been delighted with him. And in retrospect, Hoone’s suicide attempt at the beginning of the film is unusual and incredible. However, there is a believable farcical production in the film, and as soon as it starts, it causes laughter. Rick Lenz, Jack Weston, Yves Bruce, and Vito Scotty provide good support. The film is pleasant and fun, and Hawn and Bergman make you care.
