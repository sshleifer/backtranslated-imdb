Dirty dancing - I think everyone saw this movie at one time or another. I remember how in childhood I loved this film and watched it again and again, without getting tired of it. <br /> <br /> Now that I'm a little older, I recently bought a DVD, and I LEFT was not disappointed with the performance. <br /> <br /> Swayze and Gray create the atmosphere for this film, although it is argued that they do not get along, the chemistry in the film is incredible! As the film progresses, we are drawn into their relationship and believe in their every action. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is awesome, the music only adds to the romantic mood of the film and adds the relationship between the Kid and Patrick. <br /> <br /> The last scene makes this film, which you can ever forget the famous line “Nobob puts the Kid in the corner”. The song is beautiful, and the dances are awesome! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to everyone, at any age. It's just a funny movie that everyone can watch 8/10.
