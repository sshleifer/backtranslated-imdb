"Family guy", perhaps the coolest sitcom ever created. It constantly turns everything he can think of, from television shows to family drama. Best of all, this is one of the few TV shows we have today, which is actually funny. <br /> <br /> The show revolves around “Griffins”: Peter, the father of an obese, whose plans are limited by lack of intelligence. Lois, a mother who is more or less the head of the family, although Peter considers himself as such. Chris, a fat teenage son who has as many brains as his father. Meg, the black sheep from the family, but it's all a joke. Stewie, a child who has plans to kill his mother and take over the world. And Brian, the family dog, which is often the voice of reason, but often corrupted. <br /> <br /> Family Guy uses many tactics to make fun of the audience. The most noticeable are the frequent cuts that fake what has just been said. They are effective because of immaculate time and how they play. "Family Guy" also uses parodies to get humor, most often from 80's TV shows. What really makes a show so great is that a person does not need to know what he is faking. I am sure this will help, but the material is quite funny in itself. But the show does not stop there. Not only does he fake almost everything, he turns his own parodies! The show is filled with extraordinary humor. The only reason people don’t argue about this show is perhaps because it equally makes fun of every race, gender, and other similarities. There is nothing sacred here, and no one and nothing is safe from the satirical pricks of the Family Guy. <br /> <br /> Writing musical numbers in a film requires a lot of time and effort, and this is a very big risk. But "Family Guy" contains some great songs. Everything is well written and executed, and, of course, they are funny (perhaps the most famous, "The Freakin 'FCC" is both catchy and hysterical, because it hits the rating board where it hurts). <br /> <br /> Voice characteristics right on the money. Seth Macfarlane is incredibly talented. He provides voices for Peter, Brian (which is his own natural voice) and Stewie. Not only are the voices consistent and creative, he can change their pitch at will, so in fact it seems that three different actors are talking about them. Alex Borstein brings Lois's nose, which is perfect for the character. Seth Green is unrecognizable as Chris (if I hadn't looked at IMDb, I would never have known that it was him). Lacey Chaber was born in the image of Meg, and although she was good, Mila Kunis really raised her character in her sharp voice. Kunis gives Meg a new, sharper advantage that she did not have with a scoop. <br /> <br /> Family Guy is compared to the Simpsons, and this is quite understandable (and not only because they were created by FOX). Both satires of blue-collar life, and although The Simpsons are good, Family Guy has a sharper edge. The show is absolutely fearless. There is no real sacred cow. Shows (physical and mental), ethnic groups, TV shows and films, celebrities, politicians, religion (especially Catholicism), drug use and drug addiction, sexual humor of all kinds (including S & M), and some of them are beyond description. Not everything that “Family Guy” throws into the audience works, but on the whole the show is always funny and often fun. <br /> <br /> If there is any flaw in the “Family Guy”, the jokes continue. too long sometimes. Especially with the “awkward moment” jokes, the sequences stretch so long that they not only stop being funny, they become so annoying (and long) that the fast forward button is needed. They can be effective in about 10-15 seconds, but the show sometimes stretches them to two minutes. It can be argued that the show rewrites its rules in accordance with the plot, and this often happens (for example, Brian often behaves like a person, but he still behaves like a dog when history requires it). But this is not a problem, because the show is still running. <br /> <br /> Some people claim that the show has stopped being funny. Although I agree that it is not as bad as before, but I think that the fault lies with FOX, and not with MacFarlane and his team. The show began with FOX, but after some weak ratings and the turnout of the audience, it was canceled. However, DVD sales were large enough for Adult Swim to take over. The show was an instant success, and FOX was bought again. However, since the show is so large right now, FOX is afraid of allowing authors to experiment and try new things. Although it is still funny, the humor is not so fresh and sharp. <br /> <br /> Be sure to watch this show. That's cool
