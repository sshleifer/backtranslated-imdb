“My Architect” is an excellent film about the search for Nathaniel Kahn through the legacy of his famous father-architect Louis Kahn, who died since 1974. The film is built slowly, but ideally, and what begins with the seemingly lost identity crisis turns into a beautiful fairy tale with a much deeper meaning about the importance of love, loss, family, and perhaps more importantly, the work of our life. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of Louis Canet before this film, although I was dimly familiar with some of his works. Thanks to the words (both good and bad) of Luis Kahn's colleagues, you understand very well that Nathaniel must have felt when memories are recalled and stories are being retold. Sometimes it seemed that these people were telling Nathaniel what to think about his father. When I listened to each memory, my own opinion about this person ranged from beautiful to terrible, sometimes for a single moment, so you understand perfectly well that roller coasters are Nathaniel's emotions. <br /> The final sequence in Bangladesh has completely made a film for me. The respect that the people of Bangladesh talked about the work of Louis Kahn nicely tied me all loose ends and, I hope, Nathaniel. <br /> <br /> I think Nathaniel Kahn finally found what he was looking for.
