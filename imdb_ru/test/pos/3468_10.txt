I was looking forward to seeing this movie since I first saw the trailer, and now I am so glad that I have it. This is really a wonderful movie. The actors are great, the scripts are fresh and real, everything was just great. I like James McAvoy in this, and I can't wait to see him in The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe movie this December. Romola Garay is also wonderful. Be sure to check it out in two of my favorite films: “I Captured the Castle” or “Nicholas Nickleby”. In general, I think I liked this film because it did not work. It is difficult to tell a story that you are likely to offend a lot of people or get confused and turn it into some kind of too sentimental-sweet-sweet celebration of love. But they avoided doing it completely and instead made the film real, honest and touching, yes, but never excessive. Very well done. Surprisingly well done. Come out and look, and you will understand exactly what I mean.
