Personally, I think Kevin Spacey is one of the greatest actors of his generation, maybe the greatest. This, in combination with another amazing actor named Jeff Bridges, it can not be bad. And this is exactly what this movie is! K-PAX is one of the most pleasant surprises of recent years. To begin with, the film has a brilliantly written story. This is part of what makes a movie so great. Another aspect that contributes to the greatness of the film is action. The combination of Spacey-Bridges really works. <br /> <br /> This was the second time I saw the movie, and Iâ€™m sure this will not be the last time. K-PAX has it all. There are moments that are extremely funny, parts that are reminiscent of the true thriller, and others that are reminiscent of high-end drama. I think this film deserves a much higher rating and much more awards. A great movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10
