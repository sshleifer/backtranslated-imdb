I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985, when it was first shown on British television. I was shocked to see this masterpiece, and despite some competition from people like FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, this film is still my favorite for almost 20 years after I first saw it <br /> <br /> This leads to a problem about how I can even start commenting on the film. I could praise the technical aspects, especially sound, editing and cinematography, but everyone else seemed to appreciate (rightly) these achievements to heaven, while performances in general and Robert Duval in particular were also noted, and everyone else mentioned o dark images of the Dow Long Bridge and mounting a boat going upriver after passing the border <br /> <br /> What about the script? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director, but he was always a genius as a screenwriter, since he was a director, I said I was in the past tense, because making this film seemed to burn every creative brain cell in his head, but his sacrifice was worth it. In the original solo project of John Milius, we have a script that is as insane and alarming as the screen script, but Coppola’s participation in the script brought a story that accurately reflects the war scenario. Check out how the script begins with the whole patriotic and macho, with the turn of the star by Bill Kilgore, who would not look out of place in GREEN TERRIES, but the further the plot unfolds, the more shocking and insane everything becomes so much so that the Time approaches to Kurtz's outpost. Viewers watch another movie in much the same way as the characters went into another dimension. When Coppola declares: “This film is not about Vietnam - it's Vietnam,” he’s right. What began as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid-1960s, when the film was set (the Manson trial assumes it is 1970), changed America’s view of both the world and itself and the world’s view of America <br /> The crazy beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW makes it a masterpiece of cinema and during his work speaks more about the brutality of the conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians (what did you do during the Vietnam War, Mr. President?) Than Michael Moore could say in life. I did not see the version of REDUX, but when I looked through the original I didn’t feel that nothing was missing in this story, like all the really wonderful films that are very simple. In fact, this premise can be useful for many other genres, such as Western, where an army officer must hunt down and kill a renegade colonel who leads a military party of the wounded, or a science fiction film where a UN murderer must destroy a UN comrade. The soldier who leads the resistance movement on Mars, although this is probably related to the original novel by Joseph Conrad. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie of all time, and it’s very appropriate that I chose this movie as my thousandth IMDb review
