It was such a funny movie that was soon forgotten, probably because there are so many adolescent and youthful comedies in it, like this one. The film is not as predictable as you might think. Crawl is unattractive, but cheerful and caring, and most importantly a very devoted friend. However, it is unlikely that Rebecca would have an attractive and seemingly kind guy at home. When he helps her feel better at school, shows her surroundings and encourages her to communicate more, they become friends, but this is completely platonic. When she realizes what her boyfriend has to offer, she doesn't feel ready, he seems to like her boyfriend, but she seems to enjoy her free casual college party, which is not yet ready to live the life of marriage and responsibility. You will learn what a good friend Kroll is when he tells her that he will help her get married. When her boyfriend makes her an offer to the whole family, she kicks Kroll and puts him in his place. He tells the whole family what he offers her, and gives her his diamond ring, which he believes has been his all the time (he must have come for money or something. Well, they never show close-up ring). It seemed that the idea of ​​the film was not to judge people by their appearance and not to judge people before you recognize it. Rebecca's boyfriend, loved by her parents, became angry when we found out that he became friends with his new girlfriend after Rebecca (Amber Tesan) and Crow, so Rebecca broke up with Crole, thinking that they were a couple. And although this is not the case, Rebecca was angry with him, which, if you think about it, was partly unfair because they were not a couple, but I think they were starting to love each other. And I think she thought there was more. The film never showed that they actually became a couple, they left it open to viewers. They never even kissed at any moment, although there was one part where they almost did. This was the one thing that most viewers seemed to misunderstand. Many people saw it and said that it would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or shock, but they were friends all the time, even near the end. And she did not introduce him to her boyfriend; nevertheless, they never told her parents that they were not engaged. Rebecca almost did. Even if he never became her boyfriend, they could still be friends. For some reason, in the 90s there were femanin men, and there was such a big stereo type in which women liked femanin men (not that there’s something wrong with that), I think it happened because that women like a kind, sensitive type that creeps It turned out, thanks to his friendship with Rebecca. but when I saw the movie, I have to admit that if I went to see, I thought that I would go after the first guy. Nevertheless, it was a creative film in which they tried to teach a lesson about friendship and condemnation of others.
