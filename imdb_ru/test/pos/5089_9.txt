Nothing is boring in this film, which is united by fully realized characters with some depth for them. Even hooded torturers have body language. Jennings's work is brilliant, everyone will, want and need. Henry VIII, as he should have been. Henny Porten is perhaps nobler and cleaner than Ann Boleyn, but she plays a role, as it says: the victim fell into the jaws of a large (huge) child. <br /> <br /> Sparkulâ€™s cinematography is magnificent in restoration. Sensual shades. Lubich allows these characters to breathe and reveal their damage to the smallest meanness. He spends the time that the patience of an audience that has become accustomed to taking part in the action can test, but time is worth spending. Slow heartbeat and watch this little miracle of a German silent film.
