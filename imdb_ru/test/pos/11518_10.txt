LIGHTS OF NEW YORK was the first "all-consuming" feature film, shot in a lively 57 minutes and filmed by Brian Foy (from the famous vaudevil family). <br /> <br /> In the story there are two intoxicated hairdressers (Cullen Landis, Eugene Palitt), hungry for a chance in the “life of a big city” and addicted to gangsters and bootleg. One of the guys was charged with killing a policeman, but at the last minute he was saved by a firearm (Gladys Brockwell). <br /> <br /> Most of the story takes place at The Night Hawk. run by a crook named Hawk (Wheeler Okman) who watches the cute chorina (Helen Costello), who is Landis's girlfriend. Costello performs a short dance, and we hear Harry Downing (similar to Ted Lewis) singing "At Dawn" in his best Al Jolson style. <br /> <br /> The acting game ranges from good (Palette and Brockwell)) to terrible (Oakman). Several actors drown out their lines, but then continue the scene. As noted elsewhere, it was intended for short 2 spots and was made with a limited budget. Nevertheless, the sound quality is surprisingly good, all voices are clearly recorded, and there is a neat cinematic touch in the silhouette of death. <br /> <br /> The film was a huge box office, even though it was shown as a silent film where theaters were not connected to a new sound technology. No one expected this small film to bring an incredible 1.3 million dollars. He made Costello and Landis stars for a short time and, of course, launched the Palette in his long career as a star actor. <br /> <br /> Among the stars are Mary Carr in the role of mother, Robert Elliott in the role of detective, Eddie Kane in the role of street policeman and Tom Dugan as a thug.
