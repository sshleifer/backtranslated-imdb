eXistenZ is a study of reality and virtual reality, in which characters run from kingdom to kingdom, from landscape to landscape, trying to win in a game in which they do not know the purpose or where they lead. In this virtual reality game there are more layers of virtual reality games, and the question arises from what reality they come from, is “real”. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is not surprising to hide the fact that she is not going to intelligently respond to true reality, instead giving up the idea of ​​whether it is real or a video game, even to the end. I'm not even sure that Kronenberg is pretending that there will be no turning, it is incredibly obvious, in a sense, this is a bit confusing. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film, although in its basic nature, in a sense, Cronenberg calls into question reality And criticizes the game. However, the very same things he uses to criticize the gameplay force him to revel in this: violence, rift, lack of focus and, in a sense, pixelation, even if there is no such pixelation in the film. I once heard someone claiming that Cronenberg’s violence is in fact criticized by the hypervisor in the media, but he is well disguised by the fact that he gets incredible pleasure in breaking new holes in people, animals and amorphous piles of biological sludge. <Br /> <br /> What is brilliantly written and done in this film is the use of vanity in video games (the inability to say exactly what you want to say during short scenes, the relative lack of surroundings or surroundings that does not make sense). only a few people who feel that there should be a lot of them, and vice versa, all these things together with the motive of penetration. It definitely destroys the reality of a video game in such a way that it is sickening and absurd, but it does it even better by replacing the video game electronics with literal “pods” of biological matter that twist and shift and are, frankly, disgusting for one of the most terrifying degrees. This film causes you to react. <br /> <br /> But why? He criticizes virtual reality, but this is a film: this is his own virtual reality. It seems that he criticizes the banality of video game plot lines and character design, but still supports this banality. It seems that he is worried about whether killing a video game character is more acceptable than killing a real person, and how video games can be confused with reality and make people not think about the consequences of their actions in real life, and yet I say again gets great pleasure from tearing people, objects, animals, things and organisms into bloody pieces. <br /> <br /> So, despite the fact that he is focused on fear, he doesn’t do anything about it, in fact, no. The only thing he does is that in such an original form he cannot deny his own magnificence. <br /> <br /> In a sense, it would be much easier to just hate this movie. for being bloody and cruel, because I see no good reason to love him, and yet I cannot ignore it as mediocre or bad. It would be easier to simply not be able to accept it, but since I can, I can do nothing about it. I really think it is a bit over the top, it really didn’t have to go as far as it was, but Kronenberg’s intentions are so confused and confused that I don’t know if it was Kronenberg’s fault or Cronenberg’s point of view, and I don’t that there really is some way to find out, except to ask him directly. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
