Tom Fontana's unforgettable Oz is one of the greatest television series ever made. Brilliantly written, acting and directed, it is as close to perfection in any form of art (film, television, literature, music) as possible. Pursuing his extreme cruelty, he creates a prison world filled with a variety of characters, from charity to horrific. This is a show that, however cruel it may be, it is impossible to take your eyes off it. The combination of professionally trained theater actors with film and television actors allows you to create a variety of and all original performances. <br /> <br /> And although the show is highly valued and has / has loyal fans, one cannot feel that it was underestimated during his television show due to other HBO dramas, such as Soprano, Sex and the City and "Six Feet". And although all of these shows are beautiful masterpieces bordering on the right, many people forget that it was Oz that was the first HBO release in a one-hour television series. It was a bold, risky first recording, and with it HBO hit it. It is as good as it turns out.
