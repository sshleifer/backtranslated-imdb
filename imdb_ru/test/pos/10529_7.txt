This BBC version of Agatha Christie’s book reveals the pitfalls of following the book too closely. Christie’s books tend to move at a soft, sometimes soothing pace, and Evans certainly does. It also has a solid school of red herrings to confuse the plot. This version is extremely true to the book, which leads to a very slow, confusing story. As a Christie fan, I gave her 7 stars, but it takes 3 hours to complete the story without action. I much more appreciate the plotting that the BBC made for its later performances Christie. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film is a leisurely pleasure, accentuated by the hoarse voice of Francesca Annis, which brings considerable charisma to her role and plays very well with James Warwick.
