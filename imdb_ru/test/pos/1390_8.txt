1891: Stalwart, morally honest military doctor, Lieutenant Claude de Ross (solid Claudio Cassinelli) and several other shipwreck survivors are thrown ashore on a remote tropical island, which is ruled by an iron fist by ruthless and sadistic Edmund Rackham (perfectly played with a delightfully smooth stick. Johnson, who lives on an island with furious Amanda Martin (a daring performance with a delightful Barbara Bach) and her upset father biologist, professor Ernest Martin (surprise no moody image of Joseph Cotten) In addition, de Ross discovers that Professor Martin controls a dangerous race of beasts fishermen who Rackham operates as slave labor. Director / co-author of the book, Sergio Martino, tells a lively and fascinating story at a constant fast pace, offers a fragrant recollection of a lush and distant tropical setting, does expert work on creating and maintaining a creepy and mysterious atmosphere in a creepy first third, then adds things to a beautiful feature in the dry Humor and puts an exciting, action-packed climax with considerable roaring aplomb. Although the central premise is clearly inspired by Dr. Moreau's Island, the story nevertheless receives a lot of freshness and intrigue due to Martino's skillful merging of such diverse elements as voodoo, the lost underwater city of Atlantis, the evocative mondo destructo, volcanic eruption, buried treasures, unscrupulous genetic experiments and even some exciting hard fights between de Ross and Rackham during a fascinating conclusion in a completely dynamic, creative and often very interesting whole. The sound, played by a strong cast, qualifies as another significant plus: Cassinelli makes for a handsome hero, Johnson writes his juicy role as a villain with incredibly appetizing aplomb, Bach finds a pretty attractive girl in distress, plus there are neat auxiliary contributions from Beryl Cunningham in the role the sinister priestess of Voodoo Shakira, Franco Iavarone as superstitious Jose and Roberto Posse as the vicious troublemaker Peter. Giancarlo Fernando’s gorgeous widescreen cinematography delivers a host of striking visual effects, while Luciano Michelin’s pulsating score strikes outright. Amphibious humanoid creatures, fishermen, too, look pretty gloomy. Very funny movie.
