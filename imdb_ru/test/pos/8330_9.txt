We bought the “Walk With Dinosaurs” DVD and were delighted with what was done on it very well. <br /> <br /> Many DVDs today offer a minimum ... of the function itself, and perhaps another language (which does not help the viewer at all, but makes it easier for companies to watch DVDs in several markets). <br /> <br /> Not so in the case of WWD. There are so many great additions and well-designed vignettes that it’s even interesting to see the navigation menu. The entries for each chapter on The Making Of DVD are laughable. The sound and video quality is amazing. And, of course, history and content ... what else can a dinosaur lover ask for? <br /> <br /> I watched most of the version broadcast on TDC (Avery Brooks story), and then watched about half of the DVD. (narrated by Kenneth Branau). As far as I can tell, the broadcast version slipped into the narrative mainly in American slang (for example, in the section on pairing, T. Rex Branug says that “the woman is tired of the attention of the man,” and Brooks says: from the nearest doll works. I prefer the Branugh version simply because it is more complete. <br /> <br /> Overall, great price and great products. Many thanks to the BBC and the team that made this gem.
