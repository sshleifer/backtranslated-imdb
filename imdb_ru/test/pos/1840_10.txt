Gracie (Minnie Driver), a woman who is over twenty, is in line for a heart transplant. Bob (David Duchovny) has just experienced the tragedy of losing his wife in a car accident. You can guess the result. Gracie gets the heart of Bob's wife, although they don't know each other ... for now! A year later, Gracie feels like a new person, while Bob is just starting to think about his social life. When his friend makes a blind date, Bob is interested in Gracie's waitress at a restaurant where she meets. They start to see each other. How much time will pass before the truth materializes and what will be the consequences? This cute, funny and touching film is one of the best romantic comedies ever made. The two stars are blinding, since the couple that only heaven can collect and the supporting actors, Bonnie Hunt, Jim Belushi and Carroll O'Connor, are just wonderful. Located near Chicago, the neighborhood is also charming and beautiful. Let's do the same for costumes and scripts. If you know someone who does The Hague about funny love stories, you will always be at his mercy if you introduce him to this beautiful film.
