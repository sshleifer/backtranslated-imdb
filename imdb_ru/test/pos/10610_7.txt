Mention Bollywood for anyone who is a little familiar with the genre, and the images that usually conjure up are sticky, on top of the musical numbers, populated by costumes that make Vegas seem like a stronghold of conservatism. This perception is not helped by the whiff of condescension that permeates most films that have approached Bollywood from an outsider's point of view. Willard Carroll's romantic comedy Marigold, however, takes a different tactic. This is not a nudging, winking, winking look at these stupid people and their ignorant antics, but a sincere assessment of Bollywood for its vitality, lack of irony and self-awareness. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the director has a great affection and respect for Bollywood, and at the same time is stunned by his kitschura aspects. And if you have an acquaintance with Bollywood, you can appreciate what he does here, creating a real hybrid of Bollywood and Hollywood films. From one of the first shots, memories of the character Salman in childhood by the sea, a conversation with his grandmother (played by Helen! - how many Salman films start from the same premise?) To the sequence of memories included in the film that Marigold and Prem shot, any who have seen enough Bollywood films, acknowledges these links. The story itself includes tried and true agreements from Hollywood and Bollywood. fish out of the water meets the responsibilities of his family through personal satisfaction. The structure of the film follows the typical Bollywood storyline of the more comical scenery of the first half, yielding to a more dramatic resolution of the second. And yet, ultimately, the film is felt in Hollywood, with its understated, wry humor and the story of a woman who learns to believe in herself, to achieve self-assertion. <br /> <br /> You could not have a movie inspired by Bollywood if there were no musical numbers, and this movie did not disappoint the family of them. However, unlike Bollywood, the songs do not appear out of nowhere and transfer their characters to the European region or to the beach of Goa; they exist as musical numbers that are part of a film that is shot, recalling how musical numbers were justified in Busby Berkeley films as part of a stage show. Or do they come out of a situation where music already has a reason to be there ?? a sex scene in a nightclub where Prem teaches Marigold to dance or a beach scene where musicians perform (including a cameo from vocalist Shaan). All of them reflect the emotional state of the main characters at the time in the film. Often the music takes an ordinary song from one genre and adds a zest to the other. Thus, in one of the highlights of the film, where Marigold comes into its own, is the image of a song quite typical of its genre ?? female star, singing and dancing among the female line ?? but in this case, it's blonde Ali Larter, similar to a real Bollywood movie star, writing and syncing words with Hindi texts without subtitles. <br /> <br /> Bollywood synonym is great visual effects, and Marigold perfectly fulfills this aspect thanks to some of the most talented people working in Bollywood today. The cinematographer is Anil Mehta, who was also the cinematographer of Lagaan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. The choreographer is Vaibhavi the Merchant, and the director is Nitin Desai, both from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. Can you really see the influence of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam on this film? in fact, the lit floor in one of the rooms was originally from Dholi Taro Dhol, which, by coincidence, has a built-in calendula model. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, Carroll obviously has a tendency to define acting talent, as evidenced by playing by heart ?? One of the first films for Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillip. And in this film, he again gets to the point with Ali Larter. One of the main reasons why the film works is Larter. She makes a good-natured, unattractive character sympathetic, and her subsequent transformation is believable, and she is smart, funny and sexy, because she is smart and funny. She has excellent chemistry with Salman, and this is one of the film's greatest strengths. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan plays the role of Prince Charm here, which is reflected in his cult role of Prem. However, this is the old school of Prem, so expect a quiet, depressed Salman - those who are used to it in his usual undressing avatar may be disappointed ?? or relieved! This is his sincere and sensitive presentation, darkened only by the poor presentation of his English lines. <br /> <br /> With a refreshing lack of cynicism and shameless embraces of romantic love, this film is a love letter to Bollywood and Hollywood films. the former
