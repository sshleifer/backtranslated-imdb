Overall I liked the Scarlett movie. I'm a big fan of Gone With The Wind. I read a book and saw a classic film many times. I even have a small collection of Scarlett O'Hara jewelry and other things. I must admit that Gone with the Wind is my favorite book and film. Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable are great actors and two of my favorites. Unfortunately, I could not read Scarlett’s book, but I was excited to see the movie. In truth, the film is not at all like the film Gone with the Wind, nor are the actors. However, Joan Wally Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were pleasant actors in roles, and in many cases Joan sounded like Vivian Lee in her portrayal of Scarlett. Dalton also occasionally portrayed Rhett well. It took some time to get used to different actors, but overall I really enjoyed it, being a fan of Gone With the Wind, like me. One of the major disappointments was that Joan did not have green eyes, while Scarlett O'Hara and Vivian Lee both had. I also found that Lord Fenton is absolutely terrible, and I did not like his character. If you’re gone with a fan of the wind and / or enjoying romantic stories, watch Scarlett’s movie. However, do not expect it to be great, like Gone with the Wind. Far from it, although interesting to new characters and so on. I am happy that this is not a remake, and some of the events in the story were what I imagined the continuation of the love story of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. If you have not seen it today, get it tomorrow, because tomorrow is another day. :)
