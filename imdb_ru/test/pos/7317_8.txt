It's early on by boys, but some people may not be happy with it, like everyone else. I found that he was somehow different from the usual faroce Stooge. It was more fun because itâ€™s a joke, not a poke in the eye or a slap in the face. Look at the fun part when Larry takes the stethoscope from Mo and sings into it. Mo gives him a good taste. This part made me stretch out for a good ten minutes. Another hit for the Stooges.
