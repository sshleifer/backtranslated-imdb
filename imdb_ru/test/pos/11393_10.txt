All you need to know about pornography in the late 70s and early 80s is all wrapped up in Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights. Despite the fact that the film is completely fictional, it is actually supposedly based on the porn history of the kingpin John Holmes. <br /> <br /> In Southern California in 1977, Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) works as a waiter at a nightclub. One of the regular customers are pornographic Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) and his two asterisks, Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham). Jack and Eddie meet, and Jack realizes that Eddie is doing well ... a little ... gifted. <br /> <br /> So Eddie starred in Jack's films under the pseudonym "Dirk Diggler." He becomes a “big” porn star (not a pun), and seems to be on top of everything. Then comes the 80s, when the video sequence replaces the film and Jack’s porno empire begins to collapse, along with Dirk Diggler and everyone else working in the field. <br /> <br /> Boogie nights really drama shot well. There is some violence, but PT Anderson makes it more stylized. And this is partly a scathing approach to the deterioration of pornography, especially when VHS became the standard for creating prona. <br /> <br /> Many strange and unique characters are introduced. William H. Macy plays an interesting role as a man working on films whose wife continues to have sex with everyone. I especially liked the role of Don Cheadle as Buck, the stereo seller. The best BOOGIE NIGHTS performance was definitely Bert Reynolds. Classic 90s!
