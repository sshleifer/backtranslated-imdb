The plot is predictable. This has been done many times in other films. In this, you have competing summer camps: rich children versus minors competing for “boasting” in typical camp events, while children and comforters play jokes, sex and “good time! "Are you ready to fly?" Meatballs - the first (and best) film about the summer camp for the comedy of good mood. As others have already reported, this is not a citizen of Kane, but this type of film is not intended. The film works because of the wonderful comic time and the classic roles of Bill Murray. His scenes with the camper, where he tries to raise the child’s self-esteem, are very good. Bill's tips throughout the film are very funny. <br /> <br /> I also like that this film is not dirty or outright, like many other films about “teenagers in the camp” today. Throughout the film there are light sexual hints and, perhaps, one or two abusive words. But Meatballs is a teen movie type that really fits for the younger crowd. This is a PG rating. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you have to see several times to get all the jokes! When Bill Murray appears on the screen or makes one of his classic PA Announcements, you are in a movie. It seems that Bill carries the film himself. But he does it so well that when you see Meatballs, you will understand that this particular film made him a star! An additional note to this review is to avoid ALL sequels of the Meatball movie. They are terribly bad.
