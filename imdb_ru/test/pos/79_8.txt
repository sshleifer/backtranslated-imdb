Once again, the sacred home of the Bugs Bunny is disturbed by careless people. This time the running circus put the cage with a lion right in the rabbit hole. So Bugs must get out of the hole and turn to face Nero (the name of the lion), which he does in his usual cheerful style. After a slow and stony start to ride the cart, it gets better and better, and the result is quite fun. Nero-lion turns out to be a pretty good foil for Zhukov, and this turns this short into a very memorable, although still devoid of the classics. This animated short film can be found on disk 1 of volume 3 of the Golden Looney Tunes collection. <br /> <br /> My rating: A-
