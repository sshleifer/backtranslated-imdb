When I started watching, I thought I was watching some pro-rosh amateur documentary. However, I have never seen 3/4 of the footage they used. They interviewed people who said that the FBI / ATF provoked all of these things, which still sounded far-fetched, but then followed by video and FBI testimony. I was surprised. The documentary continued the investigation in the Senate after the fire, and after watching the interviews and videos you will be shocked by how the Senate and the Attorney General turned away from Davidian mainly to hide the aggression by the FBI / ATO. If you start watching this, you must finish it. Otherwise, you will think that this is propaganda of something like that.
