This film is filled with charming situations and healthy young people who are just in front of their eyes, whether they are wearing clothes or not. Strong superstructure of his plot is supported by the art of Shakespeare. As Joseph Papp discovered back in the 1950s in Central Park, the subjects of Shakespeare can be adapted to the customs and customs of modern times. And thus, classic tales of dressing up and other troubles that can be found in such light-hearted comedies as “The Twelfth Night” and “Eve of the Summer Night” and “How You Like It” are used in this film for good effect. All young actors and actresses are well advanced plot with their blockages, dialogues and costumes. And the idea of ​​a football game, to bring things to a climax, reminds me of Bend It Like Beckham, another charming film about coming of age.
