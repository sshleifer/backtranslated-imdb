John Osborne's adaptation of "The Picture of Dorian Gray" on stage is an excellent tribute to Oscar Wilde's talent as a writer and playwright. On the screen with some editing, it becomes a bit messy due to the cutting out of 3 critical scenes from the play (one of which is an important scene between Basil and Henry, showing that time has passed.) However, the acting is brilliant. Sir John Gilgud returns to his Wilde roots in the role of Lord Henry, and although he was about ten years old, he completely turns into a mysterious, life-loving Cad and cynic, whom Wilde so carefully embodied in his story. Jeremy Brett is also strong, offering a touching portrait of the painful artist Basil Holluard. Peter Firth, although not originally my vision of Dorian, takes a role with style and grace ... and then with a convincing manifestation of cruelty. The supporting cast is equally good, Gilgud's former colleague “The Importance of Being Serious” Gwen Francon-Davis plays with dignity her charitable aunt Agatha, and Judy Bowker does the touching Sybil Wayne. transferred to the screen. The only thing that bothers me is haircuts. Many of them seemed out of place, more like the 1970s Victorian hairstyles than actual style. In general, however, acting and writing raise this production to a high level. the level of perfection of the small screen.
