Someone says that this anime can be offensive to girls ... not really. Embarrassing situations are fun; When I first saw this series, I was in the video store, people around me started laughing, regardless of age or gender. The teacher said that in order to guarantee someoneâ€™s attention in the book, the beginning should be interesting, and the ending should not be obvious just by reading the last page. In the first minutes of the series, the boy gets lost in the car, in the last minutes of the series the same machine appears. The episodes had a touching and funny ending, especially the last one. I do not regret to buy these series.
