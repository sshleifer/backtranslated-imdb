The third film of the Polish brothers is their best, most beautiful, creative film. Although many viewers will have problems with the lack of traditional dramaturgy Northforka: “Hold on, Jack!”. The plot is difficult to sum up, so just know that the story includes: agents trying to evacuate the city, God in a cowboy hat, selling angel wings and a sick orphan (but it all works). The extraordinary photograph of M. David Mullen makes almost every frame exciting and remarkable. The performances of the actors, working with the inspiring original script of the Polish Brothers, are impeccable and give the film an emotional blow. The strong participant of the audience will be touched by the mythology and folk story of the story, comic and touching actors and, finally, incredible courage and team that Michael Polish shows behind the camera. Again, all of these incredible and seemingly scattered elements perfectly combine into one of the most incredible things that you must exhaust and experience. Great, great, great movie !!!
