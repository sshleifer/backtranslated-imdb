This film is very interesting, but interesting. Later in this review I will tell you why this is very difficult. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting because it was the first film that ever contained sound. No, it can be more than one hour and forty-two minutes of the film, no, it cannot contain great action films, but for me itâ€™s still a wonderful movie. This caused a whole revolution, if you will, of sound films. It can be a bit scary to watch, knowing that everything in this film is already dead, I hear the voice of a man who no longer walks the Earth at first, and that this sound is crisp and broken. > <br /> I recommend this video to anyone to watch. It created films as we know it today!
