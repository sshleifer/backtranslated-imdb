In Dublin, the crippled rebel Rory O'Shea (James McAvoy) moves to the Carrigmore residential building for the disabled, which affects the lives of residents. Roy is able to understand the unintelligible speech of Michael Connolly (Stephen Robertson), who many years ago was left in the shelter of his distinguished father because of his cerebral palsy, and they became close friends. Rory convinces Michael to move from Carrigmore to an apartment in Dublin, and they hire the gorgeous Siobhan (Romol Garai) to help them. Living with Rory, Michael faces a new world, finding friendship, love and freedom, and learning to survive on his own. <br /> <br /> “I dance inside” is a wonderful story about friendship and freedom in a very beautiful story. Stephen Robertson and James McAvoy's play is amazing, and I don't understand how they were not nominated for an Oscar with such great performances. Romola Garay also has a first-class performance and is very beautiful and sexy. The script is touching, never trivial and without ransom, and the exact direction of Damien O'Donnell is very sensitive. Unfortunately, the Brazilian DVD title is shamefully funny, giving the wrong impression of this excellent film. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Os Melhores Dias de Nossas Vidas" ("The best years of our life")
