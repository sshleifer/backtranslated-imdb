I was impressed by nurse Betty all the way. He has a great ensemble of characters, an original story and a finale, which I was supposed to see, but did not see, and which pulls you by the heart. <br /> <br /> If there is something in this movie that made me most of all it was the interaction of Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. These two are great, and I am very pleased to see that Rock is not going to make a crappy game in Big Hollywood, like Lethal Weapon 4, for the rest of his life. Freeman, as always, man, in fact, no longer need to criticize his work. Damn it, you could watch a kiss with him. <br /> <br /> Renée Zellwegger is doing everything he can to cope with his role, and Kinnear is good as his motive. <br /> <br /> Sweet film is a pleasant touch of unwarranted violence in it to satisfy a man’s thirst for blood. 9 hours 10 <br /> <br />
