“Prostitutes” were a great story for me to ordinary people, like someone you might have known. Just trying to do this, my big shot is right around the corner. Then the little temptations of Life sneak in, the spoiler stumbles again. How much your love can take and give to a guy who is actually not so bad, just a man. I liked it, I also paid extra in the film. He played drums in a bar, starred with a group, did a few walks, my green 66-inch corvette was on the set of a motel party. Wonderful cast and film crew, first-class people, mundane film. I had lunch with James Coburn, on Mother's Day, what a wonderful person, just like I have known him for many years, I will never forget him. My father spent the day with Slim Pickens and exchanged stories about horses. Slim was also very down to earth, love these guys, we miss them very much. Real people make films about real people, thanks to Levi, Gardner and Laven.
