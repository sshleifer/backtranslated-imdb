I was very impressed with this film (director Luigi Bazzoni). The story was about a young translator who suddenly lost all memory of the last three days and suffered nightmares about astronauts on the Moon. She cannot explain how this happened to anyone. One day, she receives a postcard from Garm Island, where she goes to visit. it is strange that people seem to know her, although she has never been there before. She also returns her dreams of astronauts on the moon. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very strange Italian film, which at times seemed very ghostly, and there were also strange images in the film that seemed to stay with you throughout the time when you watched the movie. I would recommend this movie to people to see how good it is. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!
