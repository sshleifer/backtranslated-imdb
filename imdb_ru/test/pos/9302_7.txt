This is a strange and compelling film. The subject of atomic bombs created in Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA, and used in Japan during the second part of World War II, is huge and, of course, deeply disturbing. The plot of the film takes on a lot of hard questions, and the actors have to carry a lot of creative tension. I have never seen this film or it was very interesting for me until I read the book Smoking in Bed: Conversations with Bruce Robinson. Robinson wrote the story and script. I think the film turned out better than I expected, having read Robinson's point of view in talking about him, but I see how he thought he got off the rails. I think Paul Newman is pretty good, but somehow not. He is too Hollywood. At one point, a big, mean guy broke into Newman’s office, and he had such an amazing presence that I immediately thought that he should play the character played by Newman. The other presenter, who plays the chief scientist, is also pretty good, but for some reason not brilliant enough to portray the enormous fear that accompanies the role — the enormous responsibility for creating the ultimate death and destruction machine. It seems that one of the most effective characters is the complex personality played by John Cusack. It has a strange effect on everyone, and in the end, this is a character whose fate really hit homes and that made me think most vividly about the fate of more than 200,000 Japanese in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
