Almost four years after the start of the war in Iraq, we found ourselves in an even bigger hole than ever. That's right, that's why all those flag vibrations that were so sure of the correctness and power of the American way are now chasing their tails, isn't it? You bet it is. This film said so from the very beginning. It is somehow strange, as far as the film or, I must say, the director knew what was coming. This is almost the same as going to the fortuneteller and hearing what was going to happen in the future. There was a moment when I felt that the hair was on my back of my head when GW announced that “the main fighting was over” on top of a visual representation of a broken RV towed by an American flag, waving from behind to see a mirror. You have to see it in order to understand what I mean. But even if you are apolitical or even a supporter of the war, this film will have some influence on you, because it is so deeply rooted in history.
