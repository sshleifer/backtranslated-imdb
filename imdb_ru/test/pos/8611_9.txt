A crushing film about filmmaking. Shows the intense and weird relationship that can develop between directors and their actors; manipulation and intellectual games; Predominant egoism performers. As in any other workplace, sexuality complicates the situation, but here to the n-th degree, when they shoot the sex scene. <br /> <br /> Absolutely fantastic performances of Gregoire Colin as a fragile, imitative male leader, and - in the highest degree - Ann Paris as a self-portrait director The image of her laughing and eating a banana at the end, when she finally got what she wants from her puppets, is pure pleasure.
