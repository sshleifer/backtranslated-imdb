I would give this film high marks for filming and performances. I just read the user's comment regarding the performance of the actress who plays the cunning courtesan who runs away from Xinyue, the main character. I remember the mini-biography of this actress after the film, when I last saw him. Apparently, she was a refugee of the Holocaust, discovered by a French husband and wife in the film industry who were captured by her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film. Like other neo-biblical films of the 1940s and 50s, “Egyptian” reflects the mores and values ​​of the time, but it is still great entertainment because the performances are amazing and the story is so well told.
