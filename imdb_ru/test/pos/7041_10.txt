I love meatballs! Stunning characters and sharp situations make him loved. Bill Murray is hysterical, and in the end you have to love this 4-mile trail! Total classic and one of my favorites now for about 20 years. He brings back pleasant memories of the camp and copes well with the experience of rejecting stupid peers and empowerment gained through the salvation of a sympathetic adult. Tons of great odnostrochnikov and a fairly wide range of consultants for fools. This is a film in which you have been repeating key phrases among friends for many years. In addition, there is nothing frankly rude and what a pleasant soundtrack of the late 70s to cause the right amount of nostalgia. I can't say enough about meatballs; this is a classic. Be warned! All sequels are rotten, smelly bombs that just bought the rights to the name for marketing. They have nothing to do with the masterpiece of Ivan Reitman.
