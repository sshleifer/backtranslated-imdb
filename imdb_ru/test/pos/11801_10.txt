Let me start by saying that I am VERY surprised by the production value of this film. I managed to catch an early show, and I have to say that this is the BEST (if not the only) Christian film that will hit the theaters since The Passion. <br /> <br /> Don't let the PG-13 rating scare you because of the serious problems that are covered in this film (divorce, teenage pregnancy, drug use and suicide), but nothing in the film is free. This is definitely a film that a youthful youth group could see without the chagrin of (most) parents, and this is great. The best part is that this is not a film FOR CHRISTIANS, this is a family film without the feeling of a raw seventh heaven. <br /> <br /> There is laughter, and several times in the theater everyone laughed, pieces of humor were natural and did not seem like a script or coercion, and this contributed to a good move in such a serious film. Teenagers and young people, both religious and others, will be able to identify with many, if not all of the characters in the film, and I was surprised to see such problems in this kind of film. The plot is in no way predictable, and by the end the hits are closer to home than many people admit. Fortunately, Christians are not shown, because all the strong know all this from the Word, but instead people are just trying to understand life. People make mistakes, and no one is perfect, even in this film ... not too far. <br /> <br /> Acting at the highest level, the point of writing, and you are not amazed at the head with all the preaching Christian rhetoric. This is a great film that will make you and your teenagers think, speak, and possibly question their own morality (or lack thereof). If you want to watch a quality family movie in January, check out your local listings for this movie, and you can learn something about yourself. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m 25 years old and I just wanted to watch a movie for free. movie.
