This is a VERY good movie. I give him 10. <br /> <br /> This is very different in that it is a rather long pursuit scene. The fact that the protagonist is mute is used in the narrative very likely. <br /> <br /> She sees the murder (for a snuff film) and decides to run away, but is pursued (it takes a lot of time) time). I will not reveal the rest of the film because it would spoil the experience, but be sure: it is very believable, well played, very intense and has some pleasant surprises plus a great ending. <br /> <br /> Do not do not miss this movie.
