In 2004, I wrote the following messages on the IMDb bulletin board, when a user thought about whether the best years of our lives were a forgotten film: <br /> <br /> ***** For me, watching this movie is like a discovery before time capsules. I think that the “Best years of our life” in many respects is perhaps one of the most interesting character studies, and it perfectly maintains the outlook on life in the United States in the mid-1940s after World War II. I believe that “Homecoming” and “The Deer Hunter”, released in 1978, were the most recent films that were most close to alleviating the numerous problems of the military returning from the war, which were raised in “The best years of our of life. " <br /> <br /> What really struck me was watching the film completely when I was in college in 1980-81, and many, if not all, college students applauded at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> This film is still gaining momentum, and I’m very happy to read in other posts that other users feel the film, which will definitely stand the test of time. ***** <br /> <br /> I am very happy to see the film, one of the top 100 IMDb and AFI films. In addition, although it was in competition with what eventually became the Christmas classic, “This is a wonderful life,” perhaps Oscar’s victories for “The Best Years of Our Lives,” including the “Best Picture,” were very deserved. <br /> <br /> I just watched the film in 2005, and after almost 60 years, the film “The Best Years of Our Lives” is still a powerful, well-played and well-thought-out film.
