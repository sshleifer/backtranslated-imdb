You can not be impressed by the intelligence and scale of this film, and at the same time disappointed by the lost opportunities. <br /> <br /> I found the script superb, and Edmund Purdom's vocal talent is quite impressive. Nevertheless, as an artifact of its time, the film suffers from too many Hollywood lawsuits, especially from poor casting, excessive pomp of the scenery and excessive pretentiousness. Edmund Purd (who plays the title character) is so obviously clumsy in physical action, I suspect that he was primarily in Shakespeareâ€™s theater before. <br /> <br /> So if people from the cinema read this, I suggest it as an excellent candidate for a remake, especially if you present real Egyptians as Egyptians!
