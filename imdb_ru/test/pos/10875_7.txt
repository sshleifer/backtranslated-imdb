A film about two Australian girls - Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight) - and about what happens when they become friends of two surfer guys. <br /> <br /> I caught it in an art cinema here in America. in 1981. Technically, I was still a teenager (I was 19 years old), so I was interested to see what Australian teenagers would do. Wise script, there is nothing new here. This shows the usual teenage adventures associated with dating, sex, suicide, etc. D. And so on. D. I always knew what would happen before, but I was never bored. What seemed interesting to me was that, despite the emphasis and some changes in clothes and hair, these teenagers are not much different from American teenagers. They had a lot of the same difficulties and hangs. It was also based on a book from a real girl surfer and her real life adventures, and (I heard) it was her true adaptation. The acting was fine, but the actors were attractive, and it was well done and quite interesting. So this is not an unsung masterpiece, but a rather accurate depiction of what it is like to be a teenager and try to be with popular children. I give him 7.
