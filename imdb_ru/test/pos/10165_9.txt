The film, shot by Alfred Hitchcock, was brilliantly shot. It all starts with a family of three, a doctor (James Stewart), his wife (Doris Day), a former singer on stage, and their little son, I think, about 10 years old, who has been traveling around Marroco on vacation. The bus stumbles upon a French government agent, and they are too sweet with him. He was killed in the market after finding out the information he was looking for. He wants to convey this information to someone, so he goes to the only person he even knows a little: James Stewart. The antagonists kidnap their little boy and say that if he tells something about what the agent told him, his son will be killed. Stewart must go to London because his son is there and the murder that the agent told him about. The film is very tense. There are many twists and turns (a typical Hitchcock movie). In addition, it has just the right amount of comic relief. In addition to all, he received an Oscar for the performance of Doris Day "Que sara, sara". This film is very good. It's hard to find a problem about this. I certainly recommend this to all Hitchcock fans and all fans of suspense. I put this film "A-" just because it is a bit predictable.
