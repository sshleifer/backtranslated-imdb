“The Hunt for Justice” is a Canadian television drama that has been released on DVD, and this is a reason for thanking those who crave for educational dramas that tell us about the facts of modern history that are somehow hidden in the media. The film is not a Hollywood production, it is largely based on the materials of court cases, but it also represents to many of us the act of heroism of Louise Arbor, which led to the trial of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. <br /> <br /> Louise Arbor (veteran Canadian actor Wendy Crewson) is a Canadian judge appointed by NATO as chief prosecutor for war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague. The film begins in 1996 when Arbor travels to The Hague to face political obstacles preventing the Tribunal from bringing war criminals to justice in the war that Yugoslavia is leading in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, a war that has serious evidence of a crime against humanity in the form of genocide , death camps and other heinous abuses. Progress towards bringing criminals to justice is made difficult by generals (including William Hert), who fear a major world war if the precautions against them are violated. Arbor, with the keen help of her translator Pasko Odsak (Stipe Erceg), her staff, including Keller (Heino Ferha) and unexpected help from British captain John Tanner (John Corbett), is moving forward by focusing on the impossible task of bringing all the responsible parties to justice to three specific events. Two of the three main suspects were taken prisoner, but during their trials, each meets its end. This leaves Slobodan Milosevic himself alone, and Arbor and her colleagues successfully prosecuted the war criminal in 1999. <br /> <br /> There are some touching side stories used to tell this well-documented story; this makes the point in the story more personal. It may seem to some that the footage from the film about corpses, prisoners and death camps is too strong to be watched, but they are necessary to get the film across to the target. Wendy Crewson has the ability to bring the idea home - the message that war crimes should never go unpunished. Many new things can be learned from this film: the writers Ian Adams, Riley Adams and MA Lovretta compressed the information and made it dramatic. Directed by Charles Biname balances the documentation with the development of the plot, not forgetting that he has a story about intrigues. HUNTING FOR JUSTICE worth seeing! Grady harp
