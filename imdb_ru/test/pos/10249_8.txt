On the surface, COOLEY HIGH is a comedy ensemble disguised as a historical piece (produced in the early 60s, complete with an impeccable Motown soundtrack). But there are so many things in this film - it gets better every time I see it. The composition of the unknowns (at that time) is excellent, and it is remarkable as a completely black acting film that does not fit into any Blaxpoitation cliche - sometimes COOLEY HIGH almost resembles a renewed urban neorealist film, with the addition of a large amount of sharp humor. From time to time, a fairly limited budget really shows, but the restrictions actually serve the film well - there is sand and honesty of emotions that give the film an immediacy that is lacking in most films with similar thoughts (such as the Later SHOWER WASHING MACHINE, which was more popular , but pretty much meaningless this today. Their loss is a beautiful, beautiful film. <br /> <br /> A blank DVD with pan and scan (without a widescreen screen!?!) Testimony It's about how little this superb movie cares.
