Three children are born during a solar eclipse, and ten years later it somehow made them grow without conscience. As they approach their tenth birthday, they become cunning and calculating cold-blooded killers. The cute girl from the local teenager Joyce Russell (Laurie Letin) faces these little horrors when most others fall in love with their angelic behavior. <br /> <br /> Referring to films such as “The Bad Seed” and “Village of the Damned,” the premise of the evil children of this film may not be entirely original, but still rather alarming. All three child actors are Elizabeth Hoi , Billy Jacoby and Andy Freeman are incredibly convincing. Director Ed Hunt and his co-author Barry Pearson support an unpleasant, but convincing mood throughout the film, they went so far as to get a little girl for admission to an undesirable peep show with her older sister (future comedy actress and personality MTV Julie Brown, whose striptease is very good). <br /> <br /> Actors Susan Strasberg, as an ice teacher, and José Ferrer, who hardly have some time as a doctor, add their presence to the hearings, while while KS Martel, one of the young people from the original Amityville Horror, is very cute as his younger brother Joyce. Other familiar faces, such as Ellen Gere, the man in the B-film Michael Dudikoff, Cyril O'Reilly (“Porky , ”The Dance of the Damned”), Joe Penny (“Jake and the Fat”) and William Boyette (“The Hidden”) can also be seen. <br /> <br /> Concerning parental fears, like children playing with weapons that they found and locked in old refrigerators, Bloody Birthday is more than just a slasher of variations with children as antagonists. With the assistance and support of Arlon Ober's musical score, this film is remembered more than some of his brothers, without a lot of blood to draw on (although this arrow works pretty well through the eye gag). <br /> <br /> Gloomy, nasty and depressing, “Bloody birthday” is worth looking curious. <br /> <br /> 7/10
