Could it really be a movie about Trom? Some scenes almost have the film "A." Acting is generally competent (the two heroes and the surrogate nurse were especially good, and I liked some of the confrontations between the young Capulets and Kves); the scenes were edited smoothly; the plot is consistent. It's funny. It has a trendy, original soundtrack. <br /> <br /> He has the usual rude troma outs and low humor, but I don’t think that Shakespeare would have been so tuned. Actually, I think he could laugh at this. <br /> <br /> This is a good DVD. There is an alternative soundtrack with a very informative commentary by the director, a few deleted scenes and the usual collection of Trome’s self-deprecating stupidity. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to tell you that this was Citizen Kane, but this is quite an inspirational low-budget filmmaking.
