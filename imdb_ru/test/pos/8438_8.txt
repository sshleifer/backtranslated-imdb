I recently shot the film “Syndrome of China”, mainly because I read that it was this film that inspired ABC to create the film “The Day After”. The Syndrome, however, is more of a thriller than a drama. The film is quite political, but I fully agree with his idea - nuclear power, although extremely effective, is too dangerous for general use. The risks are simply too high. We hope that those responsible for real nuclear power plants are much more responsible and ethical than those shown in the film. However, considering that the real almost disaster on the Three Mile Island occurred only a few months after the release of this film, this is questionable. (To be fair, in this case, most likely, it was about incompetence, rather than corruption.) <br /> <br /> “Syndrome” is criticized not only for nuclear energy, but also for modern "Network". Only much more serious. As a print journalist, I am very familiar with how people perceive the media; but it was a bit scary to see that even in the 70s television news was already selling off. When character Jane Fonda tries to convince her boss to let her do real news instead of fluff, she is advised not to try to change, as the “research” discovers that people prefer a pretty girl to do fluff rather than hard news. <Br /> <br /> What really makes the film memorable is the incredible anticipation created in its last third. During this period, the viewer constantly fears for the lives of the main characters, whether it is a danger from hired thugs or the potential collapse of a nuclear power plant. And this very last scene - I will not give it up, of course - but it makes you guess. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I felt a distinct feeling when I watched a movie that seemed at times more like a television movie than a real theatrical movie. This could be, however, more due to the fact that the rental tape I was watching was rather old and not formatted for placement on TV screens, like video and DVD today.
