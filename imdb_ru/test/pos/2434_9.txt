Sacchi is Bogart's best imitator, ever ... dry and funny, like Sam Marlowe. Music by acclaimed composer George Duning [From Here To Eternity, Picnic, The World of Suzie Wong], the cinematography of beautiful places [including the famous Ambassador Hotel] is all fine, like the famous director Robert Day [Kojak, Streets San Francisco, Avengers , directs the most charming group of famous actors through a parody of every dark detective film everyone has shot. Look, if you loved all the old serious movies and you had a sense of humor ... this is a scream.
