Peter O'Toole gives a brilliant performance in this film. I saw the original version with Robert Donat and I really prefer Peter O'Toole’s performance and the film as a whole, although it’s a musical. I have never really seen anything in which Mr. O'Toole that I do not like. He is a brilliant actor, talented, gives performances full of passion and depth. Petula Clark also showed surprisingly good results and was ideally suited for this role. It is an all-consuming soul film full of tenderness and bitter fun. I will always remember (in paraphrase) the line where Mr. Chips regrets that he never gave her children, and she replies: "Of course, you have hundreds, all boys." Thank you for the opportunity to vote for this film and express your opinion.
