I liked this movie that I just saw at the Philadelphia Film Festival. In March 2005, I went to India with two friends, and this film was very real. I treated everything and enjoyed every moment. The characters are believable, the story is sharp, and the ending is realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the show. This film very well shows a mixture, but not a complete mixture of two worlds (East and West). The supporting cast was great, he quite realistically portrayed the life that a tourist in India faces. Humor is thin and sometimes dry, and this makes it even more realistic, as it is interwoven into the characters' daily shoots. It is so easy to identify with each of the situations depicted.
