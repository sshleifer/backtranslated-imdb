Not many television shows attract as many different fans as Farscape ... I know young and 30-40 years old, fans, both men and women, in as many different countries as you can imagine, just adore this TV. miniseries It has elements that can be found in almost any other T.V show, a character-driven drama that can be from the Australian soap opera; nevertheless, in the same episode there is a scientific fact and fiction that will make even the most difficult “Trekki” run for his money in decks of storm troopers! Wormhole Theory, Time Travel in true EQ form ... Great. It covers cultures from the entire map, since the possibilities are endless, with many stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose from. <br /> <br /> With such wide coverage; one would expect that nothing will be able to maintain the illusion for a long time, but it is here that “Farscape” really enters its own element ... It succeeds where everyone else failed, especially such as Star Trek (the universe with almost zero element of Kaos!) They quickly ran out of ideas + continued to rephrase them! For 4 seasons, they manage to hold the attention of the audience, using good continuity and constant evolution of the character with several threads to each episode with unique personal touches to the camera, characteristic of certain groups of characters in general. This structure allows for an extremely large area of ​​the subject, since loyalty is forged and broken in many ways in many many problems. I accidentally saw a pilot (Premiere) passing by, and after that I just had to continue tuning to see if Crichton would ever "take the girl", after watching them all on TV, I was glad to see them on DVD, and I have to admit that it was the only thing that kept me in my right mind when I had to do a 12-hour night shift, and I developed chronic insomnia ... Farscape was the only thing that helped me get through these extremely long nights. .. <br /> <Do yourself a favor; Look at the pilot and see what I mean ... <br /> <br /> Farscape Comet
