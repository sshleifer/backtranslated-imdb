This film, like most of their music, is either underestimated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It's awesome and in many ways ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> Images are fun, exciting and, at least, attractive. <br /> <br /> The music is awesome. <br /> <br /> This is not the “sweet pop” with which they, unfortunately, are associated. This is the sound of a group exploring and rebelling. <br /> <br /> HEAD alone should place The Monkees in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <br /> <br /> Can someone tell me why these guys are not there?
