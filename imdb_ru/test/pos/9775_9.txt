Somehow CHANGI lost the AFI MY BROTHER JACK award. The last, qualitative adaptation of George Johnston's immortal novel was outstanding - but, in my opinion, not as good as CHANGI. I heard that many critics rejected CHANGI as irrelevant, unimportant, historically inaccurate, or even disrespectful. Who and where are these critics? CHANGI outstanding More than that. Brilliant. It should not be a documentary - of course, I can forgive those who survived in Changi (or even those who survived in a prison camp) for being frustrated with production, but for the rest of us, CHANGI is a great partnership force in times of extreme trouble. It contains part of the Australian culture, which seems to be shrinking as the times become simpler and less complex, but which we should never forget: after Gallipoli and World War II, the Australians were respected around the world for their partnership sense of humor. Rating: 96/100. See also: GALLIPOLI; PARADISE ROAD; THE LAST BULLET; SUGAR FACTORY.
