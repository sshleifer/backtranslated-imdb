I know Gerrit. He currently lives in the USA. This film is based on the events in the life of both Gerrit and Celeste Wolfard. This is a wonderful story. It inspired me to read "Cry, Beloved Country." The film is well thought out. The music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> The story is told in memoirs. You will learn the stories of a white racist from South Africa (Gerrit) and a black South African (Moses). Their lives intersect much. The finale is not typical for Hollywood - it is extremely realistic and ends with a note encouraging you to think about characters and themes. <br /> <br /> Be sure to check the credits - you will get to see the pictures of Gerrit in real life.
