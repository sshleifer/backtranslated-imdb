If this film were shot in the 50s or 60s, critics and fans would appreciate it. I myself enjoyed the movie from start to finish. This is not a timeless thing, and she has not aged too well for many years, but, nevertheless, it is pleasant to watch. What about Mrs. Richie in the movie? Not the best on the planet - but it adds to the unique comedic aspirations of the film and demonstrates the sense of comedy of Madonna (often underestimated). Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a former prisoner who was framed for a crime she did not commit. Griffin Dunn plays the unfortunate future fianc√© / puppet, who is sent to accompany her from prison to the bus station, where a series of unsuccessful events occur, thus creating a plot. (And there is * one * guys!) Take a picture of the movie. You may be pleasantly surprised at how really funny this is.
