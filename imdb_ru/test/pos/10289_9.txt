This is a smart story about relationships and the display of three main categories of players in a relationship game: playboys (Max), manipulating women (Alice) and fools who can really love (Lisa, Muriel and Lucien). br /> <br /> Max and Alice are very incredible and perhaps despicable characters, but they always control the game, leaving their partners in the dark. But, as the ending is abundantly discussed, it tells us that, as veteran players, like Max and Alice, they will be happy to leave at any time when they see fit, as if the game was declared finished, and each of them didnâ€™t care to get to continue your own life and play another game with other anonymous people when another opportunity appeared. Lisa, Muriel and Lucien may have been the ones who wanted to invest something real in the relationship, but could not understand that they were a lure in the game and ultimate losers (in what they showed us ... who knows whether they are also advanced players in their worlds not shown to us on the screen). <br /> <br /> This is a very fast-paced, delicately thought out and seductively witty story with a tempting performance of Cast. It also deserves a deeper reflection: how realistic is the relationship game?
