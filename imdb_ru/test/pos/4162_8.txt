Emanuele Crialese did a fantastic job with one of those films that you remember for years to come. It was Respiro (see Comments and Synopsis here in IMDb). <br /> <br /> Now, having great young talents, which he first saw on the screen, he leads the audience into a dark void. Literally immersed in dangerous waters. Subject of migration. In this case, from Italy to the New World (movie title). It is difficult to call it the American edition of the Golden Door. <br /> <br /> The story of a family that leaves everything and risks rest - that is, their lives for the sake of dreams. <br /> <br /> I hate to spoil the show telling the story, so I’ll stop a little at the work of Criles, and his whole team did it brilliantly. <br /> <br /> First of all, deciding to stick to what he knows: direct sound as much as possible. This means the whole movie. Textures, pain, nuances of reality are always mixed with smells, heat or cold, sweat and blood, life and death as brightly as in real life. <br /> <br /> Creaking of curved metal and sanding wood, the shameful hum of the wind and the ominous sounds of big engines and ship beeps - these are the moments that make this movie so exciting. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is in the hands of a French couturier. The symbolism of light is present from the very first shot (again, almost from the very first shot from Respiro) and permeates the entire film with intimacy and a terrible feeling of despair. The muffled tones and the very gray and gloomy images of people suffering from cramped and dirty boat, on which they float in hope, fascinates. <br /> <br /> Light is rarely used, almost to detect every character in the dark. The beauty of each frame and each scene is emphasized by historical costumes and ideally selected physical features of the actors. <br /> <br /> Again, as he usually does, Vincenzo Amato is certainly on his own. He plays the father of two sons (the same actors who were fifteen and twelve, and now nineteen and sixteen) with all the power that he always transfers to his very complex characters. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gainsburg is so-so, I believe that she never achieved the perfection she achieved in Cement Garden and in her very first film, L'Effrontée. <br /> <br /> Maybe she just seems a little awkward in her role. <br /> <br /> Places and scenery are hard and compelling, almost playing the character on their own. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most wonderful character is the one played by Filippo Puchillo, the dumb youngest son. The contrast here with his first role is complete. Then he played an inflated guy who was as tireless as everyone around him. Now his character is all expression. And only this: there are no words at all. His eyes tell the whole story with great power. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is one of those films that will not be very well received in the States. It is absolutely Italian in all. It is so Italian that in most cases the language is one of many dialects that is much older than Italian itself. In the US, this film may be too big for Americans because of the topic. But anyone who remembers the history of their families when they arrived in the States will see these films with reverence. <br /> <br /> And again, minimalism, which goes hand in hand with the ideas of Crialese, returns with the completion of the scene in the water. Only this time she moves from underwater photography to aerial. <br /> <br /> In general, another great and very well told story from this director, who only this year (2006) collected 6 prizes and was nominated for Golden Lion. Not a small deed!
