This is what James Cagney does: wise cracks, boldness, hardness, like nails and charisma, carrying nonsense. <br /> <br /> Although the plot sounds serious, the film is not at all like a film. This is done in the style of the comedy of the 1930s, and goes well with his “quarrel” with fiance May Clark and his reaction to the loud stories of his colleague James Burke. <br /> <br /> What raises him above normal is the dialogue and the cast that delivers it. The dialogue is good, but it is nothing, if the delivery is not in place and can bounce about the involved characters. Everyone does it well. <br /> <br /> Good fun and a good time.
