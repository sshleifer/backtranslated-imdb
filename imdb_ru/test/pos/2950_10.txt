This film took me by surprise. I make it a habit to learn less about movies before visiting, because trailers and reviews give a spoiler behind the spoiler. All I knew when I entered the theater was that it was a documentary about a long-married couple, and that IMDb readers gave him 7.8, Rotten Tomatoes users rated it at 7.9, and critics scored an average 8.2! In any case, they have underlined this little pearl. <br /> <br /> Directed by Doug Block decided to record his parents “for posterity”, and at the beginning of the film we turn to the necessary interviews with his parents, candid mom Mina and less than the upcoming father, Mike. I immediately found this couple interesting and did not know where the director would take us (the son of Mike and Mina Doug). In fact, I doubt that Doug himself knew where he was going with this! <br /> <br /> Life takes unexpected turns, and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey. It is difficult to put into words how much I was touched by this story and in what unique way it was told. Absolutely fascinating from beginning to end, and it really needs to be seen, even if you are not a fan of the documentary genre. This film will make you think about your life and may even recall memories that you thought were long forgotten. 51 Birch Street is one of those rare film impressions that makes a deep impression and never leaves you. The best news is that HBO had a hand in the production, so instead of playing with a limited art house audience, after all, millions of people will be able to see this incredible work. BRAVO!!!!!!!!
