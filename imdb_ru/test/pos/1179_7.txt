I got a few laughs from this, more than many other so-called comedies. The big ship was a knockout and it was fun to see a lot of its landscapes: just like some of the curves of Dayan Cannon. This was not the height of Lemmon and Matto's career, but it was not a complete dog, as some have suggested.
