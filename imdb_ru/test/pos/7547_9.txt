The first of the five films of St. Trinian (although the latter is usually depreciated) was based on the characters of the schoolgirl of the artist Ronald Searle, and the wonderful Alastair Sim appears in the role of Millicent Fritton, the headmistress, and also her own brother. Most of the humor is outdated, but, oddly enough, touching and outrageous in the modern world of PC - girls drink, gamble, smoke and later sell to rich Arabs, but always remain the main ones, defeating bureaucrats, police, judges and other representatives of the establishment. they loot all of England. Perhaps due to the fact that films were so often seen on TV, the holy Trinians still inspire fashion parties and club nights. The films have repetitive characters, including PC Ruby Gates (Joyce Grenfell) and Flash Harry (George Cole). The forerunner of the entire series is a fascinating film called The Happiest Days in Your Life (1950).
