At first, I was shocked when William Shakespeare's love masterpiece turned into a terrible, cruel and strange sensual film version. But after seeing it once, itâ€™s kind of growing at you, when you watch it the second and third time, when you experience shock and start to appreciate the film - a solid game, good dialogue, pleasant sequence and choreography, not bad soundtrack and some (special) effects that continue. Oh, and also the ending. What a riot!
