I think this is one of the top five Burts films, along with Deliverance, Smokey and the Bandit, Boogie Nights and City Heat. He also managed this, so he, too, had a talent like his friend Clint Eastwood. I would like him to make more such films or even the continuation of the Sharkys Machine than the Stroker Ace or Cannonball Run II. This is a tough, harsh cop thriller with Reynolds on top of his game. It was helped by the fact that he had the beautiful Rachel Ward, known for Thorn Birds. Henry Silva is a bad guy and he always does a good job at it. The film is also a great soundtrack too. I highly recommend it, wish it was on DVD in the UK, an audio comment from Reynolds would also be good. *** 7/10 ***
