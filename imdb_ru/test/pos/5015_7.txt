This film was well played and supported my interest in the main character of the entire film. Stu Unger lived an extraordinary life. Imagine if Stu was alive today! This film paints a picture of what Stu Unger's life would be like. It was interesting to see how the connection grew. I would like to see more details about Stu's parties, his sportsmanship, and his relationship with Bob Stupak. But overall, this film was well made, well played, and the story touched on many aspects of life, which was full of many events that were longer than life. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth renting.
