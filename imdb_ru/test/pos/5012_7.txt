The basis of this dynamic experience is the true story of one of the most prominent card players. <br /> <br /> STUEY is a difficult, coherent biographical film about the real poker ace, whose life is a one-way trip to Hell with several detours. <br /> <br /> This dramatic feature is different from other poker movies. This is a rare and serious attempt to bring to the silver screen the true history of the ultimate gambling coercion. Complete obsession that destroys any intimacy of spirituality and negates any chance of redemption. This is the least likely film that Vegas casino executives would recommend. And this is the only poker DVD you'll probably find on the shelves of Gamblers Annonymous. <br /> <br /> In this film there are scenes that poker fans probably call some of the best gaming scenes ever. Stu read the hand of his opponent and, in particular, the scene of a bluff in Texas Hold'em. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, we see young Stu, intimidated from a pocket permutation by a handful of hooligans next door. Poker for singles seeking revenge. This is a game of patience, which lacks hooligans. "You can not bully me!" there may well be a fundamental sense of punitive power that a champion poker player brings down on his opponents. <br /> <br /> Conservatives will view this film as a cautionary tale about a soul lost in sin. They can cause Mark Twain: "The best throw to the dice is to throw them away." Young and liberal masses will inevitably have a more simplified and responsive look. They may not have heard of Twain's quote, but they certainly remember the remark made by a stunned friend Stu, who learns from novice Stuy that he won a car from a local character in a night game. "You tell them to go to hell, and they look forward to the trip." <br /> <br /> The mosaic of Las Vegas vignettes that we see at STUEY will long be remembered. Frank Sinatra, the most generous dump truck? Forget it! No one gives a tip as extravagantly as a hot player. And for visitors to Vegas who may not know how tipping affects the quality of their stay, check out Stu's scene checking out at a Vegas hotel! <br /> <br /> “This is what I should have done, this is where I should have been Movie Stars in Hollywood, politicians in Washington and players in Vegas.”
