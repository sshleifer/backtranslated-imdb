I heard about this film, but I did not see it until my daughter, who saw him during the flight to Australia, told me that it was a great film. I was wondering if Rupert Grint, far from Harry Potter, was showing the promise you see in the Potter films. I was not disappointed. He became a good actor, showing a number of driving lessons from a shy boy who was beaten by an overly obsessed mother, to a young man who considers himself worthy of his and others' respect. Moving from lines to plays and poems with his aging employer-actress, it is obvious that he is ready to play much more complex roles in films and on stage. But the jewel of this film was Julie Walters. I saw her earlier in the Potter films, Billy Elliott and The Calendar Girls, and I loved her. In driving lessons, when she writes lines from poetry and Shakespeare, I was delighted with her timing, language skills and body language. I hope it was a make-up / costume, because she portrays an elderly woman with osteoporosis, although the film doesnâ€™t say anything about it - as a nurse, I can say that she did it perfectly, portraying a woman on the edge of old age, but clinging to a sparkling the past she enjoyed. This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time, and I would like me to see it first in the theater - but I doubt that it ever played anywhere here in Albuquerque. We miss so many such films here.
