"Born" by Elias Merhydja is the only surrealist description of the religious relationship of humanity. There are several different ways of interpreting things, but the plot itself is simple: God destroys himself, and mother-earth will be born from his corpse. Mother Earth then blows the body of God after death, and then soaks itself with the remnants of its seed. After that, she gives birth to the figure-Messiah, who trembles, presumably in infancy, but perhaps with horror, being brought to life on earth. All this happens in the first 15-30 minutes, and after that the rest of the film consists of figures in mantles that drag the messiah (who is constantly trembling or capturing) across the desert landscape. The figures in the clothes pause only to brutally elect the Messiah, and then continue to drag him around. <br /> <br /> There are several ways to interpret this, depending on your level of optimism and your worldview. This can be easily interpreted as a gloomy nihilistic atheistic allegory of the total absence of obvious power that Christian "deities" may perceive as having in modern society, which only calls their names to achieve their own selfish goals. Or you can interpret this as a postmodern pro-Christian allegory, in which you view the film as how mankind has distorted the message of Christ so much that its original purity and innocence can no longer matter in a world where this message and image are inappropriately used for support for everything: from interpersonal violence to war and totalitarianism. <br /> <br /> The visual effects of this film are phenomenal, and you will not see anything like that, period. If you can, see the original VHS release, I recommend. I'm not sure if the visual effects on the DVD have changed, but I have seen the clips of this stream on your pipe, and the effects have seriously diminished. In the VHS version, the Merhige achieved a TOTAL BINARY CONTRAST. This means that basically there are no semitones, with the exception of some grain in some frames. In addition, this film offers a rare opportunity to see PURE white and PURE black, and the result is stunning, hallucinatory and rather alarming. This film makes Film Noir look positively blurred and mediocre. The pictures merge with each other in a surrealistic manner that resembles Un Chien Andalou, not completely imitating it, for an effect that was called the Rorschach cinematographic test. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the film can certainly try the patience and commitment of the viewer. There is no dialogue for beginners. The only sound throughout the film is a rather constant loop of crickets of crickets, sometimes flavored with gurgling and deadly rattles of dying deities, and amelodious buzzing synthesizer texture. Personally, I think the film is best liked to listen to experimental industrial music, such as instrumental remixes by NIN from the Downward Spiral era, more abstract noisy / experimental music, such as F * ck Buttons and Odd Nosdam. It also works well with apocalyptic black metal. Basically any music with extreme textures and / or hypnotic rhythms. This is one of the most amazing and universal aspects of this film, this is PRIME for postmodern re-contextualization, such as projecting while playing avant-garde music or composing avant-garde music for accompaniment. <br /> <br /> Once the figure of the Messiah was born, nothing really changes for the rest of the film, which means that you sit for at least 45 minutes or more while the figure of the Messiah is a drug in the desert and beaten up. It looks darkly beautiful, but in fact nothing new happens. This helps reinforce the intentions of filmmakers who say that for thousands of years people have used the name and image of Christ for personal gain, but it can be tedious for the average viewer or a person with a small amount of attention. Basically, if you're looking for a modern horror movie with suspense, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a unique cinematic experience and do not particularly like the mainstream Hollywood cinema, this may be your quivering messiah.
