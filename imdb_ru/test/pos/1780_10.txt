Decalogue 5 can be considered a violent accusation against the death sentence, according to the fifth commandment “Thou shalt not kill”: it is not by chance that he puts the concept of the state in full compliance with the provisions of the unjust law on the same plane as the killer’s figure. “But the law can not imitate nature, it can correct it,” says Peter, a defender, a real catalyst, “Punishment is a form of revenge, aimed at returning evil for evil without preventing crime. for whom is the law avenging? Really in the name of the innocent? “The horrendous and detailed sequences of the last half-hour of a person sentenced to death appreciate the uselessness of the deterrent function applied to the death penalty to intimidate all potential criminals.“ Desperate disasters do not require desperate remedies, ”Kieslowski says in his message telling us how unjustly there can be an act of disobedience to the commandment of God, which judges punishment as well as a crime.There are three different moral attitudes: an innate feeling of rebellion KILLER, three to cause a hostile numbness of the environment, a strong sense of chronic indifference of the victims, inclined to laugh at the demands of others; decent behavior of the DEFENSE COUNCIL is always ready to fight disasters in favor of human life. The struggle for life all the time ruthlessly comes to life; disasters in the urban landscape with an emphasis on greenish tones and in their own reflections through the windshield of a taxi. Everything in Dekalog 5 conveys a terrible sense of alienation and isolation: descriptions of growing adolescent violence and insanity, scenes of unstable working conditions, ominous images of buildings immersed in an anonymous aura of desolation, aimless wandering in a frustrating environment. Jazek, the protagonist, is forced to fight a stronger opponent than himself: a city completely shrouded in deep indifference, clearly hostile, deaf to all its dumb calls for help, while the faded photo of a little girl in the first sacrament dress continues to nibble soul. He irrevocably directs his steps toward a divided path to curse, apparently through 18 mm deformations. A wide-angle camera lens aimed at distorting every detail, changing reality, causing it to disappear into a distant and alien echo. Kieslowski does not cite the mitigating circumstances, seasoned with copper tones of melodrama in favor of the accused, unlike some Hollywood stereotypes, such as “I want to live” (Robert Wise). He does not slide on banana skin of useless pathetic scenes in order to soften Jazek’s guilt and soften the cruelty of the crime, not interested in immediate psychological motives justifying any manifestation of extreme or violent behavior, and refusing to include any useless court decisions. production. In other words, according to Keslovsky, “crime is always a crime”: according to the principle of “par condicio”, he puts the prosecutor on the same plane with the convict, using many signs or symbols to represent the society, which can be seen in the society. the most sinister light. And we cannot remain indifferent: even if we disagree with him, the cries of Jazek's anguish touch our hearts with pity just like Terry Schiavo’s pleading eyes.
