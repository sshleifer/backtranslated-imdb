You know that you are watching a softcore with the wrong attitude when bad dubbing bothers you. I'm fine with the shitty lip sync, but the audio mix is ​​really too much. Every time someone says something, it sounds like there is a storyteller. In any case, this is largely a purgatory between dull French professionalism and Joe D'Amato's heavenly agility involving cannibalism and whatnot. Do not misunderstand me, there is a considerable amount of exploitation in this, but there is always room for more. The stars are Laura Gemser, and this is good because she is hot. It's a bit strange how sometimes you can see its bone structure, but it still controls your white counterpart. You can also make a cool drinking game about how often she takes her kit. Often. Every reason is good. Every man is good. Every place is good. In one scene, even an entire hockey team is involved, whatever they do in Africa. Sometimes the plot gets in the way, and the auxiliary cast consists of some really nasty people, but Laura Gemser is enough for everyone.
