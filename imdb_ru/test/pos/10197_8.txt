As a Robocop fan, I have always loved this film. I saw it when it first came out, and finally, I bought it on DVD from Brazil, it was never released in the USA on DVD. I like the film, but, like everything else in this world, everyone has their own opinion, like it or hate it. no matter what the film does, someone will always say, “Why didn't they do it differently?” in other words, you can't please everyone. if you love robocop, you will love this movie. for me, it's so unique that it's not stupid, or stupid, like a lot of low-budget films. This film has always interested me. I can see several scenes that Robocop borrowed from here, but tell me, what movies don't do that? Many films use other ideas from other films, and sometimes change them. funny movie!
