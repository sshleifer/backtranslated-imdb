I have been a Heavenly Gate fan since their first release. I saw it at least half a dozen times and thought about it for a long time as a masterpiece. Thus, it was with excitement and a sense of anticipation that I removed myself to see the restored directorial post. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I was disappointed to see him again, and has since revised my assessment of the film. The Gates of Heaven relate to grandeur in detail, but in general there is a lack of thematic and narrative consistency and passionate urgency inherent in a truly great film. <br /> <br /> First, there are two technical problems: The sound quality in the entire film is not uniform. sometimes bordered by inaudibility. Some of this may be intentional — a way to imitate the chaos and confusion of history as it unfolds. But in key moments it is impossible to register what the characters say. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is also blurred. Images lack sharpness and detail details. The result is a certain graininess and lack of visual sharpness, which leads to blurring of the foreground and background. <br /> <br /> Structural narration is inappropriate, as if Cimino could not decide on the effect he had after. He definitely wanted an epic. But a pastoral or dramatic epic? The film is restless and unconvincing sounds between styles and, perhaps, even genres. Sometimes it reminded me of the “Territory of Malik” “Days of Heaven” or even “Elvira Madigan” in its languid pace and elegant pictorial scene. In other cases, it threatens to turn into a strong “Western”, more similar to “Wild Bouquet”. In fact, the latter film offers an instructive point of reference for evaluating the “Gate of Heaven”, because it shares the concerns of the same period and uses a similar tone of ambivalent nostalgia for dark, but more heroic America. <br /> <br /> This low-quality scenario does not help this structural and thematic uncertainty, which often sounds forced and annoying to hear. The result is an unreliable sense of the speech period. <br /> <br /> Almost the majesty of Heaven's Gate is located in their established parts. In particular, the sequence of roller skates is strikingly beautiful - one of the most memorable scenes ever filmed. <br /> <br /> Another production that works very well in terms of combining themes, moods and settings occurs when Christofferson and Huppert ride a new tower to the lake, and she washes while he sleeps in the shade. This scene combines a languid pace, catchy music and monumental landscapes to convincingly portray a love story that could lie at the heart of the film - and that could be its saving grace if it were pursued more convincingly. <br /> <br /> Some critics complained about the length of the film. That alone does not bother me. A good movie may not be long enough. Restored minutes are crucial for restoring motivation and characteristics that are missing from the trimmed version, and they are full of visual interest. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the main glory of the Gate of Heaven lies in a painfully memorable soundtrack. The repeating waltz motif and its various everywhere (full band, guitar, violin solo, etc.) gives the effect of pursuing the foreground and creates a thematic sequence that is missing in the narrative itself. <br /> <br /> Despite the obviousness of the Disadvantages, especially the lack of a convincing narrative, there is a sense of greatness in the film. One leaves the movie with a sad feeling of missing greatness and the desire that Cimino could return to the film - with the wisdom of time and looking back in time to correct what is so bad.
