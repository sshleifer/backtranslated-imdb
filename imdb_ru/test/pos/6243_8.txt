The Tourist Trap is a weird, gorgeous horror movie from the 70s. The film is about a group of young people, Becky, Jerry and Molly, who travel in a jeep through the desert. Their two other friends, Eileen and her boyfriend Woody, are in a separate car. When the wheel spins, Woody delivers it to the nearest gas station and meets a terrible fate with some strange telekinetic chaos and some creepy mannequins. Friends get tired of waiting for Woody and go to the local tourist trap museum of mannequins / wax figures. Before entering, the car accidentally breaks down, and the girls find an oasis for swimming, to which Mr. Slausen is approaching, who controls the roadside attraction, which is now closed. He takes them to the old western wax museum, and the girls stay there while he and Jerry go to fix their car. Eileen, the curious of them two, wanders next door to the old house, where she also falls into the hands of a mysterious killer in masks and heaps of life, like mannequins. After waiting, Eileen, Becky and Molly go to look for her. It is then that the real horror begins, and the telekinetic (capable of moving objects with his mind) the brother of Mr. Slausen in masks begins to kill the teenagers one by one, while controlling a large number of mannequins turned into human. <br /> Sounds like a 2005 remake of "House of Wax"? Well it is. I heard about this film, but I never saw it when I saw The House of Wax, but now I see a striking similarity between the two films - The Tourist Trap, obviously contributed a lot to the remake of The House of Wax. The mannequins in this movie are frightening, some with moving eyeballs, some without eyes, and some with lowered mouths that also sing. The singing was very creepy, if you ask me, and the mannequins were terribly designed. Mannequins are creepy from the very beginning, they are so realistic, but in reality this is not the case. The film closely combines elements of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the masks that the killer uses are similar to Leatherface masks), with a small amount of the original House of Wax figures and telekinetic abilities, which are displayed in Carrie. The result is quite satisfactory. Telekinesis was a nice touch to the film; it made the killer even more menacing and inevitable. The masks were terrifying, and the plaster scene was really disturbing. <br /> <br /> Estimate for the film was really well done, if not too abused during some scenes. The game may not be particularly key, but it really wasn’t that bad. Chuck Connors was really good as the grim Mr. Slyuston, giving the character a shady but friendly look. Young Tanya Roberts is also present in the film. She is best known for her role in Charlie's Angels and, more recently, the comedy show "This is a 70s show", in which Donna's mother plays. Robert A. Burns is the artistic director, he has done a phenomenal job on the original “Texas Chainsaw” and does well here, creating a cluttered, stale atmosphere for both the worn museum and the old house filled with mannequins. It seemed to me a little strange that the initial rating of the film was “PG”, it seems that it is too frightening to have such a tamed rating, but the film is really not too cruel. <br /> <br /> In general, “The Tourist Trap” is a terribly unique, fast-moving, extremely undervalued horror classic. The Full Moon gave him a decent DVD release on his 20th birthday, the comments were interesting, and the picture was clear and crisp for the most part better than the video version. If you like the old horror films of the 70s, The Tourist Trap is an underestimated retro gem. 8/10.
