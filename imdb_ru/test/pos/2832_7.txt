In general, I want it to be the best movie, but there are enough flashes of powerful force in it to make it worth it. Peck made this film in the same period as Shooter, before he apparently decided that he was a monument, not an actor. A pity! He was a good actor, well prepared to deal with characters that were not very pleasant, and do them very well. The character he plays here is purposeful and, if necessary, ruthless. Given the mission that the character was assigned to, and the “people” with whom he should do this, these characteristics are important. <br /> <br /> Without being a spoiler, think of this film as an earlier, brighter example of the dirty dozen of the genre. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this film is a bit shy, but it's atmospheric and intense, and definitely tells a story worth telling. It contains the good work of all the actors, and even Barbara Payton turns into a credible performance. <br /> <br /> This is not often shown on TV, so your local video store may be the only place to find a copy. , Succeed! Devote him to the evening. It is worth your time!
