Yes, this show had a lot of male frontal nudity, and yes, over the years the storylines have become excessive, melodramatic and very unreal, however, it did not matter, because the show is great. You really get involved in the characters, and every character, no matter whether small or large, is perfectly played. <br /> <br /> I can’t imagine anyone other than J. K. Simmons playing the neo-Nazi leader as a racist rapist, nor anyone else playing Tobias Beecher other than Lee Tergesen. The transformation of his character from season 1 to season is amazing. However, the MADE Oz OZ character was Chris Keller (played by Christopher Meloni). He had no relationship with anyone else in prison other than Beecher (well, except for Ronnie Barlog, but this was only for Ronnie to stop playing with Keller's lover, Beecher). Their relationship exceeded sex, and Tom Fontana actually made us take care of these two and wanted these two to be together. <br /> <br /> I liked Verne's soft spot for his children in the series and how Fontana made the cute characters out of all these disgusting criminals we adored, even Simon Adebesi. <br /> <br /> However, some storylines were completely unbelievable and unreal: * A guy building a ounce bomb * Guys standing in the center of attention in their windows in their boxes looking at other men who they are plotting in their minds - also on top. * Drugs in an ounce * Everyone in the rehab group used or sold drugs, and Sister Pete never helped anyone for six years. * People are killed in the gym, pantry and kitchen. * No one harms Ryan's mom. * No one fights Cyril outside the boxing ring (except, of course, Verna). * Two prisoners with tools left alone in an elevator shaft, and one of them dies without investigation. * Karl Metzger (guard) is killed and no one investigates. * The governor holds all his press conferences in prison. * All a prisoner needs to do is say, “I want to see Glenn,” or “I want to see McManus,” and they are delivered to them without question. * People die every week in Oz. * Outside, people kill someone and get 20 years old, parole of eight, but if they kill someone from the inside, they almost immediately fall into the cell of death sentences. kitchen or post - prisoners manage both departments without asking questions. * Aging medicines for prisoners to replace them over time. * Ryan has no friends or like-minded people, but he is never subjected to injuries, murders, injuries, rape or beatings. * Guys NEVER flush toilets when they go to the bathroom or are thrown. * A scout from the NBA comes to the prison to hire a player from the NBA (yes, right) <br /> <br /> However, despite all these shortcomings, this show is still great. It is terrible, brutal, sexy, poignant, rude and innovative. Dean Winters, Scott William Winters, J. C. Simmons, Christopher Meloni, Louis Guzman, Adel (the guy who played Simon Adebisi), Imonmon Walker, Lee Tergesen, Terry Kinney, Mums, Male Alexander, LL Cool J, etc. D., And so on. D., And so on. D., And so on. D. Everything is amazing and made the show worthy of attention. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend renting it on DVD. The sixth season is 9/06 (next month). The first five seasons on DVD - watch them, and then watch again with audio commentary. I liked the commentary of the director with Chazz Palmentar. The sequence with Andy Schillinger running across the dining room tables and then falling into the hole was awesome at the highest level !!!! Kudos! And Katie Bates, the director of Family Business and the famous scene of the struggle between Beecher and Keller, is simply amazing !! Brilliant !!! It would be so strange if Meloni touched the private part of Torgessen in front of an icon like Kathy Bates in this scene !! Blimey! Handled it well, pun intended! <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for Oz: Next generation !!!! (as with Star Trek, etc.) Come on !!! Let's start !!!!
