I saw this film over 20 years ago and I still remember how much I loved it. it really touched me, and I thoroughly enjoyed the work of Noel Trus in this. Highly recommended: atmospheric and touching. <br /> <br /> I think about this film from time to time, and I’m disappointed that he didn’t get as much of a revival as many classic films. While I was not looking for him today, he received an Academy Award for the best original story about Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. <br /> <br /> The main thing in it is a vile character who destroys someone else’s career and damn It. he dies, but he is allowed atonement if he can convince someone to shed a tear over him. Most of the films show him in achieving this goal. well written and cute. I knew him from his plays, so I was surprised to see him in that role on TV late at night in New York. Be sure to see if you have such an opportunity.
