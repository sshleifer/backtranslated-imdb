I like it. In fact, I watched it again and again, and I could watch it again. This movie does not get boring. <br /> <br /> The concept of the vampire in this film is revolutionized. This is a job well done, great for today's generation. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes was born for this role. Stephen Dorff was the perfect vampire. Arly Jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me any time she wants, and what a sexy accent she has. Donal Log provides great comic relief. <br /> <br /> This vampire movie is different. I can't wait for Blade 2.
