This is a pleasant project, not a movie, as the name suggests. Good performance Nadia Dajani, who again plays the role of Grace. I follow the repetition of what is happening with Mike and Grace in New York. She leaves, but he wants to contact her. This project is his attempt to contact her. <br /> <br /> I saw this in the IFC. I heard that it will be released on DVD. I like this trend of more independent projects. This is an example of a good project. <br /> <br /> I hope he finds it. <br /> <br /> See and have fun. <br /> <br /> KirbyEF
