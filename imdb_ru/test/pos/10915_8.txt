I have seen this movie many times, and I never get bored. We are talking about a man coming out of the closet, about which he does not know where he is. Kevin Klein's character is a teacher, and when one of his former students declares that Klein's character is gay, people in his city start thinking about whether he is straight or gay. Klein's character begins to wonder if he is direct or fun too. Acting is absolutely incredible and fun by all the actors. I found the film very funny and soulful. I like this movie, it makes you laugh and makes you feel good while watching. I recommend this movie to everyone, you will have a great time watching it.
