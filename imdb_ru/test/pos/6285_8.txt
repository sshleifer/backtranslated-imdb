When I first saw that this film was going to play on TV, I just found out about the insane beach, like this comic joke, who was wearing really weird outfits that day. I still decided to watch it, and I was impressed. The shore brings fresh breath of air to the screen. in this film, he crawls as a college advisor, who probably needs his own adviser. Carla Gugino, in an underestimated role, plays Becca, a Midwestern “farm girl” with a simple family and a guy from the movie Travis. when she heads off into the school, she meets crawling, and he quickly turns her into a playful, blond California girl. she decides to bring crawling home for the thanksgiving holiday. when Travis decides to make an offer, Becke needs to be distracted. crawl decides to make everyone believe that he and Becca are already engaged. this leads to a crawling seasoning romance between Becky's parents, making friends with her brother, and even making the dancers at the local bar relax. I'm not going to disclose the end, but I liked it. in any case, do not rent it if you want a sharp performance; Rent it if you want to laugh at your ass and enjoy the often overlooked part of the 90s humor.
