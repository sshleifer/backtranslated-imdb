definitely the best game for the N64. I most of all say that I am terribly disappointed that tomorrow I will never die, but the world does not have enough promises to be better than a golden eye (according to the website). I love the golden eye so much that I find something to do every time I play it. I even made up my own missions for levels. Multiplayer is the best of all games, and the graphics are amazing even now. I remember on the first day I wanted them to come back and turn all connection films into games. Can you imagine how you ride this high speed boat live and let you die and make these incredible jumps, or fight a ninja or fight your jaws in a spy who loved me and Moonraker. (I think it would be more fun to fight him in these games than in the Aztecs). And what about chasing Sanchez in gas trucks or for throwing St. Kerils just in your eyes. oh well, let me go back to the game at hand. All levels are unique and create very funny killing conditions. There are many places where you can hide, so that you can sneak up on people (especially the park of statues), and this game should not be rented, you really need to buy it today.
