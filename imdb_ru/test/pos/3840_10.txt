This is one of my favorite movies ever. The story is fantastic, and the characters are so good. Unlike other Disney films of the time, this film never tires the viewers. 101 Dalmatia, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but not enough of what we have here. It is funny, creative and always aimed. There is something else in this film that you cannot learn in books. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. This title is owned by BRILLIANT Toy Story. But this is a respectable second, followed immediately by the "Lady and the Tramp." Just look and enjoy what is one of the greatest achievements of the cinema. And, by the way, I'm not a small child, this is for an older audience who wants to regain their childhood. Absolutely necessary!
