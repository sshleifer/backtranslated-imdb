This typical film for teenagers is one of the best, besides a good story, music accompanies the film well all the time. <br /> <br /> Although I do not enjoy a classic film, if it is not a classic and better written script, this film is exceptional. Perhaps the hair style and tongue should change a little, in the 80s, I believe, abusive language is still rarely heard. <br /> <br />
