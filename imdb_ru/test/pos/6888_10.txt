I love the Promised Land very much. The first episode that I saw was during my mission in 2003-2005. I really loved the rich family story depicted in the show. Here was a family with its own struggle, but instead of dwelling on it; they will lovingly turn to those who may have the same problems, trying to forget themselves and go to work. This is what made me fall in love with the show. All the actors; especially Gerald McRoney; demonstrated the true meaning of the word "family", which left an indelible mark on my life. I followed the same path as they did, but it took me a long time to develop this kind of character. I love this show so much that I want to share it with friends; but I was really stunned when I heard that he was taken off the air. I thought and still think they should return it! So many lives can benefit from heaven-inspired media. I truly believe that this show was divinely inspired; because it brings spirit every time I see only one episode. This show really (in my book) really defined what the Promised Land is. It is the love that you hold in your heart for others; which leads you to a higher goal. The spirit of love is one of the strongest messages in this series, and all I can say is to bring it back. -Robert
