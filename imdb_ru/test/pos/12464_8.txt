This is both an exciting and touching version of a classic fairy tale, also quite smart, not at all about the school “I, Tarzan, you, Jane”. <br /> <br /> This is a famous story about children who grew up to adulthood. in the jungle monkeys. Titled British couple (wife is pregnant) stuck in the wilds after a shipwreck. After the death of their parents, monkeys grow in the jungle. Twenty years later, this young man (t. E. Tarzan) rescues a wounded Belgian researcher, returning him to recovery. The Belgian discovers evidence that the young Lord Greystock is his savior and returns him to his legal estate in Scotland, where he must adapt to a civilized society. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two parts. In the first half, we see Tarzan in his jungle. Not being an expert, I don’t know how realistic it is to depict the life of the monkey community, but it’s certainly interesting. For me, a more touching section is the second half, when Tarzan must meet with his real family, develop language skills and adapt to aristocratic British society, all the while caring for Jane (Andy MacDowell). He is portrayed as a “noble savage”, whether in the wild or in elegant Edwardian salons. On the contrary, the upper part of the bark is depicted much more barbaric than the jungle left by Tarzan. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert fantastically portrays Tarzan in the jungle and in a civilized environment. He conveys a real sense of his confusion and conflict, torn between two completely different worlds, his original family of monkeys and his new human. Sir Ralph Richardson, one of the oldest British legends, is magnificent, as always, as the grandfather of Tarzan, the sixth Earl of Greystoke. <br /> <br /> In the film, more attention is paid to Tarzan’s struggle to adapt to civilization and its internal conflict than to his exploits in the jungle. This unusual look at the old classics makes it at the same time a typical dramatic adventure, as well as, above all, a touching personal story. I was not surprised to see here that it was directed by the same man, Hugh Hudson, who also shot Chariots of Fire, another brilliant film.
