What `s the show! Lorenzo Lamas once again proves his talent as a cop who has committed the worst crime a good cop can do by being a good cop. Then he again shows how sensitive a policeman can be, demonstrating a number of emotions that no other actor can, except perhaps for himself in Terminal Justice. <br /> <br /> HUGE PLEASURE!
