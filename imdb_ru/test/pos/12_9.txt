I was pleasantly surprised to see this film as a preview in my local theater. <br /> <br /> We have all seen this storyline before (Top Gun, GI Jane, officer and gentleman), but this is a good script still works. This story is mainly about the preparation of the Coast Guard rescue team with several side storylines. Kevin Costner plays a very successful rescue team leader Ben Randall, who is forced to lead the training team after a difficult mission. The film tells us about the difficulties of the educational process and the personal stories of the character Costner and Jake Fisher, played by Ashton Kutcher. I am pleased to report that Ashton is great in this part. <br /> <br /> There are no big surprises in this film, and you will probably understand what is happening long before its appearance. Nevertheless, the use of humor, the study of the rigidity of training and funny observation of how Ben Randall “does his job as a coach,” kept me excited and entertained. I enjoy watching a movie that makes the whole audience laugh out loud, gasp here and there, and clap at the end as a tribute to the cinema. <br /> <br /> We all had a good time (despite a couple of difficult moments in the film) and, I think, you too.
