Ghoulies 4 is a pretty awful sequel. Ghouls are very different from the first three ghouls, but it's still cool there. There are some good memories from the first Guli movie. Jonathan is back in this again. He was not in parts 2 or 3, though. The film is at times low-budget, but it's interesting to watch. You have Tony Cox as the Dark Ghoul and Arturo Gil as the Light Ghoul. The hunters in this film are really good guys, not evil, like in the first three films. Both Gooley are pretty funny characters in the movie. Then you have a very hot Alexandra! This is a great dark comedy and funny! Any fan of ghoul movies will enjoy watching Ghoulies 4. The DVD will finally be released in July 2007! Hopefully one day, Ghoulies III will appear on DVD in the USA. I would really like to see the continuation of this film one day. I doubt this will happen though. It's 2007 now and so far there are no signs of continuation. If there is ever a sequel, I hope Jim Winsky does it. <br /> <br /> I give Ghoulies IV 9/10
