I enjoyed it. Well, I said it again. I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it a couple more times. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer films like this garbage, like Die Hard 4, which supports box office and gets critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving America. Van Damme is great for a guy of his age (I think 47), performing kicks that look like a kickboxer. If you like old school battles and explosions, this is a movie to watch. This is one of the best works of Van Damme. <br /> <br /> Van Damme and Steven Seagalâ€™s films go out in theaters where I live, so I never miss the chance to see our star action movies on the big screen.
