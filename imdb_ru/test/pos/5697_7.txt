<br /> <br /> Since I am a teenager, I have about a hundred years of cinema to catch up. I'm trying to see a mixture of classic, mainstream, art house and other films. The 70s are one of the most important decades for films: it was then that ordinary, classic films turned into a multitude of messages and anti-social behavior. It became like no one had ever seen before. What basically shows the “Decade Under the Influence” is how important all the films from Graduate to Star Wars are. <br /> <br /> Richard Lagravenes and the late Ted Demme are the main interviewers in this documentary, which are interviewed by people like Dennis Hopper, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman and John Voight, among others about how these few years have changed the movie forever. This is a very professional, well-honed documentary, and it is even funded by IFC films. However, since this is very professional, I think they will at least edit the noise of someone who laughs behind the camera. For me, it showed how everything was neat and clean. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is a very interesting documentary about the people who filmed it. Of course, they do not make their own films or something like that, but they portray honesty in what they thought about the films and what they had in mind. I don't know much about the film (but I want to be involved in it when I become an adult), so I feel that for someone like me this film is a huge asset. I have seen many films that they mentioned, such as Chinatown and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, but a little more information about these films was very informative. <br /> <br /> However, I did not. Love Influence, no matter how it was edited, at first seemed to take its time and was quite relaxed, so he did not have enough time to get to everything they wanted to show. They huddled in Star Wars and Jaws in the last few minutes, when they were two of the most important. They seemed to be trying too hard to show a lot of clips, and this is normal, but some of them were not important, for example, extended from Network. <br /> <br /> In general, Influence is a very entertaining, informative documentary that helped me at least learn more about the second “golden age” in American cinema. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> R for language and images of sexuality, violence and drug use.
