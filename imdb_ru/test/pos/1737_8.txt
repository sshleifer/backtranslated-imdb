In September 2003, I heard that the BBC was going to revive the WHO DOCTOR and make it “More and Better”, but I heard these rumors in the press before and thought that this was all they were - Rumors. But then it was mentioned that Russell T Davis was going to executively produce and write the show, and then, once on a Saturday afternoon in March 2004, on channel 4, the news interviewed the actor in the lead role - Christopher Eccleston. Yes, that Christopher Eccleston, an actor whom I have always been impressed with since I watched his debut in the movie "GIVE IT HAVE IT", and if he was interviewed on television, that should have been true. As the months went by, more and more information leaked out, Billie Piper picked up, Daleks returned, and the Hollywood effects company, The Mill, who worked on FX for GLADIATOR, was contracted for special effects for the show. For several weeks before the first broadcasts announced the return of a new series, massive billboards in London informed the public about the return of the show, huge photo stories with newcomers were placed in the tabloid newspapers, and Christopher Eccleston appeared in such diverse programs as BLUE PETER, MASTERMIND (Which had a special evening edition of WHO DOCTOR), THIS MORNING and NIGHT FRIDAY WITH JONATHAN ROSS. In fact, this new series of WHO DOCTOR must have been the most promoted program in the history of British television, it would have been better damn good. <br /> <br /> So what the hell is that good? Undoubtedly, it was a great success with almost every episode in the top ten shows on the television charts. To give you an idea of ​​success in the rankings, only one episode (the second episode of "The Ark in Space" - February 1975) from the old series hit the top five television charts. In the first episode of the series there was number three with two more episodes that either beat or equalized the previous record, and this is in an era when competition in terms of television stations and choice is much higher. Let's laugh and cheer on the fact that the DOCTOR who stuffed me with Heath as a Baby is ONE MORE TIME, STRUGGLE AGAINST and disfigured the ants AND CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT SHOWER NIGHT. Of course, much of the success depends on breathtaking visual effects and acting out on the famous prestigious actor in this role. For the most part, everything you see here on the screen is equal to everything you see in the Spielberg / Hollywood movie. There is a Dalek invasion group numbering tens of thousands of exotic newcomers, a 19th-century Cardiff that looks like a 19th-century Cardiff, and a night shot, which is actually a night shot, rather than a dark filter overlay on the screen. I promise that you will hear much more from the directors who worked on this series, especially Joe Acharn once will be in Hollywood. List <br /> <br /> In the new series of the WHO DOCTOR there are some flaws and they should all be at the door of Russell T Davis. It may be debatable whether soap operas and postmodern elements are successful or not (in my opinion, this is not so), but what is not disputed is that the weakest scenarios are written by RTD. As I mentioned in my CASANOVA review, he deceives the audience, and he does the same here: when he encounters armed soldiers who have sent their weapons at him, the Doctor roars the “delta of attack plan”, which makes no sense to anyone in the audience, but allowing him to escape from a difficult place, naked captain Jack suddenly gets a laser that he hid, and RTD scripts are full of cheats of this type and endings like deus ex machina. In fact, the last episode is badly flawed by the ridiculous concept of what a “bad wolf” is, which seems to have gotten an RTD from a difficult situation more than the “Doctor”. And from the endings that I'm trying to remember, was any of them really up to the Doctor? Most often, this is a helper character or companion to the Doctor who saves the day. The show is called DOCTOR, not ROSE TYLER, so we can see how the main character saves the day, as in the classic series? And the last remark about the image of the Doctor is how he is written as a smirking loon. Eccleston is best known for his serious and gloomy roles, and he is absolutely breathtaking in the scenes when he shows grief, like a tear running down his face in the End of the World, but more often he is written as “Tom Baker at speed” character. It's clear why Eccleston didn't do a lot of comedies in his career - he's not very good at it <br /> <br /> I start to sound like I hate this show? Sorry, I didn’t want to, but just some of the expectations were met or exceeded some, and almost all belong to Russell T Davis, who fortunately contributes less to the scenarios in the next series. DOCTOR WHO . Let's look at more traditional stories about how the human outpost is threatened by monsters, as we saw in the 1960s and 70s, let's present a story like Sea Devils with a huge budget, directed by Joe Ahern! Yes, and the last request - Can we see these "NEXT TIME" trailers written off? They reveal the best moments of the episode next week
