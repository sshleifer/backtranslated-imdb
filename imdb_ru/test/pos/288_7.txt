One thing that I encountered when watching this movie is that it was fun / exciting for the cast and crew; I could feel that they were going against the budget constraint with enthusiasm and dedication, because they obviously liked the people involved. <br /> <br /> I like films B, which are original and have a heart, and I think this is one of those works. It seems to me that the actors put more hearts into it than usual, perhaps because of some kind of good leadership from the main actress / director, and they were obviously quite clear in their parts of the story to make a coherent watchable piece of art. <br /> <br /> Criticism of this film, which more or less say, “why not just take a hardcore porn movie,” make a point why they don’t like this movie. Visiting this film in the hope of a large amount of T & A without patience for the plot material is why it is so unpleasant for them. We can say that the film is more of a romantic work than the erotic of a porn movie, although I understand that the star has done its share of soft porn. I think she finished. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of writing, the dialogue is not a huge part of the film, as in the movie Tarentino, but the plot is decent, and the plots are original and sometimes funny. In particular, the finale is not a disappointment, but a pleasure, where the heroine / heroine and the “leading person” learn from their complex web of feelings. <br /> <br /> I understand that the producer has signed a contract for 3 films. Take off your hat for having proven tens of thousands of dollars, it can go very far if you have artistic sensitivity and pride. <br /> <br /> Gabriella and the other girls with nude scenes were pleasant along with the fact that they were hot, not just air buffaloes, like an erotic science fiction play with some gorgeous nude art, even as part of B- The film land is not disappointing.
