I just saw this movie again, I think, for the sixth time. I will undoubtedly see it many more times. This is one of the most exciting French films in history. Although the film is mysterious, what happened to the writer and director Gilles Mimouni is even more mysterious. For ten years, he did not shoot another film, and it was his only one. The history and performance of this brilliant film is impeccable, and he constantly pays tribute to both Hitchcock and Buster Keaton. The fractional-second time for the movements is just as carefully controlled as the scene where the side of the house falls on Keaton on Steamboat Bill Junior, and he just isn't killed a few inches. In this film, people lean, turn, and overtake each other by surprise, and if they had one second, they would have collided. Thus, the storyline runs so intensely at random events that you cannot take your eyes off the screen for even a millisecond, otherwise you will miss something important. Peter Chase’s ghostly, albeit deliberately repeated music reminds us of Hitchcock’s “Vertigo,” and the whole movie has the same eerie quality, but while Hitchcock’s one woman was two women, Mimuni’s two women were the same woman that the plot structure has been inverted. There are passing references to other Hitchcock films, but it is “Vertigo” that is the central element of this film’s inspiration. Externally, the topic may seem obsessive love, but the film is actually about the magic of everyday random events, invisible threads behind the tapestry, inexpressible. Everything is overly charged with passionate love and desire, but desire surpasses its object and fights for something behind the object and beyond. That is why he is so easily transferred from Lisa to Alice when he realizes that it is Alice who is more mysterious than Lisa, and it is Alice who truly embodies the Eternal Secret. The film is ultimately “made” by Roman Beringer. She is so charming that she overshadows Monica Bellucci, which you really need to experience, given that Bellucci is a knockout beauty, while Bringer is what the British call "simple." However, Romane Bringer, even at this early time, mastered the art of “domination of the personality” when beautiful girls fall by the wayside and do not notice, because Romana is so charming that you cannot take your eyes off her. Just look at the beautiful girls, and in the end you only think about her. I’m sure most of us remember her father Richard Behringer lying in the bathroom and listening to opera in the movie “Diva” many years ago. I would prefer to watch Roman, not with Richard lying in the bath, but it looks like there is some genetic secret in how to be charming, because Richard Beringer is also fascinating, and he is not even a woman. Romana looks as if she can turn into Anna Magnani when she becomes much older, which means that she will receive an Oscar if someone can write her another Tatu Rosa. There is so much passion in her that she can set the Seine on fire. Wouldn't it be great if they and Julia Delpy were united? This film is perfectly used places in Paris. But where is this "square in Luxembourg"? It looked like a Fürstenburg place to me. Maybe I missed something. I have to watch the film six more times, just to study the accuracy of the timing and of the one who is passing, and make sure that I understand correctly. All this is similar to the ten giant chess games played by the grandmaster blindfolded. How exciting it all is! Romana, you can look in my window at any time! Mimuni, come on, let's discuss the impossibility, low probability, coincidence, synchronicity, everything that happens, what is invisible, and how it affects the visible. And here again we have the spirit of the Breton novel Nadya, embodied in the great French work of art. More! More! More!
