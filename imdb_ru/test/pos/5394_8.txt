I'm not going to tell anyone what happens in the end, but it did not fit into the film. The remaining Imaginary Heroes, however, portrayed a realistic family, experiencing realistic problems such as death, drugs, relationships, and high school. I could swear it was my own family, no kidding. <br /> <br /> Emil Hirsch was quite plausible when the teenager fought his brother's suicide, and Sigourney Weaver was played by a mother trying to keep her remains of a (slightly) dysfunctional family together. <br /> <br /> Although this family can take its problems to the extreme, anyone can relate to what they are going through, whether it is graduation, meeting expectations, or being a parent.
