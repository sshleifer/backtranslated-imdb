This is without a doubt one of the funniest and most interesting films I've ever seen. I really liked the characters in the movie. All of them are amazingly bizarre. This is something I have never seen in any movie. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning to the end, the story is practically non-stop. There are no boring moments. I was completely captured by the film. And I thought the acting was great. <br /> <br /> So if you want to watch a funny movie. You have to look for green butchers. A great movie. <br /> <br /> I give it a 10/10
