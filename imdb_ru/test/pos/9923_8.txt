Opera (1987) <br /> <br /> Director: Dario Argento (Deep Red, Suspiria) Scenario: Dario Argento and Franco Ferrini (Church, Sleepless, Demons) Photo: Ronnie Taylor (Choir Line, Sleepless) Music: Claudio Simonetti (“The Phenomenon”, “Goblin”) History <br /> <br />: Betty (Cristina Marsillah) - Lady Macbeth's student in a very stylized production of Verdi's opera “Macbeth”. The time to shine Betty comes when the star-diva breaks her leg before the opening of the night, when she is knocked down by a car running into hysterics. Macbeth’s famous curse takes on a more sinister and calculating turn as the body immediately begins to increase. It seems that Betty gets her first fan through the pursuer, who binds her and attaches needles to her eyes, to make her witness the horrible killings of people around her. Plot: 3 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Acting: in many of these Italian films it is sometimes difficult to judge. English, Italian, French, German, Spanish can sometimes be in the same row, as they usually speak their native languages, which makes dubbing a rule of thumb and difficult to judge. As a result, I usually weaken them a little. Acting: 4 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Direction: Djallo maestro Argento is again in the genre that helped the pioneer. "Opera" shows him on top of his game with an exquisite combination of blood, tension and beauty. Direction: 4 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Visual: it must be one of the best Argento films. Superbly filmed by Taylor, “Opera” has an amazing and inventive cinematographic work that allows the film to work quickly and diligently, and also gives pleasure. It seems that the camera always has an idea of ​​whether it is an excellent shot from a camera climbing a spiral staircase, or an episode approaching the end from a bird's eye view when this bird is circling in a crowd at the opera house. Visual: 5 of 5 Audio <br /> <br /> Audio: Argento Simonetti's frequent collaborator (through his various Goblin, Demonian and solo groups) complements the action on the screen with zeal when his score moves from classical (Verdi) to metal thinking ( with a little help from Brian and Roger Ino and Bill Wyman) and gives the musical muscles bloody screen fading. Thanks to the sound design, you get everything you need: from shots to shots, from fire to screams and masterful re-performance on the Anchor Bay disc in a magnificent 6.1 for every crunch and impact. Audio: 5 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Technical information: thanks to editing, the film moves wonderfully and moves. In combination with camera work, editing assistance saves surreal dreamy images. The exquisite opera house is one of the hellish places and is perfect for staging a horrible version of Macbeth. You can’t finish reviewing an Argento movie without commenting on the killings. Argento sends the characters with glee this time with a brilliant sequence of blows, a raveny shudder and a bright moment from the movie when a pistol shot penetrates the eye and crashes into the back of the head, which once again sends the former wife of Argento to Daria Nicolodi to the morgue movie. Priceless! Technical: 5 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Summing up: an almost flawless text that suffers from a bit of unnecessary epilogue in Switzerland, which delivers all the visual sensations that Argento fans crave. <br /> <br /> Overall: 4 of 5
