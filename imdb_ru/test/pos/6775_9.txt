The art of the absurd is alive and well in modern Danish cinema! Well, at least it's in this movie. No one in this movie is surprised. They are all either annoyed or shocked, and if they haven’t already done so, they will be soon! This is a story of failures, murders, embarrassment, dignity and, in the end, love and redemption. The awful, awkward humorous style is idiomatic and will not please everyone, but I personally found that it contains only the right exciting mix of the strange and the absurd. You feel sorry for characters at a distance, even if you don’t like them close and personally. But their story is so tragic that you yourself can forgive them and be glad for them, even if they get away with the murder. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, the best Danish film about the past few years. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
