Dear Lily is fantastic! This is definitely one of my favorite movies! It certainly did not deserve the bad reviews it received. Julie Andrews starring Lily Smith (Schmidt) - the best part of the whole movie. She is charming and spectacular! As Julie Andrews is my favorite actress and singer, I was definitely not surprised at how stunning she was. This film is just ... great (I’m running out of adjectives!), It’s great, amazing, amazing, funny, terribly romantic, sad and just awesome, and it's all thanks to the lady Julie Andrews! And her husband, director Blake Edwards. Oh, yes, Rock Hudson was fine too :) <br /> <br /> Julie Andrews is the beautiful and beloved singer Lily Smith. Rock Hudson portrays Major Larabi, who quickly falls in love with Lily, and she is with him. But their business was not accidental. There, the meeting was scheduled by the German government (I'm not sure that you call them that way, but you understand what the point is), because the warm, happy, singing actress Lily is actually a German spy. Lily is ordered to seduce Major Larabi to get information about the new Top Secret operation (later known as “Crepe Suzette”). Although Lily is on a solemn mission, she falls in love with Bill (Major Larabi), which makes her original quest difficult. But Lily does her job when she finds out something that’s not quite right about Bill. The end will remain unsaid by me, as it is wonderfully laid out. If you like something, you will love this film, I probably did it !!!!!!!! <br /> <br />
