* May contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> I first saw this film when it was re-released on video when I was about 8 years old. Now I am 17 years old, and I still watch it when I have a chance. “Aristocrats” was a sweet heart movie that I immediately fell in love with. I really liked the songs, especially the ones that kittens sing on the piano. In fact, I even sang her in a talent show with my sister and girlfriend, as I liked it very much. All three kittens are so cute, and their mother is one of the most beautiful cartoon cats I've ever seen. The ally cat had a great voice! <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when kittens play the piano. This part is amazing. I also like their journey home. This is incredible. This is one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen, and one of my favorites. Everybody must see it. I give this movie 10/10 stars.
