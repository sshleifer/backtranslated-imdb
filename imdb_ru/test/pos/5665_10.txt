Giorgino is a long and painful journey from bad to worst in the life of the main character, after whom the film is named. A young demobilized, gas-poisoned First World War lieutenant with very delicate health, who was previously a doctor at a shelter for children with some mental disabilities, goes in search of their new location and finds much more than he ever intended, and a completely different nature. The depressive atmosphere of complete despair, where the insane are much less terrible than the sane, where insanity is a kind of poetry, will keep you hypnotized from the very first frames of this film to the last. And all the beauty: the beauty of winter and mountains, the beauty of snow landscapes and wild forests, I do not even know how all the sorrows and sorrows of the last days of the war could be made so beautiful.
