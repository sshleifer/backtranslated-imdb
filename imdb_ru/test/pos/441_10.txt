French Cancan is one of my favorite films of all time. This is a great movie. There is color, there is humor, there is music. This is a very good portrait of the so-called "Beautiful Age", although the priorities of Jean Renoir have always been to show creativity and imagination. So the film is not a historical film. The final episodes in which girls dance cancan are unforgettable images. This is a movie you should not miss.
