Critters 4 is a good movie. A small twist on the series, as it happens in space, and not in the earthly community. Good effects and acting make this movie a must-see. I would recommend this to all horror / science fiction fans. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Horror Fans. These films should be checked at Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Sleep Away Camp, Slumber Party Massacre and other full moon.
