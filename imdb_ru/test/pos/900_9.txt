Gen-Y Cops ... since I heard about the release of the film, I have long wanted to watch it, because I liked Gen-X Cops. I was a little disappointed that A) Nicholas Tse did not return and B) too much farce. However, I liked the sequel, because it may not be very good, like the first film, but it’s good in its own way. <br /> <br /> Stephen Fung returns to the role of the ultra-cold female match “Match”, in which there is a permanent girl Olya (NOTE: where is Hayes?) -English !!!!). The real star of the film is newcomer Edison Chen. He makes an excellent replacement for Nicholas Tse as ... Edison. I also liked Paul Rudd's speech with Agent Curtis ... he seems to be as strong as a nail, an intelligent FBI agent you would like to hate ... but soon you will like his character. <br /> <br /> The fight scene in this is much better ... although there are very few of them, but they are great, courtesy of Jackie Chan's stuntman Nikki Lee. <br /> <br /> Look for Ron Smurenburg's cameo as a cell of the cage, which has a small little fight with the match. Smurenburg is also a backup for Rudd. <br /> <br /> If you like GEN-X COPS ... you will love GEN-Y COPS !!!
