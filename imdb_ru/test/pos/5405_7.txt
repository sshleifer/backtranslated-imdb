Imaginary Heroes is a 2004 film with Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels, Emile Hirsch, Michelle Williams, and Kip Pardue. <br /> <br /> The story of a dysfunctional family, which becomes even more dysfunctional when the eldest child (Purdy) commits suicide. <br /> <br /> “Ordinary People” is often mentioned in connection with this film; this is a kind of “Ordinary people” with changing roles. The mother in this case, Sandy Travis (Weaver), is more accessible than the father, Ben (Daniels), who is clearly devastated and unable to cope. Like Ordinary People, the film’s focus is on the youngest son Tim (Hirsch). <br /> <br /> For me, the movie was exciting enough to keep watching, but there is a curious detachment in it. There were some wonderful interactions - mother and son, mother and neighbor, brother and sister (Williams) and some good unusual moments. What never clicked was that Ben was part of this family or had chemistry with Sandy. It seems that this was the goal of director / writer Dan Harris. In one of the scenes at the grocery store, the child at the checkout assumes that Sandy is “about 30,” and gives her her phone number. Almost in the next scene, Daniels asks Sandy if she wants plastic surgery on her birthday. Weaver was 55 years old when this film was made, in fact, probably 54, and looks phenomenal. So what is Ben looking at? However, there is something strange in Ben’s complete detachment, because the viewer really doesn’t see how Daniels has ever been attached to this family. <br /> <br /> At the end there are a couple of turns, as well as some very touching scenes. Everyone is very good, among them are Weaver and Hirsch. <br /> <br /> In this film there is not a lot of dialogue and a lot of views. The script could be sharper. But "Imaginary Heroes" is a good effort.
