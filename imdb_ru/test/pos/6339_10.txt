A great episode that showed that Dean not only tastes good, chooses Cassie for his girlfriend, but also shows that he has a heart and can only love one woman, and he is not just some guy who loves them and leaves their! Aweso e episode. Applaud them on this. I just hope that somehow they will return to a relationship with Cassie next season (if there will be another season?). I would like her to return to their “supernatural” lives, especially in the life of Dean. I also like the fact that an African American woman has chosen a particular woman in her life who has somehow escaped. I hope that they do not screw it up and do not finish it, as he finished the episode. The girl who played Cassie was really an observer, and it was nice to see the WB branch out into what we all see in everyday life - the intercommunity link that became common and acceptable (finally!)
