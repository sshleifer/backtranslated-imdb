This movie is shocked !!!! Saw it on screening a couple of weeks ago. Some strange story where James Franco plays this idiot who marries Sienna Miller just to leave the country and they go to Niagara Falls for a honeymoon. I do not want to give it away, because the film has not yet come out, but it is absolutely awesome and you never expect it to happen. I thought I would hate it because it is romance, but it is also a bit perverted and the like, which I really like. The acting is really good, and Sienna Miller completely smokes and plays this really cute girl. I think she should play more of these roles. James plays a jerk, but in the end he likes you, and the end of the film is really good. David Carradine plays a cowboy and he is good. I gave this film 10 because I came out of the film that I really liked and wanted to see it again, which I did not expect, and my girlfriend liked it very much, and he cried. good date
