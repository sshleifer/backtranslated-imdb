I SELL DEAD (2009) ** 1/2 Dominic Monaghan, Larry Fessenden, Ron Perlman, Angus Scrimm, John Speradacos, Eileen Colgan, Brenda Cooney. An uneven mixture of horror and comedies, which is a horror film valentine of the 60s from Roger Corman and Hammer Studios, with two dirty grave robbers (Monaghan and Fessenden) who face the final punishment for crimes through the guillotine, but not earlier than their Occult stories can be remembered in memories. Amusing and somewhat well splashed, but in reality the disorder in B-films, trying to be a cult classic in the spirit, is largely due to the castes of the veterinarians of the Perlman and Scrimma genres to no avail; good Halloween rentals. (Directed by: Glenn McQuade)
