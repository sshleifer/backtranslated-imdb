It should be one of the best films we have seen, and we highly recommend it because it exposes the injustice of bigotry. Billy Wirth is an incomparable actor, and he is truly amazing, like Corby / White Wolf. However, I felt that the story would have been improved if his character had more scenes. This is a movie that can be watched over and over without fatigue.
