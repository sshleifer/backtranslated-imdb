Wow, I'm sure I saw quite a lot of Kelly McCarthy this summer. I did not know that this woman has made so many erotic films in the past three years. It is like seeing a future star erotic star in front of you, very much like Michelle Hall did a couple of years ago. <br /> <br /> “Peak of Passion” is the third quality erotic film in which I saw Kelly McCarthy with “Girl for a Girl” and “House of Love” being different. “Desire and deception” were fine, but it was not impressive. This review has spoilers, so read only if you want. <br /> <br /> The story begins when Christina (Kelly McCarthy) travels from a big city to the mountains. She inherited the house from her dear late grandmother and plans to turn it into a mountain house. Even before she had time to fold something, some woman named Kim (uncredited in this film, but rather aggressive) starts ordering guests to stay there. Now she needs to quickly put the house in order - Chip (Bobby Johnston), a childhood friend, comes to the rescue. Chip helps her bring home into working condition. She hires two local idlers to work in her house — Chip Bait’s sister (Samantha McConnell) and her sex friend Hank. <br /> <br /> Now the guests are starting to come. The first to come are Eric and Linda (Flower), two stereotypical lawyers dealing with money. Linda and Erik quarreled during the mid-dinner dinner movie, which led to their separation; sad things there. Next comes the romance novelist Sophia, played by the B-movie goddess Monique Parent. She uses this stupid pseudonym Scarlet Johansing again, and this time she looks very professional - with blond hair, of course. It would not be Monica if she didn’t have at least one scene where she plays with herself - and she is obliged during one of the sex scenes of Eric and Linda. <br /> <br /> James and Chenet (Devinn Lane --yes, pornstar Devinn Lane) show a small weekend, as well. Unbeknownst to Chenet, James and Christina have a great history. James and Christina used to meet, but Christina tore them to go to this mountain box. James walks over to the couch to get Christina back, but his plan has failed. Christine sheds the Chaine beans, which is why Schene goes to him and goes down to the local bar to get undressed for the locals. Shene is in the sleeping bag of the now only Eric, and they leave together. Beit realizes that she wants something more than just sex with Hank, and Christina finds true love with Chip, and Sophia absorbs it all and writes in her next love affair. <br /> <br /> Actually .... if you ask me, this whole film is played like a novel. I don’t know if the screenwriter was going to achieve this effect, but I definitely got the impression. Sophia had some of the best stories in this film, which reinforced the idea that it was a living novel. She seems to like all the fights and stabs in the back. <br /> <br /> Now about sex. It was quite a lot, and it was the usual irregularities. Monica was pretty moaning in her two sex scenes. This film was noteworthy, and this story really interested the audience between the sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Monique was just Monique. Of all the erotic actresses I've seen over the years, in my opinion, she is the best in acting, she really can act and be sexy, so she is held at number 1 in my Skinemax Top 10. Kelly McCarthy is better at shooting erotic films than the soap opera Passion; I don’t know why she doesn’t do more than that. The flower was just a secondary landscape mostly in a limited role. Samantha McConnell continues to impress me, and Devinn Lane is another a tough actress crossing into the realm of erotica and doing a decent job halfway there.) Sex: B (It was good, but not impressively exciting. Lots of groans. Do not look at the R-Rating. version, believe me to me .... most of the good things have been removed. My grade for the uncut version.) History: B (A solid storyline, which ich adds an artificial storyline "Oh, the construction inspector will close us" by the end, which spoils everything. The main story between Christina and James was pleasant, and Sophia’s dialogue, full of metaphors and images commonly found in novels, was a nice touch.) <br /> <br /> Overall: B + (I found this movie quite fascinating. Softcore's not true Hall of Fame as "Girl for Girl", but this is a respectable addition to the Skinemax collection.)
