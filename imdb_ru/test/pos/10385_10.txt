Looks like a betting movie I've ever seen. not too much for sensible perception, but so rich for sensitive perception. Antonioni is relatively wise in his film. Malkovich is so organic, the roles are so true, the situations are so real. I changed my worldview after this cinema. I am a novice writer in Russia - the country of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky - and Iâ€™m quite sure that watching Antonioni is good and fun for Russians, because I and we really understand his point of view. so I don't understand his lower rating on IMDb. I am sure that, speaking from Russia and our people, we like Antonioni because of his romantic soul and positive sense of the surrounding reality.
