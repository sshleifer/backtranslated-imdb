A very delightful part of the film that should have been more widely spread. Ian McShane right at home is playing a soul-loving DJ who gets canned food because he doesn’t “agree to the program,” and intends to let the world know what they are missing. The cast is also great, and the music is the “soul” of the film. I just want the film to be released so that I can get a copy of this for my movie library.
