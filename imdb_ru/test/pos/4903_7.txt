Although it is a “women's story,” I found it still quite interesting. This is unusual because in the film three real sisters play sisters! I mean Priscilla, Rosemary and Lola Lane. <br /> <br /> Why did critics like this film because of the presence of the bad rebel guy John Garfield. In their perverted, liberal-dominant minds, American characters are disgusting, but people with a bad attitude toward life, such as Garfield, who have been played here, are people with whom they can identify themselves. Despite this, this film still has a good feeling of goodness, and that is why I liked it. Some of the characters may have done stupid things, but they have good hearts. Whose heart was more here than Enns (Priscilla Lane)? I agree with the critic IMDb user comments, which says that this is Priscilla’s movie, just like Garfield’s favorite (not me) movie. <br /> <br /> With a director like Michael Curtis, the film turned out better than anyone else. Curtiz made sure that no scene, soapy or otherwise, lasted too long. <br /> <br /> In addition to Sisters Lane and Garfield, we have Claude Raines (who adds much-needed humor to the story), Jeffrey Lynn (girls ’main love interest), Gail Page, Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, and May Robson. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this film was a hit, because there were several side effects from it, neither of them approach this in content and box office success.
