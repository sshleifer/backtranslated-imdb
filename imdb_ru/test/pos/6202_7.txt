I liked this show, but I felt that it was all undermined by the recording / mixing of the sound. <br /> <br /> For some reason, they had to use a lot of what is called ADR, where the actors replace the original sound of the location by re-recording it in the sound booth. <br /> <br /> The reasons for this are usually related to location problems or the fact that someone messed up somewhere in the sound production chain. . <br /> <br /> It wouldn't be so bad if the ADR were done well, but sometimes it just distracted. The problem is not only in ADR - the sound mix just does not match the quality of performance and pictures. <br /> <br /> I would be interested to know what went wrong.
