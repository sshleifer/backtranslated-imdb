This story, shot during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, anticipates a good book or film about the Cold War, as the multinational group of foreigners are trying to take Jason Robards from Hungary to Austria. However, three things complement the story, making this film extremely good. <br /> <br /> First, the actors use the actual languages ​​of their roles. Russian soldiers speak only Russian; Hungarians only Hungarians; Germans are only Germans, except that they tell a story to a minimum degree. Since Debra Kerr is English, she speaks only English, and, of course, Yul Brynner and several other significant people in this story also speak English with a strong accent. As a result, the empathy of viewers to travelers becomes paramount. The viewer shares all the confusion and hesitancy of participating in illegal border crossing, when he / she cannot understand any of the languages ​​spoken around him. The audience causes very strong feelings, and, despite the intensive use of foreign languages, viewers never have trouble watching the movie. No subtitles needed. <br /> <br /> Second. I was in Hungary in 1995, and I tell you, this film is entitled to it. From gypsy music that suppresses supper, to underground caves in buildings where most of the action takes place, to village scenes, realism is incredible. If I did not eat in the very restaurant in the movie, I ate twice. I thought I was really walking down the main street in this village. (Actually, the film was shot in Austria). <br /> <br /> Thirdly and most importantly, this film reunites Debero Kerr and Yul Brynner (after “The King and Me”), and the magnetism between them as the story progresses is nothing but Oscar. Of course, Yul has already received an Oscar for participating in this relationship, so Akadamia is not going to give him another one, but this is the quality of the film. Do not miss it.
