This show is great. "Haruhai Suzumiya" is not only a very well-written anime show, but also reflects such things as philosophy, science fiction and a small religion. In some moments it is fun, and in others it is “cute” (due to the lack of a better term). In fact, this may be due to my lack of experience in Japanese anime shows, but this is one of the best genres I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I basically have to give credit to the writers. I have not seen such a brilliant realm of imagination in a television show since the days of the original Star Trek. I hope that the authors will continue to add strange new characters and will give more information about the already great characters that have been added. <br /> <br /> 9/10
