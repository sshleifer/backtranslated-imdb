I have not seen such a funny show on a fox for a long time, and it was worth the wait. The kids in the series have something I can relate to in each episode, and even my dad will sit down and watch it. This show is not for all ages, which does not dull the children. It still stands, but the next level. What everyone says is what everyone says and actions that everyone does. This suggests that we all think, but in a rather rounded form of presentation. The first time I saw the show, I could not believe that it was on a fox and that he was allowed to remain on the air after several episodes, from choosing Hilary's boyfriend to choosing Kenny's boyfriend, it's worth it.
