I do not understand this movie is clearly an average rating!? <br /> <br /> I really liked it, I didn’t even sleep until the early morning hours to finish watching it late at night. <br /> <br /> here are three great characters, great characters. Danny DeVito played the gem, a real feat, considering that he also led. His ridiculous, at times ridiculous character was brilliantly written and was completely unrealistic in a completely believable way. There are such people, Owen was just on the line, not crossing it. <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal’s comic style and sense of time were EXCELLENT for his role. His disappointment / comedy was interesting and exciting, and more than that ... you could understand his feelings. To really feel as if you know that the character is difficult to achieve from the point of view of the writers, to find a suitable actor is in itself an art, and both of them have been achieved here three times. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, who else could play mom? No one can play this role so well. There is a style, unlike any other, something that you like to watch, I expected it to appear on the screen ... and not because everything else was bad, oh no, but because mom's character was , again, so on the line, without crossing it, so that it was beautiful to look. <br /> <br /> And what else? Happy completion of new friendships, no one was hurt, and everyone got what they wanted in life ... WITHOUT a large piece of cheese, tied at the end. <br /> <br /> Brilliant script, brilliant idea, perfect cast, Great film.
