Honore de Balzac’s truly bizarre short history, on which it was loosely based, receives an alarming, albeit strikingly taken, interpretation here as a kind of flourishing of love-prohibition during the period between man and animal in the early nineteenth century. Subtle and very blond English actor Ben Daniels plays the role of a young soldier during the Napoleonic wars, who is lost, accompanying the exiled (?) French artist through the turbulent, dangerous landscapes of the Gobi Desert. Passing literally in a circle, both men stop trying to reach civilization again, so everyone decides (contrary to common sense) to go his own way, promising that both will return to the same place when and if the water source is actually found. This, of course, is how Daniels’s character encounters a creature (a wild and untamed female leopard) and ultimately forms an seemingly inextricable link, or rather love, with it, which simultaneously saves his life and almost destroys him by the end. the movie. Exquisite cinematography, a minimalist dialogue, a somewhat crazy story, which probably hints at possible bestiality in about three scenes - this is what ultimately makes professional critics consider the film to be pretentious and too long trash. Although this film is not for every taste, I find it a subtle, although clearly shifted from the center, mixture of fantasies with a surrealistic and luxurious atmosphere, which is emphasized by the fact that more than half of the actor-filmmaker Ben Daniels is forced to oppose the wild animal four leopards were used, not just one), which, based on simple common sense and a little knowledge of the theater, suggests that it was an intolerable and very difficult job that he managed to brilliantly cope with if you ask me! In general, I think that "Passion in the Desert" takes some time to warm up, but if you are a patient person who is willing to spend some time with him, he will indeed cast a uniquely original spell on you, no matter what; and unlike most platonic stories about the relationship between humans and animals, a talking pig, monkey or shaggy dog ​​is not required to maintain interest.
