Good, but not very good movie "The Great Dictator" - the first radio of Chaplin. This is a good effort, and sometimes a wonderful satire on Hitler, but unfortunately, the moments of Chaplin’s brilliance offered here are undermined by the tendency to use too much unnecessary dialogue. Yes, Chaplin, the silent master of the screen, simply uses too many words in this film, and his tendency to write long speeches and extraneous passages of dialogue will be transferred to his other films, such as (better) “Limelight”. Nevertheless, Chaplin was extremely bold even in the making of this film, and his performance in two roles is certainly remembered. Paulette Goddard does not have such brilliance as in Modern Times (her offscreen romance with Chaplin was cold at the time), but she is always worth seeing, and Jack Okey almost steals the show as a rival dictator Chaplin Hinkel’s famous creation.
