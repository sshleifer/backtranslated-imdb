I am surprised that this, well above the average 80s comedy, ranks only 5.2 of all IMDB voters. Dan Ackroyd makes his usual satirical twist as a crook who takes the perfect opportunity to steal a contract from his prison doctor. He retreats to California to begin his work, giving advice on a radio show, pretending to be the disgraceful Dr. Lawrence Baird. The only person who knows that he is an imposter is a drunken priest (Walter Mattau) who comes to pamper himself with the new found wealth of Aroyd who accused him. Charles Grodin also serves as a good support. For my genre, I think this film deserves the same credibility as Ferris Bueller or Trading Places. 7.5 / 10
