I recently saw Episodes 1-4, and now I can't wait for 5 and 6 to be available! (I heard that they will appear soon.) It seems that the Commander's Journal is destined to become a cult hit among the university crowd and all the rest who have a taste for an unusual comedy. Obviously, the budget was small, but caution when developing the script is quite obvious. In fact, the simplicity of the show allowed me to evaluate the composition and acting skills more. Bowlesby is a master of repression ... I just wanted to remember all the best of them for later use on unsuspecting colleagues! Let's put it this way: if you don’t like the commander’s log, I personally will take care of your underpants getting extra starch!
