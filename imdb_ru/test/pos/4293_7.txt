Another popular display of British paintings in the Colville Theater of the Century. A well-designed, solid drama with a constantly evolving storyline and ongoing “twists and turns in the story” ... when lies lie! Master class in acting of impeccable cast, well-organized for the first time by director Julian Fellows. Outstanding performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson, but good turns by all stakeholders, including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. This film has been absorbed by our audience, including several shock incidents that really make you jump. A good tight production in just 80 minutes, probably done with a very limited budget, but a success that Fellowes should see again on the big screen. Some of the film’s advertising seemed to suggest that it was set in the 1950s (according to Nigel Balchin’s novel), but obviously it’s not. Recommended view.
