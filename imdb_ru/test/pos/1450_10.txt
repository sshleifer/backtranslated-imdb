I am fifteen years old, and I saw thirty-three Sinatra films (not counting television shows and documentaries), and I was not impressed by only two of them. “Until the clouds pass” and “Miracle of the Bells”, nevertheless, they are not considered, considering that he sings the magnificent “old man river” first of all, and in the second he is not half bad - only the picture is pitiful. My favorite recordings, radio programs, TV shows and films about Sinatra change almost every day - everything gets a different shade with each viewing and sometimes it seems like the best thing he ever did, and sometimes worse until the cycle resumes, but there are a couple of things that cannot be compared. When it comes to movies, “The Man with the Golden Hand” heads this list. Anyone who knows anything about Sinatra knows that he thought it was his best ... ever performance, he was nominated for an Oscar, it was the first serious look at drug addiction, etc., etc. The jazz score is unforgettable, cute Kim Nowak, despite the ridiculous accent, Eleanor Parker is annoying and too dramatic, the turtle - like Arnold Stang entertains For the first time, but every time more and more confuses, and Darren McGavin makes surprisingly slimy drug dealer, sets are not persuasive - at first glance it seems its figurative mixed bag, dropped by the great Otto Preminger with an unusual charm. <br /> <br /> Then you come to Sinatra. Like everything else in his life - except for music - reports about his game are always divided in half. Directors like Fred Zinnemann, Frank Capra, Billy Wilder, Stanley Kramer, Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich and Otto Preminger agreed that if Sinatra worked as hard on his films as he did on singing, he would be one of the greatest actors in the world - if not the biggest. Humphrey Bogart even said: “This guy has the most natural acting talent I've ever seen.” Not bad for a man who never took acting lessons in his life, at the same time created a discography that would make him “the greatest singer of the 20th century,” and did almost all of his scenes at once. <br /> <br /> Other reviews and biographies are in direct contradiction to all of this, sniffing haughtily, how lousy the actor was this Mr. Sinatra, and how many “bad” films he made. This question will never be answered for universal satisfaction, because contradiction was one of the main virtues of Sinatra, and both arguments, in a sense, played into his hands. In any case, at this time in this role, Sinatra is gorgeous. In the late fifties, the columnist said: "Sinatra may not be the greatest actor in the world, but there is nothing more exciting to watch." No matter what Sinatra does in the film, it's hard to look away from him. This, of course, is the “charisma” that I have seen only in a few other people — Orson Welles, Richard Burton, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift — perhaps James Cagney. He has no real definition, and it is often difficult to understand whether you really enjoy the show or just fascinate, but it is this demonstrated quality that is what the film does. Sinatra is directly exciting, real, intense - transcending decades and thousands of pop stars of paper dolls with something called quality. Anyway, this is a show for one person with several character actors hanging around in the background. He covers every emotion with remarkable subtlety, from sweet, lonely tenderness with Kim Novak to the terrifying shock of Frank Sinatra, Whimpering and screaming in the agony of "cold turkey." Sinatra was right - this is his best performance. No questions. <br /> <br /> I was eight years old when Frank Sinatra died. I haven't been around for all the years of Bobby-Soxer and Anchors Aweigh, Mr. Ava Gardner and From Here To Eternity, lamppost albums and fans of swingers, Kennedy, Vegas, melody. Basie, Mia and Reagan, concerts from Madison Square Garden to South Africa, from the White House to the Sands. I can't say that I like Sinatra because I heard it on “Paramount” or because I hear “September of my years” autobiographically - the usual excuses. And my excuse? When I was eleven years old, I watched the movie "In the City" ...
