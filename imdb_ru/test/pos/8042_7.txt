This is definitely a quality film with a stylish cast. As for the films about Carlos the Jackal, this film transcends Bruce Willis's weak efforts in The Jackal to bloody pulp, and then spits on them. I'm a little surprised that this film did not get more votes, something like “sleeping”, obviously. Too bad because this movie is definitely worth seeing. It is smart and never boring. Look, 7/10
