I heard about this series in 2001, which my friend recorded on television every week. I never bothered to look, although I became acquainted with the show through a magazine that I occasionally looked through in bookstores. I recently purchased TV series 1 on DVD and was fascinated by this fascinating and original series. At first, the characters seem incredible, but it's amazing how quickly they grow and develop into a single force. When they start to care about each other, it becomes easy to care about what happens to them (considering that these are just TV shows, and they are fictional). <br /> <br /> However, this is not the world of PC. from Star Trek and so, although each character shows a good trait, each of them has its flaws and demons that they have to deal with. Individual storylines, mixed with a common multiple storyline, make this one of the most complex and rewarding television events I've ever had the pleasure of watching. I really enjoy watching all the characters interact with each other. <br /> <br /> This strange new world we are familiar with is brilliantly depicted by the eyes of astronaut John Crichton when he learns and adapts to being on the other side of the galaxy, strange alien creatures, different cultures that are hunted a character who wants him dead and his companions are treated as inferior, we can easily relate what he needs to feel. As he gets used to his surroundings, the audience and his compassionate, strong-willed and courageous character are very pleased to watch. <br /> <br /> I watched only seven episodes of the first season of Farscape and look forward to continuing. through the seasons two to four and mini-series. Perhaps one day we can enjoy the fifth season. Viewing is highly recommended and it is worthwhile to set aside time for viewing. Buy and enjoy! 10/10
