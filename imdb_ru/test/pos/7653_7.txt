I ended up like this movie, but it was not easy to handle. What makes a movie great is the music and the scenery. The songs are beautiful, and the musicians are talented. Much work has been done to show the different settings for people from Rome. <br /> <br /> However, the viewer was not focused enough. A deeper history of Roma people would be good. Only a small part of the spoken words was supplied with English subtitles. In addition, more explanations about the settings and who and some of their problems would be appreciated. It would help if the narrator also explained about customs, clothing, and music.
