Another one in the long lineup of movies "Not" in the late 70s and early 80s, but this one is much longer. This film is a very underrated low-cost schloker with a twist. It has a grainy quality and a quirky soundtrack, typical of the horror films of the time, but the extremely undervalued performances of amazingly talented actors / actresses make this film good. A young nurse arrives at Dr. Stevens' progressive psychiatric hospital immediately after he was killed by one of his patients, and things are not as it seems. It seems that Dr. Masters, a rather ambitious woman doctor, assumed her responsibilities and began to implement her own ideas. Each patient acquires his own unique features and has his own individual features and shortcomings, which make him very interesting. There is a nymphomaniac, a crazy old crown, a woman with an unhealthy obsession for babies, and a man who returned to his childhood among others. There is also a strange little twist on this strange story, which later discovers that the young nurse was trapped in a shelter when patients were running freely and their bodies were accumulating. If you are a fan of cheap 70s meanness, then this film is for you!
