I remember watching this movie as a child in the 60s. It took my breath back then at a young age. I was glued to my seat in front of a black and white TV. The cast was one of the best I've ever seen in my life. The musical was one of the greatest ever written. Please, the families of Gershwin and Goldwyn, please publish it on video or DVD, so that generations now and in the future can experience what I am sure many of us did when they saw this great work of art. not the work of this great man has gone unnoticed for many years. I pray and hope that the hearts of these families will be softened and allow the world to see this great film again.
