“Saturday Noon” is one of the most famous short plots of Harry Langdon, and for good reason. This is one of his funniest and best movies. The plot - the way it is - is an old product: a husband with a beak of a chicken sneaks up for the night with a friend and a couple of other girls. This is a solid and well-used comedy story, but the difference here is in Harry Langdon himself. His slow, ineffective, baffled, innocent character somehow came across a marriage with a woman who feels that he of all people should be ruled by an iron fist, and he is only inclined to deceive her because he cannot say no to the calls of the friendly Vernon Dent and the sweet fluttering of the girl's eyelashes. <br /> <br /> This is a very adult problem - to be imposed on such a helpless child character. Harry doesn't want to cheat, but he can't do anything about it. In an amazing comic business, he cannot bring himself to raise a goodbye kiss from a new girlfriend: he slyly pushes a kiss to her jag and wipes his hand bashfully, as if punishing her. The film is a three-part comedy that is ten minutes longer than those of Harry Langdon dvuskatchikov, previously starred in the role of Mac Sennett, without a plot. Perhaps it was even designed to be twin-engine. It works great, as it gives him as much time as he needs to bring in slow reactions and bewildered glimpses and half-actions where so much of his comedy lives. <br /> <br /> He’s at his best here, and the show is really the curious magic of Harry Langdon and the ability to unleash a comedy from almost nothing. His small half-smiles, his gaze on handling the money he hid under the carpet, the children's attempts to engage in battle at the end. I think that his comedy makes us recognize something fundamentally innocent and confusing in ourselves, which makes us feel that the whole world is too much for us, but at the same time allowing us to understand what Harry does not know (for example, that women whom he honestly brings to his friend, to cheer him up after he thinks that a date has been set, are actually whores) he makes him with a little sadness understand that we are not so innocent. His comedy is also capable of making us hear the words “Awww,” as it makes us laugh, often immediately. <br /> <br /> Here, Harry wants to give up cheating on his wife, he wants to tell his wife whose boss and regain power in his relationship, he wants to fight back the two cruel men at the end of the film, but he just can't strongly affect their surroundings, and sometimes we all feel that way. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully shot by frequent director Langdon Harry Edwards; he moves at a fast pace and never stops, at the same time finding time and presenting the best effect still, of Harry Langdon's reactive comedy. Vernon Dent, a frequent opponent of Langdon, plays one of the roles here, where he becomes an almost comedic partner in his very effective connection with Harry. The gags are spaced in such a way that they also give the maximum effect, and in the end Harry gets his own version of a trick in the style of Lloyd or Keaton. Here, comedy is not because of Harry’s great reaction to the danger of sitting between two moving cars, but because of his slowness. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie and a great example of comedy. one of the most unique and talented comedians I've ever known.
