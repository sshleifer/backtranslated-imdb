This film aims to do something special, but also not to do certain things. In short, he has a certain deliberate trajectory - to deal with the idea of ​​looking at death (with very little choice and all of them are bad) as serious and real, and not random or funny. In search of this realism, he avoided certain conventions, such as obvious symbolic arcs and hooks. It is not so much about the characters, but about the state of a person. Never mind what the actors would do ... what would you do in their situation? <br /> <br /> Open Water may have been the starting point for this film, but it goes much further. In contrast to this film, after all, it does not deceive the public when you find that sharks have nothing to talk about. In this there is a real monster, not only the idea of ​​a monster and not just an animated stand. He also has good production performance, considering what these very inventive directors had to work with. And again, unlike this other film, there is some exciting and brilliant action in its climax. And let's not forget, let's say, “dazzling”, the presence of the youngest star on the screen. It can be a real discovery.
