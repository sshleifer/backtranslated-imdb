One of the advantages of my work is that when things are going slowly, I can watch a movie in our theater downstairs (I work in a small cinema with two screens) in the screaming room and still watch the concession stand. I have seen an Italian job, probably 20 times, and I'm still not tired of it. The atmosphere reminds me of "Ocean-eleven", although the acting is not so good. Mark Wahlberg is fine, Charlize Theron speaks to the guys, but Seth Green is AMAZING in this film. I thought Edward Norton played the dirty bag perfectly, although many disagree. I also liked Mos Def as an explosives expert who is afraid of dogs. I highly recommend this film and will watch it whenever I can!
