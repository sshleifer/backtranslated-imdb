Milo is an underrated and underestimated horror film of the late 90s, but the atmosphere and atmosphere are more like 80s horror films. It seems that a bunch of little girls are taken to “see things” in Milo’s father’s office, a gynecologist, and as a reward for seeing what’s in the banks (yes, a gynecologist plus something else ...), one girl plays "doctor" with Milo. Hmm, his first patient, and he lost her. Now Milo is a creepy little kid who always wears a yellow rain jacket, rain or shine, and he says funny ... but that's not all that is strange about him. Fast forward now when these girls are adults, and for one of them a wedding is planned, but tragedy happens, and one girl who came from another city chooses whether to replace her friend as a school teacher, what she does. And then strange things start happening again. Which, of course, involves this young child in a raincoat. This is not too cruel and not a graphic image, but a distinct eeriness that you will not find in many modern horror films, and it is worth seeing. Someone wonders why it is so difficult to find good horror films in this day and age, but here’s one that is criminally overlooked and certainly worth your time if you check it out. 8 out of 10.
