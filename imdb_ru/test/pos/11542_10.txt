This documentary about the life and comedy of Bill Hicks contains excerpts from Hicks's Revelations and other performances. It also presents interviews with other comedians and people from the industry who knew him, as well as with journalists and journalists who talk about how his political commentary was rude and rude. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. I have already seen Revelations, but comedy clips are still refreshing. This is a good balance of comedy and documentary, which will explain the popularity of Hicks to non-fans and will appeal to those who already know him. <br /> <br /> I rated it at ten.
