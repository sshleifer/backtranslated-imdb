This film shook me. It was so realistic, and the story was incredibly touching. They speak German and Russian, which makes it more believable and real. This is a must see movie. The actors are great too. Really good job. The plot takes place as part of the German squad in World War II. They must go to Stalingrad, the Soviet, to fight against the Soviet armies. You become more connected with every soldier in this group and watch them through all the dangers when they are captured in Stalingrad. They meet face to face with the death, blood, grief and cold of Russia. This is a film that you definitely need to watch, and you cannot afford not to see it.
