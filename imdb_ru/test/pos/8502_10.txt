Do not forget the lover on the side !! She is a beauty, Karen Parsons is adorable, she is beautiful in acting, beauty and style. It's just his job! CW, well, here's a show that says you hit a gut, and while you bend it kicks you in the ass! Quoting Peter's wife (partner / writer / producer), she said that when they watched the “previews” for the upcoming “new” shows at the ABC network party, she looked at her husband after the “Jobs” preview played. and said, “It’s not like anything else on this network. You guys are in trouble. ” That is, it looks very good! But this is not like the usual fare "brilliant happy people" or drama in the style of "hairstyle" that they (ABC) regularly feel comfortable playing on the air. From the moment I saw it, after the end of the first episode, I made sure that I did not miss this period of time next week, I immediately became addicted to “Work.” Madness and cynicism, outrageous situations and ridiculous writers make this series a hit! <br /> <br /> Then I felt angry and frustrated that the show had just left the air. I was wondering what kind of manager made this decision to tear down the main comedic stone for their network? <br /> <br /> I told someone about this someone knows, someone does not, but I know that a stupid network has not advanced it is difficult enough, or I should say quite clearly. If they had this, he would have worked for at least 3-5 seasons, maybe even six. I just believe that knowing that the net comes in and overly subscribes to this or that "formula", they missed the boat. th this There was so much room for expansion, it just started. The situations were ridiculous and serious, fast and sometimes slow, although not very good. a few years later I finally found it on a new dvd for $ 50. For me it will cost $ 1000 in my entertainment library. I watched in amazement as I went through both seasons for the third time on DVD and the final episode of “Betrayal”, went into a serious dramatic episode with the disclosure of the murder victim, it was better than most drama victims. Unit 'and' policeman 'are now shown on the air !!! They went on stage, as serious as a heart attack, and so believable that they did it, as if without even missing a beat. Just as it should have been serious, I was so impressed by the “universal ways” that Tolan and Leary shared in storylines and scenarios. <br /> <br /> In another perturbation of the “week of entertainment,” I learned that a beautiful wardrobe, silk ties and expensive suits with pressed shirts and ultra stylish shoes ... it was all sold for the film, filmed on cable “In the cut "(2003), for only four hundred dollars, that's all !!! ! I am sick. Have you seen what they all wear for every show? One good top coat can run so much. <br /> <br /> It was Denis Leary, one of the best. I recommend this great policeman "dramedi" for oriental coasters or wherever you are in this country. I even heard that people from Ireland joked with Leary in the episode "Bathroom", repeating to him the lines from this episode, because they saw him there.
