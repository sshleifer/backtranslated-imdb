This is as good as it turns out. <br /> <br /> These are six episodes in which it can be traced (briefly) what life could look like when dinosaurs ruled the earth. Made in the style of a documentary about nature, this series eliminates talking heads; instead, it only gives us what dinosaurs are trying to survive. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not a real documentary, since we canâ€™t see it on the screen with any certainty, but this is the best assumption, and an interesting one. Here is a show that realistically embodies dinosaurs without involving them in human food. This is a show that should be shown to any child who loves dinosaurs, as he imparted the OH WOW factor to them to learn more. It will also entertain them, and you. <br /> <br /> Look at this. If you like animal shows, nature or science or the adventures of Disney True Life (except that no one really died), or just a really good trip to another place, run out and get yourself a copy. Your brain will thank you.
