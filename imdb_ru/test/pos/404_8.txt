I saw it on TCM recently, and through IMDb I discovered that there were seven “Crime Doctor” films with Warner Baxter in the role of a psychiatrist-detective. Baxter is slightly longer than his uncompromising performance on 42nd Street ten years ago. Not a noir, and a bit picky today, the film also has a touch of the possible supernatural. The plot, black-and-white cinematography and characters are much more complex than in the Moto and Charlie Chan series. There are several plots, unexpected turns and appearances of a number of films “B”, which we all have to recognize immediately (no one has ever achieved status “A”). This is a surprisingly unpredictable 70 minutes. <br /> <br /> I would like to watch a series of DVDs in boxes of these films.
