It was a fun movie. Just seeing the Evil Dead trilogy not a week ago (and leaving much to be desired), I got as many Bruce Campbell movies as possible, including the really bad ones. This funny, but not exceptional, but, as hell, original. <br /> <br /> I mean that you have crazy scientists, superhuman cyborgs, half-robes, gypsies, former KGB taxi drivers, jealousy, murders of passion, love, romance, sex, action and much more, all with the same six actors :) <br /> <br /> You really have to see it and enjoy it, I can't explain it in the text field, I guess this is not such a cult film as “Evil Dead”, but it has that feature of Bruce Campbell that I love. Ted Raimi extends her hand, Tamara Gorsky looks both beautiful and interesting (she has come a long way from a prostitute on Friday the 13th), and Vladimir Kolev also shows promising as an actor, although he will probably play a minor character in Hollywood films her entire career . <br /> <br /> Outcome: funny movie. If you like Evil Dead, you will also like it.
