It was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid. It had everything - music, stories, talking squirrel and funny daisies. I wanted to be one of those hippie chicks who sing and swing on a swing. I am 35 years old and I grew up in South Jersey, but we have three New York channels with our cable connection, and I think it was on channel 11. They just don’t make such shows anymore (I know it makes me sound very old), and I’m just amazed that I have only 9 channels on our TV, but I could always find something cool to watch. I talked with only one person who actually heard and watched this show. She is three years younger than me and grew up in the north of Jersey. I would really like to see this show on DVD so that I can show it to my 5-year-old daughter, and she could see what stupid (but wonderful) things she was looking at on her mom! I just found a VHS tape with a few episodes and a music CD from the show on Ebay, and I bought them right now, although they were a little expensive. I can't wait to make them relive wonderful memories!
