I actually learned about Favela Rising through the IMDb website. I am especially interested in Afro-Brazilian culture and films. Favela Rising is one of those gems that gives new meaning to human transformation. Well documented and filmed by Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochari, this is the story of Anderson Sa, a former drug dealer in Rio de Janeiro, who after the death of family members and friends becomes like Christ, Malcolm X and Gandhi are all in one. Sa created AfroReggae, a massive cultural movement that uses Afro-Brazilian hip-hop, capoeira drummer (Afro-Brazilian martial arts) and other forms of art to turn hopeless and in most cases evil young into bright, viable, caring people who love community. > <br /> A few years ago I remember going to the Cidade De Deus show and completely numb I left the theater. The images were dark but stunning, and you couldn't take your eyes off the screen. I remember how hopeless some situations were at favelas and how decadent the society was because of the neglect of governments. How the drug trade was a way of life, how indifferent slum dwellers are, because death was a daily reality. Like The City of God, Anderson Sa talks about how people from the favels were also desensitized. He talks about police corruption and how communities were so immobilized by drugs and gangs that you could not visit family members in other favels that you had to meet in a neutral place. Unlike the mass movement of the city of God Anderson Sa, AfroReggae offers solutions for anger, hopelessness. <br /> <br /> In the documentary there was one part where Anderson, in the spirit of a preacher, approached some young people and asked them to join AfroReggae. These exhausted young people were so traumatized by daily survival and violence. Their role models were drug dealers, and this is what they wanted. Anderson said then that drug dealers did not live very long. Of course, there was reluctance, but after five months he was able to get some young people to join AfroReggae. <br /> <br /> The visual effects in Favela Rising are incredible. It is clear to me that Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochari are not only great storytellers, but also visual artists. This is a must see documentary! There are truly magical and transforming moments in this documentary. I do not want to spoil them for you. I want you to see it for yourself. Please tell about this wonderful film to your friends, scholars, youth consultants, family members. It will make you take care of the world and our children. <br /> <br /> I would give him eleven stars!
