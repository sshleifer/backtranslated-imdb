This is the case when the script plays with the audience in a way that only serves to extend this story to 90 minutes. The story begins in 1969, when a young girl named Faith (Cameron Diaz) goes to Europe with her boyfriend Wolf (Christopher Eccleston), but she dies under mysterious circumstances. Then in 1976, sister Faith Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) also decides to go to Europe and try to find out what happened to her sister. In France, she looks at Wolf, who has stayed there, and wants him to help her repeat the steps taken by her sister and answer some questions. He is reluctant, but decides to go with her. Along the way, he fills in the gaps in the events and tells Phoebe that Faith joined the Red Army, which is an extremist group that is involved in terrorism. Phoebe and Wolf enter into a novel, and this complicates the trip to Portugal, where Vera died. These are a few things wrong with this movie, and all this is related to the script. First, the romance between Wolf and Phoebe is wrong and does nothing for history. It sounds completely false and seems compelled. It seems strange that Wolf enter into an affair with his dead girlfriend sister. Secondly, Wolf fully knows what happened to Faith, but only distributes small pieces of information every 15 minutes or so. Wolf every 15 minutes will look at Phoebe and say: "I did not say something to you"! Gee, thank you very much wolf! If Wolf had arrived for the first time when he spoke to Phoebe, the film would have been finished in 30 minutes. Another thing that bothered me was that I did not think that this film recreated the 1960s in general. Diaz wears hippie clothes, but time just doesn't ring true. I liked some things, such as the authentic places where the movie was shot. This is a very beautiful film and a beautiful landscape. All performances are good, especially Brewster and Diaz. Besides the Fast and the Furious, I have never seen Brewster in anything. But after watching her performance in this film, I left very impressed. She is very good here, and I hope that the best roles will come to her aid. The script is written in a very contrived way, and the film never seems believable.
