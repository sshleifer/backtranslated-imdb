This film has an outstanding acting game by Marilia Pera and a terrific Argentine speaker Hector Babenko. This is, in my opinion, the best Brazilian film ever made. The film was shot with a child from the Brazilian ghetto 'favelas'. The children were not actors and were abandoned by Babenko in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The story of criminal children arrested in a correctional prison, which looks much worse than Alcatraz. Children are constantly raped and beaten by a policeman. Unfortunately, this is not just an invention, in Brazil it is still happening today. Be sure to look for those who love violent movies. But get your mom out of the room because it's a heavy movie.
