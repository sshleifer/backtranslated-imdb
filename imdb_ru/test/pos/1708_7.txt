As for the talk show, Larry King is good live, and since he sometimes gets good guests, this show should be turned on once in a while, but not intrusive. When Bill Maher, Karl Bernstein, the former president or other informative guests sit in front of him, it's not so bad. In other cases, he usually receives guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal, which gives absolutely no intellectual information to the country and serves mostly uneducated audiences who want to hear the latest gossip about film and television stars. During the trial of O.J. Simpson, it seemed that all the other guests in his show were connected with this case. But is this journalism really? Or National Enquirer on the tube? Sometimes it sounds a bit like garbage TV - Jerry Springer during an interview with phone calls instead of a live audience. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, King’s show is definitely much better than Bill O'Reilly, whose show is nothing but the righteous political platform of the Rush Limbaugh variety. Nevertheless, Larry King is not a bad interviewer, but, alas, he is not great. King does not always come off, as he fully understands when intellectual material is presented, especially if it is a scientist or a historian with a new book on subtle aspects of politics. It always seems that at the moment when King cannot fully deal with the problem in question, that’s when he turns to phone calls, perhaps hoping that someone in the country will have a better question than he does. He could have interviewed someone like David Gergen, but could not have read any of his books. Kind of like a film producer who never bothers to read a script. <br /> <br /> When it's a celebrity for fun, no problem. He may come off as if he is knowledgeable, since the material is not so significant. Talking to Elizabeth Taylor about her relationship with Richard Burton is not exactly rocket science. And I notice that he usually saw the last movie of a star. Watching a movie takes much less time and thought than reading a book. However, if it looks like John Dean or Bob Woodward, King comes off, as if he hadn't completely finished his homework. So let's talk about phones. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a true in-depth interview, Terry Gross of NPR is probably the best interviewer in the United States. She reads and / or examines everything that is written or about her guests in advance and has practical knowledge in these areas. I don't see King doing that. Of course, he probably has an audience 1000 times larger than Terry Gross, which can say more about the American audience than about King. In short, Larry is better than Bill, but not as good as Terry.
