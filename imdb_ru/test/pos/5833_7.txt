Hi. To read the whole plot around "OZ", just look at the IMDb here to find it. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING SPOILERS INSIDE THIS REVIEW! ** Oz is a series that not only touched me, but also shows a little. From the American penitentiary system, but I have to say (judging by the program of discovery channels over the prison), this is not entirely realistic. <br /> <br /> Although I have to say that they are not shy, they are raped, they shy away (they prick) a lot happens. Nevertheless, this is television, so you, pfl, think this is really wrong. <br /> <br /> There is a greater degree of violence in this, and some have overdone here and there (plot by plot for plot) this can be quite boring. But remember that the series is almost ancient. So times also change, and I believe that I must judge this by timing, as it appeared. <br /> <br /> Since the season lasted until the fifth season, it was pretty good! Until one of the drawbacks won a $ 2 million lottery ticket, because he spoke to God, it seemed to me that "well, it comes to that moment, I donâ€™t want to see this show anymore." However, I continued! And now I just saw episode 3 of season 6. This is where the flakes get a blow to his brain, and then his "mom" keeps him after while he is drooling. Then you see O'Reilly crying too, seeing her brother like this (RL BROTHERS). This is the best scene from the whole series "OZ", which was real for me! Until now, do not read it wrong, that I am trying to break and burn it. This is a really good series! And even now, 2010 is worth seeing! I give him 7 because of the storyline, which weakens with the season. But still a golden glove.
