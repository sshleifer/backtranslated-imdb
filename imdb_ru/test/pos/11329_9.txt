For those who like their films full of exploding planets and extreme violence, this is definitely not the one to see. In fact, the plot is very small (or, at least, very little that cannot be summed up in a few seconds: A meets with B. Mr. A falls in love with Mrs. B and has an affair with her. In love and surprise (very long) whether to deal independently). <br /> <br /> This is the Cantonese Visconti. There is no history, but what you DO is a series of wonderful images and piercingly trivial music that convey the slow passing of emotions of the central characters. There is also the opportunity to see one of the most beautiful women in the world in a series of stunningly elegant dresses. For my money, it's worth looking at it alone. How could this woman be the heroine of the militants? It looks like it came straight out of the pages of Vogue.
