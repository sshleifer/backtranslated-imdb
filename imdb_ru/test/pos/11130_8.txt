Secondary school. After years and decades, some look at it with love, others are embarrassed. But few are easily forgotten. This is one of the most important stages of our life, when changes occur quickly and violently, whether we are ready or not. No longer children, not adults, irresistible forces envelop us, pushing and pulling us in all directions. <br /> <br /> “Glory” has done everything possible to capture this turbulent, chaotic period for her young characters. For the most part it succeeded. She wandered, but she felt like a piece of life. This film holds a special place in the hearts of the 80s class. We have just said goodbye to the decade, and soon to the end of three or four challenging and sometimes difficult school years. We headed into a cold, cruel world, leaving home for college, and then unknown parts. As we approached our watershed event, this newly released film was like a two-hour annual for us. We could not avoid the title song on the radio. It was us there on the screen. These were our friends, rivals, and classmates, since we faced our own dreams, disappointments, successes and failures. <br /> <br /> This is especially true for those who have attended any of the other elite, high schools of New York. especially Stuyvesant, Bronx HS of Science or Brooklyn Tech. Like the children here, we were considered the best of the best. We did not have any auditions, but there were strict entrance exams. Perhaps even more than the children of the performing arts, we had to change the world, although not necessarily becoming famous. Like them, not all of us have done it. But the pressure cooker setting contributed to the extraordinary camaraderie and corporate spirit, which is not much different from the “hot lunch jam” in the cafeteria. On our own graduation day, our spirits soared almost like a jubilant crescendo in an awakening finale. At the end of the film “I Sing an Electric Body”, the film appropriately shows us the only triumphant note, indicating a dazzlingly bright, boundless future and all the promises that he kept. <br /> <br /> "Glory" could not have been set anywhere else. This story would never have worked in a small or suburban school. Los Angeles is more strongly identified with film and television, but New York is a mecca for all kinds of art. New York, where not only what was then called PA, but also the world-famous Juilliard, is a cultural center that has no analogues in any other city in the world. It is also a temporary capsule of the rest of the city at that time, showing the seed, sand and dirt that were characteristic of New York City, still struggling with a financial crisis that almost went bankrupt. But, above all, it showed vitality, as muted by the invasion of Giuliani, Disney and tourism. <br /> <br /> I wouldn’t be young again. But with Glory, at least I can remember what it was like.
