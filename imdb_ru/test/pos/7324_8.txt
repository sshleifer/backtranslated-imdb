This refers to their highest level, although there were others, such as microphones and drunken punches, which were more worthy of Oscar nominations than this one. But, to say the least, the recurring announcement of Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard, followed by Curly's “Woo woo woo woo”, makes it a classic on two levels. First, it symbolizes everything that the puppets are; My daughter loves repeating the announcement when she does something stupid. Secondly, the absurdity of these three as doctors in the hospital; I imagine the horror that I would feel if I were a real patient in a real hospital and heard this announcement through a loudspeaker. Throughout this short speech, you hear this announcement and know that something terrible is going to happen, and the loudspeaker’s voice will stay with you for several months.
