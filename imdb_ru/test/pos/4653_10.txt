I would like the cast members and the crew to sit down and make an audio commentary on this film! All the different places they went to shoot this movie! Should provide some very good jokes! Fans of this film would like to know: <br /> <br /> What permission did they need to get to shoot in certain places? <br /> <br /> Were there any memorable episodes? <br /> <br /> Were there scenes that were deleted? <br /> <br /> What problems did the actors and the film crew face? <br /> <br /> Did any of the actors have double stuntmen? <br /> What was it like working with other cast members? <br /> <br /> Were there any scenes at large? <br /> <br /> What were the cast and crew members until now? <br /> <br /> What places are there and which are no more, or is it another business now? <br /> <br /> You can read trivia about this movie on this site and other websites. But nothing compares to getting it right from the horse's mouth! <br /> <br /> C'mon guys! Get together and make a comment! Never walk away from the test! Go for fun!
