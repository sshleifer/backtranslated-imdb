First of all, I would like to begin by saying that this is a refreshing start to see a British drama that finally looks and seems believable. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart pays tribute to the role (Ian Hood), a government adviser on science, with his persistent and unshakable views on authority and thoughts about the future of real world science and how it feels. be used or abused by others. <br /> <br /> Casting is not only carefully supported throughout the series, but also makes his characters more believable than most other British playwrights. <br /> <br /> Ashley Jensen is also great at the role of Dr. Good's appointed bodyguard (Rachel Young), she refreshes her view of unscientific, disinterested everyday views on science, and her constant struggle with Hood makes for some of them very funny and memorable moments. <br /> <br /> The way the series makes all the scientific elements more realistic, <br /> <br /> However, there are noticeable disappointments in the series: every time the Episode ends, I’m disappointed that they don’t seem to cover all aspects of the plot and sometimes leave open stories open. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this is still the first series, I hope that in the near future we will see a return to form, when these open stories can finally get an important conclusion that they rightly deserve. <br /> <br /> For those who like slower science-related storylines, this is the perfect show to watch, as it always manages to remain believable and, more importantly, important.
