Six teenagers go to an old distant abandoned school, where 27 years ago there was a terrible slaughter for a night of fun and practical jokes. Instead, the children are confronted with a brutal mad guard (excellently playing with the extremely terrible threat of the Spanish icon of horror Paul Nashi), who committed horrible murders. Director Carlos Gill tells an intriguing story at a fast pace and does a skillful job of creating an incredibly frightening and mysterious atmosphere. The witty script by Tino Blanco and Mercedes Holgueras offers a clever and inspired mix of slasher and supernatural elements that make the viewer guess until the very end. Smooth cinematography Fernando Arribas makes expert use of light and shadow. David San Jose's capricious evaluation also does his job. An attractive and attractive young cast contributes to lively and captivating performances, especially the commendable performances of Carlos Fuentes as the leader Ramon, Olivia Molina as the panic of Maria, Zoe Berriatua as the hideous prankster Jordi and Carmen Morales as the playful Sandra. Pieces of killing are as bloody and violent as they should be. A terrific blow to the unexpected dark end too. Hard and satisfying shocker.
