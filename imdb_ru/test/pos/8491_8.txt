Jamie Fox perfectly plays the role of the famous blues / soul / country singer Ray Charles. To the credit of the film, he shows both good and bad in relation to the character of Charles, and the choice he made, both personally and professionally. <br /> <br /> This is an attractive film that gives you a rich sense of the periods in which the story takes place. Not only does it look good, it sounds good. I just wish there was more music here. When it is inserted, it is incredible, but it is not enough. <br /> <br /> Assuming, at least for the sake of review, that the story was true, I was impressed and disappointed by Charles, that is, the story left some memorable impressions, as I write this 16 months after watching. Basic impressions include: <br /> <br /> GOOD - re-experiencing Ray’s tremendous talent and prudence to go out and take a musical risk, for example, to go to the “country” for a while. The man was very confident, but did not look too arrogant. Also memorable was the fact that he beat his heroin addiction - without help! This is just awesome. <br /> <br /> BAD - I also remember how easily this film hooked on Ray, and he was disappointed that he was so unfaithful to his wife. A really sad comment was that his wife was more upset because he missed the games of his little league, than because he was cheating on her, even the father of a child with a member of his singing group. <br /> <The only drawback I had with the filmmakers was the reassessment of his problems, accused of one event of early childhood, the accidental death of his brother. This tragedy was used as an excuse for all Ray’s atrocities as an adult, which is another example of a culture in which people refuse to take responsibility for their actions. <br /> <br /> Note. There is an enhanced version of the DVD, but there is a word that it is so poorly edited that you should not watch it, so stick with the “theatrical version”.
