I discovered that this film is filled with irony. But, seeing the movie, you can almost see what will happen next. Leila is a bewildered, bored home wife who is constantly looking for happiness. When she thinks she finds true happiness, she clings to him, leaving behind everything she knew. But she discovers that she almost compares the records between her former and current husband. She found out that if she only reported more about what bothered her in her previous marriage, that this could have been saved much easier than she wanted. She understands that words are nothing without action, but she finds out that too far in the second marriage and finds herself looking back and hoping for change again. The main conflict in this film is Leila against herself. You cannot have true happiness without being truly happy. I liked this film, but I would recommend this film only to women, I do not see a man who really finds pleasure in this film.
