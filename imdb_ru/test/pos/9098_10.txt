Jack Black and Kyle Gass join forces to promote their Tenacious D group in this rock classic called Tenacious D In The Pick Of Destiny. Jack Black and Kyle Gass invent their own rock opera ... it was like a rock and roll opera. Some of the most confusing events occurred in this film ... most of the legs ... the mushroom part ... and finally, when they came across the devil. A classic formed in Tenacious D ... one of the best films I've seen in a long time. The last couple of things I saw in the theater were stupid ... but this film is stunning. It really made me laugh. The fact is that Jack Black is looking for his rock partner in Los Angeles. His partner is Kyle Gass and a man who has always been bald. They work together to find this magical choice that can make the most terrible musician play very. Finally, they get to the rock and roll museum and steal a pickaxe. On the way, they meet a stranger played by Tim Robbins. They get to the club to win their prize money when the owner takes a pickaxe, and all this time he was the devil and fights D in Rock Off. DJ does not win, but the devil's horn falls, sending him back to hell. Therefore, LONG TO LIVE D !!!!!!!!!!
