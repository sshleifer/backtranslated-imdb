At a time when Hollywood thinks that it’s louder, faster and more bloody, Manna from heaven looks at it comically and touchingly at what we all thought: what would I do if a load of money fell from the sky. <Br /> <br /> It is interesting that the characters took many years to realize that money did not change their lives. They all become what they were destined to become. Unfortunately, in most cases, what they became was miserable, despite their good fortune all those years ago. <br /> <br /> While Manna suggests the familiar Hollywood storyline “Good versus evil” or, in this case, “Generosity”, “Greed” distinguishes this film from what good wins, turning evil, not crushing him. <br /> <br /> I think the big idea for this movie is that you can change the world ... even if you do it one person at a time.
