Beautiful, charming, highly versatile and talented Irene Dunn - one of the greatest 5 or 6 actresses of American cinema. At the age of 21, as in all of her films, she lights up the screen with a natural but charming presence. She is both genuine and human, and a charismatic, inspiring model. This role is a typical Irina Dunn, full of pathos and wit and little harm. I love all of her films, and this film was a fantastic discovery for me when TCM was broadcast last night. I hope they will not wait for years to show it again. <br /> <br /> In addition, Charles Coburn is one of the character’s greatest actors in all American cinema. True, he often depicts variations on the same theme, but I do not get tired of looking at his carefree assholes. Here his character is the perfect foil for Irene Dunn, and Coburn portrays him beautifully. Their conflicts in this film are fantastic. They never miss a beat. In addition, they represent the main conflict of the film and the moral conflict of her husband Irina Dunn, depicted by Alexander Knox. <br /> <br /> I'm not so familiar with Knox's work. He was recognizable, but that was all. However, in roles with Dunn and Coburn, he holds it. He demonstrates beautiful nuances. His character has noble motifs that are made available to us through the game of Knox and never hold on to us like some holy grail. He is noble but controversial and doubts his ability to successfully complete OCS. His interaction with Dunn is also always convincing. Dunn supports him without being a syrup and without becoming a martyr, and he responds in the same way. Their scenes are very well made. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is a fantastic snapshot and setting not shown in other movies. I don’t recall, as in my head, another film that depicts America, still fighting in World War II, but with an approaching end and an emphasis on the formation of the post-war world. Not an ordinary WWII film! This in itself is interesting; this is also important for the plot and movie message. Unlike other commentators, I thought the climate was okay, but not great. It was very well delivered by Knox, but it was not written as tightly as we would like it to start. I heard the best cinematic speeches on very similar topics. It served its purpose. <br /> <br /> For me, the greatest value of the film was the description of Dunn and Knox’s life, as it reflected the typical OCS experience. The sense of community among the wives living on the Palmetto Terrace seemed absolutely genuine - as did the Palmetto Terrace itself, despite the fact that it was clearly a stage set. Incredibly short meetings between wives and their OCS husbands. The rigor of candidates for OCS, the assimilation of complex and complex material that they had to study. Shabby "base building" - obviously, hastily built. Tired and worn out setting. Constant and painfully short terms - for returning to the base, for learning lessons, for catching trains for the subsequent “posts”. Tenants are constantly faced with their predecessors and successors in the base building as they move and leave. Yes, I suspect that it was a glimpse of the real experience of the Second World War - dressed in some kind of comedy, but very real in its essence. I loved it, and I recommend it very much.
