I remember how eagerly watched this show every Saturday night. This was the highlight of the week. I loved everything about it, the location, the costumes, the actors and the wonderful music of Clannad (I still have their Legends album). I liked how they solved the problem of leaving Michael Praed, creating another Robin, this time Count Huntingdon. I believe that in medieval times there were legends about several robins. Another thing that I really liked was that it was filled with young actors, I am sure that Robin and his people will be young, because people did not live so long in those days. Other Robins always look too old (Kevin Costner, with his ridiculous accent, looked like Robin's grandfather). The only sad thing was the final, a shame that they could not, at least, do something special to tie all the loose ends and make him happier.
