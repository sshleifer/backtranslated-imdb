Valentina "Dogkiller" Dussault and Joe "Judge" Kern join forces to clean the vile streets of Geneva! I am delighted with the fact that they inflict kibosha on international heroin smugglers, runaways from Poland, spying volumes, girlfriends, friends, renegades dogs and bugs who are too lazy to throw out the garbage. Do not be deceived by the deceptive advertising campaign Miramax, which portrays it as a pretentious, art-house. This movie is 100% action packed!
