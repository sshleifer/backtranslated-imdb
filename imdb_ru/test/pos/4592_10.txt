This film is the "stupid comedy of the year" and is possibly Mike Judge's best thing since the days of Office Space. If you're a Mike Judge fan or enjoy shows like Futurama, you're doing a serious disservice by skipping this little-known limited release. Although there are very few “bonus features” on DVD, this film is certainly funny enough to compensate for its “lack of value”. <br /> <br /> This film is about the grumbling of an army named Joe Bowers (played by Luke Wilson), which is part of a top-secret army experiment designed to save military personnel in peacetime so that it can be defrosted in wartime to fight for our country. Nevertheless, everything becomes interesting, because the general in charge of the operation finds himself in the ring of prostitution, and the experiment is almost forgotten. Bowers and his girlfriend Rita (played by Maya Rudolph) both woke up in 2505, when, thanks to the natural selection, America’s population became more and more stupid. Now Joe and Rita must find their way to the time machine in order to return to 2005 with the help of Frito (played by Dax Shepard). <br /> <br /> What I really liked about this film was Mike Judge. a comedic satire about the course of US history over the past 50 years and how humanity is progressing over the next 500 years. This is evidenced by advertising in the film, which has become one of the main products of American culture. With shows such as South Park in the mainstream media, it is easy to see how it can be concluded that in the future profanity will become a marketing tool. This is depicted in a film with humor with such subtle things as “Fudd-Ruckers”, changing their name to “Butt-F ### ers”, and a billboard that shows the advertisement “If you do not smoke Tarryltons ... F ## # You! ". I also can't stop laughing at the role of Carls Jr. in this future, with their slogan" F ### you ... I'm eat "and their automated kiosks that advertise their own" Extra Big-A ## Tacos ". (With a lot of molecules)! This film contained everything I go to the movies for. An excellent, sharp, witty comedy, as well as an exciting plot make this DVD for centuries. Boo You’re warned, however. If you’re not a fan of Mike Judge, don’t care about Beavis and Butthead, or you don’t have a sense of humor, then this film probably doesn’t suit you. Otherwise, I would say that the funniest film from 2506 ... I mean 2006.
