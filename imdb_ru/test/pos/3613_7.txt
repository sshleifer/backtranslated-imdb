Once again, John Madden gave us a great movie. A simple but beautiful story, located in a real paradise, and the music could not be better, Stephen Warbeck pleases us once again with good actions, but ......... why would Penelope Cruz in this film? I asked myself the same question while watching this movie. Of course, her Greek accent is implausible, she is not able to behave decently even in one scene. Even in the end, she did a good job, after so many events, years later, she finally saw Korelli again, and she could not change the same face of stupidity that we endured throughout the entire film. In any case, Cage was very good at one of his best characters; Hurt is also great in the business, and all the other actors did an excellent job, so ultimately this is a film that is really worth seeing. This is a beautiful film that even Mrs. Cruz could not spoil. So far, I think this is Madden's best work, so no fan will be disappointed.
