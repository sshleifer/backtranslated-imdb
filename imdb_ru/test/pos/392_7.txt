Dylan and Bobby are childhood friends, and they are in love as young boys sometimes are. But Dylan met the girl and starts putting these baby things aside. Bobby knows that he is not interested in girls, and misses what he had with Dylan. <br /> <br /> Said as partly 80s pop video, partly home cinema, partly video, memories, this film tells a tangled and sad, but too often true story that will amaze many who see it. <br /> <br /> This film brings back many memories and aroused a real response in me, but I would like the director to go a little further and leave it on a happier note. Yes, we all love and lose, even when we are young, but there is always tomorrow, especially when we are young.
