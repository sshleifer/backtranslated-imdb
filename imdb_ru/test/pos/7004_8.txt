I have to say that I didn’t expect to sit a lot to watch Pitch Black, but I got a lot back in terms of excitement and pure fun. This is the type of click, when you can just sit back, relax and have a great time while having fun. This is not a deep film in any way. Everything he offers is either reworked or ripped off from other films, such as Alien, Predator or the like. But when I watch plagiarism, I want it to be good, and this plagiarism is great. <br /> <br /> It opens with a galaxy of stars. Some of the greatest films of all time are opened with such scenes - “2001”, “Star Wars”, “Alien”, “Predator”. The ship flies in space when the entire cryogenically frozen crew awakens. The ship was hit by something. They fall to the ground on a dirty little planet with three suns. All leave the ship when they discover that their prisoner transport, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), has escaped from prison. They scan a deserted planet in search of it and eventually find it, but they have no way of making their ship fly again. They are looking for water and civilization on the planet, but it seems that everyone suddenly disappeared from the planet not so long ago. <br /> <br /> Then they learn that every 22 years the planets line up in a solar eclipse and the whole planet turns completely black. There are also clusters of aliens who thrive in darkness living on the planet - what are the chances? They are on the planet right at the moment of an eclipse - what are the chances? And Riddick has a rare talent - he can see in the dark - again, what are the chances? <br /> <br /> It seems there are a lot of coincidences in this film, but there is no such film to get an Oscar for originality or believability. He is here to entertain the audience - he does it with ease. Vin Diesel is a big gorilla of a man without acting talent. But I have to say, is there anyone who can fit the role of the crappy killer, this is Diesel. Listen to how he mumbles: "He did not know with whom he fucked." Great stuff. <br /> <br /> The aliens in this film are a mix of hammerheads from Aliens and Predators. They have long horizontal heads, similar to the heads of a hammer, the agility of the newcomers and the secrecy of the Predator. I suppose that David Touie (director and screenwriter of the film) did not expect the audience to believe that his creations were really something they had never seen before. At least I hope not. <br /> <br /> “Alien Redux” may be the best title for this film, but again, it's better than the second and third “Alien” films combined. At a time when the obviously finished series are being revived - “Terminator 3”, “Alien 5”, “Predator 3”, “Alien vs. Predator” - “Black tar” is generally distinguished as a new series. Two more sequels are planned. Let's hope they do not get carried away. I can only imagine this in twenty-five years: “Foreigners vs. Predator vs. Black Cat Aliens: * Battle of the Year”. <br /> <br /> * The title of “Battle of the Year” can be transferred to the upcoming film “Freddy vs. Jason vs. Michael vs. Leather Face vs. Norman Bates vs. Alien vs. Predator vs. Terminator vs. James Cameron vs. Barney Dinosaur”. <br /> <br /> 4/5.
