Jolene (Heather Graham) works at a nightclub in New York and lives with her husband Carl (Luke Wilson), a photographer. After about 500 days of marriage, Jolene comes home to find a note from Karl that he needs "some space" ... and a bouquet of daisies, her favorite flower. Joe quickly puts the chamomile in a blender and presses a button. Shortly thereafter, she sets off on a journey to find Karl somewhere in the west, because, after all, she is “loyal” to Karl. However, when she finally tracked him down in Texas, Joe first camped outside his house, hoping to find evidence in his decision to leave. She meets the magnificent sculptor's neighbor (Goran, can not spell his name!), But Joe does not approve of his attraction to her. When she finds out that a new girlfriend may have a new girlfriend, she decides to seek advice from a Mexican-American mystic (Alfonso Arau). Joe is loyal, but does this mean anything to Carl? This is a very imaginative, rather humorous look at the marriage vow. This is a bizarre scenario, and an unusual style is completely contagious. Graham is just gorgeous, like an abandoned woman who is hard to let go of. Wilson does not give his best results, but adequate as a mixed husband. The rest of the cast is pretty good, however, with Goran, great as a sexy neighbor. Landscapes, both in New York and in Texas, are very cute, and the costumes are fresh and funny. If you like romantic comedies and independent films, this film is made for you. It goes to another rhythm, which is the most attractive, but still delivers in the final category a happy ending.
