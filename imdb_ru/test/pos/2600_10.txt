Rabbit Fire "The Hunting Trilogy" (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952) and Ducks! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be regarded as a comic commendation of the collaboration of Chuck Jones and Michael in Malta. Although they are rarely mentioned in the lists of the “greatest” or “most important” cartoons in the history of animation, they are by far the funniest cartoons I have ever seen. Michael Maltese never received due recognition from such directors as Jones, Frang or Avery, but it is his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros cartoons.
