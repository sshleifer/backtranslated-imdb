... instead, look at the great story of the maturity of African American men in the mid-1960s in the ghettos of Chicago. For all of you under the age of 50, “What Happening” was a carefree, rather bizarre sitcom with very few serious moments that lasted four years (1975–1979) for a group of young African-American schoolchildren living in a working-class area. I really liked it - there is simply no connection with this film. “Kuli Khai” started as a basis for “What is happening”, but its serious nature was not well received by the test audience, so it was remade as a comedy, even though the “What is happening” captions still read that it was based on this movie. <br /> <br /> This film begins with light, but touches on many aspects of life that are unique to the turbulent 1960s, as well as some other aspects of growing up that are timeless. Guys have sex, betrayal, unemployment, hopelessness and even early death. The ending is pretty powerful and serious, and the film has a great Motown soundtrack. Highly recommended. Unfortunately, this film is not so new that it can be watched on premium cable channels, and it is not considered old enough to be considered a classic film, and which will also be shown in several places for these films.
