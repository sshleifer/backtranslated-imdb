_The Wild Life_ has a clear resemblance to _Fast Times At Ridgemont High_, and _The Wild Life_ does not hold out. <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> Some other employee wrote the above comment. Of course, Wild Life is not Ridgemont. Ridgemont is a typical 80s movie. Nonetheless, “Wildlife Life” is enjoyable if you do not complain that pointless films are pointless films (especially if you know that initially it should be a pointless film). The little Latino from Scarface is in this film, and he is directly disrespectful (“I received a visa ... Masterrrrr Charrrrge !!”) The colonel also appears (“Suit ...”). Rest in peace Colonel 1931-1997. <br /> <br /> This film is no worse than six compared to other genres, by the way. This is no worse than 7 in terms of other 80s teen comedies. This is very similar to the Cameron Crowe movie. Only villages gave 5.
