The film is about the relationship between a man and a leopard, which is very similar to the “English Patient”, right up to a scene similar to the scene in which the character of Ralph Fiennes takes the body of his beloved one through a rock in a deserted rock. In Passion in the Desert, the protagonist carries the body of a leopard through a rock of a desert stone, but in the opposite direction (calculated solution or unconscious contrast?). Historically built from the very short history of Balzac, the film is not perfect, but no less pleasant. The last shot will haunt me for a few weeks. (8 out of 10)
