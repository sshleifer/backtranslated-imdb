This is one of my favorite James connections in games, because: the mission is fun to play, they have a lot of action, they can be difficult, which makes them interesting in using the weapons that you use. The way James Bond looks in these James Bond games is quite beautiful, you can see Pierce Brosnan in it, which is great, and all the other characters in this game are like the actors who played them in the film. There is no way that you canâ€™t have a good time playing this game, I liked it. Also, the game follows the movie, maybe a few things added, but it largely follows the movie. In addition, this James Bond game has pretty good graphics for Nintendo 64, and, unfortunately, there was no voice for actors in this game, but who cares while playing the game is fun. <br /> <br /> Overall rating ** ****** outside **********
