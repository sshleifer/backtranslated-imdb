I went to a preview of this film, thinking that I was going to start 120-minute smooth lines, a meaningless plot and nauseous game that made the Postman one of the most malignant manifestations of cinematic errors of our time. But I was shocked. Shocked to discover a movie with Costner, who liked the soul of the audience. Shocked that Ashton Kutcher can play in such a serious role. Shocked that the film, in which both films were shot, actually attracted and captured my own emotions. After Robin Hood, I did not see this Costner: he is full of depth and complex emotions. It seems that Kutcher set up a serious game in which he played in the “Butterfly Effect”. These two actors entered this film with a serious, focused attitude, which was manifested in what I consider to be one of the best films I have seen this year. No, this is not an Oscar-worthy film. This is not an epic or deep film with social commentary. Rather, it is a story on a simple topic, illuminated in such a way that this audience reaches a higher level of empathy than was thought possible. This is what I consider good filmmaking, and, for example, I am very impressed with this work. Bravo!
