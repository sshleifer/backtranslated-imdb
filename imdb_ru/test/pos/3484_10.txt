This film was so real. I really felt that all the emotions that were depicted here during my life at different times were both Rory and Michael. I have Duchenne muscular dystrophy, like Rory’s, so what you see here is exactly what I actually felt myself. Some will not believe that there are such handicapped people as Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know that they exist because I am one of them. <br /> <br /> The story is wonderful. For drama, a character-driven movie, the story moves fast. I have never been bored, perhaps in part because I have seen things that are close to my heart. But I think that most people with intelligence will be chained to the screen and take care of the characters. The game is phenomenal! James McAvoy is beautiful as Rory O'Shea, who has Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He, Stephen Robertson, deserves an award for his role as Michael Connolly, who has cerebral palsy. <br /> <br /> Michael's love does not return as a girl, and Rory helps him come to terms with it. I felt it many times, and the question is: “Doesn't she love me because I am not the one, or because my disability has turned her off?” Whatever the girl says, we will always be skeptical of the truth. It's just natural, and in any case it hurts. <br /> <br /> A few moments made me cry a little, because it's sad, and I have to solve problems on my own. People without terminal disabilities simply cannot understand what they can feel. This is a film that everyone should definitely watch. People with disabilities are everywhere and misunderstood. This film sheds some light on some facts of life that are taken for granted by the employable. We want to be the same as you - live on our terms, go out, get drunk, be loved. Outside we can do nothing, but inside we dance!
