Pixot is directed with a little bit of sentimentality. And yet I more than imagine that Hector Babenko owes some of his filming of this film to the neorealist style of Vittorio De Sica, in particular Shoe Cleaning (this film, as in Pixot, takes place mainly in a children's prison). And yet, although I could still prefer De Scyke’s film, if it came down to a choice between the two, it’s so close, because it’s not a pun as a choice between two children. They are both marvelous works of raw drama, and with Pixote Babenco has the added advantage and terrible quality to deal with, that it is not filmed in the conditions caused after the world war. This is how it was in Brazil — one could see it with a little more instinct and trembling in the “City of God”, perhaps in the same places — and these children were on the streets before and after the filming of the film. Some of them are not alive 20+ years later, and everyone knows about it. <br /> <br /> Zvezda, a pre-school homeless child Fernando Ramos da Silva, plays the main role, a fatherless young man or indeed any family that will look after him, and is placed among dozens of other street children and offenders in a correctional institution for boys Conditions can not be much worse, and become even more unbearable, as two children are killed one by one for some reason because of the security service. There is rebellion and escape, and in the middle of the film we find Pixote with several other young people, including Lilika, a practical transvestite who is not even 18 years old, and they become pickpockets, drug dealers, anything to do. None of this, I have to repeat, is manifested with any seriousness - of course, you would never see a million years from now how Ron Howard or Paul Haggis put such a picture - and yet there is emotional honesty in everything because that nothing trivialized. <br /> <br /> Almost every scene is important in order to show how fragile life is for Pixote, and how it can be killed or die in any way on any course, and therefore, without even reaching puberty, it should be at the level of those around him, who are a little older (albeit very little) and become what will pursue this person forever. Despite the fact that Babenko used a gentle and mournful musical score and one or two scenes with people who cry a lot, nothing feels forced. As in the case of De Sica, maybe even more, given the constant conditions of street children in São Paulo and Rio, he is a natural leader of children, and Coax has a really good job with Coax for Ramos da Silva and Jorge Julian and others, which gives the right touches “Cinematic” drama (which is not so real that it becomes documentary, which, however, is not bad) and even subtlety in some scenes. <br /> <br /> Pixot may not be as well known as 21st century Brazilian films that recall the horrors of Rio, or even neorealist films, but it should be so. Anyone who wants to get a good, hard glimpse of what it was like should search for it in a library or a friend and immerse in what is the best foreign film of 1981.
