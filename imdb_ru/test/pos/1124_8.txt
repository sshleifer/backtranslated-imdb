As a person who was in pan-Hellenic society, I was not sure what to expect when I tuned in to this show. After seeing so many dramas in “made for television films” films and crazy reality shows, I was curious to see if a Greek could show real college and Greek life experience. <br /> <br /> I was very pleasantly surprised at how the show was able to give the viewer the satisfaction of defining the character’s ever-familiar characters, but he was also able to add depth to the characters. Greek life is not only parties and minor conflicts. Although these things happen in Greek life, they also occur in any other social or professional circle throughout a person’s life. To characterize it as an exceptional experience for those who work in a Greek organization would be wrong. Most of the plot lines and situations occurring in Greek can and do happen everywhere, in a circle of friends, in sports teams, in real life. But I watched both episodes and my “little sister”, with whom I was still very close, and I spent both episodes, laughing and recalling how they really captured the spirit of our years and college experience. <Br /> <br /> I liked how the second episode showed how the characters are struggling with other aspects of their lives; school, relationships, goals, etc. Cappie tells Rusty that the school comes first and turns to your brothers for help, it was very true to life. You cannot stay in the organization if you have bad grades. How Rusty was assigned to his professor was far-fetched, but it was interesting. Even the dynamic between Casey and Rusty; It happens, you grow up, and whatever your relationship with your brothers and sisters, they change, so you have to adapt. <br /> <br /> Essence: Greek is a great show, great entertainment value and enough “real life” to be believable and definitely worth the time of the audience.
