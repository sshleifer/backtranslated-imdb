I loved it, but I'm a child of the 80s. I loved Rainbow Bright all my childhood. I do not know whether children today are very interested in the show, not mine. (But everything is fine, I still bought it for myself. I just brought a little one so that the guy at the checkout would not look at me funny.) I like the non-violent drama and the colorful decorations. It just reminds me of a simpler time when cartoons were subject to more violence than our local legal news. :) Although I may be a little biased on this. In the end, I was Rainbow Bright for 6 consecutive years for Halloween ........ I wonder if they make a Rainbow Bright costume for adults. Lol
