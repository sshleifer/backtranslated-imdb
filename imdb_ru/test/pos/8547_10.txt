I saw this film many years ago and never forgot it. The topic is very relevant. It was on TCM this morning, and I wonder why this great movie is not recorded on VHS or DVD. I searched this film many times, but I can't find it. I believe that if enough people ask about it, the film will eventually be burned onto DVD. It amazes me that such a stunning performance by Quinn and such a powerful story are not yet available to the public. The fact that ethnic cleansing exists today in many parts of the world makes this film a must-see for both teachers and students. This film is an excellent educational tool from the past, but in many ways as modern as Crash. From previous comments, I see that this film made a deep impression on everyone. Again, very bad that it is not available for sale.
