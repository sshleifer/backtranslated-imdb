Some films simply disappear, but the Tourist Trap has stood the test of time and has rightfully become a cult favorite. Although he is not quite original - he owes a lot to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but he has a sense of humor, genuine eerie moments, a brilliant score by Pinot Donaggio and cheerful performances by Chuck Connors and the actors. Don't let a PG rating keep you aside, this film proves that unwarranted blood and nudity are not needed in every horror movie to make it interesting. These elements are commonly used to cover the lack of thrill in the film. Here the fears are deserved and effective. In addition, only Chuck Connors can tear down the scene in which he has to share the soup with a mannequin! Really classic scene. This film, which is now available for viewing on DVD in widescreen mode, is a must-have for fans of the 70s horror film.
