“Murder in the music hall”, like almost any republican film ever created, seems to have undeservedly disappeared. Shame, because this ridiculously created, expertly directed and written and ingenious subject with a mysterious expectation spins up an enticing thriller against the backdrop of Radio City Music Hall. The murder in one of the luxury apartments in the penthouse of the building is suspicious of the lush Rockett - among them, Vera Ralston (which, in addition to showing attractive indicators of subtlety and vulnerability, provides several excellent figures for skating), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop and several other delightful B-40s star films. Tall, blond and handsome William Marshall (usually in musicals) preys on the murderer when a complex and increasingly creepy plot unfolds, against the most chic things you have ever seen in a film noir. The end is as amazing as this sadly forgotten, cool murder mystery. It is worth recovering and livening up on cable TV, VHS or DVD. In this performance, Grade A, the Republic spent an impressive budget, and Murder in a Music Hall is as cleverly, nervously and immensely pleasant, like any other major studio films of that time. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Pay attention to the rhapsody song written by the victim just before his death. Then, amid the incessant chatter of show-girls in their dressing rooms, try to determine what is humming this fateful melody. You will find out who the killer is, like William Marshall. Great fun, movies that they really don't make anymore, and what a loss - for movie lovers and actors.
