A magnificent look at the 60s through the eyes of four friends from student days in 1960 before their reunification 10 years later - a Yugoslav immigrant who is in love with the American dream and struggling with the often cruel reality; son of a prematurely balding undertaker; soldier; and the crazy hippie girl they all love. Good direction and strong cast do justice to the brilliant script of Steve Tesic; the dialogue is not as fast as in “Separation”, but the themes of growing up and the conflict between father and mother are solved just as well, and there are some more wonderful comic moments among the turmoil and drama.
