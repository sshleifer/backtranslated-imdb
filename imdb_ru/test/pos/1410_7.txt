At the same time, John Russell played rancher Nathan Burdette, trying to free his useless brother Claude Akins from Sheriff John Wayne in Rio Bravo, he worked on television from the other side of the law. These years were probably the high point in Russell’s career, his most famous film role and his most famous television role, Marshal Dan Corpse of Laramie in The Lawyer. <br /> <br /> Russell maintained law and order in Laramie just as James Arness did in Dodge City on Gunsmoke. Unlike Gunsmoke, Laramie never developed all the minor characters who gave you the feel of Dodge City at the time. Instead, he concentrated on Russell doing business and studying legal business to his impatient young deputy Peter Brown. <br /> <br /> Brown played Deputy Johnny McKay, who was the most respected young man, constantly calling his boss Mr. Corpse. He was very comfortable with shooting iron, but was inclined to be impulsive. Well, that Marshal Corpse was near. <br /> <br /> Another regular contributor to the show was Kitty Russell from Laramie, Lily, played by Peggy Castle. It was here that the Lawman most reminded Gunsmoke. There was an unspoken understanding between Russell and Castle, which even the youngest children could not miss. And I was not the smallest of the children when Lawman was in the first race. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there were problems with substance abuse in Peggy Castle after Lawman’s run was over. I remember a small obituary that marked her departure in the first half of the seventies. She was one beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> Lawman was a good Western nonsense from that golden era of adult western television. It was one of the best.
