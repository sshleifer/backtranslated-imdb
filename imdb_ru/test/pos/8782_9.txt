Oh, Hitchcock! It's hard to find Hitchcock's bad film until he lost it after BIRD (1963), and SABOTEUR proves it. For many years, admiring most of the work of this director, I managed to skip it, perhaps because of the lack of interest in Priscilla Lane and Robert Cummings as lead actors. Of course, I was familiar with the culmination of the Statue of Liberty, because I repeatedly saw it in film retrospectives, but I mistakenly thought that the story telling about it might not interest me. Was I wrong? The disturbing plot begins to prepare immediately after a random meeting between the bad guyâ€™s saboteur and the main character, who is accused of being wrongly accused, and continues to scale up a series of further random encounters and narrow escapes. All the familiar Hitchcock elements are present: an innocent person mistakenly accused of committing a crime; people are not what they seem; dramatic or unlikely places that reinforce the tense scene played out in them (airplane hangar, ranch, bridge from which the hero in handcuffs throws himself to escape from the police, a luxurious charity ball in the palace mansion, the upper floor of a skyscraper and, finally, the Statue torch Freedom). <br /> <br /> Everywhere the humor provided by the players of support, the generous baking of early comments on World War II is an old social commentary, moments of human warmth when suffering people find it within themselves. lend a helping hand to another person without getting anything in return ?? In short, Hitchcock has always been the core of humanity, but terrible attributes are the sensational cast of supporting players, mainly Otto Krueger as the most clever villain on this side of George Sanders (his achievements on Broadway include the male leadership in the film Noel Tvard PRIVATE LIFE ?? and that says it all) and affectionately Norman Lloyd as a title saboteur, not to mention Alma Kruger ?? nothing to do with Otto ?? as a prominent widow of society, involved in the intrigue of the fifth column (her character foreshadows the role of the mother of Claude Rains in the film "The Notorious"). Priscilla Lane copes with the challenge. For most of her early scenes, we cannot say whether she considers the hero to be innocent or guilty, and she seems to be constantly changing her mind, not completely switching to his side until the late stage of the proceedings. It is impossible to establish whether the game is guilty or whether we should be in a state of uncertainty, but the storyline is so fast, fun and smart that we really do not care what it thinks. <br /> Then there are the special touches of Hitchcock, which have nothing to do with the plot. Twice the character Lane pauses to get a quarter change ?? once, to reimburse her captors for ice cream soda, and call again from the phone booth. Why were these scenes inserted, one can only guess, perhaps the film would seem more realistic and thus increase the credibility and uncertainty? Or maybe give the viewers a chance to take a breath? Some of the characters are over the top ?? a talkative truck driver, incredibly kind and trustful, blind, living alone in an immaculately groomed forest hut, wearing the human skeleton political philosophy and other members of a circus caravan hiding the main characters from their pursuers.
