This story is about a murder investigation detective who fights with a couple of young rich children who have nothing to do except plan a convoluted murder and hide it. Looks like they outwitted the police forces at will. they scoff at the detective, planting evidence and leading them in pursuit of the wild goose. it has a decent conspiracy with a few good turns at the end of the film, Sandra Bullock does an excellent job of this as a woman on the edge, unsure of herself and fighting with her inner demons, she seems unable to save a man in her life, especially partners , they seem to continue to leave her for some reason. In general, this is not a bad movie, it makes you guess the most shocking finale.
