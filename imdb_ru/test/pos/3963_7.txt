In this film there is something that is not found in most other films of this genre: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, this is the story of a child named Bartleby (Justin Long), who is rejected by every college he addresses. His parents are incredibly strict, disappointed and frustrated. So, Bartleby and several other students who face similar problems start a fake college to give themselves up to their parents in childhood. Not everything goes according to plan, and the film inspires them. But behind this plot, which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morality and a new look at the American education system. The college they create, the Southern Harmon Institute of Technology, accepts those who have not been accepted anywhere else. The bottom line is that you don’t need “money, traditions, or fantastic books — you just need the desire to improve yourself.” they are a completely unorthodox school, but the film teaches that it is still good - and it is not necessarily a bad thing, whether it is a person or a school, and that everyone, regardless of whether they have a chance to improve themselves "Strange." This is a message of inconsistency, and it also has traces of anti-authority. But not only the messages are great - it's fun! haha i was laughing very hard. humor can be subtle, but it can also be blatant, and this is a great combination. Brotherhood beware.
