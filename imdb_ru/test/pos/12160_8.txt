Under the control of the whole of mainland Europe, Hitler prepares for the last obstacle on his way before heading to North America, the UK. With an overwhelming advantage in the plane, the Luftwaffe Goering looks unstoppable on paper. Once in the air, however, the RAF tenaciously destroys the paradigm, forcing the enemy out of the air sky at seven to one rate. The battle for Britain has been going on for more than a year, since the island nation is bloodied, but has no guile, giving its American allies a crucial time to produce more weapons for the inevitable struggle. <br /> <br /> Using more mock footage than the three previous documentaries from the Why We Fight series, Battle for Britain looks more propaganda with dramatized (some with unmistakable Warners music) scenes that are clearly for the newsreel. In an ironic twist among the destruction caused by German air attacks, Beethoven's Seventh Symphony is used to emphasize visual suffering. The story itself is one of the remarkable courage of the defiant nation, which refused to resist the destructive attacks inflicted on it until then by an invincible war machine. This is the 300 version of the 20th century Spartans. <br /> <br /> After this film, more thorough research and more attractive commercial efforts were made in this battle, but the spontaneity and motivation provided by the Battle of Britain will always make it a more valuable document of England during hours.
