Before I watched this TV movie, I knew little about one of my favorite actresses. After seeing it, I realized how sad life was Lucille Ball. He also had wonderful moments, but I did not understand how sad that was. This film was very good and very well told the story of the beloved Lucille Ball. I highly recommend it.
