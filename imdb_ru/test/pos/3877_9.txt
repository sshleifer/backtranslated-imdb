Return “A-team” - it was a special time show, shown on channel 4 last year in the UK on channel 4 and held by moderator and comedian Justin Lee Collins. The show tried to track and reunite the members of the A-Team film crew together. For the first time on television. It was something that no one ever tried to do. Well, not everyone I know is true. <br /> <br /> Justin is a great presenter, and his eccentric personality and humorous banter have shone throughout this program. Attempts that he takes to get the actors are very funny, but he was also very persistent and ready to perform this task, and I would say that it is his merit. Keep in mind that he’s great on television anyway, whether it’s a show or a Friday night project with co-host Alan Carr. <br /> <br /> There were speeches and interviews with Dirk Benedict. - Feisman himself, Dwight Schulz, known as Howling Mad Murdock, Marla Heesley, who played Tawnia Baker, Jack Ging, general 'Bull' Full Bright, creator of the A-team, Stephen J. Cannell and the big man himself, Mr. Teca. B. A. Barakus. It was just interesting for them to see and hear what they would say about the program, which became a world hit in the 80s, because they remember and experience the good and bad moments of the show: both during and behind the scenes. Unfortunately, there is no George Peppard, but, of course, he is already in heaven, for understandable and strange reasons - not Melinda who played Amy. <br /> <br /> I just did not understand why she was not shown in the series. Well, she was fired after 3 seasons or something else, but she was the first and original female member of team A - only to replace Tavnia Marla, and therefore it would be great to see and hear her side from the A-team. team history, in addition to other actors. <br /> <br /> In general, the Bring Back A-Team is an excellent documentary style show. Perhaps it could be spread more by which it could be a six-part documentary. But, nevertheless, this was a great effort on the part of JLC. recommended
