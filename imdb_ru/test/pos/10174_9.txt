A lot of funny scenes about people that you donâ€™t usually pay attention to in a film, and what they have to do to get a job, and what happens when they do it. Lou Myers was very funny, like Wilson's half-step. Any guy who has a close-knit group of friends can relate to many unrelated movie scenes scattered throughout the movie.
