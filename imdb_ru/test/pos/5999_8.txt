Swift socialism and pacifism go through every chance in this well-made remake. (Do you know that there is no hyphen after “good”? Fact.) He meets warlike miniatures, socialist giants, philosophers, as if in the head (literally), and pacifist horses that rule Yachoos - almost Neanderthal humanoids. (That's where Yahoo came from?) We also meet the dastardly Dr. Bates, the devotee Mary Gulliver, the sweet and devoted son of Thomas, and the full line-up of a really terrible 19th century lunatic asylum. Suspension of unbelief comes easily, and our 7- and 12-year-old girls enjoyed it just like my husband and I. (Sorry for the length, IMDb requires 10 lines.)
