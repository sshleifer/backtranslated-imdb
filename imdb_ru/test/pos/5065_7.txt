Reviews of the RENDITION, as a rule, were not favorable, so I waited until he moved to the local discount theater to see it. The film tells about the Egyptian American scientist Anwar El-Ibrahimi, who was pulled out of an international flight and dragged in for questioning after a strange coincidence linking him with a recent terrorist act in an unnamed North African country. Not as bad as I was afraid, this is an interesting and thought-provoking recording in the thriller genre “pulled out of the headlines”. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the film asks tough questions regarding counting methods in the United States. information from political prisoners: does the uncrossed line (openly) of torture of suspected terrorists cross what our country should do? Does it provide useful information that helps save lives? If so, at what cost? What kind of monsters do we create when innocent people are captured and tortured? In sanctioning torture, what kind of monster are we becoming as a country? It always disappoints when a film with such provocative material is negligent with some details that make good movies gorgeous. For example, I would like to sympathize with Anvar's wife, who is conducting the entire film, trying to find him, but the only identifiable character trait she gives is an advanced pregnancy. RENDITION also seems to imply that Arab women who do not agree to marry their fathers are only asking for trouble, and there is a poorly thought-out album kept by another of the film’s main characters, who are too comfortable with all the details on that his love interest is simply necessary at this particular moment. I laughed out loud when the moment was supposed to be full of fear. <br /> <br /> In the film, Jake Gyllenhaal played well in the lead role and the strong (but too short) performances of Hollywood veterans Meryl Streep and Alan Arkin, as well as Omar Atvolli's impressive twists in the role of Anwar El Ibrahimi, as well as actors Moa Huas, Zineb Ukach and Igal Naor, all of which I would really like to see in future films that have nothing to do with terrorism. Good luck to them. The five or so stories followed by the RENDITION are well woven until the filmmakers put in a small but effective twist that finally hints at an endless cycle of slaughter caused by violent attacks of terror.
