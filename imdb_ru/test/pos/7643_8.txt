Luck accompanies the homeless stroller when he becomes entangled in the underground underworld of deception and chaos. Archie (Norman Reedus) was released from prison and he has nothing to lose. He is almost killed before an owner of a carnival named Hayk (Armand Assante) hires him. Soon, Ike reveals Archie’s strong desire to kill his mischievous wife, Divan (Dagmar Dominchik), an erotic dancer for a carnival. Soon everything gets complicated when Archie falls in love with Couch and warns her about the scheme. They become involved in a very fresh affair, which leaves little to the viewer's imagination, after which they soon make a plan. Together they are plotting to kill Ike, but things are not going as planned. <br /> <br /> I would be lying if I said that this film did not surprise me. Personally, I was amazed at how good this film is. Having rented it a few years ago, I was expecting another cliché-thriller with a lot of typical elements and themes that are shown in many films of this type today. A few minutes later I caught on and found myself very passionate about the world of this film. This is such a film, very similar to BUFFALO '66, which simply draws you in and takes you to the style and feeling of paranoia. This is a film that is truly stunning. One thing that I particularly appreciated was how the film portrayed his characters. The film is not as simple and clear as it may seem in the plot. These are the characters you really care about and who are fascinated by them, including the characters who must be the bad guys. In truth, there are no good or bad guys in this movie. All characters have flaws that are realistic and incredibly realistic. There are not many films that do the job as flawlessly as this film, but this is definitely a style of film that I like and I want to see more of the films today. In the early 50s there were quite a lot of crime films that were like that, but since then there has not been such an exciting and unique one! <br /> <br /> In terms of deficiencies, I have mostly very minor problems. The film itself is not quite original. However, I doubt that most people expect it to be original. The movie editing style can also be annoying for some people, as it tends to have a wobbly cam like a camcorder. Although it didn’t bother me, and I really felt that it adds to the atmosphere, I’m sure that most viewers will not be delighted with it and may find it generally disgusting. However, despite minor flaws, this is one of the most underrated films of the 2000s. It is so refreshing when I get lucky and watch an unknown film that turns out to be good. It seems that this film was a release for the video, although this film is much better than this one. If he had been put in cinemas, he would not have received any awards and would not have been noticed, but he would have received much more recognition than today. Recognition that this film deserves. TOUGH LUCK is a striking, interesting and perverted neo-noir-thriller with a real sense of class and style, combining with each other and meaningful enough to make an ordinary moviegoer not just satisfied
