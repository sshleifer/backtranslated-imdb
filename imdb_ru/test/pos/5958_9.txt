Looks like M.Hazanavičius is back! The man behind la classe américaine returns with a really funny and clever continuation of these old-fashioned OSS-117 ... While directors tend to "over-update" the continuation of the old classics (remember the avengers, urk), Hazanavičius decided to work on really cheap hero, OSS-117, a kind of low-budget French 007, and decides to do it in the spirit of the old school ... Photography, attitude to the body, choreography of fights and FX, all as a tribute to the way films were made back in 50- x And it works, since the tone and the jokes of the film are really good! Jean Dujardin perfectly embodies this stupid, arrogant, macho-selfish French spy lost in a country that he understands only in terms of folklore and inferiority. no, I will not say that it has anything to do with what is happening now in the same area ... ah ah) ... it just looks like unfrozen Lino Ventura, with something like 40 pounds smaller, which is perfect for the role. Other cast members are perfect, with all that you can dream of Russian spies, Egyptian independents and former Nazis. And, of course, women, because in any good spy there must be “fatal women”. movies ... The plot is good (perhaps not brilliant, but really good enough ...), occurring between real historical facts and in a funny way recalling how France (and others) treated their colonies in those days. It all begins in 1955 with the disappearance of a British spy while spying on a Russian cargo full of weapons in Suez. Then France sends its best friend, the agent OSS-117, to find out what happened to the cargo and the agent ... The fact is that this agent is actually as stupid as possible, and he slips through the story without even understanding it, resolving it in a very cloz-essential way. I have to say that I had a bad feeling about the film, as the ads around it were rather frightening, and since French humor tends to be quite populist and flat (forget about les bronzés 3 or camping ...), but I was really surprised and in a good way! I highly recommend it, do you want a good parody of Bond Esquire films (much more fun than, for example, in DEBS, but with fewer skirts), or are you a fan of the sincere and frank way of filming that they had in 50- x years Yes, that is clever and (really!) Funny, you understand again, Mr. Hazanavičius!
