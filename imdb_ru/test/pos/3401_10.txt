I have a mini-series on DVD, because I really love this story. This is one of the best historical plays about the civil war that I have seen telling the story of friendship divided by war. The costumes are great, the storylines are great, I like how the story jumps from character to character so you don't know what will happen next in their lives. There is a great balance between good and evil. Some of the characters who are evil in my opinion are too good not to look at them. Every time something more disgusting happens than the last, I curse the TV as if they hear me. I love how this mini-series makes me feel involved in its drama. However, I would advise NOT watching the third movie in the DVD series. This is a disappointment compared to the first two films, and most of the original characters do not return. I do not want to remember how the third film ended, I prefer to live with thoughts about the end of the second film. It makes me happy.
