So forgive me * really * sucky gaming scene, cardboard background and studio stadium. For this part I had to give film 5 instead of 7, but read on ... <br /> <br /> From the background to the plot there is much in common with “Substitutions.” Some say that this film is ripping off the “Substitutions”, and some say that this script was written before it. <br /> <br /> Both films require a kind of “suspension of disbelief in the main premise,” and this is especially difficult for “Second Line,” since it has the NFL licensing team and the whole story behind it. It sounds too unconvincing for some people, and not to mention the fact that the bills "second line" have to overcome big points again and again, with a limited budget for shooting a game scene, this makes it even bad. <br /> <br /> In the “Replacements,” premise and league are fictitious, but you know that this happens in real life. I find it easier to accept a fictional story and a setting with a real event (“Oh, yes, it happened before!” Than the real situation / background with a fictional script (“Bill can't win the Super Bowl!”; Some scenes were actually filmed in The crows pre-season game, in a real stadium, in the audience and in some NFL games with the same shooting angle. <br /> But, let's say, both films came out on the same day, and we erased the budget factor ( so Ive forgotten the game play action scene): Overall, I like “Second String”, not “Replacements”, not really, but I like it more. <br /> <br /> He has “relatively better” character development. In the “Replacements”, the character Keanu is too “out of sync with the world”, and all he cares about is maybe a girl? Second String, you see QB struggling with returning work and dealing with your past with a coach, or a problem with an awkward guy. This decision to keep the ball throughout the day is certainly not new, but we see progress in correcting it. <br /> <br /> How about these tricks? I think this is “relatively realistic” than “Replacements”. Dan Marino is like a fake knee pass, flea blink, a wild cat with a full back, all real, except that sometimes it looks too easy. But for me this is better than the central catch of the “Substitutions” and a throw for 50 yards, or how the 60-meter field goal looks too easy. Oh, by the way, I am glad that they didn’t force TE kicker to make their shot .... <br /> <br /> Of course --- if you objectively view this movie over other football movies, it could easily be 5 out of 10 movies. But some say it's the worst football movie? Try "Return".
