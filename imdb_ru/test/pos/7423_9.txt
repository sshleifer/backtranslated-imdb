Terry and June, one of the most unscrupulous programs of all time, was also one of the most popular sitcoms of the 70s and 80s. <br /> <br /> It started with Happy Ever After, but when Eric Merriman decided that he no longer wanted to write, everything changed, and hence Aunt Lucy and Fletcher became medfords. <br /> <br /> Yes, these were cozy, homely things of the middle class; the plots controlled a set of clichés from the boss who came for lunch, the vicar who had organized the random sale, and unwanted relatives who came for the weekend. It was, of course, not a "terrible lazy comedy." As for being “not smart,” it should not have been. It was fun and well done, and that was enough! <br /> <br /> I also really liked the “alternative” boom of the 80s (“Spitting images”, “Black adder”, “Young”, etc.), but I also liked such traditional things as this . If nothing else, it provided an alternative comedy with something to be an alternative. I was sad when people like Ben Elton confronted both this and Benny Hill. Well, the family comedy almost disappeared from our screens, but where did she leave us? See the latest T.V. graphics. All soap and reality dross. The few remaining comedies are aimed at teenagers. This means that they are filled with curses, jokes with bodily functions and explicit sexual references. Yes, and they are not so funny. <br /> <br /> The alternative comedy boom was good in many ways, but it had a dark side. This made ordinary comedy shows old-fashioned, expelled talented writers and performers such as Spike Milligan, and ultimately led to such incredible delirium as Little Britain and Tittibangbang (heaven help us). If it is not broken, do not fix it!
