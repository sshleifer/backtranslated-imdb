Did the distribution of relatively high-quality shows in spreading television channels allow people to create, shoot directors, finance and / or make films in their own films that otherwise could not do that? It's good? <br /> <br /> This film doesn’t answer the last question in any way, but it would seem that without Jeff Garlin, Debr Garlin could not have done “I want someone to eat with cheese.” <br /> <br /> Like most new producers / directors, Jeff Garlin’s independent play gives a more sensitive sigh than the machine he is most famous for (Curb). And yet, is this a sensitive movie guy? He is not a very sensitive guy. Pleasant, of course. Indeed, in connection with this. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to say what this film really is about; I can only tell you about what I took from him. <br /> <br /> I rented the film for the trailers, in particular for the scene in which Amy Sedaris portrayed a consultant who tells James Aaron (Garlin) that a particular woman is interested in him mainly because she " chubby chase. “I almost fell off my seat. Based only on this scene, I ran to my computer to write myself a note about this movie. I thought that the school counselor (Cedaris) was talking about Beth, pictured by Sarah Silverman. I I presented a light romantic comedy between Fox Silverman and fat Garlin. I did not think the story would be something original, but the dialogue would be fast and the scenes would develop at a satisfactory pace. In short, I thought it would be a comedy. <br /> <br /> It was intriguing that the film was starting I did it that way, but then I took a much more realistic character when Beth gave James great pleasure, because “I have never been with a fat man before.” That's how cruel we live, and it was completely realistic. I welcome the decision. It's just it meant that Beth had now left the building and with her the only living person in the film. <br /> <br /> James’s relationship with his mother was also interesting. . It had that confused feeling for it. (The whole Marty film in the film was completely lost to me, since I had never seen this film.) <br /> <br /> Although I had serious doubts about the character of James Aaron. Really in 39 years he did not have a serious relationship? Is he an actor? This is not quite with me. For me, his person was less acting and more corporate. I also could not buy his ordinariness. Without a doubt, he was extremely disappointed that nothing had happened to Beth. We felt it. But then, did he really care? <br /> <br /> Another thing - how in the world can he and his mother afford to go at the same time? Hasn't he lost his job? Last he had? This was one of the reasons why he did not seem ordinary to me. Where does funding come from for his life? <br /> <br /> And yet I read reviews that talk about a realistic depiction of urban loneliness, so it is. Yes, this is very realistic, the way we should be satisfied with what we have, because that's all we have. The way we disappear from ourselves and each other in interactions (James and Stella) is a kind of self-deprecation, which occurs only in order to proceed to the next moment. This, unlike the ability to define ourselves through our moments, our thoughts, like James and Beth, really crush. <br /> <br /> Very well done.
