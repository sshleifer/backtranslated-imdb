I saw this movie at the premiere, and I liked it. I probably would have liked more if I hadn’t sat next to my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately, I have not seen it yet) and continued to discuss all this. He continued to say that the film sucks, and that it is stupid. The fact is that he did not understand that the creators laughed a little at the horror genre with the film. In each horror film is always a certain character. If they weren't in the film, well, maybe you wouldn't like it very much. Trademark: <br /> <br /> “Main character”: Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) “Main character guy”: Wade (Jared Padalecki) “Main character’s brother / (Reformed soon”) Dash ”: Nick ( Chad Michael Murray) "Annoying depraved character": Paige (Paris Hilton) "Characters who are just around to look beautiful": Dalton (John Abrahams) and Blake (Robert Richard) <br /> With these characters it becomes a little predictable who will die and who will live. Obviously, you know who will be with what I just typed. The film can be predictable (on Actually, I had a pretty good idea who would die just by watching the trailer), but it was still pleasant. Sometimes it may seem silly (why is the sugar factory located in the middle of a deserted camp, which was not there at the beginning?), But it's very easy to watch. Comedy and bloodshed was the perfect amount for filmmakers with weak stomachiness, it is really terrible, don't get me wrong (less than “Final Destination 2”), but it works very well. In conclusion, this film was not as hot as the fire in which the TV went up, but the temperature could still burn the “wax”.
