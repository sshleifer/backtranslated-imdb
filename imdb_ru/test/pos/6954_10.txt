I'm not sure how IMDb "weighted average" turned out to be with such a low rating in this film. In my opinion and for all other reasons, this is overlooked by the gem of the film. Rip Thorn is great in the role of stubborn Lord Noel, and the excellent Tantuan - in the role of neighbor in the house. Thorne and Cardinal are both underestimated actors who were finally given the opportunity to work on their craft. <br /> <br /> Their relationship is not always pleasant, but quite real. This is NOT a “funny and touching love story”, which is described as on the cover of a DVD. In the end, it is a tragedy. The lord simply seeks too high and ignores all the advice to take the money offered by the energy company for the move. <br /> <br /> Music is fantastic, as are periods.
