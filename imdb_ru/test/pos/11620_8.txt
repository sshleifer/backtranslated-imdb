“Subliminal Cruelty” should be one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. Nevertheless, it is sometimes extremely gloomy and gloomy, so fans of politically correct mainstream horror should not be worried. The film mixes a lot of great visual effects with lots of dirty movies. and mountains. This is very strange, angry and anxious, so fans of a strange movie will not be disappointed. My favorite piece from “Subconscious Cruelty” is “Larvae of Man”, which shows us the intricate relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister. The scene of the birth of a child is especially unpleasant and not so easily forgotten. The last segment “Right Brain / Martyrdom” must be seen to be believed. This is incredibly harsh and blasphemous with scenes of genital mutilation and horrible torture. We see how Jesus Christ was captured by three naked women who disfigured him, tore the flesh from his chest, licked the wound on his knee and wrote on him. There is also a statue of Jesus with a projection of the swastika on it. “Subconscious cruelty” is a truly unforgettable film that fans of extreme cinema should see. Check this.
