This is an interesting, hard-to-find film of the early 70s with Jan Michael Vincent in the role of a young man who doesnâ€™t hit like a marine. Dressed in "blue" outfits, to humiliate them when they are sent home, failed recruits are sent to pack. Vincent stops at a bar and encounters a very young Richard Gere, who has just returned from touring the Pacific as a hardcore sea Raider. Gere's character is already exhausted and contemplates desertion, and he takes advantage of Vincent's innocence, stealing his "blue-blue" form after he drank and beat him in an alley. The character of Vincent, whose name is Marion, takes Gear's clothes and suddenly turns into a naval "Raider." Marion travels to Wyoming and stops in a small town like Norman Rockwell. In the local cafe, he meets Rose Hadkins, who immediately catches the eye. Staying with Hudkins' parents, Marion attracts all kinds of attention from urban residents. Mr. Hadkins suspects Marion and wonders how the sea-raider can still be so innocent. The story also tells of the Japanese internment camps, as city residents "hunt" for 3 fugitives. Marion shot randomly during this hunt. But there is still a happy ending, which puzzled me a little. I would prefer a little more drama! In any case, it captures JMV at the peak of his 70s performances. Buster and Billy, BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER in the mid-70s were amazingly good performances by JMV. He was both an action movie star and a heartbreaker at the same time !!! He made many quality films in his career, and continued to do so until the mid-80s with the awesome TV show Airwolf. He does an excellent job with this task as Hedge, calmly watching how people treat him (in his form) as he travels around the country. He must have done some of the stunt work - at the end of the film there is a heartbreaking river scene - and it looks like he is the guy who is being thrown over the river to me! But in reality, in the midst of his popularity, this film could have done much more with the talent of JMV and his appearance. Innocence can only be so interesting. The evil seen in Buster and Billy is much more dramatic! In any case, Glynnis O'Connor is as amazing as Rose. The whole look of the movie is like a Norman Rockwell picture. The outdoor scenes are great - they must have been shot in Canada.
