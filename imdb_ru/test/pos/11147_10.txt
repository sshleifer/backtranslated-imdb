This film is exceptional in that Marlene and Raymond present outstanding performances. Acting in this film is the greatest strength of the production, but the original, the manual and the editing deserve applause. There is an unusual chemistry that exists between two stars. If you like Marlene, and you like Raymond, you will like this movie ..... (A classic that compares with Casablanca.) <br /> <br />
