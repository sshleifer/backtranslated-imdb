Going into this movie, I was a little careful. I have always doubted a bit about clay films. I always liked decent animated films, but glining was always different from me. But this one caught me by surprise. Wallace and Gromit are extremely cute characters, and this is a great story with jokes for all ages. There are silly jokes about children and thin fartings, but above the heads of small children there are jokes about us elderly people. Very neat pottery, and although there were holes in history, my interest in it began to end. <br /> <br /> Nowadays it is very rare to find pure and unspoiled humor, this film was all the more refreshing. Wallace and Gromit are doing their usual thing, destroying humanely freaks that spoil vegetable crops of people. But this time they are fighting with some monstrous rabbit, which their humanely built traps can not even keep under the tabs. Great laughter and a good one and a half hours of fun. If you didnâ€™t show yourself to Wallace and Gromit, I highly recommend this film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I rate it as 7 and not higher is because it is still a family film, and I have no children, I enjoyed it, but if I watched it with little rats and my wife, it would be at least 9! Give him a chance!
