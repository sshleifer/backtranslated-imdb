My young aunt is unique in many ways. At first it is the first fighter Hui Ya-Hung (Kara Hui). Secondly, she really starred in fights after she had the surgery a few days before the shooting. Thirdly, this film is off the chain. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the fact that Van Lung Wei is trying to take the inheritance from his brother. His brother has Cara to marry him so that Van cannot take the treasure. The story is pretty good, and everything leads to its correct position. <br /> <br /> Comes the action, what can I say, what has not yet been said for films such as “Pupils of the 36th Camera”, “The Victim”? or even the Magnificent Butcher. The fight scenes are what sell the films, and there will be no problem with that. Liu Jia Liang and Wang Lung Wei engaged in a battle you must believe. Why these two men did not fight each other more, I do not understand. <br /> <br /> I don’t really want to spoil anything, but you have to see my young aunt to get a full charge of excitement. The only thing that worries me is that Yuen So was not used as widely as he was used in 3 Evil Masters, or even in Invincible Pole Fighter (8 Diagram Pole Fighter) to watch movies perfectly. 9.2 / 10
