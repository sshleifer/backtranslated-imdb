The boy who adores Maurice Richard from Montreal Canadiens, much to his dismay, receives in the mail a Toronto sweater made from maple leaves. I recently watched it in a class in which very few people were interested in hockey, but almost everyone knew about Maurice Richard and the rivalry of Toronto / Montreal. Very interesting, funny and neat.
