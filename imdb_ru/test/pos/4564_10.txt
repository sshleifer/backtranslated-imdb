Admit it, guys, “DK3” is more sophisticated, innovative and clever than its predecessor. Difficult - his levels are ridiculously complex for a considerable period of time. One particularly difficult level is called "Lightning", where you can be struck by lightning at any time. Innovative - he opened many doors. It is a pity that the SNES became extinct soon after this title. And smart - level titles range from product labels ("Lake Orangatang") to witty mentions that the target audience of the game will not receive for many years ("House of Glare"). <br /> What's annoying to me in the criticism of most people of this game, basically comes down to two words: Kiddie Kong. He is a worthy "little buddy" successor to Diddy Kong and, of course, does not deserve to be called a "backward monkey". "DK3" will remain a classic until the end of time.
