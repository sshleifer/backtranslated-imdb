This time the Barbie movie is good. I am 18 years old and I’m too shy to say this, but I got hooked on these films. I hated Barbie when I was younger, but the films I love. Shivering so cute, and I fell in love with him. He is as cute as a polar bear, and completely in love with Aiden. Oh man, I'm in love with Shiver. I love Annika’s determination not to give up hope, and in the end it works. I like this movie, and hopefully they will be other good ones. Barbie and Swan Lake is another brilliant film. I would recommend this film to children of all ages (even boys), because the film is very good and I find it hard to please. "Barbie and the magic of Pegasus" - an exciting and exciting movie.
