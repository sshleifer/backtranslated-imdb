This film is very funny - the character of mom makes me come back to the film again and again! I can't get enough of her dry lines ... for example, when she tells her son Owen to bury her friend in the backyard before he smells this place ... and her suspicion that Owen is trying to kill her, giving her unsalted nuts! It's fun! <br /> <br /> If you like movies such as “National Lamphun Vacation,” “Uncle Buck,” or “Airplanes, Trains, and Cars,” you have a similar humor. This is a great, useful laugh ... you absolutely must see!
