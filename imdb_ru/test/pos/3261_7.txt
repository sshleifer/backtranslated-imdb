“Two Hands” is an interesting, funny story about an Australian lowlife. The script contrasts the world of fast money and deadly actions with an inexplicable fate and circumstances. In a subtle way, we are asked to think about the concept that the main events in our lives are sometimes generated without our full understanding of the root causes. The forces of fate and circumstances lead Jimmy, the protagonist, to situations that lead to the realization of his petty dreams and, ultimately, to an understanding of a more promising world. <br /> <br /> The ignorant Jimmy, depicted with the insight of Heath Ledger, is a child who grew up without opportunity. The high-paying world of crime offers the greatest appeal to its dulled feelings. Love and the help of friends lead him to a higher plateau. <br /> <br /> The film is well focused and works well. A group of criminals teetering between pleasant and despicable, forcing us to be interested in their crazy antics throughout the film.
