I have to admit, at first I was worried about Farscape. The initial segment was not very strong, and I began to worry about what would happen next. However, as soon as he entered Hensonâ€™s familiar territory with a wry sense of humor, unique and enduring characters, and an exciting story, combined to create an excellent piece of science fiction. The story goes about John Krayton (played by Ben Browder), the scientist who developed the spacecraft and the theory based on the slingshot movement. However, during the first test, his ship collides with an unknown magnetic field, and he moves to an unknown galaxy, where he finds himself in the middle of a struggle between escapes of prisoners (on the "Moy" spaceship) and peacekeepers (security forces). into the ship for prisoners, and after many turns he finds himself with the prisoners (Ca D'Argo, warrior Luxom; Pau Jaan, Delva priestess; Rigel XVI, ousted ruler; and Irene) Sun, the Peacemaker who reluctantly joined the crew) With excellent special effects, moderate makeup, dolls and robots that exceed the standards of excellence Henson; FarScape is a fantastically original, creative, and intelligent science fiction series.
