I saw Borderline a few years ago at AMC. I have been looking for this since. It pursued: visual, textural, sensual. This film took me somewhere, like a dream, and I didnâ€™t care where. I will never forget the curtain blowing in the wind. I still remember how this made me bow my head. I remember my expression when I saw it. I did not know what happened when the film ended, but I find life like that. It did not bother me. The injustice of the final rejection of an innocent character seems to me sadly real. I liked the faces, the way the camera looked at them. The camera looked at the film set with the unfocused eyes of the dreamer. The border was real for me, unlike films. It was precisely the lack of explanation, color, sharpness, which made him enter my mind like a thief in the night. I love this film. Someday I will own it.
