I first saw this masterpiece on VHS 10 years ago, and the powerful interpretation of “The Evil Child, Painfully Against the Established Society,” which he carried, has since remained in my heart. Director Hector Babenko is such a good person who finds a delicate look to tell the story of how the city authorities kill childhood children from the poverty class. Even rogue children have their innocent beautiful dreams. But vicious reality never gives chances ... <br /> <br /> Thanks to publishers for the recent DVD release, now I can leave this wonderful movie in my favorite collection.
