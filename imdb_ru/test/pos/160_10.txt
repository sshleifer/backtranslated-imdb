Not because of disgust, but an abundance of fabrications, inventive use of situations using vampire mythology, magnificent visual extremes and interesting and bizarre characters make this film one of the most amazing horror films I have ever seen. He plunges into complete madness along with the characters, but he never seems exploitative or horrible without a goal. There are abundant bloodshed, accompanied by unpleasant sounds of sucking and squishing, as well as subtle moments when you laugh loudly. As he usually does, Chan-wook Park keeps you in the spotlight with jumps in time, plot and situation that you have to fill for yourself, forcing you to participate in plot and characters. <br /> <br /> And literally jumps. Keeping in the spirit of the vampire myth (the pun is intended), they have superhuman strength and can jump from tall buildings in one go (to come up with a phrase). For the first time when our heroine is carried by a restless vampire priest through the tops of buildings, Lois Lane and Superman's entire magical novel is in her - but this novel is becoming more and more disturbing - but driven by a strange and controversial "love story" is not just a horror. <br /> <br /> The acting is great, especially OK-Win Kim, a great actress in the main female role, who at 22 demonstrates a wonderful range. The character borders on something like a black widow movie like noir. She seeks from an innocent to fool a fox to a demon with full conviction. This is really a smooth and nervous presentation. <br /> <br /> If you love true art in horror or are an Oldboy fan - don't wait for the video, watch it immediately.
