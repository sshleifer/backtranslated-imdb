If you are looking for an erotic masterpiece, it is not. If you are looking for a comedic masterpiece, it is not. If you are looking for something hardcore, then it is not. <br /> <br /> This is said, if you are looking for an example of the fine art of the European erotic comedy of the beginning - mid 1970s, that's all. . <br /> <br /> I see that many people complain about the quality, please understand that this was done in 1974. Yes, women do not match the modern ideal of attractiveness. They are by no means ugly women, but they do not have that appearance that is idealized in our silicone culture. Yes, rewriting is not very good, but they speak German, and anyone who speaks German will understand that rewriting a word with 12 syllables is rather difficult. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a DVD before the latest release comes out with 2 covers of the 80s, and more recently and 90s for adult stars. This film is an R film, so those who complain about hardcore should have understood this, the film was edited from the original, BUT it was also edited before the film was launched in the late 1970s. <br /> <br /> I first saw this film as a young man, and judging by some comments, many in the same boat caught a glimpse of Cinemax. Many people get upset when later in life it does not match their previous memories. This is understandable if we take into account the obscenity and nudity in modern erotica. <br /> <br /> If you compare 2069 with a modern erotic comedy with a soft core, you may be disappointed. The film, although outlandish, is actually quite smooth, and jokes, while, as a rule, the understatement and double meanings are still preserved and may still cause a chuckle. If you compare it with a hardcore film, you will be even more disappointed, compared to today you see very little. <br /> <br /> This is still one of the best examples, along with Bottoms Up and The Other Cinderella of European Erotic / Comedy Cinema of the 1970s.
