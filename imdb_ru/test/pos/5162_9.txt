"With all the trouble in the world, how can we not get drunk?" ?? Mia <br /> <br /> A beautiful aerial view of a large city becomes ominous as the fleet of bomber planes approaches; an angry barber who reacts to alleged racial filth cuts through the thick hair of a businessman; the man dreams of being dragged to the electric chair after a failed magic trick, and the teacher breaks down in front of an elementary school class because her husband called her a hag. These and about fifty other vignettes that cover the whole gamut from frankly depressing to wildly humorous and joyfully uplifting, inhabiting Roy Andersson “You, Live”, his first feature since he received critical acclaim, commercially unsuccessful songs from the second floor . <br /> <br /> You, The Living is filled with the same imagery as the songs, filled with black humor, surreal situations and strange looking characters. Although he is a bit long and less focused than his earlier work, Andersson's unmistakable style with his stationary camera, sterile-looking background and precise attention to detail remains unchanged. If there is a topic that ties sketches together, this is what our time on Earth is limited and “tomorrow is another day,” so let's treat each other with kindness. On the way, we are entertained by the tuba and drum music from the Louisiana Brass Band, the guests of the dinner in the banquet hall, standing on the chairs, sing a fiery song, and the house, which turns into a moving train. <br /> <br /> Emotions range from the gloom of a daughter trying to socialize with an Alzheimer's patient in the young woman's enthusiastic dream of marrying a handsome guitarist named Micke to the cheers of the crowd. Although there is no continuous narrative thread, the theme of greed and despair appears in several sketches. The first of these strands are two fat individuals and their tiny dog ​​sitting on a park bench. A woman mourns the fact that no one understands or loves her, but she carelessly ignores the consoling and encouraging words of a man. <br /> <br /> a hefty mixture of irony. During what seems to be a lunch for a manager, one person talks on the phone to another that workers do not appreciate quality and how pleasant it is to value money and things that you can buy, for example, good wine. However, when he is not looking, the person at the next table calmly removes his wallet from his jacket on the back of the chair. Although Andersson's cynicism is sometimes not well hidden, You the Living has a fundamental humanism that demonstrates compassion for the human condition. This is a cautionary tale that considers the mess that we humans have fallen into, but assumes that there is still time to change it if we listen to the warning of the poet Goethe, who opens the film: “Be pleased, you live in your delightfully warmed bed before the icy wave of Leta lick your escaping leg.
