Good shots of ships and aircraft of the First World War complement this excellent military drama on the Adriatic. Walter Houston is excellent as a commander who knows his place, and in his place there is no place for personal feelings. Ship safety and mission should always come first. Robert Montgomery is a lieutenant who has not yet mastered the role that a leader should play in battle. He makes bad decisions, endangering the submarine and its crew, but eventually becomes a “real man” after his military court fired and fired from the fleet. Robert Young plays Junior Lieutenant, and Jimmy Durante plays the cook. The military drama parallels are an equally important wartime love triangle between Montgomery and Madge Evans, who plays the daughter of Houston and the wife of an injured aviator. Featured.
