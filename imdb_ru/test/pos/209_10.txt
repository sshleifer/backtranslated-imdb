In 1956, the 20th Congress of the Communist Party took place, and Soviet Prime Minister Kruschev condemned Stalin and the Stalinist purges and labor systems of the Gulag, released information that had previously been banned, publicly revealed the terrible new truths that opened the door to the new Cinema Council under the leadership of Mikhail Kalatozov, once Stalin's filmmaker. This film depicts the Red Army, which does NOT win, in fact they are surrounded in retreat mode, where many people die, including the hero, in the film after 06-02-41, the German invasion of Russia, when Germany presented the Barbarossa Plan, the invasion blitzkrieg, designed to lead to a quick victory and the final enslavement of the Slavs, and very nearly succeeded, actually reaching 20 miles from Moscow of what was destroyed by the Red Army, the devastation of human losses, 15 to 20 million Russians died or 20% of the total population. Historically, this was a moment of tremendous trauma and suffering, a psychological shock for the Russian people, but the Red Army held and continued the war for another 4 years, until they finally won. <br /> <br /> During the war, Stalin used the military genre in films to explicitly raise morale, introducing heroines of ultra-patriotic, strong and idealistic women, suggesting that if women can be so successful and patriotic, then Russia could expect at least as much from their soldiers. Stalin destroyed the mass hero of the proletariat and replaced it with a separate, courageous leader who managed to kill many enemies, which explicitly refers to Stalin himself, who in the film was always portrayed as a bold, wise and victorious leader. But Kalatozov changed this image, since “Cranes fly” were made after Stalin’s death, causing a political thaw and creating a global sensation, winning the Cannes Film Festival Palm D'Or, as well as the best direction and best female role (Tatyana Samoilova) Awakening the West to the Soviet cinema for the first time since the days of "Ivan the Awful" Eisenstein in the 40s. <br /> <br /> In this film, the brilliant, breathtaking and extremely mobile camera work of his outstanding cinematographer Sergei Uresevsky was shown, using impressive shots of cranes and tracking, images of wartime, battlefields, Moscow and populous streets, which are extremely bright and real, Another brilliant scene shows the main character, Veronica, who has not heard from her lover, Boris, for 4 years in the war, so he is considered dead, but she continues to love him, expressing Yas in the scene where she runs to the bridge with the train following it, the moment when the viewer wondering if it can jump in front of this train, instead it saves three year old boy named Boris who is going to bring down the car. Another scene captures the death of Boris on the battlefield, which dies a senseless death, and his thoughts revolve and spin in a beautiful montage of trees, sky, leaves, all rotate in a kaleidoscope of his own thoughts and dreams, including an imaginary wedding with Veronica. This film shows the famous line "You can dream when the war ends." In the last sequence, when the war ends, the soldiers return to the mass scene on the streets, Veronica learns that Boris is dead, everyone is happy and excited about the return of the soldier, but Veronica distributes flowers to the soldiers and strangers on the street in an extreme gesture of generosity and selflessness reveal “cranes white and gray floating in the sky. " <br /> <br /> The film was released in 1957 in Russia, and according to some reviews, “the silence in the theater was deep, the wall between art and living life fell ... and tears opened the doors. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
