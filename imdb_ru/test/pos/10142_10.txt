Excellent cast, storyline, performances. Absolutely believable. I understand the close-knit group that is an example of marines. But this film brought fear into my heart. Marines allow damned principles. This film seems to be based on real incidents. It shows how difficult it is to confront the establishment. Anne Heche was completely convincing. Sam Shepard portrayed a fanatical guy, Marin was sobering. And Eric Stolz, like her lawyer, so deftly balanced his loyalty to the Corporation, but also his loyalty to his client, while high on his rope. He knew what his true course of action should be. But he was separated by his immersion in the maritime tradition, loyalty to the shell above all. I sat chained to the TV screen. In general, I give this an amazing 9 out of 10.
