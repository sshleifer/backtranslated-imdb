Anyone looking for the episode "Law and Order" or "CSI" would have to look elsewhere, since the most basic elements of the work of the police or forensic science were completely ignored in this case. <br /> <br /> The murder took place, and all the police did was grab a 15-year-old boy from the street and take him to the only witness - a 65-year-old man - and asked if this was the guy who did it Of course, the old man thought that the child at the back of the police car must be guilty. never mind that he did not look like a real killer and was dressed differently. He must have shrunk, changed his age by 5-10 years, and changed his clothes. <br /> <br /> Police made no effort - and they admitted it! They did not conduct a forensic examination on any of the evidence, did not interrogate other witnesses, and beat the confession of a 15-year-old child. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this convincing view of the criminal justice system is that this happened right in the future in Jacksonville, Florida. Now let everyone start talking about "southern justice".
