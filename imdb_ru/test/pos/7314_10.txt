Three Puppets has always been one of the many actors I loved. I love almost all the shorts they made. I love all six puppets (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are funny, and many other great actors and actresses have also been shot, many of whom were in many shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stooges - one of the greatest actors of all time and the funniest comedy team of all time! <br /> <br /> One of the funniest Three Stooges shorts is Men in Black. This short film tells about Bad Jamison, Gini Roberts, Phyllis Crane, Della Henderson, Little Billy Rhodes, Billy Gilbert and Ruth Hyatt. These actors are good, especially Jamison and Roberts. There are a lot of funny scenes here that I think most Three Stooges fans will love! In my opinion, this is one of the most diverse shorts Three Stooges. I recommend this to everyone!
