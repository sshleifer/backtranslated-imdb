“For the squadron commander — usually the only guy trained and equipped to navigate the squadron — and very difficult to replace — risk an expensive plane and yourself to pick up a crashed pilot pilot, no matter how close he is, it's hard to believe in the face enemy troops, especially when they both have to share the closet cab of the Spitfire - two in the Skyraider, fine, but on the spit ?! C'mon, this part of the movie is the Biggles adventure, not the right movie to be taken seriously! as Tord S. Eriksson (Gothenburg, Sweden) said, this is rubbish. Not at all, Biggles. One true story about the war comes to mind two pilots of the scythe, who planned and carried out (illegally) a mission in France. It was necessary to break the ground, and his friend landed on his scythe, while the German infantry approached them, and took them both out. In spit. Both of them were seriously injured in previous battles, one had an artificial leg from the knee down. Now it may sound like something from the Beagles, but it happened. I will get sources if necessary
