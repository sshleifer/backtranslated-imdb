First, let's call this movie what it is: <br /> <br /> 1. This is a good movie with a message. <br /> <br /> 2. With the acting, everything is in order, the dialogues are a little better, the production value is quite good. <br /> <br /> 3. Scenes in rugby ... hardly passable. <br /> <br /> But this is the trick: this is not what Hollywood has invented, and it is not trying to be a ferociously accurate depiction of the sport. Instead, this is a pretty good representation of mostly real people, in real-life circumstances and a real storyline. Of course, they could cope better with a report on sports, but my voice: he copes well with his tasks. <br /> <br /> (And, by the way, I can’t recall many football, baseball, hockey or football films that are also true to the sport. C'mon ... Bull Durham?) <br /> <br /> I am not a rugby player (I was a wrestler), but I graduated from Highland, attended 86-90 and sometimes practiced rugby with the guys. However, my brother-in-law, David, was one of the first founding members of the Highland Rugby Club in 1976. (As I recall, his younger brother Billy played next year. If you are interested, there is a Highland rugby website on highlandrugby.net dedicated to the history of the team.) <br /> <br /> By the time I was there, The club has existed for about ten years and has long gained a reputation as an excellent player. It is a fact that they focused on “broad” training topics: dedication, honor, discipline, effort, and not tactics. I thought that the rugby guys I knew were a little “off” in my head, but I think I might just be a little jealous. They were strong believers in the belief system promoted by Gelwix. <br /> <br /> With regard to the issues raised by “cultural mixing”, it would be interesting to note that although I was there in the 1980s, one of the largest schools in the city, Southern High School, and its students were closed distributed among 3 other SLC primary schools. Honestly, until the 80s, the Highland was pretty snow-white ... I have a photograph of the team (I think) from 1977, which depicts a * completely * white club. South High, on the other hand, was a much more racially integrated school before it closed: I had a couple of friends from southern countries who joined the team, one Tongan, one Samoan, and, as I recall, there were many island nations. players who joined the '88 -90. I don't think anyone doubted the credibility of the team in accepting Maori (or other cultural) traditions: if there was something that was obvious in these guys, it was that they walked. <br /> <br /> As for the strength of the team compared to the best teams of high school students in the world: yes, it’s true that the United States-rugby, on average, in general, does not represent well against the best elsewhere. There are exceptions, but hey - it's a simple fact that rugby doesn't have that fame or impact that is necessary for the development of the numerous traditions of supremacy in the United States that arise in other countries. <br /> <br /> With that said, judging Highland by merit: <br /> <br /> - * is the only * team that is selected annually for the US National Rugby Championships during the 25-year history of this organization. <br /> <br /> - win record 392 wins, 9 losses. Read it again ... The best coach in any sport in US history. <br /> <br /> - regular international tours. <br /> <br /> - some convincing victories over legitimate international teams. <br /> <br /> Are they the best in the world? Maybe a few years, maybe not most ... but they are pretty good all the time. And it is disrespectful to the game to drop them when Highland Rugby may be the best ambassador in the sport in the United States.
