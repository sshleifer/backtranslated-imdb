Most people are completely unaware that this film exists. Fox, who paid the Judge to do this, kept it in the bank for quite a long time and then spent nothing to promote it. I guess it made many think that it was one of the junk movies that broke out at the end of the summer. Well, I'm here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look to a future that is not so hard to believe. In essence, the judge puts forward the idea that stupid people, with a large margin, breed smart people. Then these fools become more stupid, mostly spending all their time watching TV and having sex, which makes people more stupid. By the year 2500, a person with average intelligence today will seem like a genius who says “it's all fine”. Seriously, it's really so hard to believe. Oh, of course, this future is painfully ridiculous and absurdly stupid, but still plausible. Luke Wilson is great as an army guy traveling through time, hopelessly trying to return to a more comfortable time. This story will gain a cult status thanks to numerous funny videos, such as “Can we have her family style” and “Hey, man, I ride here!” This is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary to American society, which seems to be full of pleasure, complacency and stupidity, and I guarantee you that I will buy it on DVD on the very first day when it comes out, and I will see more.
