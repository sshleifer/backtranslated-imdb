I like the films of Brailat, but this is the best I've seen in the balance of animal heat with sexual intelligence. Ann Pario is electric, and the script is terrific - especially considering that he must be filmed on the set of another Braille film. You do not have to agree with her to everything to benefit from it. It made me think a lot about vulnerability and strength. Try to imagine the male director with the openness of Joan - not impossible, but a little stunning. Undeclared sexual undercurrents, which are always present when people get together to do something, are supported here by bright light, but not by cold light.
