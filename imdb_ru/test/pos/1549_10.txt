Back in the 60s, this dark study of Joy, a young proletarian wife, was the beginning of Ken Loach's career, who became one of the most distinguished and respected British directors of all time. By that time I knew very little about Brecht, politics or reality of the poor, and I was struck by the aesthetics of the film, its free style, its strict color cinematography and Joy monologues in front of the camera. I was also very surprised to find that Terence Stamp (who became famous for Billy Budd, Collector and Modesty Blaze) had so little time on the screen. Although Fox of the 20th Century distributed the "Poor Cow" in Panama, Loach did not remain in the mainstream cinema (which this film is unlikely to be), and I lost touch with his films. I just heard about his success "Kes", "Family Life", "Black Jack". until I caught up in the 80s. By the way, Donovan's beautiful title song is available in his collection "The Troubadour".
