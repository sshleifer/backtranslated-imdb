One of the best musical bios. Dennis Morgan is great as singer / composer Chonsi Alkutt. The cast is very good, especially Andrea King as glamorous Lilian Russell. The atmosphere at the turn of the century is the perfect setting. Technicolor is great. Simple plot, but the movie makes you feel good. Morgana has always been underestimated as an actor and singer.
