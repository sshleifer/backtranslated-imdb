Some people think it was a pretty bad show with cheese effects. (considering that this was filmed in 1977-1979), but in fact, let's look back at those years and think: "We did not have computers at that time." so if you think this is a pretty good show. <br /> <br /> I always thought that bad ratings killed the show, but no. network did. they canceled their theme "Network of superheroes" and abandoned the short series "Spiderman". if it continued, it would probably get to the 80s, and if it were really lucky (and I mean really lucky), in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> And no one wanted to choose this series up. <br /> <br /> In any case, the cheerful old (or young) Nicholas Hammond from “The Sound of Music Glory” is presented on the TV screen as Peter Parker, the Secret Person of an Amazing Spider-Man. in the series, Peter deals with a clone, a beautiful girl from another country and a corrupt politician. <br /> <br /> While the series goes beyond the schedule (since Peter has already graduated from university, and that's when he bites a little, and Uncle Ben is already dead). Viewers refer to the action, tensions and attitudes of the characters to Peter and his alter ego, Spiderman. <br /> <br /> Although it is also a little disappointing, that is Robert. F Simon is not at all like JJJameson, it’s not so disappointing that Betty’s grant is not Betty’s grant, but a hot African American girl (which reminds me of Halle Berry, who is one of the hottest women on the planet), so in fact one was not so bad. <br /> <br /> But, given the time and how much drama they have invested in this film, it seems to foretell that today’s bad television. in any case, it is interesting, even today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
