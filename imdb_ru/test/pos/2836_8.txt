This film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of westerns released in the 50s; cavalry in need of protection of the territory from the murderous group of Indians, the officer who decided to perform this task, and people with him with various character flaws, which he must combine into one. This small group should hold up to the fort, located near the Indian village, until reinforcements arrive. Indians are well aware that this small group is under protection and can be destroyed before help comes. One of the main differences of this film, “Only Valiant,” is that he is trying to play the usual storyline, but at the same time convey a message that debt is the primary task that everyone should share, even if they do not accept this is an accusation. <br /> <br /> Gregory Peck embodies the tightly tucked commander of a squad who is supposed to prevent the Indians from entering the territory. The soldiers he takes with him to a small outpost are the garbage of the detachment in the fort; they, in turn, have flaws or weaknesses that make them wonder if their captain took them because of their general lack of commitment. In the end, the captain and the small group confront the enemy, and at the same time each one is confronted with its own shortcoming. The cast includes Western heroes such as Ward Bond, Gig Young, Neville Brand, Lon Cheney, Jr. and Warner Anderson. <br /> <br /> Sleeping film, and a good solid western for fans of this genre.
