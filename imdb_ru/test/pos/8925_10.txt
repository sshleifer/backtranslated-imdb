I am a 55 year old rather exhausted white gay. Since I do not watch TV, I watch at least 250 films a year, most on DVD. I keep records of all the films I see and rate them. Since December 2003, I have watched only five films that have reached the eighties. So, I rated EIGHTEEN better than at least 700 other recent films. Mr. Bell is too modest in his comments on the film. EIGHTEEN is a great movie. And it also led to the two “first” for me. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie for the first time, and I was covered in tears and cried for the past half hour, what happened only with me, three times before. (After five minutes of the film, I knew it would be very good.) When Jason began to read Whitman, I lost it, and then ... Kiss. Well, this is one of the main kisses of the film, and this scene is among the most acute and unforgettable. When Pip blew out the candle at the end and the loans fell out, I clapped my hands. I welcomed. I love happy endings. I cried. <br /> <br /> Then I watched the trailer and the TLA preview and thought, "OK, this is Indiana, 800,000 dollars or so, is it really great?" So, I immediately looked at EIGHT 19TH again, what happened only three times before. And another eighty again tore off my socks, all the more. Then I watched the documentary “Making Eighty” and was completely fascinated by the actors and Mr. Bell. <br /> <br /> So, I thought I'd look at eighty again with the director's comments. I have never watched a movie three times in one night before. The third time, the third time, I realized that I had just watched a great movie; Eighty is now ranked 10th in my top twenty films of all time. And in a very small universe of great gay or gay overtones, there is Brokeback Mountain, EIGHT, Mulholland Drive and Maurice. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Mr. Bell! EIGHTEEN is brilliant and fully realized, with a great cast, an amazingly touching, understated score, excellent cinematography, an interesting, touching, perfectly appropriate and humble song. I can go on, but I won't whip too much. <br /> <br /> This film should have been nominated for an Oscar, certainly for the “Best Picture.” The performances, without exception, were wonderful. Miss Jill's beautiful, sultry voice was an amazing insight. And Sir Ian McKellen? “Nuf said. Awesome <br /> <br /> Eighty is the reason why I make my way through more than 200 mediocre films to absolutely terrible films (some of which cost more than 150 million dollars) a year to find this one treasure, one elegant, magical , unique and charming, the perfect “Faberge egg”, enveloping an unforgettable heart. <br /> <br /> Finally (I promise), my second "first" - I have never before published comments to any movie that I saw. <br /> Thanks again, Mr. Richard Bell! Gripping genius. Give this man $ 100 million for his next movie! He made 700,000 US dollars in one of the 50 best films of all time. If I had the money, I would give him $ 75,000 a year for living expenses and match any funds raised for his next film. Mr. Bell is already a great director at 31. Can you imagine him in 45 years? <br /> <br /> Wise and witty, gentle and cruel, balanced, sharp, reserved, but at the same time sharp, frightening and exciting, bewitching, haunting, unforgettable: EIGHTEEN, DIN.
