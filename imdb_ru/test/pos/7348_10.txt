Oh god, this is really the best show in the world. It's harder than Jackass and CKY, and it's so fun and interesting. I love the show. All 5 seasons are awesome, but for a brief summary: Season 1: - Great, if you want to plan a hunt for scavengers, look at how a house is falling apart, and admire Phil hungry. <br /> <br /> Season 2: - Great if you want to see them buy Castle Bam, see the killers concert, see the miracle that represents Mardi Gras, and enjoy visiting it, see the derby demo and see the creation and opening of the casino Tree Top. <br /> <br /> Season 3: - Great, if you want to see, probably, the first Skatepark Driveway, civil war, Johnny Knoxville, the pirate ship and Don Vito, who actually won one of Bam's deer games. <br /> <br /> Season 4: - Great if you want to see them in Europe, they have jobs, state and city construction and Dudesons 5 season: - Great, if you want to see them in Brazil, it's a birthday monkeys, Mike Valley, The Metal Mulisha Bams Lambo disappears, Bams Hummer collapses, the playboy party in the Bams pool and the latest in the history of Viva La Bam :(
