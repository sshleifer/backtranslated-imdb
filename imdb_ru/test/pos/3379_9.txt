BIG, Chris Diamantopoulos has to be the best Robim Williams I've ever seen ... He describes it perfectly. It was like observing Robim Williams for what he really was. It almost made me cry, watching him. <br /> <br /> I had no idea that Robin was as close a friend of John Belushi as he was. The image of this relationship was very good and almost could be dignity in itself. Very sad that they both survived. <br /> <br /> I really felt like Val, and Robin in his difficult times. I'm glad they finished it in a high note! <br /> <br /> I hope Robin puts a $ 100 bill in this guy's hat !! <br /> <br /> And it was great that it was filmed in Vancouver!
