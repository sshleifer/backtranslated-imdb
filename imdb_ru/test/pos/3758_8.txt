What a surprise. The main imitator of the comedy classic "Nutty Professor", only naughty. Funny guy Tim Tomerson (who steals the series in the role of Blinkin in the movie “Robin Hood-Men in Pantyhose”) is just jolly, like anal restrained Dr. Jekyll and Hyde's insane sex. <br /> <br /> One really funny scene is when Dr. Lannion (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: <br /> <br /> “how dare you use my innocent daughter. "Jekyll <br /> <br /> replies," but, sir, I continue the operation. "<br /> <br /> Lannon replies:" Oh, well, in this case, fu * * your brains !!! "
