Peter Seagal's 1995 commercial hit and now the iconic classic Tommy Boy is a hilarious movie, an evergreen artist. Chris Farley is a talent that we will never forget !!! <br /> <br /> “Tommy Boy” is a simple story told in the most amusing and amazing way. Farley & Spade goes on a journey that is filled with uncontrollable laughter, even a part of Rob Lowa is damn fun. As a child I remember watching 'Tommy Boy' over and over and over. It was my favorite childhood, and always will be. Even today, when it comes to T.V., I stick to him as a devoted fan. I am rather possessive in this film. <br /> <br /> Segal's direction is super. Chris Farley could have died in 1997, but at least he stayed alive for me. What an actor! Look at his work at Tommy Boy, he is so calm. Later, he staged fantastic performances in films such as “Berverly Hills Ninja” and “Almost Heroes”, but his work here remains his best today! Love you, Farley! Spade, on the other hand, is as good as ever. He is a great actor in all respects! <br /> <br /> Tommy Boy rules ... one hundred percent higher than this author!
