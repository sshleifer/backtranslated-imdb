I really liked this movie. My only problem is that I thought the actor playing the villain was Michael Ironside's low rent. Of course, Ironside is just Jack Nicholson's low rent. I think Mike was busy this year with "Highlander 2: The Quickening". Unfortunately, “Beastmaster 2” would be a much better career step. This is by far the best of the Beastmaster series and in many ways resembles this great classic of the “Masters of the Universe” big screen. This is not only the star of the incomparable Mark Singer, but also a great cast, in particular, the second girl from “Sliders”, Uncle Phil from “Fresh Prince Beler” and the angry chicken from “Superman 2” This shocked my world and, of course, is a prerequisite for all who do not have social or physical capabilities. BEASTMASTER FOREVER !!! ROCK'N'ROLL!!!
