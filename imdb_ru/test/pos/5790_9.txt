This documentary was my first introduction to the theory of Peak Oil. A fascinating concept that has a lot of frightening effects if it turns out to be correct. I had no idea that the consequences of the depletion of oil reserves would come so soon that literally took my breath away. This film is likely to open your eyes to how strongly the American way of life depends on the “abundance of cheap oil” - the term used in the film. Many topics are simple common sense, and they in no way go into details. But you probably never put all the pieces together, like in this movie. Interviews with authors and energy experts are very interesting. I don't think this film is meant to scare people. It is simply meant to inform people about what to expect in the coming years, and perhaps encourage you to think twice about going 100 miles to work and leave your light on all day. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I could no longer look at the cars and buses that zoom. Great documentary, everyone should see it.
