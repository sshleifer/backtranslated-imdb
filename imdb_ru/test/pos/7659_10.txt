A beautifully captured, expansive study of Gypsy culture in the context of their music. Travel around the continent, experiencing amazing musical styles of various groups of Gypsy peoples. To be misled by the fact that this film is not told. He is masterly transmitted by the music itself, soaring melodies and texts with subtitles tell the story much better than the narrator. Watch this movie.
