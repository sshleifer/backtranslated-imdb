I really liked this film - the actors were beautiful and suited for their roles. The story itself was wonderful (and the truth was, the setting was perfect, and the message about the personâ€™s reaction to the war, the danger and the risk was exceptional. The person who wrote the musical score also wrote music for Life is Beautiful (another favorite) apparently it was as follows: "... it was not like an English film, it was like an Italian film." I think he is right! Callum Blue is perfect for the role of Eric Newby. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a story that is truthful and moral but inspiring as well as a beautiful love story.
