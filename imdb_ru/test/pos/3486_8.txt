The last film by the underrated director Alberto de Martino (“The Antichrist”, “The Murderer on the Phone”) is a really disturbing, but incomprehensibly forgotten text, containing almost all the trademarks that make this Italian horror genre so gorgeous and exciting. to the fans. There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, fake priests ??), a lot of creepy moments, plot turns left and right, outstanding music and ?? last but not least ?? A handful of truly sadistic murder scenes! Especially the intro sequence, which is a kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror! What is it about ordinary children's dolls that make them so creepy? When an anonymous man dressed as a priest attacked a little girl, and her doll's broken head bounced down the stairs, it really caused a cold shiver in my spine! Years later, a young girl from the prologue is an adult woman attached to a wheelchair. She inherited a lot of money, but uses her wealth to encourage people with disabilities to play sports and maintain a positive attitude. She is ?? Joanna ?? falls in love with her personal trainer, and they immediately marry. Naturally, he is only after her money and begins to terrorize Joanna, forcing her to survive the trauma of childhood, which harmed her. Repeating images of the sinister look of the priest, guided by terrible melodies and children's rhyme, give the Formula for Killing a lot of real fright, and the leadership of Alberto de Martino is very decisive. Acting is quite competent, with David Warbeck ("Beyond the Boundary", "Black Cat") in the glorious role of the greedy villain. Due to some plot holes and lack of originality, this film may not be able to compete with Italy’s best horror films, but it definitely deserves more attention. Many former little-known and unknown Italians received great DVD releases, and hopefully, “The Killing Formula” will soon receive the same treatment. In the meantime, good luck to track down this child!
