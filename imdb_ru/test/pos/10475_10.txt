Some commented that subtitles are not a problem in this film - I’d allow myself to disagree - the inconvenience in facial expressions and subtle interactions between the characters are such that you cannot afford to look away even for a split second to overcome this problem (do not make this mistake, the result is a parody). The only way to get full advantage is to watch it two or three times in a row so you know it, and then ignore the subtitles. A master class in acting is not about dialogue, but about body language. <br /> <br /> These little things - the postmaster / caretaker inflates his chest and enters to take the cap before delivering the letter from France! ! The general's stunned expression, when he admires a bunch of beautiful grapes, evokes a biblical mention with a depth worthy of "Being there." <br /> <br /> The cinematography is awesome, and the gloomy minimalist village with vague color emphasizes the luxury of the holiday when it comes. I have a friend who claims to be descended from the Borgia, and his family motto: “If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing with excess” - Amen. <br /> <br /> every time I laugh out loud and cry every time I watch this movie
