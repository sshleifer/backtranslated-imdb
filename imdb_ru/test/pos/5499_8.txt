In The Line of Fire we are given a great game of cat and mouse. Clint Eastwood is pursued by John Malkovich in this exciting film. Malkovich says he is going to kill the president, and he purposely calls Eastwood and presses the buttons. He questions Eastwoodâ€™s ability to protect someone. Malkovich brings to his character a cold but very clever thinking. Everything he does, he does for a reason, and he does not hesitate to kill. Eastwood must overcome the suspicions of his superiors to catch Malkovich, but no one wants to listen to him. The result is a crackling film from tension that develops into a tense scene in the ballroom at the Bonneventure Hotel. Wolfgang Peterson increases tension, and we feel every turn.
