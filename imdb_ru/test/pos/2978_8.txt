This film captured me from the very beginning, when a pretty teenage girl was shown on one grave, and then Elton John’s powerful Friends started playing her when she was shown alone, walking through the streets of Paris with a suitcase, naively unaware of the theft of a car and prostitution around her. The entire film is a beautiful, dreamy, romantic collection of scenes of young love, holding hands living in the village, wild horses running freely, fields of wildflowers, sunsets, wine toasts, bonfire evenings, fun and general innocence, everything is set to romantic music of Elton John. It is magical. <br /> <br /> For some reason, I missed this film when I was growing up. I am sure it would make a strong impression on me if I saw it then. I remember the radio commercials for the 1971 film, telling about how it was a special film with Elton John's music and with the chorus of the thematic song "Friends" playing in advertising ("Friends of Makin for the whole world to see" ... "), but in those days I didn’t hear anything about it and never saw it until I rented it 35 years later in a video store. By the time it was edited, censored, and all sorts of unhappy people with angry political plans used all sorts of ugly words to describe the film. What can I say? Since then Ohr the world went crazy. <br /> <br /> The fact is that a 14-year-old girl is forced to move to a cousin in Paris after the death of both parents. (It was their grave, which she visited at the opening.) Once, visiting the zoo alone, she meets a 15-year-old boy, they meet him and agree to meet the next day.The next day, riding together, the boy accidentally drove into the lake in a bizarre car accident.It was his father's car, he can not go home , to meet the anger of his father, so two teenagers start living in a French village together, on a mutual background, that they both hate their lives at home. They settle in an unoccupied cottage, the boy takes on odd jobs to support himself, their supposed friendship turns into romance, the girl becomes pregnant, and a child is successfully born at their home. All this time the police are trying to find his missing son from the boy’s father. In the year of the anniversary celebration of the couple, the police finally find the boy's employer through a personal survey and are told that they can see the boy the next morning when he comes to work. The next morning, the boy is shown leaving his house to go to work, sweetly saying goodbye to his girlfriend / wife, and happily making wheels as the scene stops at his girlfriend waving goodbye. At least that is how the video version I saw ends. This is an unexpected though timely finale, apparently depicting the last moments of bliss before the boy is returned to his parents' home, and his happy life with his wife and child is ruined. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as the plot and the images, the plot is terribly unrealistic and very contrived. I think it is better to just enjoy the film, like the fantasy of a young dream that embodies the dream, and not go into analysis, because all logic and likelihood quickly crumble when the story is explored in more detail. Why is a fully furnished and equipped cottage left unattended, and the door does not lock and does not visit for a whole year? What did they plan to do when the owners returned? Why does the girl trust the hijacker enough to get pregnant from him? Did they not think it was unethical to use other people's homes and food? How could they hope to receive the necessary dental care or other emergency medical care while living outside the community? How could a boy get into a car accident on a country road without collisions and without other cars? Where in civilization are there places where wild horses run freely? How is it that a teenage man won't have sex as the main thing when he picks up a girl at the zoo? (The lyrics of Elton John simply do not fit.) Why do they take off their clothes when they sleep at night, when it gets cold? And so on. Scenes of wild horses were designed to appeal to girls, as well as the unrealistic theme of “friendship before the novel”, as well as all scenes with backwash and tickling with their predictable results, running across the flower fields towards each other, scene smoke filters, shot through the wildflowers in the foreground, baby ducks and so on. It works, but it is definitely invented. <br /> <br /> However, this is a film about youth and freedom, and this ideal has not changed since the 1970s. Young people today are still treated as things or as lost pets that the police can return, not as mature people who have the same need for romantic love and freedom as the adult world, as well as the ability to bear responsibility, if freedom. Therefore, the message is universal. It is clear why the sequel did not work: this story is about a magical, year-long respite from the real world. Such a situation could never be extended indefinitely, if we assume that this can happen at all, and in the history of real life there will not be enough magic appeal of such an unreal state of existence. I really hope that no teenager took the film seriously enough to try such a stupid trick. But I also hope that teenagers who were impressed by this film in the 70s learned something from it and have since made attempts to make such a magical world a more achievable reality for others, instead of perpetuating various hate and repression. societies, especially from their children.
