If you want to see a real thriller, rent it !!! This is not from the director or screenwriter Creek, does not include replay, overpayment of TV actors, posing as "stars", and is not a series of bonan special effects. Instead, you get a first-class, sharp, very strong (in violence), but an exciting nail puller.
