In 2000 (keep in mind, this is two years ago, not four), two men had the motivation to create the most wonderful work of art on this side of the Mississippi. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Jere Cunningham and Tom Flynn, the world can now enjoy the delightful Second String TV movie, which tells about a gang of secondary rag rags (hence the name) that end up in a starter position . <br /> <br /> Due to the motivational direction of director Robert Lieberman and last minute QB “Buffalo Bills” Dan “Give them hell” Heller (portrayed by Canadian actor Jill Bellows), often the Super Bowl snake bills find themselves in a limiting position. <br /> <br /> With an intriguing combination of internal and external conflicts, a love story, companionship that only a great football sport can bring, and the general theory that the outsider Second String is a great movie worth watching at any moment when appears on TNT. <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be bad in this production is the spelling of the name of the designer named Jenifur Jarvis. <br /> <br />
