I saw this title again on Shemaroo. I also asked my nephew, who was 17 years old, to look the same with me. I am 35, and he is 17. He liked it, and I, too. It's still fun, a little childish, but still very pure entertainment. Satish Shah oars in many roles. This comedy film will still be better than many of the recent TV shows on television. But obviously, some people obviously like the worldly tariffs that are coming out today. It would be good that Shafi Inamdar would continue all seasons. He is no longer alive today. I would like someone to list all the episodes here. <br /> <br /> Who can forget the lines "Yeh Kya Ho Raha HAi" "What a relief" "Kaat Daalu Boss" "Vyavhaar hai Vyavhaar" "30 years of Ka Experience hai" <br /> <br /> and title the song Yeh Jo hai Zindagi, which teaches us to live as it is and to receive pleasure from it. The life of ordinary people. I still like this comedy series. at times it may not seem so funny, but some episodes are still funny.
