In my opinion, directing, editing, lighting and acting (with the exception of Franco) were very good. I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed by this film. I did not expect much because of the camera angle, sound, etc. But in these places the film was not at all bad. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I was disappointed with both characters. because I so much wanted these two characters to connect with each other. And I felt that the character of Travis (Franco) was not really affected or changed at the end after Terry commits suicide. Although this may be due to the absence or inability of James Franco to express emotions (of any kind) very well in this film. I have seen several other Franco films, and for me he just can't handle it when the scene demands real emotions or facial expressions. The only positive thing he brings to the film is the possibility of more people watching this film. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Rachel Miner in the role of Terry was well made, and she hopes that she will have a bright future. I really could see and feel the sadness and emptiness in her character, and it made me feel her. The only pity is that I could not see more in Terry's life before the film ends. <br /> <br /> This movie was good for a short film, but in the end you want more. I just wish it was a little longer to see how the characters evolve. Despite this, I hope to see more films from the director and film crew in the future. :)
