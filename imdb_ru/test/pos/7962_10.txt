This is, without a doubt, one of the most perfect debut films for any director. The film lasts only 90 minutes, but he manages to tell almost everything about life and death. Not a lot of action, and the dialogue is minimal, but the film flows perfectly and requires your attention because of the surprisingly natural feeling of everything that is happening. Performances with the participation of the presenters are impeccable, and even some heroes play strong emotional scenes. The film will be somewhat lost for the modern modern audience, but this is the film that everyone should see. Surprisingly unsentimental and honest, it is on a par with the works of Ozu. <br /> <br /> Scratch my header, this one is perfect!
