Dan Finnerty and Dan Band are so good that you have to believe it. Does anyone have a copy of Bravo's concert for sale? Please, if there is an upcoming release, let us all know. I checked the Bravo website, but in the future, there are no reruns scheduled for the most attractive guys ever to be choreographed, Dan Band. What a huge energy they exude, entertaining themselves with a nice attitude towards an American guy, based on sensitivity to his cheek wrapped in sparkles and tears, causing men and women to fall in love with them. I hope that a sufficient number of people will be able to influence the forces that will be in Bravo to bring the show back into our life as a semi-annual special offer.
