I agree with the Australian comments for the most part. However, there seems to be a pretty decent plot, albeit a non-original one. Christina (Kelly McCarthy) inherits rural property, which she is going to open in a mountain house. She again meets Chip (Bobby Johnston), whom she knew when she grew up there. The plot gets stronger when James (Paul Logan) arrives with her new friend the stripper, Chenet (Devinn Lane), because Christina was a friend of the stripper James in the intervening years, and it is assumed that James somehow did her wrong. To add interest to the film Sophie Lynn (Monique Parent), a romance novelist appears as a guest in a bed, like Eric (Sebastian Guy) and Linda (Flower), a couple of lawyers from the city. James calls the local inspector the building code for Christina’s affairs as one of his dirty tricks to shut her down. So the question arises: “How far will James go to sabotage the box, and will he succeed?” <br /> <br /> Keep an eye out for Devinn Lane here and in “Devotional Beauty.” It seems that she is moving from a solid core business to the world of "R". Another famous is Samantha McConnell, who plays the role of "Bait", obviously the most outrageous character name in the movies!
