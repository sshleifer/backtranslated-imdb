An astronaut is lost in deep space and discovers that he is traveling through unknown territory aboard a living spacecraft, accompanied by a group of alien criminals. This incredible plot and enjoyable TV game becomes a positive fantasy about birth. Individual characters who come into conflict at the beginning of the series must learn to get along with each other and finally turn into a powerful group. Most of the action takes place in the womb of Moya, the living spacecraft (which even gets pregnant and gives birth to another ship!). While sci-fi stories are usually interested in negative birth fantasies (see, for example, “Aliens”, especially the fourth part “Resurrection”), this comes as a surprise. Also pleasant is the absence of a military hierarchy aboard the ship and a positive attitude towards sex and the human (and alien) body. One of the female characters, who is actually a plant, experiences “photogasmas” when exposed to sunlight. The crew even have to go to the toilet. Wouldn't it be impossible in Star Trek?
