This is a film that is much nicer than one might expect from its rating of 7. In many ways, this is similar to the VALLEY OF THE DOLLS of the 50s - most of the VALLEY extravagance and slovenliness is a bit corrected for 1959 viewers. Like this later film, both talk about three young ladies who are on the fast track to success - although this time he is in the publishing world and not in the entertainment industry (although one of the women in The Best of All has a desire to Broadway). <br /> <br /> The film begins with Hopefully, Lange will come to the company on her first working day. She is nominated for boss Joan Crawford, who appears in her first supporting role in decades. Despite being disgusted with Crawford, Lange is determined not to give up - to cope with this job. And over time, she quickly moves into the ranks from the secretary to the editor. At the same time, her two new roommates are also trying to move up - one through the stage and one through a relationship with a rich playboy. As in the Valley of the Dolls, each of them has its ups and downs (mostly falls), but by the end of the film there is some hope that at least some of them will do it - beaten and beaten, nevertheless. <br /> <br /> In this film, men are mostly pigs. The only guy who looks decent is played by Stephen Boyd, so, naturally, Hope Lange neglects him, because the former guy does not succeed. As for the guys played by veteran actor Brian Ahern and the rest, they are sexist scum, and in the end you understand how Crawford became so bitter and nasty. <br /> <br /> This film has everything - adultery, premarital sex, abortion, etc., and, of course, is not an artistic triumph. Nevertheless, thanks to the excellent production performance and juicy scenario, this film is a pleasure to watch. Just do not wait for Shakespeare !!
