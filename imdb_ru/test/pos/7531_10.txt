Watching this film, I can not help but compare it with "Wild Reeds", another thoughtful film about adult teens. <br /> <br /> Like Wild Reeds, this film is slow and the director is not in a hurry. So, if you need a quick decision, don't watch it. This film is like a piece of life, starting imperfectly and ending imperfectly. For no one has permission, for anyone happiness, as in real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is as real as possible. The game is surprisingly good. The director loves long, very long shots, and the actors and actresses succeed in displaying subtlety and inner thoughts. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. I hardly watched it, but now I am very glad that I did. This is not a movie for everyone, but if you want it to grow on you, you will be rewarded. <br /> <br /> 10/10
