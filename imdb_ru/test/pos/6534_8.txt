Although I am a bit older than the recommended age group, I really liked this movie. This is a small separation from reality, and every little girl must be dreaming of making friends with a pop star. I know it was mine to be sure! The first 10 minutes were very funny, and the vile girls said a few things that were a little funny too. Once you get over it, you can really start enjoying it. I liked the relationship between JD and Jane - they were very cute, and you could see how much they began to love each other. The soundtrack is perfect and fits very well with the film. I also liked the family created for Jane, her sisters seemed beautiful. Very well made movie.
