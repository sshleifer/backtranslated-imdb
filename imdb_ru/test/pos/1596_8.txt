The greatest tragedy that man faces is that he, so often capable of the divine, accepts banality. From this fact comes so many great tragedies. "Death in Venice" - one of the few films in which patience and courage solve this problem in the literal sense of the word. It confronts the human eye with beauty and inspiration in their two most inevitable human forms - self-denial and decay. Undoubtedly, this is the greatest film that has not had a noticeable influence on the main cinema. His strict, sophisticated appearance, echoes of sound, a mixture of unconfirmed languages ​​and complex themes cannot be copied: this is both a coincidence of his original production and the vision of his director. The central performance, simultaneously tough, excited and vulnerable in the face of expression and decline, highlights Bogard as if not the best British actor of his generation, then, of course, the most adventurous. Able to keep sympathy, as his desires capture him and are interesting despite the endless close-ups and the account of Mahler playing above him. Not one Friday night with your girlfriend, but certainly nice if you want to explore the limits of human spiritual limitations.
