This film is basically a parody of Hitchcock's strangers on the train, which, I thought, was still overestimated. In the story, Danny DeVito is going to see strangers, and then she thinks that Billy Crystal wants them to exchange murders, so that Crystal will kill his mother, and DeVito - his wife. Both Devito and Crystal are as magnificent as Mother Devito. This is Devito's directorial debut, and it's better than the Rose War.
