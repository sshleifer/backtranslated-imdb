Instead of watching the revised Pearl Harbor story, in which nothing new is revealed, with the exception of a few real events involving several people, so that the filmmakers can say that they contributed to the distribution of the story along with CGI. explosions that fill the juicy romantic triangle. We must see the dark blue world. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in the historical time of the Second World War, when Czech pilots left their homeland and went to fight for the Air Force instead of laying down their arms and surrendering to the Nazis. It was part of a story that needs to be told to the outside world at least once. A love triangle arises between the main characters, but one of them dies not as comfortably as in Pearl Harbor, but from the sacrifice for true friendship. The film is a tragedy after a tragedy, even with a not bitterly sweet ending, when our hero does not enjoy the glory of returning his country, returning love to his present lover, returning love to a reunited lover or even returning unconditional love to his long time favorite. His heart is broken and he doesnâ€™t feel worse in a Russian labor camp. Such an ending is that Hollywood would probably change if it were their script. <br /> <br /> The film sometimes plays on sentimental, but also shows the humanity of people. Overall, a decent film.
