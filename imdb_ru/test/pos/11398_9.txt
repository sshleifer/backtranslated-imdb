Boogie Nights are full of surprises, nothing prepares them for the soul. Yes, he has a soul, while he solves the most difficult topics, with a wry smile and respect. A brilliant cast and remarkable character development, the performances somehow combine the best of stage skills with improvisation in the style of cinematic style. <br /> <br /> The plot turned out to be richer than I expected, and the main themes are revealed quite deeply, as each Human Being of category “B”, through crisis, falls into perspective. <br /> <br /> A situational study of a sociologist’s dream, the film reflects the harsh truth that we all know about self-esteem, parental love and the absence of it, attention / love deficit and its manifestation in adulthood, the desperate need to belong. Here everyone will find something for themselves ... almost disguised as untouchables and their separate environment, but, of course, they are universal. <br /> <br /> The film works on several levels. The ironic loop is that the environment depicted exists only thanks to the voyeur who, as it turned out, is watching the movie ... <br /> <br /> Boogie nights do not judge the subject and characters, this is rare. He deserves every reward and much more.
