Speaking radio, of course, is probably not the most famous of Stone’s films, but don’t let it alienate you, this film is ripe for discovery, I’m challenging anyone who’s not fascinated by it. Along with the best cinema performance of the 80s by Eric Bogosyan, for me (along with JFK) this remains Stone's best moment. It seems that Stone these days did not really comment on this and did not make director's comments on DVD, like all his other films. Stone has nothing to be ashamed of; most directors would kill to take a picture in such a film. <br /> <br /> The studio’s claustrophobia is intense, and Champlain’s opinion is still a very important argument to date. Speech "legalize all drugs" is very strong, and you can agree with him. In my opinion, the film is about freedom of speech and how people sometimes do not like to hear what they disagree with. Speeches and conversations with listeners are very convincing, even worried, a chill ran through my spine when a madman called Champlain, saying he had to rape again, because the city was driving him crazy, just shocking. of course, Champlain is not doing himself a favor by ridiculing him. Champlain (or, I must say, Bogosyan) fearless in films and performances, completely mesmerizing, th Bogosians shame another important role was the villain in Under Siege 2 (dear god !!) One scene that didn’t ring true, was when Boss Barry Dan (Alec Baldwin) makes him calm down, Barry does not seem to be one of those people who fall silent and do what he is told, it looked a bit far-fetched and cliche. Scenes outside the studio are criticized for being too formal; this is true, because Stone is trying to make the film more cinematic and let the viewer see the beginning of the Champlains, but this does not quite work. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliantly cinematic film with extreme close-ups, deep focus, incredibly fast cuts, a fantastic set of 360, which is used for the final exciting monologue. You need to watch a movie, it makes it rare, because it was ignored at the time, but now it is again receiving the attention it deserves so deservedly. Classics should be studied by generations of filmmakers. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 for the ingenious use of “Bad To The Bone” in front of T2, a brilliant cast, including John McGinley (Dr. Cox from the Scrubs) as the grubby Stu, Leslie Hope (24) as the Champlains girlfriend , John Pankov and Alec Baldwin as costumes, and Michael Wincott, who plays three roles (a very underrated actor), tension between listeners and Champlain, which is very heartbreaking @ once and, of course, thank the stars Bogosyan and Stone for such a fantastic piece of cinema. Enjoy!
