This film strikes the heart with a reality I have never seen. This shows that to us, that we, in a democratic society, take for granted, and that we are fortunate not to experience. The acting in the movie is great, sometimes you have to remind yourself that the movie is a drama, not a real life. Mr. Rickman does wonders with his role (as he does with all roles), making the investigator fully dimensional and human. The set is incredible. This gives a feeling of “in the round” theater. Which does not add or remove emotions from action. This film seeks to open the eyes of the viewer, and I would say that they have succeeded in this goal,
