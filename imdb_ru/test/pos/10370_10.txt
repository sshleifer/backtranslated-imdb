By the time we see Monica Dolan (in a truly ingenious film), she is delightfully amused, as Cora has already hooked us at an early stage, but only later she reveals herself in her amazing screen creation, that crazy, intrigue Angry Queen of murder and deception, posing posing as anxious Miss Gilchrist, that she not only effortlessly steals the whole telemedia for herself, but also simply amazes everyone who approaches her, including very well-measured David Suchet, who himself seems to be a little blind taneous and acting talent, very gentlemanly, allows it to occupy a central place. Dolan is the real driving force of the film, and her Miss Gilchrist is Christie’s really well-rounded character, assisted by a juicy script and a cheerful direction — as well as the rest of the cast, led by Geraldine James and Dominic Jefcott, who all show signs of sympathy for This material and play with pleasure. <br /> <br /> Production performance, as usual, are at the proper level, and if there are any weaker connections, they can be located in a relatively poor-quality musical score for most of the later poarots, and also, perhaps, due to the lack of a real Italian actor for the role of Cora's husband. In addition, it is one and a half hours of pure television pleasure, which is as much indulging and entertaining as it is connected with love.
