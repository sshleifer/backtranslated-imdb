... the world may never know. (The film, which filmed "the best animated short Oscar" of that year, "Anna and Bella" is very good, but it is not "Big Nyuka." Both are available in the Expanded Entertainment compilation "The Greatest Animation of the World", in case to compare.) <br /> <br /> Snit and its director Richard Kondi attracted so much attention that I had nothing to add. However, I would like to point out that the film contains one of my favorite singles in the “short film,” in which a man opens the door to release a cat. I do not want to give the actual events depicted here, but the first time I saw this shot, I jumped from one mood to another, and then after a few seconds to another. This shot has never had such an effect on me since. For this shot and for how Condi accumulates this set of moments, “Big Portion” deserves a “masterpiece” tag.
