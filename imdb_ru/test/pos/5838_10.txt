For 51 years, I watched TV a lot, but I never had so much fun every week as I watched Oz. The cast of the entire cast was excellent. The letter was just perfect, each character remained unchanged for six years. I also enjoyed chaos and ultra-violence. It may sound strange, but sometimes it was funny to find out how one of the characters would eventually die. I especially liked the real romance and love between Beecher and Keller. These two really knew how to quit, in all possible ways. I sincerely hope that HBO will continue to show us replays of this great show FOREVER! I watched every episode at least 4 times, but I'm still looking forward to Tuesday and Thursday evening at 11 o'clock in the evening. for an episode of this fun and very interesting show.
