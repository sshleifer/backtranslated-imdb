Sri Lanka ... not the country I have ever thought about, I have to admit. I did not even know that this was near India, not to mention the fact that since 1983 there has been a bloody civil war. It seems that the rebels from the Tamil minority are in constant conflict with the military regime that governs the country. over the years, leading to death and the many suffering on the island. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratman’s latest film, Peck on the Cheek, tells the story of a young girl named Amudha, who is separated from her Sri Lanka. parents to war and brought up by a young Indian couple. Amudha is a bright and mischievous girl whose life has been turned upside down when her parents tell her that she was adopted in childhood. Although her adoptive parents love her as much as they can and raise her without harming their biological children, Amudha cannot help but want to know more about her biological family. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratman is probably best known for his 1998 film DIL SE, in which the story of terrorism and politics is hidden in a love story (or vice versa?). Peck on the cheek lives in a similar area, but perhaps more ambitious in the soil it covers. The central theme of the film is love between all members of the family, especially between the child and her adoptive parents. This is a fairly honest and open view of feelings that can be very touching and warming in some cases and rather painful in others. This is an emotionally complex film with characters that are somewhat idealized, but still behave very humanly. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the 9-year-old Amudh, played by the charming and lively young actress PS Keerthana in her first and only acting role. She is a princess and a monster, always in trouble, but so disarmingly charming that no one can be angry at her for a long time. The young actress is perfect for this role and does an enormous amount of work in the various and often complex emotional scenes that are required of her. <br /> <br /> PEAK ON CHECK has an innocent name for which I was completely unprepared for the intensity of the experience. I would never say that such a small act had such a huge emotional impact. The film is a bold and creative attempt to explore problems that are not often highlighted on a silver screen. <br /> <br /> The direction of Manyi Ratman is excellent, very confident and mature - the most difficult work that I have seen from this director yet. The film is visually very stylish, with excellent camera work and images. A.R. Rahman provides a movie soundtrack that is not as good as his classical music DIL SE or BOMBAY (at least based on first impressions), but still shows his great musical talent. <br /> <br /> There is no DVD release for the film yet - I saw it in Tamil with English subtitles thanks to the San Francisco International Film Festival, the film was undoubtedly the highlight. Staging is truly a world-class job, and I’m sure it will be popular with Western audiences as it begins to get more widespread. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
