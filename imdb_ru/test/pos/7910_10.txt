Finally, I discovered what I thought I remembered when I was four years old. After watching the color version of 1960 on VHS, I continued to say that I remembered that I had seen it in black and white 2 times earlier. Now IMDb helped me find out the truth that it was broadcast twice (2 performances) in black and white for 2 successful years, 1955 and 56. These are the ones that I remember best when I was four years old. I did not realize that the 56th broadcast was not the same as the 55th. In 1960, I was 9 years old, and the color rendition is simply not for me. The black and white version was gorgeous with as much trepidation and amazing impact as modern high-tech films, even without any computer effects. You should have been there! Please comment if you had a similar reaction to the b / w version.
