I first saw Otto Preminger's Porgy and Bess discovery on TV, perhaps in the early 80s, and my young one, I thought it was a little slow, despite the eternal music. I turned it off. <br /> <br /> Last night, the extremely rare, cobblestone-printed print shown in LA’s cinematheque was something of a revelation. The performances are strong and memorable. Dorothy Dandridge bears most of the vulnerability, strength and subtle (at least by today's standards) eroticism. Sidney Poitier is said to be uncomfortable with the film, but his performance is amazing, like Pearl Bailey. Even better, Sammy Davis is like the immoral, cat-like Sportin 'Life and Brock Peters as the evil hooligan Crown. <br /> <br /> However, I am not a fan of the early, lead Preminger - and it’s much easier to watch - “Carmen Jones”. "Porgy and Bess" is far superior to this less controversial film, although perhaps this is due to the fact that the source material is also much better. <br /> <br /> As seen last night, this is a solid, but far from ideal job. Not all moments fully come to life, and there is some awkwardness in how the film blends the clearly styled Catfish Row set (beautifully done by Oliver Smith) with real locations. In addition, even to my rather untrained ear, some short pieces of the score seem to be unreasonably popular. <br /> <br /> Moreover, although this does not detract from the achievements of cinematographers - Preminger's decision to shoot almost completely in wide frames, without close ups and random medium shots, no doubt, made it inaccessible for viewing on TV And can even doom it to widescreen DVDs if it gets the recovery it deserves. On smaller screens, we will not be able to make out many of the details that are crucial to how Preminger put the film. <br /> <br /> Also, we heard last night was strange. Many of the vocals, especially in the debut of "Summertime", seemed overly soft and were impressed with instrumental music. Perhaps this can be fixed in the restoration. <br /> <br /> There is the issue of film racial politics. Personally, I do not see anything bad in this, at least in the modern context. At a time when so few films portrayed strong African American characters, this might have seemed like an unfortunate choice for a high-budget Hollywood movie. And although there may not be so many “opportunities,” these are recognizable people who are not racial stereotypes. These are opera characters who make the wrong choice, because that's what tragic characters do. This alone made it a giant step forward at that time. <br /> <br /> In the modern context, when strong and heroic African-American characters are less common (although still not common enough), these characters seem no more and no less than human. They can really be poor and uneducated people of any ethnic origin. <br /> <br /> In addition to challenging policies, the original work is undoubtedly one of the truly great achievements of American music and (secondarily) theater. Poitiers, Davis, Dandridge, Peters and, yes, Pearl Bailey, were amazing performers that we will never see again. This is not quite perfect, but still durable film clearly deserves to be seen and appreciated.
