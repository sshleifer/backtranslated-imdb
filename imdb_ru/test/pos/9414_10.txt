I use "Princess Raccoon" (to give the film a not quite accurate title in English) as a litmus test for my friends' sense of humor. It either leaves them cold and bewildered - as several other commentators on this site have obviously made - or leads to double laughter, invariably huge grins and occasional sighs of admiration. <br /> <br /> Laughter emanates from the movie Unsurpassed Mix of Parodies in Contemporary Style. Goals include a bunch of forms of Japanese and Western classical theatrical drama, from kabuki to late Shakespearean and Spanish renaissance Christian fantasy; heaped void of contemporary American and European musicals, testifying to the multitude of random songs in the style of tap and rap dance and some very funny banal texts, choreography with loving “amateur” cliches; Japanese clichés with anime and samurai; significant Buddhist ritual; and excessive sweetness of the Viennese operetta. I have not laughed so loudly at this type of film since the time of Ken Russell’s outrageous musical deconstruction in The Guy. <br /> <br /> The grin comes from a clever text subversion of a Japanese legend narrated into a traditional structure of 5 acts, reminiscent of 17th-century master Tikamatsu’s plays. As in his work, the story is promoted in a mixture of song, recitative, loud poetry and weak comedic relief - here the heat of the incompetent Ostrich ninja from peasants boils under the illusion that he is a tanuki raccoon in human form. All of this is somehow connected with another, and even more surprisingly, manages to attract the observer's emotions through many cultural references. <br /> <br /> In truth, “Princess Raccoon” wears her pan-cultural outfit with charming ease, and it is here that sighs of surprise. Visually - again, as in the case of Russell's masterpiece - the film is a pleasure, a riot of color with its digitized backgrounds of classic Japanese screen imagery and prints, luxurious costumes and scene sets, mixed with some breathtaking sequences of live action in summer fields and coasts. You will love it or hate it, but there is no point in criticizing chalk for being cheese; and "Princess Raccoon" acts, first of all, as viciously, and also gently suppresses our modern cultural emptiness, both in the East and in the West. Bravo!
