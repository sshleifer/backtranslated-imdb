I finally managed to get a copy of the Opera Dario Argento, and I tell you ... it was on time !! It was the last Argento film that I have not seen yet, and I am a fan of most of his work. I believe that most of his work is extremely important for the horror genre, but some of his films tend to disappoint (for example, phenomena). But Opera always liked the plot idea of ​​me, and it turns out I was right !! I enjoyed every shot in Opera, and I was fascinated by this film from the first minute to the last. Of all the films, Argento Opera came out on top right away, and I hope that I can get more people to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Opera’s scenario and plot idea is quite simple. Especially compared to the previous Argento Phenomena film, which had too many ideas and ended up in a mess. a satirical commentary — almost a deception — against opponents of sheer violence. *** SPOILERS *** A young opera singer (the magnificent Christina Marsillah) is being chased by a terribly sadistic murderer. During each slaughter he does, he forces Betty to watch his actions with wide eyes. Needles are attached to her eyelids, and when she covers them, they are torn to pieces. *** END OF SPOILERS ***. To this simple - but effective - idea, Argento adds many horrific elements, such as the crows, the classic play (and the curse) of MacBeth, as well as the atmospheric layout of the opera house and music. Especially the presence of creepy ravens has added value. Ancient masters such as Edgar Allen Poe already knew that there are many secrets around these black birds, and Dario Argento also knows this. <br /> <br /> Violence and blood are very well represented in the Opera, and this is what makes this picture of Argento real. His best, in my opinion, with Profondo Rosso as a close second. I certainly hope to recommend this film to many of you. Especially for fans of the (Italian) horror business, it is absolutely necessary! Favorite scene “Rewind”: Argento shows her visual talent best of all in the scene where Betty's friend gets a shot in the eye while she tries to see who is in front of the door.
