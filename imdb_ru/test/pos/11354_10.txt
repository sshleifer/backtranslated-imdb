In the 1960s, in Hong Kong, a man and a woman move to neighboring apartments with their respective spouses on the same day. Soon they suspect their ever-absent spouses that they had an affair with each other. A strange relationship arises between a man and a woman when they cope with their sadness, taking turns playing each other's spouse, before a more complex relationship arises ... <br /> <br /> No resume can do it right for Hong Kong The author of the book Wong Kar-Wai "In the mood for love" is nothing but a miracle. The story of sadness, which can be touching and sometimes funny. A novel that never feels compelled or fake. Without a doubt, the director's method is largely related to this. <br /> <br /> Directed from a non-existent script (although the concept largely derives from the Japanese story) in favor of improvisation, the film immediately highlights the freshness of his performances. The whole movie revolves around this, and the rest is pure improvement. The film is based on two characters that will penetrate your heart and stay there for a long time after the end of the credits: Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are simply amazing, and not a single language barrier undermines any fragment of immediacy and truth that they represent. Additional material is also top-notch: the films are simply gorgeous (partially made by Christopher Doyle from Hero) and the music is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> This is something that everyone should see, if only because it is the most cordial, mature and genuine “love story”. Unmissable.
