Ponyo At The Cliff, made in beautiful colors of watercolor, certainly a sight, vaguely recalling the trailer, because I did not find it impressive, I was surprised at how beautiful and detailed it was. This film has just filled me with its purity. <br /> <br /> In the center is a young boy who comes into contact with a sea creature and his relationship, which carry the film. Miyazaki is a master both in creating memorable images and in demonstrating how young people interact plausibly with their small, intact quirks. <br /> <br /> There are several parts I didn’t like. It would be an understatement to say that music during a certain scene “resembled” Ride Of The Valkyrians is a shame, because such a precious film like this one cannot afford to take the liberty and damage the otherwise truly magnificent scene. The antagonist and his backstory also never interested me, but I think that this served more as a background than anything else. <br /> <br /> Anyway, great movie. I think the scenario of traveling in a boat with all its images and sea creatures. Pure and magical. And yes, handicraft is more intimate than computer animation, I am now really interested in Princes and the Frog.
