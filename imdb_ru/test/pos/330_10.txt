Honestly, I do not speak Tamil and did not understand the film. My good Tamil friend, Kaneswaran Kumarswamypillai (wow, what a long name) explained everything to me. What a great movie !!! After watching this film, I felt that I had to watch many more films from Tolil Film (Tamil Film Industry). The scenes of the war were amazing, the camera work is excellent, the plot is beautiful. Actress "Simran", what a beauty. Give her a reward for the best look of someone. Dean, Dean, Dean, let me smell the winner of OSCAR. I did not understand the songs, but they were excellent. Mani Ratnam is a great director, and I hope that his next film was a success.
