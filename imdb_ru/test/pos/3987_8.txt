Containing Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure, unexpectedly for Billy Crystal. In this film, various tears, dramatic, serious plots (especially with the scene with Stephen Seagal). This film was both interesting and serious, a film about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, friendship and values ​​with an added dose of humor, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy is not always maintained, as with the new classic genre of this type, but the real idea and motivation for this film remains firm. The discovery of a talented intelligence man / agent Billy Crystal in Romania about a giant man is revealing, and the behind-the-scenes look at the film agent is amazing. However, the emphasis remains on the sensitive bonds of love and knowledge about oneself. Eight out of ten stars.
