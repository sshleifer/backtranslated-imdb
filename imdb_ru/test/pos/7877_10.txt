Oh, man, this movie is amazing. This is very good, this is a story about a man who doesn’t accept black people very much, he sits in a bar, drinks in the evenings, and he runs around hippies who are against the war, and Blacks and hippies do not deserve any welfare checks. This film is very realistic, because it depicts the guy "Joe", who represented a lot of guys then and now and now. The story goes like this ... Joe at the bar and talks to a rich guy who just accidentally killed his hippie daughter's guy. And this rich man goes to the bar to rethink what he just did, and while he does, “Joe” shouts about hippies and people who are against the war. A rich guy accidentally tells Joe that he killed a hippie; and obviously Joe applauds the rich guy, Because Joe hates hippies, Awesome movie, watch it to see what happens next. I liked this film because it looked like those days in the early 70s, I liked how they made films then, very good things, it doesn’t look like today's films. In fact, the film gives you an inner look in the head of the main character "Joe". I like the theme of the film ....... about a working man who breaks his ass trying to make a living
