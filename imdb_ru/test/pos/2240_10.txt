I would like to point out these wonderful moments in favor of this film: <br /> <br /> # 1 Angelina Jolie's sex scene <br /> <br /> # 2 actress Foley surpassed herself <br /> <br /> # 3 the plot was pretty thick <br /> <br /> # 4 DVD includes trailers and stop heads <br /> <br /> # 5 when making the film no harm was done to the animals <br /> <br /> # 6 pay respect to the blade runner through the film <br /> <br /> # 7 burning trash cans <br /> <br /> # 8 funny guy without legs <br /> <br /> # 9 Speaking by Jack Palance added to film is a real dynamic element. <br /> <br /> # 10 The sage will advise, for example, "When you are having dinner with the devil, bring a long spoon." <br /> <br /> # 11 Angelina Jolie was only 18 years old! <br /> <br /> To summarize: an evening of entertainment was organized.
