I rented this film because it was a documentary and highly acclaimed. This is more a study of a bastard son trying to figure out who his biological father was than anything about architecture. <br /> <br /> Most of all, the film is based on the fact that we have an eccentric, highly praised, perhaps a brilliant architect who cared little about something or someone who was not outside this is a profession. <br /> <br /> The tragedy of the film is the broken families he left behind. His little mothers met more as despicable fans than irresponsible women, which can only have negative consequences for children. <br /> <br /> With this, Nathaniel, the filmâ€™s producer and son of Louis Khan, was faced with how rather steady and curious, if not bitter. The people he interviewed were, of course, more interested in talking about the buildings of Louis Khan than about his personal problems, but I find that the combination of topics makes the film interesting. <br /> <br /> As for his buildings, I found them abstract. Art is strange, impractical, and is usually appreciated only by so-called critics.
