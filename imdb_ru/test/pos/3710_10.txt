Although it was a film lasting less than forty minutes, this is one of the best directorial and played stories I've ever seen. This gives in less than 45 minutes what most films cannot do in more than 90. <br /> <br /> This is the story of two brothers, one 18 and the other 10. They are from a poor farming family in Mississippi. Both were embroiled in war and the conflict of duty, and the love of family. <br /> <br /> This caused tears in the eyes, especially because the entire film was shot and directed so well, plus tells the story of many wars, where one serves and the other is left behind. <br /> <br /> I can fully recommend this film as excellent!
