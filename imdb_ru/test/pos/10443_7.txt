This film was released when I was 15 years old, and I could easily relate to the themes depicted in the film. <br /> <br /> This was over 24 years ago, and since then I have not seen this film. This time I cringe in some acting games, but I still appreciate the film for what it is. <br /> <br /> Life is not always fair, and good guys do not always win, in fact, I think the film was a success to reflect this, especially during adolescence, injections always succeeded with many girls. It also doesn't matter how good you are, you can't make someone like you. Girls / boys like who likes them no matter how hard you try otherwise. Sometimes you just need to let go and say the following. <br /> <br /> Gary clearly shows his tensions with Karen. This is so true of teens when they are fixating on someone. <br /> <br /> I remember sitting with my buddies, laughing at our asses over some antics. The action is not quite there compared to the Fast Times in Ridgemouth High, but it is straining at this film simply because FTARH has a bad ending for the audience, because this movie has a realistic ending. Cute guys finish last !! Gary looks like a material worthy of lame pranks, but we all know guys who are far from sensitive. We all know David, the funny guy who makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> Some people end the ending here, but hello to the finale exactly what can happen in real life. Some chicks simply return to more, no matter how bad the dude treats them, especially at this age. I experienced it on my own experience. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack !! U2 "I will follow" - Jesus, is it so old ??
