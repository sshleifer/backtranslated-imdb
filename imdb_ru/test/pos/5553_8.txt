This is a great romantic comedy about love, work, self-indulgence and middle age crises. The main character is a talented filmmaker who decides to make a stupid PG-13 film in order to get out of the situation with the IRS. He has an excellent cast, a wide range of humor (from the deadpan to the farce) and excellent writing. This is also a curve advertising film industry. The meta comment includes several distinct lines between reality and the film that is being shot, and in some places the film is different from strict realism. The result is a multi-dimensional masterpiece of humor in the middle of life.
