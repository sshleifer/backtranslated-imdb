Michael Jackson is awesome. This short film demonstrates the absolute highest standard in a music video, and no one will ever be able to surpass this masterpiece of “King Of Pop”! This shows that Michael is turning into a zombie and dancing on the street with some kind of exciting choreography. The story is wonderful, the scenes are wonderful, the music is fantastic, and on the whole the clip is hilarious, stunning, eerie and a real sight. Today, everyone still does the same thing in a music video with dance and film-based storylines that he invented. This revolutionary video is MTV's toast and will forever be remembered for being the best music video of all time !!
