First of all, I want to say that Ang Lee did a very good job on this! I watched it yesterday, and at the moment I was surprised. The story is very good, but all the ignorant people say: “It sucks, people can't fly!” I tell them that this is fiction and that it is. It should not be perceived as a film about reality; one can say that it is a “fairy tale”. And it is very nice to watch an Asian fairy tale. The image can actually blow your mind. Because it is so artistically filmed there, Ang Lee has a very (underestimated, one might say, great) talent. The scene of the battle is very cool and beautifully presented to the viewer. But it is sad, but this film did not receive the assessment that was supposed to receive. But Ang Lee, fortunately, attracted the attention he deserved by his blockbuster breaking the mountain. So even for viewers who are not interested in history, the images are quite interesting!
