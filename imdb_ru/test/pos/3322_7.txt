These working girls go to hell, soap is a candidate for time capsules, thanks to his impeccable physical production, the costume of the 50s (look at all these bows and pearls), the creamy theme of the song Johnny Mathis and about so bold (for its time) sexual relationship. Rona Jaffe's novel, on which the film is based, continues to be reprinted, and just a few years ago, Vanity Fair actually dedicated an article to this exciting film. Look at the new DVD program and you will understand why. <br /> <br /> The three main characters - Hope Lange, Diane Baker and Susie Parker - repeat the girls from the movie "How To Marry a Millionaire" or Carrie Bradshaw and her friends from "Sex and the City." “Gentlemen's singers are in the thick of fun ...” Their romantic adventures and sexual confusions are a paperback passion thing: empty calories from caramel corn, devoid of food, cannot be resisted by having a snack. Lange is genuinely touching in her image of neo-Grace Kelly, Baker is truly vague and idealistic, like a timid virgin who (chokes) is knocked off (hissing) by Cad. It is helped by the fact that Robert Evans, a grouper, tycoon sniffing coke, who undoubtedly led many innocent young lambs to the slaughterhouse in his bedroom in Beverly Hills, plays the role of father. <br /> <br /> Suzy Parker is charming in the first half of the film, all heedless self-confidence and knowledgeable remarks. She scatters her belongings in a big fashion icon, which she was in the 50s. Alas, she is not up to the place where the film sends her: in madness and obsession. But she exudes glamor and rage, and her game, at least, is adequate. Someone wonders why critics hated her, actually pushing her out of the cinema in a few years. Perhaps a detached attitude from a good-looking woman is too much to endure. This drowned Ali McGraw’s career a generation later, and if you think about it, Ali McGraw and Susie Parker were mostly the same actress. <br /> <br /> The only major drawback of the film is a weak end. In the end, she pretty much collapses into a romantic swoon, rather than turning into a melodramatic finale, similar to another famous soap opera from producer Jerry Wald Peyton Place, in which Lana Turner cried and gnashed her teeth during rape. trial. Here, Hope Lange goes to the pavement in New York, the spots are big, forever hanging (but now, of course, sober) Stephen Boyd, and they just go together ... into the sunset, you can assume. Otherwise, this is largely a definition of guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah ... there is also Joan Crawford, who breathes the fire of all the young girls and smokes cigarettes while she hisses at her married lover over the Phone. And the names are made in a bright pink color with an inscription on a tape that resembles an advertisement of a department store of the late 50s. Do not miss!
