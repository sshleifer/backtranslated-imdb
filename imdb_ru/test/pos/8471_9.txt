I do not say anything new when I say that “Ray” was great. Continuing to praise this film, I must mention something that sets it apart from other films. Very rarely is this a film made entirely by actor (s). “Ray” quite simply made by Jamie Foxx. Without Jamie Fox's wonderful performance, “Ray” would be just another interesting and informative biopic. I always thought that Fox was funny, flowing from his days with "In Livin 'Color" and "The Jamie Foxx Show", and I also knew that he was talented because he used his own show ("The Jamie Foxx Show ") To show your musical talents. But I never thought that he could play such a role. I don’t know much about acting and what they’re going through to get into character or other such things, but what I saw from Jamie Foxx was extremely impressive. He was in that role and made us see Ray Charles, not the actor portraying Ray Charles. Yes, the story with “Ray” was great, but it was revived by Jamie Foxx.
