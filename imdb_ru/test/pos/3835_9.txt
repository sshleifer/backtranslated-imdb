When the Romulans come, they will not bear the gifts; no, they bring war with them - war and conquest. As is known to anyone familiar with this episode, this is an unnecessary war film “The Enemy Below” of the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American destroyer and a German submarine) participating in the deadly war games, these are two space ships in open space. In the history of Trek, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, the Earth fought in the Romulan Wars. After 5 years of conflict, a dead end led to the conclusion of a treaty and the creation of a neutral zone, the border between us and the empire of Romulan. Now, on this occasion, the treaty seems to be violated, because our outposts are attacked and destroyed by some weapon of great strength. Yes, the Romulans returned to test their new military toy, and Kirk must now earn his salary: he must make decisions that affect this sector of the galaxy, for example, figure out how to avoid ... oh, I don't know ... maybe be interstellar war? <br /> <br /> I think this episode is so effective that it does not shy away from the grim aspects of war, as one would expect from a simple television episode of the sixties, especially an episode from science. art show. It's all very tense and exciting, like in the best war movies, for example, when Kirk sits down with his key officers, which makes up the military council. The writers and actors are not joking here: this is all preparation for a terrible conflict, potentially for the start of yet another year of battle. Ultimately, Kirk's goal is to save this battlefield for only two ships — but even then it is an effort fraught with danger and probable casualties. In fact, I believe that this episode is a record loss for the ship to the end. At the very beginning of the episode, we see the devastation that such a battle can cause, in this supposedly well-protected outpost. Then start a cat-and-mouse war game between the Enterprise and the Romulan ship — it's just as exciting as any conflict we saw on the big screen. Of course, if you don’t like war movies, you’ll have to look for other things you can admire in this episode. <br /> <br /> What strengthens this episode even more is the revelation of who and Romulans is a kind of electric shock. Now we have another conflict between brigades on the Enterprise bridge - for some people, war tends to cause the worst. Because of the still disgusting attitude to the race in this future, the tension intensifies even more - Kirk is fully engaged in this. I believe that the only weakness in history is the convenient mitigation of the problem of fanaticism to the conclusion. On the side of the Romulans, the actor Lenard first appears in the universe of Trek as the commander of the Romulans; he is terrific in the role, the flip side of captain Kirk or captain Pike, make your choice, made to look more like Spock. Surprisingly, his character does not long for war, as we expect, another revealing response for this episode. Then the actor will return to this universe as Sarek, Spock's father, so he is nothing if not a wagon. It also suggests that the first appearance of such characters as Romulans is usually their best shot, as here. They appeared in the "Incident of the enterprise" next.
