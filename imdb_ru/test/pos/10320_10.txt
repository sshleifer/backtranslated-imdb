The “Indisputable Bridegroom” is almost certainly the best short film “Three Stooges” with Shemp, as well as any of the best shorts from the Curly Trio. Memorable moments Rogs abound. Opening with “Professor” Schempe, who gives voice lessons to the homely, inept and lustful Miss Dinkelmeyer (Dee Green), wincing at her terrible singing notes and fighting off her achievements, is an excellent example of Schemard Howard at his best. Many considered him the funniest of the puppets. <br /> <br /> Later, when Moe and Larry are trying to help him find a wife (and require $ 500,000), Shemp thinks he has his head cut off. when his mirror turns back. Having fastened the mirror, he cries with relief: "TAM I am SO and good, like a painting!" “Yes,” Moe responds quickly, trying to hem his pants, “APE!” <br /> <br /> The best scene (and maybe Schempe is best for the trio) comes when he turns to attractive young Miss Hopkins (Christine McIntyre). Wrongly mistaking him for the long-lost “cousin Vasily”, she stifles him with hugs and kisses (which also leads to a cheerful battle between Mo and Larry in the hall), preventing him from explaining his true identity. Suddenly, the REAL cousin Vasily calls and she becomes infuriated by slapping him many times and accusing him of using "a poor, helpless, defenseless woman!" This last line is delivered when it plunges it into the jaw (with a real blow, according to Schempe and the crew), knocking it through the door and into the hall in a beautifully made gag. "What happened, baby?" Mo asked. "Can I help if I am not cousin Vasily?" she asks before swooning. <br /> <br /> Other classic bits: Mo and Shemp get entangled in the phone booth, trying to find the lost coin, Larry slaps because of Shemp’s poor appearance (his face is pressed against the phone). glass box), and the great girl fights in the apartment of the magistrate. The great Emil Sitka says his classic line (inscribed on his gravestone) “Hold your hands, you love birds” again and again when his apartment is destroyed. <br /> <br /> I prescribe "The Bride for the Groom" as a medicine for everyone who thinks the puppet glory years were over when Curly left. True, Shemp didn’t have as many great shorts with the band as Curly had, but that was due to the growing lack of support from Colombia and his (and others) old age. When Shemp was healthy and the trio received decent material for work, they were still at the top of their game.
