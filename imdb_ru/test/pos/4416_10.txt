One of the most sublime American masterpieces, Morrissey opens the film, sexually sexing Dullesandro, with his mouth open, snoring on a pillow. Interestingly, he goes with heroin? We just see his face, then the flash, his body, the flash, his naked rear. I cannot recall another film that would use this form of flash editing as well as to create a hypnotic, narcotic mood, editing method that works wonderfully both as a tempo and as a style. After this introduction, when Dullesandro opens his mouth, his accent becomes sharp - we expect him to be some kind of quiet androgyne; instead, he has the voice of a street gangster — Morrissey doesn’t feel comfortable leaving our assumptions unchanged. The long opening is very sexy and playful - it is a combination of combat troubles, exciting Dullesandro kisses and early morning sex antics; it all flows together, if not always smoothly, then emotionally realistic. <br /> <br /> What I got from this was the same as what I got from "400 blows" when I first saw it - this is the continuation of more than 20 years of this story. There is a partnership feeling between meat sellers and buyers; when Dullesandro walks down the street looking for men (to fund his wife's abortion), there is a feeling of a secret handshake when the boys make deals with each other. I never found it boring, although nothing happens - nothing happens brilliantly, the boys moan about, as they are, waiting for tricks. The main trick that Dullesandro finds is fascinating to observe using Greek descriptions and touching only the back, a form of aesthetic worship of the body by the person. It’s also terribly funny (“I’m not talking to an empty bed, is it?”). This is one of the most spectacular scenes in the film - I think, in any film; Of course, any film about sex and sex for sale. When Dullesandro's eyes appear red and swollen, we cannot say, because he is drunk, ashamed, embarrassed or all. <br /> <br /> The conversations in the film are cut off - they don't matter, (In several scenes the film is silent, some of the sharpest and most beautiful you have ever experienced.) And yet when Morrissey decides to include one of them, the way he includes her (we somehow connect her) is amazing, for example: one conversation between Dullesandro and rookie Hustler - and none of them ever mentioned the words "gay" or "hustler." This is followed by a scene in which we listen to a couple of transvestites, when Dallesandro is serviced - this is only after explaining to the newcomer that he is “used” to work. <br /> <br /> Dullesandro - a subject worthy of attention paid to him, both by his clients and Morrissey. He is less than effective as an actor, in the sense of acting, but as far as disclosing something that he is incredible - he is the one whom we immediately want to feel higher, but we go through his experiences with all their difficulties "forced to try to find him. He is the clean sheet, to which we stretch, but can not grasp him. And, of course, it is incredibly striking - forgetting everything else, it is partly evidence of the beauty of the male body, the magnificent body of Dullesandro and constantly growing nipples. <br /> <br /> In f Ilme has one destructive scene, but like everything else that you cannot truly master - the girl says that she was raped, and her only self-defense is to say that if the abuser asked only for sex, he would look after her , it would get better styling. It destroys. The film has a feeling for everyone, but even better, it’s not just a sympathizer, it actually tries to help us understand people — and not even dictate what we need to understand. It does not look down and does not enchant people in the film. When we see Joe hugging a transvestite, it seems comprehensive. When he reads a letter (he says that he cannot pass one eighth grade at some point), he is completely charming, he pauses on the word ... then he says: "Voteva" and continues. <br /> <br /> You can learn something deeper from the interaction between Dullesandro and one of his clients in terms of homosexual relations than from any case study. Here we have a young boy who smiles (his upper lip disappears at the same time) when a Korean war veteran, who is over 30 years old, runs through his hair with his fingers; this is a scene that seems very deep, this adult person shares something with a younger version of himself - these are not two gays together or gay paying a straight man, this is something else that you cannot put a finger on; sexuality issues are irrelevant to the case. (Never before had acne seemed so tender.) After sharing something emotionally with each other (although with Dullesandro, because he is there for money, it is never clear why he is there; although he is never less sincere, what could be his most disarming quality), "So ... can you help me?" The man says, of course. "I don't mean my pants!" 10/10
