I was very surprised when I came across this film on cable television a couple of years ago. This story is a wonderful example of how our land is constantly changing, and the struggle to hold on to it and use it as needed. The contradictory desires of the "people" and the government. The actors were fantastic in their performances, and I absolutely fell in love with Tantoo Cardinal - she is so believable and was such a character in this film as Rip Torn. The story was also a love story about the land, the past and the two main characters. I tried to buy this film and could not find it, but I would really like to have it.
