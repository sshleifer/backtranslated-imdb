Even if “Rising” was your favorite movie, it could be watched no more than once every ten years. This is too emotional stress. Widely regarded as the best film Shepitko, “ASCENT” is the story of partisans acting in the Belarusian forest at the height of winter in the Soviet Union occupied by Germany. <br /> <br /> Attacking the audience The pure physicality of the wartime experience, especially the deprivation of cold and snow, the actual struggle for survival both against nature and against the fascists, there is always a subtle, one can hardly assume the implication of moral judgment and the question of whether a person can be moral or immoral in one context, but in another - in another. <br /> <br /> A guerrilla group hiding in the forest is attacked by a German patrol and loses its food reserves. Two men, Rybak, who knows the area, and Sotnikov, a Jewish school teacher, were assigned to go to a small village for food. They discover that the village has burned to the ground, nothing edible and nothing more than charred logs and foundations, in which a children's mirror is hidden in one hole. The overwhelming feeling is that the one who brings the cruelty of war to the land and people becomes truly damned. I thought about the war that the Americans and the British brought to Iraq, and that bringing the horrors of war to people is an act of a degenerate nation. <br /> <br /> They moved to the next large village, where they get a lamb from a senior employee forcing. The Germans are arriving, and two partisans are fleeing under fire. Sotnikova hit on the leg and keeps the German, when Rybak escapes with a lamb. Sotnikov comes to such despair that, preparing for the fact that he will not be taken alive, he takes off his shoe in order to put a bullet in his head. Just then the Fisherman returns and takes Sotnikova from the line of fire. <br /> <br /> Fisherman drags Sotnikova through the forest, a bloody meter by meter, and all this is done in one long take. Every meter is agony, and yet he still pulls him through deep snow, up the ridges, through depressions, through black stumps of bushes that crack when they break under the weight of people. There are several similarities with the cinematic vocabulary of Tarkovsky - documenting the process, the effect of repetition and the resulting emotional stress, which is created as the shot lasts, takes a lot of time. In the background, invisible because of the action, the question arises - did Rybak commit an amoral act, returning to Sotnikov? In accordance with the moral norms of Marxism-Leninism or simply the general imperative of the survival of the group, was it not his duty to return the food to his hungry group and leave Sotnikov to cover his escape? Donate one person to survive? What leads to the question - can one expect that a person who is immoral in one philosophical system will be moral in another moral system? Guerrillas seem to be another curse of war in a farmhouse with a woman with three young children. She is embittered by the scourge of war and barely hangs out with her three children. They barely rested when more Germans appeared. They leave and go to the attic to hide. <br /> <br /> Sotnikov's cough gives them away. When a German looks into his head to look, and no one answers, he threatens to shoot through the attic, and Rybak’s nerves break, and they are captured. Now, who has the moral responsibility here? Sotnikov for coughing or Rybek for cracking? Two partisans and a mother are tied up and taken to a nearby town, passing ominously under a wrought iron arch at the entrance. They find the elder and the little girl already imprisoned. They are interrogated by a defector Belarusian, performed by the beloved Tarkovsky Anatoly Solonitsyn. Sotnikov keeps his head during interrogations and torture and only asks what was the pre-war profession of the investigator? He is not responding, but because of his ease behind the desk, the likely answer was a “school teacher.” <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Rybak asks about his life and even offers to join the police. A previously imperceptible character defect, the adoption of a “wrong” moral decision, the ambiguity (sentimentality) of which hid it from judgment, now becomes obvious, alarming and very ugly. <br /> <br /> Five are sitting in a dark cell, They all have to die the next day. From here the elements of the Christian parable become stronger. Genuine lighting and compositions by Rembrandt are used as other poses of Christ by the Old Master. He decides that he can save everyone if he takes the blame for all. He must stay alive until the morning so that he can save everyone. He asks his mother for forgiveness, and the head, knowing what is happening, does not feel such despair from useless death, as before. <br /> <br /> Morning is coming. Germans do not care if Sotnikov takes upon himself all the sins of his companions or not. They will all be hanged. They trudge up the steeply sloping street, which is a virtual Via Dolorosa. Bench delivered to the place of execution, which is the gateway to the city. Five ropes hang from it. The bench costs only three, therefore Sotnikov stands on the stump that Rybak knocks out from under him. They are all hung. <br /> <br /> When Rybak comes down the road with the Germans, someone in the crowd calls him Judas, an unnecessary allusion, Shepitko's only mistake. Rybak imagines being shot several times in the back, trying to escape, dying with an honorable death, and unsuccessfully trying to hang himself in the gazebo, but leaves the Germans like a beaten dog. However, if Rybak was morally right to return and save Sotnikov’s life, then is he wrong in trying to save his own life?
