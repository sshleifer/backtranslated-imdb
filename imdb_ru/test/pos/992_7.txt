This is primarily about love in World War II, but we must remember that this is also a biopic for Dylan Thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his life. <br /> <br /> The time of the film is simply superb. It truly reflects what I think would be a spirit in those times; smiling and hoping you are not being bombed. Although it may seem boring to some, the film has a particularly dangerous advantage. <br /> <br /> At some point, my heart beat towards the end, when the film reached its climax. It does show some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors. Killian Murphy in great shape, like Matthew Rhys. Both are polar opposites, and it makes an interesting watch. The relationship between the characters of Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley is excellent, and we have to thank the cast (and not miss the episodic role of Suggs “Madness”). <br /> <br /> Despite all this, this is a rather slow movie. Combined with the fact that it takes only two hours, it is quite a difficult task to come to a conclusion. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a solid science fiction film about the war with many wonderfully crafted moments that no doubt helped a magnificent number of famous British names behind the scenes. But sometimes he does buzz too long. Still worth seeing. 7/10
