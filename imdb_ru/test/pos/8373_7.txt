The only reason Duke Is Tops is worth mentioning today, one of several “racing films” made during segregation, is that it debuted in a movie with a 21-year-old singer named Lena Horne. She plays Ethel Andrews, a singer who must leave her mentor-producer Duke Davis (Ralph Cooper) in order to become popular. Davis, however, must pretend that he took the money for his services to her so that she would not regret having done so. He then teams up with Doc Dorando (Lawrence Kriner) for a series of medical shows in the south. Meanwhile, in New York, her new producers bombed a big time because they made her a whole show, and not just a special act. Davis learns on the radio and offers his services as a producer and band leader to bring his lineup of other special performances, many of which make their one of the few or only appearances in films here, for his chance of a great time with Ethel next to him. Guess what happens? While the plot is similar to what you have seen in thousands of other musicals in the cinema during this time, the fact that it was done for a specific audience makes this one of the most exciting features I have seen during this Black History Month. Miss Horn's singing here is well demonstrated, and it is interesting to see her so young, until her professionalism mastered later in her career. Among other supporting players, according to IMDb, is Lilian Randolph, Anne in my favorite film “It's a Beautiful Life,” and sister Amanda Randolph, whom I just saw in the short musical “The Black Network”, as a woman with sciatica who does not recover after taking the Doc medication, until the Duke explained that it was for the feet! And as a longtime resident of Louisiana, I would like to point out two players from this film: Joel Fuellen from Monroe as a tonic buyer and Marie Bryant from New Orleans as a sexy dancer who appears on the eve of the musical climax. So only for Lena Horne “Herzog peak” is worth seeing at least once.
