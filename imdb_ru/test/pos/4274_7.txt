This show is really Broadway American Idol. There is singing, a British guy, a guy who is sometimes good, and a super-sweet woman. <br /> <br /> Of course, everything is different, because there are battles, dances, and some acting games (we just donâ€™t see some actors). <br /> <br /> I gave this show 7 because there are a couple of tweaks that I know that many people (including me) will do if they work on the show. The first thing that really needs to change is the judges who decide who goes home. I know they want to find the right Danny and Sandy, but America should have the right to decide who makes the house. There is no point in a duel. The person with the fewest votes usually goes home anyway. Another thing I would change is to see how they actually play the show. What is Broadway without acting? The last thing to change is the song that the detached people sing at the end. The expelled Danny always sings the same song, and the discarded Sandy always sings the same song when they go out. As they sing it every week, these songs become annoying over time. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am not a fan of the film, Grease, but for some reason I was hooked. This show is very undervalued. He has so many memorable speeches and moments.
