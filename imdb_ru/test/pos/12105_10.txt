This is a very good film (documentary) about Istanbul and its people, and this is music of any kind. The editing and success of the director is very impressive. I have been interested in Faith Akin since I saw “Gegen die Wand” (“Frontal Movement”) (“Duvara Karsı”), and I greatly admired his work, but this one was the most touching for me, so I write this here. This is not just the Turks or something like that, it is a very good biography of the city and the way music lives in it, you can say. There are opinions of many people and therefore very different ideas even about life and love. I really liked it, and I think everyone should see it, and not only, but especially those who are somehow connected with Turkey ...
