Label this film as a “lesbian love story” as accurately as calling Pride and Prejudice a “direct love story”. There is much more to it. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main character is a lesbian, but her story is a classic bildungsroman, a journey from childhood to adulthood, from sexual innocence to maturity, from personal blindness to self-knowledge. In the direction of the film there is a stylistic element of the camp, but this is not a hindrance; rather, it serves to emphasize the staged and dramatic part of the life of the protagonist. <br /> <br /> Those familiar with Anna Chancellor, according to the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice, will surely be amazed here. Rachel Sterling is stellar, as the main character Nan, and Keely Howes is a virtue with eyes wide open, like her mistress, Kitty Butler. Outstanding role can play the Chancellor, except Sally Hawkins, who plays Xena Butler. This film is not for the faint of heart, but it is not part of gay advertising. This is a true story, with real comedy and drama, an exciting story with compelling characters that are worth seeing.
