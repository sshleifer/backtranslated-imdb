Operation Scorpion (AKAThe Scorpion King) does not turn on at maximum speed for as long as the last 25 minutes or so, but when the action reaches maximum speed, it creates truly amazing martial arts scenes that require the attention of the viewer. This does not mean that the first hour is worth nothing ?? Compared with the final martial festival, it looks a little out of ecstasy. <br /> <br /> The plot unfolds around Yuk-Soo, a talented comic book artist who dreams of becoming a hero, like those he portrays in his drawings. When Yuk-Soo saves a young maid Siu-Yu, who is sold into prostitution, he incurs the wrath of her evil boss Ba. Under the guidance of Sonny, the masters of kung fu in the style of scorpions, the henchmen of Wah pursue Yuk-Su and the maid. Yuk-Su's father intervenes, but he is injured. After being rescued by friendly bodybuilders, they eventually hid in a restaurant with noodles belonging to their friend, Master Yatu. <br /> <br /> Yuk-Soo learns to cook noodles, but he also gets out regularly to Secretly build up his strength and learn kung-fu under the guidance of Gene, the teacher of muscular carcasses who saved them. When Master Yat is due to leave on business, Yuk-Su remains in charge of the kitchen; however, he appears to practice skill with Jin, leaving Siu-Yu to serve customers. Sonny and his people visit a restaurant and, disgusted by the noodles they are served, litter in a restaurant. <br /> <br /> When Master Yat finds out that Yuk-Soo is sneaking, he tells him that he had to learn kung-fu from him; it turns out that Master Yat was the main assassin of the Triad, until he decided to try to change his ways. Under the guidance of Master Yata, Yuk-Soo improves his skills, even learning the art of hitting without a shadow! In the end, Yuk-Soo gets a chance to try to become a real hero when his friend, Fat Man, announces that his maid was also sold into prostitution. Together with Jean, they visit the Ba, posing as French brothels looking for new women. When the maid Fatty is introduced to them, she accidentally takes away their cunning, and finally the action begins a great style. Despite all his efforts, Sonny strongly beat Jin, and he and Yuk-Soo are forced to flee. Returning to the restaurant, Yuk-Soo finds him on fire; and worst of all, the bad guys found Siu-Yu! Yuk Soo, accompanied by Master Yata, returns to Ba's place to try to save Siu-Yu ... <br /> <br /> Despite some rather interesting training scenes, slow preparation for the final action in Ba's house is rather elongated and devoid of any serious fight scenes. It's a shame that halfway through it you are not tired of breaking up a decent scrap, instead of keeping all the juicy things to the end. <br /> <br /> The last fight, however, is worth the wait at the end; Won Jin with tremendous skill and dexterity, performing the terrific game of Sonny, who with tremendous skill and dexterity shakes, turns and spins, and Chin Kar-Lock demonstrates a solid game in the role of Yuk-Su, an artist who has become a fighter. The old kung fu star Lau Kar-Leung (AKA Liu Chia Liang) as Master Yat is also particularly good, proving that this old-timer still has what it takes to kick ass! Operation Scorpio, although not an ideal film, has enough outstanding action movies in the finale to definitely deserve to be watched. <br /> <br /> nb. Maybe I misunderstood some names. My DVD calls characters with different names than those listed in IMDb.
