This is one of the best Peter Sellers films. Why is it never shown on TV or in movie theaters? Will it ever be released as a home movie? Is it too humiliating for the medical field? I would love to see this movie again. I would like my son, who was a doctor, to see this. Laughter is the best medicine, and Peter Sellers is the best doctor for this.
