Frank Sinatra plays one of his best roles as a reformed addict returning to Chicago after a long stay at the clinic. He plans to give up drugs and find a drummer job, but he cannot avoid colliding with his old friends. Initially, he was arrested not on drug charges, but because he was caught for participating in an illegal poker game. His poker prowess brought him the nickname “The Man with the Golden Hand”, and the people who lead the game, one of which is his former heroin connection, want him to come back into the game. Meanwhile, Frank must take care of the woman he injured in a car accident, Zosh (Eleonora Parker), and make peace with his old friend Molly (Kim Novak). The film perfectly helps us to plunge into the spiritual state of Sinatra. When he was confident at the beginning of the film, I felt good for him. But, when the promised phone call does not come once, he gets depressed and returns to the beat. Later, when he finally gets to the audition, he arrives completely frustrated. His embarrassment, when he cannot play the right bit, is destructive. He had such big dreams, and other musicians do not even pay attention to him when he runs out of the room. The film moves fast, and it shows Frank's drug problem in a realistic light, without turning into a picture of a social message. The actors are equally good. Elmer Bernstein's account is one of the best in his time. The only thing I don’t like about the film is the final. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Although I like Zosha’s character very much and Parker is very good at the film, they could have done a bit more to fill her background. The ending is a bit too much. Despite the fact that after the film closes, the characters will most likely have pathos, but Zosha’s death too accurately links all loose ends. Frank is free to love Molly, and he will not go to jail. In addition, his dealer is dead, so at least the immediate threat has disappeared. Well, I think that in Hollywood there is always a desire to tie everything into a neat little package. It hurts the film a little, but at the moment it is one of the best and most adult drug addiction films I can think of. 9/10.
