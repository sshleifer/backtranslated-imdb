I was going to use the “German Shout” as a summary, but this was already accepted, lol. This well sums up the anatomy. Provided that you are no stranger to reading subtitles, Anatomy fits perfectly into the Scream / Urban Legend set. This is teenage horror at a medical school where students go missing and then become experimental objects in the laboratory. Give a cue to one brave student who investigates herself and uncovers a giant conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Provided that you watch the original film in German (I cannot comment on the dub without seeing the English edition) Anatomy is sharply written and cleverly constructed so that the tension never weakens. Compared to American counterparts, the mystery is revealed much faster, which means that instead of being a slasher right up to the final disclosure, Anatomy develops during its time from a horror movie with a dead body to a clever and exciting thriller. This is an exciting ride from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Hats off to the actors involved. Franca Potente proves once again that she is a smart, intelligent actress who can fulfill any role. Her main performance as Paula is a great base for the film. The creepy lecturers and pets of their teachers are equally good, and this is a really foreboding presence. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the film draws little. The pace is fast and energetic, very similar to the early Urban Legend, which means that there is always something that keeps your attention high. If there is one drawback, it is possible that some will find the Anatomy too disgusting for them, but if you continue through the deliberately graphic opening sequence of the first half, the second half with its exciting thriller overtones will reward you. I recommend Anatomy to anyone who loves good teen horror, but is a little puzzled by the American understanding of this issue.
