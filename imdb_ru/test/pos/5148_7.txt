I saw it at the 2008 Palm Springs International Film Festival. There are some great descriptions of this film from other commentators, and they seem to really enjoy it, so I won't give a short overview of the film for too long, but you might see some Woody Allen and maybe some Federico Fellini of 50 short sketches or vignettes, stitched without a single plot. However, some of the vignettes are related to each other in character and storyline, and the corner panel is often used as a central scene, where they always give the final challenge. The initial and final scenes also have a common theme that fills the imagination with the film. It took three years to make this film, and most of the time must have been spent searching for the simplest and nicest people in all of Sweden to shoot. This is Sweden’s official application for the best film in foreign languages ​​at the 2007 Academy Award ceremony. This is a good film, but hardly deserving of official submission for the best foreign film. Last year, the official presentation of Sweden was very weak Farval Falkenberg, and a year earlier it was expensive, but boring ZoZo, so Sweden will have no chance to get an Oscar again. This film has its moments, and it would be a good short film for 20-25 minutes, but it becomes a bit old and cold for a full-length feature film. Roy Andersson directs. Gustav Danielsson - operator. Editor Anna Mirtha Verne deserves credit for the work she must have invested in this. ABBA Fame’s Benny Andersson offers entertainment music. This is an interesting film with a lot of dry humor, and I liked it, but there is nothing special about it, and it could give it only 7.0 out of 10.
