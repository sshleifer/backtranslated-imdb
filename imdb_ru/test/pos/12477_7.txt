Should we take the first shot as a weird shot ??? I think we should. In any case, the two women behind the umbrella are closing, they go up to the talent agency, and we go with them ... and then they will never see them again. Okay, why not INSIDE the place, at the piano or even outside with the SOUND of the piano, and then track inside and again, a la Hitchcock ??? So I think that Clouzot no longer subconsciously tells us that we are following a segment of the post-war society: especially how he then uses the song Citizen Kane = like, cut into about five plays, to show how the singing lady travels from talent Agency right up to her first roses and the applause of her vaudeville debut. <br /> <br /> After this, we are unrelenting observers of the more or less disgusting details of the defeated country, breaking with its war-torn knees. And no one ever coped with a little disgust better than Clouseau. In fact, it is very unfortunate that he never tried Sartre's nausea. Almost everything we see after the first few minutes makes us nauseous. .... well, well, I greatly exaggerate this, let's just agree with the general feeling of most of the film. Look carefully, in fact, and you will even see one of the policemen picking his nose. And in how many films has anyone ever done this. Then a very loud nose appears in front of the lesbian photographer at the head cop, who notices that she literally does not blink and does not raise an eyebrow. <br /> <br /> The essence of all of this Apparently, this is almost a feverish immersion in contiguity, until you smell almost every scene, and also see and feel it. <br /> <br /> As for the other aspects of the film, the others here described them in much more detail than I did. But forget the riddle here: this is the main McGuffin. Klozo is just as interested in the real killer as the two women who come out of the rain in the first few seconds of the film and never see them again. From beginning to end, all he wanted to do was follow a group of people, not even particularly interesting, and, let's say, look at the twitching of this woman, at how a man clings his pants in all their insignificance, years and years back Tina Turner sang, we don't need another hero. \ <br /> <br /> Even the obsessive frivolity of the final is joylessly done in a dilapidated part of Paris and in a rather cool apartment with bare walls. Only couples love each other to see through them, as if they say that throughout the city people like you should have two or three million, and every day they work out the fingers for little love at night. <br /> <br /> From this, it was only a short step to the Fear Wage and final in despair. <br /> <br /> They donâ€™t even know how to make such films in the USA. However, then they did not even know how much in France, and now it is much less. The inexorable detail of the gesture makes even the neorealists of Italy look like bad psychologists. What I think makes Clouzot a kind of Rossellini at speed. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant nonsense, this film. It seems to me that this is the only drawback, and, as another viewer noted, for some reason the leading woman is not entirely right. All the others in the film are almost perfectly played.
