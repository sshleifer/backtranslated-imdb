For many years I have not seen a better comedy than King of Queens. I rate it as one of the best ever. I just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a business trip, and they accidentally showed several episodes. I joked it off, and then asked the stewards to play again, and they did it. Thanks AA. Acting from the whole team is top-notch, especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Jerry Stiller, but in fact the cast is great. I love all the actors, they are so funny. In "The King of Queens" there is a hard line that I love, and is rarely found in today's television comedy. Both Leah and Kevin are so good at playing each other that every situation is believable and funny. I just bought the 2nd season while I was in Az this week, and I’m going to buy a complete set the next time I’m in the USA. My son, who is 20 years old, also loves this show, and his magnificence lies in the fact that he has the magic to cover different generations. I would like to thank everyone who took part in this amazing show - it’s so nice to see this kind of TV show in what I think is the era of a bad TV fair in general these days, except for replays in Seinfeld and the like .. Thank you for a great show ..
