I would recommend this for anyone who is a fan of the late John Cassavetes. And for those who never knew about Cassavetes. This is a great movie. I really do not have time to go into the details of why this is my opinion, but if you are looking for something fearless, with many scenes for reflection, then this is for you. Cinematography is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the film, as well as the story itself. This “review” does not make the film fair. This is an experience that you need to see for yourself. MANY CHARACTERS. VERY ONE
