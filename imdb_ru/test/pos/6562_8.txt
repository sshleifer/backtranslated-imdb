I really liked this movie. He effectively combines humor, fantasy and a few moments of horror with the solid efforts of the director Higuchinsky. Brilliant visual effects and a very original spiral story. My only complaints were that he had boring moments and he was not as brave as he could have been. However, I give it 8 points out of 10. The US should take note of this and other wonderful Japanese horror / fantasy films that have appeared recently and put them on a region 1 DVD. some of the best films that were not seen by the American public, because they are hard to find. I highly recommend that people search for these treasures, they are hard to find, but once you find them, you will be glad you found them.
