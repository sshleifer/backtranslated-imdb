When I first saw it on tape, about 10 years after it was released, I thought it was one of the best James Bond films. However, seeing him again at the turn of the century, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think this is a little overrated just because the critics were very happy to see Sean Connery end his 12-year break from playing in Bond. that they did not dare to criticize the film. I think it disappointed me, so this is the final. After spending two hours on a movie, you expect a less frivolous, more enjoyable finale. And it can be picky, but I was disappointed that I did not see regular actors in supporting roles, such as Miss Manipenny, Q, Felix Leiter, etc. <br /> <br /> On the positive side there were many unique action , especially in the early stages, and two villains were interesting. I thought that Klaus Maria Brandauer was the more intriguing of the two, because he was so discreet and looked like a “good guy next door”. He was not the usual villain of Bond. <br /> <br /> He had a lot of skin for the PG movie, especially with Kim Basinger in the title role, who was never an actress known for hiding her figure. The language was very tame, but most Bond films are pretty good in this department. <br /> <br /> In general, this is an “honest” Bond and nothing more. The fact that Connery is in it does not mean that it is automatically good. Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan proved that they too can play this role well.
