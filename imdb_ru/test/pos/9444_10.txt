It must be one of the best episodes of Doctor Who, whom I have seen since he returned last year. There is a mixed mix of fun, fear, and tenderness that blend together, which is one amazing episode. Wade was brilliantly designed, and I'm sure there will be a lot of jokes in the next few weeks. I myself have been guilty of this. I especially liked the way we saw a different perspective on Roseâ€™s relationship with the Doctor, and also at the end, well, for the first time I hid behind a pillow! I can't wait for the next week to find out how they get out of this mess.
