"L'Auberge Espagnole" gathered viewers wherever it was shown. He collected spectator awards at many film festivals around the world. And this is not strange. We have the opportunity to look fun and amazing work of art. And this is the way by the way. L'Auberge Espagnole is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up. But most of all we are talking about the lights and shadows of life in the European Union. <br /> <br /> The film’s protagonist is a French economist from Xavier. For his future carrier, he is sent to Barcelona for one year of study. In Spain, it turns out that lectures are read in Catalan. This probably does not help increase knowledge. But it helps in strengthening relationships within the group of exchange students. Especially if they rent a big apartment together. There are 3 girls: English, Belgian and Spanish, as well as three boys: German, Danish and Italian. Our french guy will get there too. The year is very long. Long enough to get close and make friends. And meet some European stereotypes, trying to destroy them. <br /> <br /> Clapisch considers this special case of the process of uniting Europe with humor and without daring didactism. It comes from the fact that young people are the same everywhere. They love jokes. They like to build irresponsible relationships. But they do not neglect their aspirations. The most interesting is the sum of the experience of this small community. They live together in the fire of everyday affairs, struggling with the surrounding reality. They are full of unusual ideas for life. Young Europeans are returning to their countries to live adult life on their own. They are Europe’s hope of fighting the many problems of the Union. For example, a terrifying administration system. In the end, they argue that they are not only able to communicate and make friends, despite the many differences. But they also now how to live life to the fullest. And they will not allow them to take so much life.
