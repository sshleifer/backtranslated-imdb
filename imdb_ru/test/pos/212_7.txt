Nothing of the kind was seen on TV at that time, and probably never will again. From the first image of a police fire blinding you, and from there you heard the words: “The police squad is in color,” you were shocked to see that this was by no means an ordinary comedy series. <br /> <br /> Also kill the “Guest Star” and never again contact him, where have you ever seen it before. Then the real show began, and if you didn't pay attention, you would have missed a few jokes in the background. Do not pay too much attention to one thing, otherwise you will regret. It was a show for which video recorders were created, long before they married children or the Simpsons. <br /> <br /> Stories didn't make any sense, and sometimes the dialogue was so strange that you had to think about it. for 5 minutes before you realize that it was a joke. <br /> <br /> The characters Frank Drebin and Ed Hoken came straight out of Dragna, and they were absolutely direct (without funny accents or expressions), but instead there were puns and distorted sentences played absolutely deadpan. Only once, as I recall, was an episode played for silly laughter — a scene that included a trip to the dentist, aspiration, and a lot of saliva. <br /> <br /> There were some tedious moments - like Johnny's informant and some celebrity's appearance. It was a purely joking moment, but they had to use it in all six episodes. Well. Everything can't be perfect. The important thing is that the rest of the time you were knee-deep in tears of laughter. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen was lucky that it revived his career when they put Frank Drebin's character in 3 roles, but it had to be the Achilles heel as well. Can you remember that you saw him in everything except for the work like “Naked Gun”? And do not count the terrible Mr. Magu, converted for live action. Although he probably made a lot of money.
