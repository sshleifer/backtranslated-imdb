Written by someone who was there, you can say, but only if you were there. Great performances by Meryl Streep (of course!), Renee Zellweger and William Hurt. <br /> <br /> Many people say that we are talking about a dysfunctional family, I think that every family is unfavorable when faced with this kind of torment. NOT to be dysfunctional would be dysfunctional! Are you losing your family as you know it? Could anything be worse? People need to watch this movie, so when they run into this nightmare, they may change the way they do it. Maybe they will see that the father deprives himself of valuable time, and he will never have a chance again. Maybe they will understand how hard it is to die or to watch how the one you love dies. They didn't miss most of the nightmare, it's hard to forget.
