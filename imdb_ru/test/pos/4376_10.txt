This is bad for I. Really demonstrates more talents of George Carlin. He really is still sharp as a tack. It's a shame that we lost him last year, but his comedy will live forever. This special performance is literally one of the funniest I've ever heard, a comedian's performance. Even though he laughs at small children, it just makes you laugh when he says some things. It’s true that Carlin can literally do something that seems unfunny and turn it into one of the funniest things you’ve ever heard. I really enjoyed this performance, especially from Carlin, and I recommend that those who like it should familiarize themselves with the performance of George Carlin.
