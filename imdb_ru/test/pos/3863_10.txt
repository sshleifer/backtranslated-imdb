The twentieth animated Disney classic is often criticized by many as "mediocre" or poor in quality, but it is a great movie. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the “aristocrats” do not receive the deserved respect. Personally, I consider him one of my favorite Disney classics. <br /> <br /> Despite being underestimated, this is one of the funniest Disney classics. He is full of funny (some of them hysterical) moments. <br /> <br /> Edgar, the greedy butler, the villain of the film, but he is the perfect comic relief. He is one of my favorite Disney villains, because he is very funny. <br /> <br /> Each scene in which Edgar and the hounds, Napoleonic and Lafayette dogs, are chasing him is one of the funniest you have ever seen, especially when Edgar drives his motorcycle into and around the river the bridge, chasing him dogs. This is hysterical! <br /> <br /> But classic humor does not come only from Edgar or beagle dogs. Other characters also have their moments. <br /> <br /> With regard to the topic of quality, it is not perfect, but it remains at a high level. Even after the death of Walt Disney, these artists knew how to remain faithful to the spirit of Walt, and "Aristocrats" are one such example. These days they don't make them like that! <br /> <br /> As usual, the legendary Disney actors are voicing characters. In this case, we have Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway, Paul Winchell, Eva Gabor and Pat Buttram. <br /> <br /> In general, cool characters: Thomas O'Malley, Duchess and her 3 kittens, Roquefort mouse Alley of cats, English geese, hounds of dogs and horses. Also included are the human characters: the eccentric and kind opera singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamil, the old comic lawyer Madame Georges Hautekur and Edgar himself! <br /> <br /> About the soundtrack, there are some nice and memorable songs in it, such as the theme of Thomas O'Malley (but I don’t remember his name): “Everyone wants to be a cat” and “Aristocrats” Maurice Chevalier). <br /> <br /> This film takes place in Paris (France) in 1910. First of all, this is a fun, enjoyable and very enjoyable movie. A timeless classic that is often underestimated and forgotten, but very worthy. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be in the top 250.
