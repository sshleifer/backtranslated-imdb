Everything that Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant and very twisted at least. Well, at least I'm not a cyborg. The new film Pak called “Thirst” is a romance-erotica-thriller-dark comedy-drama about vampires ?? yes, are there many adjectives ?? inspired by a 19th century French novel by Emile Zola called Teresa Rakwin. The park creates a unique Korean and unique park vision of vampire myths and asks the audience to investigate the dilemma of a Catholic priest who discovered that he has a blood thirst and a moral and spiritual crisis that may develop. The park offers the elements you hope for, but definitely does not match the qualities of the masterpiece, such as Oldboy or even Lady Vengeance. Badly bloated with a story that often loses itself to a much smaller audience, Thirst desperately needed another journey through the cutting room. He crawls when he should run, but fortunately returns him home before he completely loses his audience. No matter how negative it may sound, the positives definitely outweigh the negatives, and to the dark and perverted film Zeitgeist of Park Chan-wook, no doubt, added another volume. <br /> <br /> Check out the rest of our review at www.thefilmstage.com
