This film is not half bad. It may be a little long, but fascinated by beautiful landscapes, IMMEDIATELY beautiful love letters and great actors, you forget the time and enjoy. The main prize, however, will go to Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan, as .......... well, that says so, but they are just BIG!
