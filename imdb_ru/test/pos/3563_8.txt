A gang of gangsters led by an insightful, rude and ruthless Monethero (a magnificent performance by Gilbert Roland) during a daring train robbery steals gold coins for $ 300,000. But the unreliable member of Bahund (Jose Torres' funny move) runs off with coins and hides them. Unfortunately, Bahundu is killed before he can tell Monethero where he hid the prey. Thus, Monetero must work together with the cunning, bold, mysterious bounty hunter Stranger (who is played smoothly by handsome George Hilton) and the cunning, corrupt banker Clayton (delightfully affectionate image of 50-year-old idol Eddy "Cooks" Burns) to find coins Cleverly directed by Enzo J. Castellari, with a clever, complex and quirky script by Castellari, Tito Carpi and Giovanni Simonelli, playfully immoral and nihilistic in tone (everyone keeps double and triple intersections with each other with joyfully greedy energy) The gentle, fragrant, energetic score of Alessandro Alessandroni and Francesco De Masi, a lot of exciting shooting and awakening rough, difficult fights, an ominous crafty idea of ​​mocking humor, a steady tempo and a real awesome surprise in the end, this thought-inspiring jovial designer, a steady tempo and a real awesome surprise, after all, this thoughtful jovial inspirer of ideas, a steady tempo and a real awesome surprise. Leone "Good, bad and ugly." In the elegant minor parts appear juicy Stephanie Kareddu as the fiery Gal Monethero, Marisol, Ivano Staccioli as the plump army captain and Gerard Herter as the frivolous lawyer Lawrence Blackman. Very fun and enjoyable romp.
