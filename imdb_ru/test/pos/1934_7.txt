One of the latest films directed by Lionel Barrymore, “Ten Cents for a Dance” is starring Barbara Stenvik as the girl from the Barbara dance hall in her sixth role. In this film, Stanvik looks pretty stupid and starts by chewing on the dance hall manager. Then comes the rich guy Bradley Carlton (Ricardo Cortez), who wants to knock her down. (Cortez and Stanwick made three films together in the 1930s.) She then meets Eddie, who is very different from the dashing Carlton. The author, Joe Sverling, worked on some important things (“Wonderful life, guys and dolls”, “Gone with the wind”), so I was surprised that the characters and the script in this film were so ordinary. The story begins to get more interesting about halfway through, and it is VERY similar to The Bride of 1936, ALSO in the lead role of Stanwick .... T.B.W.O. much more cunning, but at the same time more tamed because of the attack of the Hayes code ...
