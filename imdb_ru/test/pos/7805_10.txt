There are some films that appeal to almost everyone you encounter, and, nevertheless, turn out to be box-office setbacks. Andaz Apna Apna, a clever and funny comedy falls into this category. At this time, the Indian director took into account the feelings of the audience, and did not betray the stereo-typical deception of the type of Kader-Khan. The film tells about two guys who dream of wealth and try to achieve this by caring for the daughter of a millionaire. Humorous drama unfolds, while in the history there are many difficulties. Difficulties add to the pure comedy of the whole plot. Aamir Khan plays a street guy, while Salman Khan unexpectedly performs well as a dumb guy. Willian, played by Paresh Rawal, and his henchmen, Junior Ajit and Kaliaa, make you laugh in your sleep. Although the film is borrowed from many other films, in spite of bad cinematography and sometimes “loud”, it remains one of the rare “funny” films that Bombay invented after such films as Padosan, Holmal and other films by Amol Plakar, It’s sad that it didn’t work out at the checkout, because manufacturers are returning to the formulas, and creativity is abandoned.
