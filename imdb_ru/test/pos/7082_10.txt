If you belong to an IMDB audience that ranked High Fidelity in the top 200 of all time, then this film is probably NOT for you. This film is as unique as Steve Frears. Renee Zellweger is an excellent modernist style journalist who returns to her suburban Bucks nest to look after the Strip mother (who performs another performance in the Hall of Fame) William Hurt is the perfect actor and irresponsible, unfaithful and selfish husband. If this movie does not make you cry and laugh, then you are too smart to enjoy it.
