Since I was jumping from film to film at the SXSW film festival, this film from the premiere stayed with me. Curious, because it is a dark comedy with a completely absurdist prerequisite. <br /> <br /> The family of hyper-stressed fundamentalists in a small community of like-minded people is changing as a result of a car accident. Three of the four have the same near-death experience in which they are fully disclosed, as each receives a rejection of the concept of original sin (I will not spoil this scene with specificity). The fourth, a high school cheerleader, is not only physically injured, but has not changed and is now witnessing what became of her crazy, obviously spiritually bankrupt family. Each new moment brings new indignation, as they become innocently naked and frank in all respects, terrifying her, and then the community. <br /> <br /> Franklin's forgiveness is the most beautiful scene of sexual awakening between husband and wife, which I have ever seen in Sarah Brightman's song "Deliver Me" a song that can now cause tears in my eyes. <br /> <br /> The cast is awesome. Robertson Dean as Father in middle america they know peggy). And Teresa Willis glows positively like Betty, Mom. Actors playing three modified characters are at great risk, and these risks pay off. <br /> <br /> I hope that this film will be released in a wide sale - if so, I plan to see it again. <Br /> <br /> Very accurate overview at: http://www.fosteronfilm.com/phil/forgiving.htm
