This series, although idealized and contrived, has the quirkiness, sincerity and kindness that come from life on the island. <br /> <br /> I lived in a remote part of Hawaii for several years and found cheerful, whimsical and cheerful people in some remote (non-tourist) areas. <br /> <br /> Every time I see repetitions of this series, I lovingly compare my memories of the experience beyond the tangled parts of Hawaii with the memories depicted and made up in Key West. <br /> <br /> This series is not a reality show. I hate reality TV. <br /> <br /> This is the era when people were still writing creative TV shows. Give me a "young writer" who draws inspiration from the "angels in the spray," the wizards in the palms and the elves in the shells. "
