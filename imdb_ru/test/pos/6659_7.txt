This film worked for me because I see this film as the exact opposite of Gone With the Wind. Farm owners instead of plantation owners. Scarlett fights and indulges for what she wants; Ada falls into a depression and turns inside himself until Ruby (Renee Zellweger) appears to save the day. Somewhat. Deserters instead of officers trying to return to their families, the lists go on and on. Even the love story was the opposite. If this is what the producer and the screenwriters tried to convey to me, then I succeeded. <br /> <br /> There are only two things in the film that I didn’t like, the rest seemed good to me, and I liked it enough to recommend it to my friends. First, I could not see the attraction between Inman (Jude Law) and Ada (Nicole Kidman) so strong that Inman left her to return to her. Inman said that he wrote to her only a few times, where Ada wrote to him almost constantly. Secondly, something or someone was killed or died in almost every scene, there were few. I have to say that it was full of action because of this, but after the second scene I knew that someone or someone would die in the next scene. I like to be surprised at the next scene, I don’t know what will happen before it happens. <br /> <br /> I thought all acting was done very well, Zellweger is the best. She deserved the credit she received for this. I thought she played the role of the village girl very well. She must have done her homework from the outside. Zellweger even said in the film that she is smarter than people thought. I think it was true. Lowe did well with his part of everything he had to go through in order to return to Kidman. It must have been a much stronger love to get through all this than I thought. Now he showed a lot of emotion on his face during trials. Perhaps Kidman’s role was due to the fact that I chose her performance after the other two. Except for the cases when she was depressed, she did not show any special emotions, I don’t know if it was written this way or how she perceived the role. She still did a good job, I just thought that the other two were better. <br /> <br /> I liked the scene with Zellweger, Kidman and the rooster, although it was one of those scenes I mentioned above. I thought Home Security was exactly the same as they were probably back then. Although we don’t hear much about them, they were part of that time. I thought the landscape was beautiful. The film was all that was needed to be a good historical novel.
