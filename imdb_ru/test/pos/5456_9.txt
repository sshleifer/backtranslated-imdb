The direction is brilliant, the casting is wonderful (although I would like to see a little more than Aaron Lustig (from Y & R fame), who was played by Paul Schaffer). I have only two minor jokes about the film, as subtle as they are. Leno Warlba Robok is great, but his stage presence (that is, during what appears in the recording of one of his later episodes of the show) is a little disappointing. Two - the spread of obscene language. I am willing to tolerate obscene language, until it is used free of charge, and to some extent the film was gratuitous. The language seemed to be used as a tool to reduce the pathos of Kushnik, who in other respects is well depicted by Bates, because of her frequent use, and served to the fact that Leno Robok became very useful because of his non-use behaved so, thank you all). Nevertheless, this material is excellent if we talk about television and video. The film, I feel, had the potential for a big screen, but it would take a re-cast for the bit parts, and probably another director (the aesthetic feeling is that Larry Sanders show, good for HBO, mediocre for cinematic purposes).
