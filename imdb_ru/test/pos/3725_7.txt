Luc Besson's first work is also his first foray into science fiction, a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with The Fifth Element (1997). Even if this film was heavily influenced by Hollywood movies, it is still very pleasant. Back in 1983, “Le Dernier Combat” reveals Besson’s own approach to science fiction. He picks up a weary topic, and his efforts are discernible to make stylish work. Filmed in widescreen and black-and-white versions, the catastrophe destroyed almost the entire population of the Earth, and we will never know what kind of disaster it is and why people can no longer speak. Some barbaric hordes were formed. At the same time, a man (Pierre Jolive) lives on his own and arrives in unrecognizable Paris, where he is received by a doctor (Jean Bouaz). <br /> <br /> There are no words in Besson’s work. The actions of the characters and the development of events pass through looks and gestures. Although the starting point and background are unnerving, the film never looks dull. It seems that the man and the doctor are trying to reproduce the gestures and actions associated with humanity, before the disaster. The film begins with the fact that the man has sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to get him to talk through the car, and in his free time he is an artist. It is all the more intriguing that these paintings seem to have come from prehistoric times. Based on these considerations, it can be argued that the bearded giant (Jean Reno) personifies evil and the threat to the efforts made by a man and a doctor to return what eventually made a man. The same applies to the gang of villains at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The pessimistic smell that such a film can give is not really in the first place, but gives a glimmer of hope. Personally, the film could be obtained without music in general, except for the one that a person can hear with the help of his tape recorder. Luc Besson was supposed to make the best and still exciting films like this; he also promoted Pierre Jolive's career as a director who in the future would leave behind a spotty work: Force Majeure (1989), Simple Mortel (1991), "ma Petite Entreprise" (1999) or "Filles Uniques" (2003).
