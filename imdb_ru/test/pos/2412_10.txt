"NEXT KARATE KID", in my opinion, is an excellent martial art. I thought that Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) looked good in their graduation dress. For me, Ned (Michael Cavalieri) was a real bully. This happened because Julie had problems with the director of Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside) was clean ******! This was because he was a very harsh man who would not tolerate mistakes. My favorite parts were the prom and the battle between Julia and the Alpha Elite. In conclusion, I highly recommend this strike to anyone who loves martial arts or Hilary Swank fans.
