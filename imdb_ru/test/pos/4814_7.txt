The late director John Frankenheimer shot his first full-length film Young Stranger after he began directing direct television dramas in New York. This film followed the success of the film Rebel Without a Cause in 1955. James MacArthur made his feature film debut as a troubled teenager with the father of the film producer, played by James Daly, who does not establish a sufficient relationship with his son. Kim Hunter plays a mother who is trying to bridge the gap between husband and son. The film uses the popular juvenile delinquent corner of time to tell its story. MacArthur is in trouble at the cinema with an overly zealous theater manager played by Whit Bissell. MacArthur, in turn, has to deal with police sergeant James Gregory, who wants to teach him a lesson. The material could easily become exploitative, ridiculous and sensational, like many other people of that period. However, under the true guidance of Frankenheimer, the film is a sensitive depiction of teenage and parental dynamics. The dialogue is realistic, and most scenes are kept surprisingly well. Some scenes with Bissell as the theater manager and Gregory as the police sergeant are a bit tough and outdated. Nevertheless, the performances are equally good, which is necessary for the success of a movie of this type and on this subject. This is an impressive debut in the full-length film for MacArthur and Frankenheimer. *** out of 4 stars.
