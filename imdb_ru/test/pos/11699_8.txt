Considering Mick Molloy’s horrible track record since he came out on his own, I had pretty low expectations from Crackerjack. Even the movie posters made me nervous. In fact, if it were not for the fact that I received free tickets for a preview, I would resist the pressure of Mrs (who thinks Mick is nothing - there are fears) to pay for it. /> <br /> The first few minutes of the movie excited me - it starts with one of the mixes getting tired of the “get mad at minor things” routine, but it got a neat touch that at least made it a little refreshing. The rest of the screenplay was pretty good and very frivolous — even Mick Molloy’s typical humor (and Judith Lucy) was well delivered, and although I never had to climb out of the aisles, it caused much more laughter than I did. waiting (and it was consistent). <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in the story - rather predictable, but it moved quickly between one-liners and other jokes - I never felt that it was hidden for too long or too short; Mick must have worked hard to polish his script. It was one or two “Late Show” jokes, and one or two jokes that only Melbourne could get, but, of course, there is much in common for a wide audience. <br /> <br /> Something that disappointed me was the relative unfunnyness of John Clark - he just didn’t seem to work like a bad guy, but that’s not too distracting from the film. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked this Australian comedy and was pleasantly entertained throughout the film. I left the cinema with a decent smile - a rather difficult thing for the Australian comedy in my books. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br />
