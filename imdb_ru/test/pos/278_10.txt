This is a very touching film, which tells about a new turn in which we were all: a relationship that is about to end. Speaking of Kristen Thomson as Tessa, who is desperately trying to keep her connection with Bobby for one more day, is extremely convincing and touching and takes you straight to the story. Those who have not faced the end of a relationship and at least wanted to cry with tears: “Another night!” When he gives her one more night, the journey that these two people share, makes you think about how valuable all things can be. this close relationship, and how everyone - permanent or not - should be treated with respect, not just discarded.
