I always thought that my father had a second life, and I was looking forward to the development of 51 Burch Street, when I sat down and looked at it for the first time. Surprisingly, the journey of this film led me to places I did not expect, and made me rethink assumptions and judgments. A truly wonderful personal story told in an intelligent but straightforward way. I especially liked how the filmmaker pulled his mother’s diary type — very effectively. I read the previous comment and want to point out that the sound was good when I watched it, and I suspect that the film was slightly modified, or the theater could have contributed to the deterioration of sound quality for another author.
