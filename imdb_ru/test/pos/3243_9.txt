Heath Ledgers, who starred in this film, really annoys me, but overall this is a great watch. Brian Brown is excellent when I usually donâ€™t like him, but then his whole gang is a great job. Jimmy is an ill-fated gangster-imitator who can't seem to do something right (SPOILERS: losing money on pandos, ackos a car and almost robbing a bank robbery), but still comes out on top. <br /> <br /> I did not know that two children were in it from the very beginning, but they perfectly connect some plot lines. <br /> <br /> Overall a damn good piece of Australian cinema 9/10
