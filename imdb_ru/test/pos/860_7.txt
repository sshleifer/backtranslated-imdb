I really liked this movie, and today it is one of my favorites. The story was excellent, although the turn at the end was too predictable, and I knew it would happen too soon. Usually, when this happens, the film is spoiled for me (for example, “Others”), but even knowing the result, I still enjoyed it to the very end. Looking through the comments of others, many were impressed by Kelly Overton (Eve), I'm afraid not. Her performance seemed to me a weak part of the film, unlike the amazing work (or characteristics) of James Haven (Don Wake) ... I hope that we will see more of it. What a great little movie, I highly recommend!
