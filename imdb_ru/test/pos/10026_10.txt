The Warner Brothers significantly intervened in the history of America in the first-class Western film directed by Raoul Walsh “They died in boots,” a somewhat inaccurate, but quite exciting biography of cavalry officer George Armstrong Custer. The film chronicles Custer from the moment he arrives at West Point Academy, until the Indians kill him at the Little Big Horn. This is one of the main roles of Errol Flynn and one of the greatest works of Raul Walsh. Walsh and Flynn teamed up quite often after that, and "They died in boots" reunited Olivia de Havilland as Flynn's romantic interest for the last time. They appeared as a couple in seven previous films. This 140-minute black and white overs is nothing but brilliant dynamic action films, humorous romantic scenes and harsh dramatic clashes between our hero and his opponents. One of the notorious mistakes associated with Colonel Philip Sheridan, who, before the civil war, was shown by the commandant at West Point. Indeed, Sheridan was a lieutenant at that moment. In fact, the commandant was Robert E. Lee, as Flynn’s earlier film "Santa Fe Trail" showed. Another historical decline concerns Lt. General Whitfield Scott; Scott was not the commander of the Union forces throughout the civil war. Warner Brothers introduced Caster as a drinker (probably because Flynn had a reputation for drinking), but in real life Caster did not drink or smoke. Nevertheless, these, as well as other historical nonsense, do not detract from a truly magnificent film. <br /> <br /> “They died in their boots” opens when Caster goes to West Point Military Academy, dressed in an unusual dress uniform with an African American carrying his luggage and taking care of his dogs. After the sergeant of the guard understands that he became an honor guard for the future plebeian instead of a high-ranking foreign general, the sergeant tells Caster a high-ranking cadet Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy from the City for Conquest) to take responsibility for him. Sharp plays Custer on practical work, setting it up in Major Romulus Taipa’s apartment (Stanley Ridges from the Task Force), who quickly supersedes Custer. Naturally, the mutable Caster attacks Sharpe in a public brawl. General Phil Sheridan (John Litel from Sons Katie Elder) is ready to fire Custer from West Point for inappropriate behavior. It turns out Sheridan cannot rule out Custer because Caster did not register. Once he enters, Caster creates a mediocre academic reputation with a willingness to fight and accumulate flaws in abundance. When the American Civil War begins, West Point finishes cadets who have not yet completed training, and throws them into battle. Custer is one of the last cadets to go to war. No matter how he tried to fight, Custer meets his future wife, Elizabeth Libby Bacon (Olivia de Havilland from the Santa Fe Trail), and they swear to each other, despite the fact that Mr. Bacon (Jean Lockhart from Jean Lockhart ") Carousel"), which hates the look of Custer. It seems that Bacon ran across Custer in the saloon and insulted one of Custer's friends, and our hero reprimanded Bacon. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, in Washington Caster was desperately looking for a translation in the regiment, but Major Taipe his cooling his heels. Caster made friends with the round lieutenant general infield Scott (Sydney Greenstreet from the Maltese Falcon), and they share an appetite for creamy Bermuda onions, which becomes one of the characteristics of Custer. to get his team. During the Battle of Bull Run, July 21, 1861, Custer does not obey anyone except Sharpe to strike at his senior officer and hold the bridge so that the infantry can cross it. Wounded in the shoulder and sent to the hospital, Caster receives a medal, not a military court. When Confederate General Jeb Stewart threatens the Union army in the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania, Scott is shocked by the chance of South winning. When the brigadier general cannot be found, Scott prompts Taipea to nominate the first available officer. An error has been made, and Caster is promoted. Incredible at first glance, Custer seizes the moment and hacks into the progress of Stewart. After the war, Custer idle and begins to get drunk with the guys in the local salons. Sharpe appears as a dishonest promoter of the railway, and together with his father they are trying to enlist the support of Custer as president of his railway so that they can get the money. In the end, Libby intercedes on his behalf with General Sheridan, who commanded the army, and returns him to active service as commander of the 7th Cavalry. When he takes command, Custer finds the 7th Cavalry a drunken party and is not surprised that Sharpe is in command of the alcohol in the fort. Meanwhile, Custer breaks into the Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn of Arms of Navarone) for the first time and takes him into custody. Of course, the Crazy Horse runs away, becomes an opponent of Custer, and they fight. <br /> <br /> As soon as Custer put down the Crazy Horse and the Indians, Sharpe and Taipei, as a government agent, conspired to destroy the peace treaty with the Sioux other Indian peoples. They also ensure that Custer is accused of having hit Taipei in a saloon brawl. On the way to Washington, Custer discovers the treachery of Sharpe and Taipe, who staged a golden blow in the sacred Black Hills. The settlers rage, and the Indians fall on the warpath. Caster sacrifices himself and his 600 fighters on the Small Big Horn in a decisive clash with 6,000 redskins. Lancer "Diligence" Bert Glennon captures both sand and glory. The long shot of the 7th cavalry leaving the fort at dawn is impressive. As an additional premonition of the inevitable demise of Custer, Libby loses consciousness after he leaves his premises for the Little Big Horn. "They died in their boots" wins thanks to Max Steiner's first-class score, which includes the regimental melody "Gary Owen."
