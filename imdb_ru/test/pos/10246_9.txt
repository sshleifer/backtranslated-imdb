Pearl from Japan, where so many of the world's best films are being shot today. Stylistically, this is not something special. It's just a simple drama (with some comic overtones) about recognizable people leading their lives. Yuko Tanaka, best known for voicing Lady Eboshi’s character in Princess Mononoke, plays the 50-year-old maiden. She takes pride in her health, conducts vigorous workouts every morning, bringing milk up and down the steep hills of Nagasaki. After she finished this part-time job, she works with her usual job as a clerk at a grocery store (called the S-Mart, which made this Army of Darkness fan giggle). On her dairy route lives 50-year-old man, whose wife dies. It turns out that a dairy woman and a man, a child care worker, were in high school, and everyone obviously still has something in love with the other. The film actually has serious problems with the story. When the screenwriter actually wants to unite two unanswered lovers, he uses a rather incredible deus ex machina technique. Climate sequence is also really forced. But most of the film is beautifully small and attentive to the two main characters, as well as many minor characters. The film also has several subsidiary scenes that seem to ultimately lead to weight loss, but never lead to this. I think that the best in the film is Tanaka’s heart-rending play in the role of a lonely milk woman who resigned to being left alone for the rest of her life. Whatever the problems, the film basically surpasses them.
