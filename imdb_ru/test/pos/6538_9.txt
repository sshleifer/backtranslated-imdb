I don’t understand why everyone hates this film, except for the fact that they are just jealous that their musical career never began like the mega-pop star Aaron Carter. Whether you like it or not, but Aaron achieved more success in his young life than most people could have imagined, so it was completely natural for him to appear in the film. Lou Perlman and his company were known for having overly exploited their pop protégés, do you remember how Justin Timberlake invaded the television film “Model Behavior”? Of course, this film is not very ambitious and impressive, but it is not. This is not an attempt to impress people or be an Emmy Award winner, it was released right on DVD. It's just a cute little movie about an awkward teenager who dreams of becoming with her favorite pop star; I know that many of you once had this dream about your favorite singer, do not deny it. This is sweet and gentle, and I applaud him for not entering into the realm of sex, violence and vulgar language, which seem to penetrate more and more of our films today. Where is the propriety? Where is the line? Nowadays, teen dramas come in dozens, because teenagers are a big market for companies, at least this one is more tolerant for me than Bratz (also known as Slutz), when all fake girls run around and say, “Oh, Mach, Goud! ”In t-shirts and miniskirts, and this is better than those films about bloody festivals like Saw. I feel like the girlfriend of the main character, because I was a boring outcast girl in high school who loved Aaron Carter, NSYNC, Backstreet Boys and other pop music and still loves her; and how the character of Aaron will receive the crushing “testophobia”, especially in mathematics. If you judge this movie solely by the fact that you do not like or envy Aaron Carter and his fame, then, of course, you will hate him and tell about him in the reviews. The only reason Dribbling Crossroads Britney Spears got a higher score is because she has boobs. Take this film as it is, not as you want it. I think this happy sample teen movie ends on a high note and makes you want to sing.
