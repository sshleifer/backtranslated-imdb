I liked this movie, and I watch it every day. I think that although acting is not so good, in fact it’s just a group of guys who are having fun with the script. I searched for this film for almost a year, and when I found it for thirty dollars, I just needed to get it. This is now definitely my favorite movie of all time. This concerns the breakup of relations and at the same time jokes about it. I loved all the parts with Don Vito, especially the one where Valo asks him for grapes when they sit on the porch, and he tells him to eat the one that rolls down the porch. IT really portrays him as he really is. Participation in the “Creation” really touched me when they noticed Brandon Novak’s addiction to heroin and how much his friends and family tried to help him. A new film is released under the title “The Seller of Dreams”, telling about Novak's dreams, destroyed by his addiction.
