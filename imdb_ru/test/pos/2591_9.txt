This is a medium cartoon of three (between Rabbit Fire and a duck! It just depends on one gag for too much action. Still a good cartoon. I feel a certain sympathy for Duffy in this, which is rare for me. Duffy is so obviously overloaded that sometimes it hurts to look at it. A good cartoon in a great series. Recommended.
