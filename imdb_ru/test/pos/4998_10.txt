I must have seen a different version from the first one in the user comment section. <br /> <br /> It's really, very good ... Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are great together. The character of Val Kilmer is very similar to him in the novel, although the focus is on Gus and Cal and the Comanches. We'll see what happened to Call and Newt's mother. I won't spoil it, but it gives a lot of insight into Cal's character. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a really compelling job. I thought Steve Zahn had the biggest problem with Robert Duvall! There is a lot of action, humor, tragedy. He has something for everyone. I can't wait for him to go on the air, my family is jealous of me, I have to see it early!
