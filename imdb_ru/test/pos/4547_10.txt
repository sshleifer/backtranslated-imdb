The main advantage of this film is the combination of Chris Farley and David Spade. It was the first film in which this comedic duo showed his humor in the style of Laurel and Hardy. Farley’s obvious physical prowess in the comedy is perfectly complemented by Spade’s sarcastic look at every situation they find themselves in. <br /> <br /> This film is different from other comedy films. Tommy Boy plays with The Blues Brothers as a comedy piece, whose individual scenes and fragments stem from the plot, and do not serve to break the storyline and give the film a weak feeling like many other comedy films. Thanks to Sagal's excellent leadership, every scene is tough and immediately heralds or plays the story being told. He is as important as Farley and Spade. The acting of Dennehy, Lowe, Akroyd, and many others (see a gas station employee 22 miles from Davenport) reinforces the film. <br /> <br /> The film requires repeated viewing, because the film has many small nuances that may be marred by Farley / Spade. <br /> <br /> I think this film is very well made and is the funniest film I've ever seen.
