This is the question that astronauts Roy Tinnes and Ian Hendry ask themselves when they discover the parallel world of the Earth, always hidden on the opposite side of the Sun, in this cult science fiction melodrama of 1969, released here in America as TRAVELING TO THE FAR. The plot of the film was developed by British writers Jerry and Sylvia Anderson, the creators of such TV shows as "UFO", "Thunderbird" and "Cosmos 1999". Sometimes it is very strange: it shows the influence of the “Twilight Zone” and even the 2001 Stanley Kubrick classic: COSMIC Odyssey. Derek Medding's visual effects work, which later will also work on SUPERMAN: FILM, surprisingly well copes with the latest advances in special effects over the past three decades; and although they are not really at the same high level of Kubrick's film, they are very excellent. If you do not expect a movie like STAR WARS and can sometimes overcome a banal dialogue, DOPPELGANGER is a good movie; it was enough for me to rate it as '7' and consider it an undiscovered sci-fi gem.
