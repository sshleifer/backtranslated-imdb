This is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists. Sometimes, even without a 20/20 vision, which offers in hindsight, you can see the cogs and wheels that make these people what they are. The following is one of these views of the past of Christopher Nolan, one of the greatest storytellers of modern times. <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan's cinematography style attaches great importance to giving the story. Although people may complain that it depends too much on the shift in time back and forth, it is still interesting for me to observe how he uses this method in different ways every time. Memento was probably the most convoluted story telling I ever saw. Ignore the seasoned cynics who say that this is an old piece of meat wrapped in an unusual sauce. Memento shows how even the simplest stories can be turned into mind-blowing. Prestige, which was greatly curtailed in comparison, still showed a creative approach in how its three stories intertwined. Even in an exhausted enterprise such as the Batman series, Christopher Nolan sprinkled some of his outstanding yarn weaving tricks, breathing new life into the dark knight. <br /> <br /> The following is an intensive history of intrigue and mystery, where we see an amateur writer who becomes a reluctant voyeur who becomes an ignorant accomplice to many small crimes and finally sees an end that no one could have expected. I had never heard of Follow, I had no idea what to expect. At any moment, the film made me wonder where he was taking me. Since the mysterious corner was clear, I was constantly trying to understand what would happen next. And here I think the film is so good at it. In the film, many elements that led me in pursuit of wild geese. <br /> <br /> The film is entirely black and white and narrated in several time lines, which are now considered useless. The following makes it all in the smallest possible formal or contrived form. There seems to be no reason why the story is told as it is, but you do not feel that you have been taken for a walk. Lack of pretentiousness or self-awareness of arrogance is what makes this style of work a storyteller. Highly recommended!
