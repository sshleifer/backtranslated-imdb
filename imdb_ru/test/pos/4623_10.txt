First of all, I have to say that I really enjoy watching this movie. The way we follow different people at the same time works great, and this is one of those films that really makes you think. <br /> <br /> Spoiler !!!! <br /> <br /> The fact that girls who kill themselves are those you don’t notice. This fact made me think, because that is why she commits suicide in the film ... The director struck me with this, making a film that shows the plot to the audience, and also convey a message that not many people would see his arrival. Some people may start talking about why no one did anything to stop it before she did, but no one noticed her, like no one who watched this movie, either ... I don’t know how you but I didn’t guess what exactly she committed suicide .. you? <br /> <br /> Regards, Jan
