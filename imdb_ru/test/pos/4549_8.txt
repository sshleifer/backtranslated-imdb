This movie is fun. Laughter never stops. Each scene is filled to the limit with a funny comedy. Chris Farley is a brilliant comedian, and Spade plays his part in a T-shirt. Farley was one of the best comics in the face, and in this film (as in all his films) we see how much time and energy he devoted to depicting his character as he saw fit. “Tommy Boy” is a great example of comedy, it always makes me laugh, no matter how many times I have seen it.
