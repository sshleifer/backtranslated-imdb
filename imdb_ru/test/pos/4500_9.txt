This is a film that made me hold my breath ........ wanting to know more about Afghan history and traditions. Today's mantra of the "villain" obscures reality, and inspires to experience the beauty of people and their beliefs. <br /> <br /> The casting was impeccable, the scenery is simply amazing. Acting was first-class, and the fact that the Academy lost sight of it (except for music) is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderful and so emotional. To provoke the "terrible scream" of this observer. <br /> <br /> A film that is worth seeing for the second and third time.
