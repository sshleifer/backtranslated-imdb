Captain Corelli's Mandolin is an old-fashioned Hollywood war romance, but with sex and nudity, presumably without Americans. The story takes place on a Greek island during World War II. Italians arrive to seize the island, but under German supervision. There is a romantic triangle consisting of a Greek couple and an Italian captain. Good performances of all the actors; Penelope Cruz's best work yet.
