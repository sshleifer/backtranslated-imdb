Big fat liar is a pretty funny movie. But while I watched it, I was thinking about something. Some of the events that happen in this movie are incredible. So, in fact, the film is a big fat lie. There is no way he could avoid all this. Here are all the incredible things. <br /> <br /> 1. When he forges, his father chokes on a meatball, and behaves as if he were a father. Jason (Frankie Munez) could not do it. Well, fortunately for us, he did not. So it didn't work, outrageous. <br /> <br /> 2. Even if the grandmother was blind, she could still understand that this was not her granddaughter. <br /> <br /> 3. They couldn't get on a plane, fly to Los Angeles, act like they were coat sellers, get into the studio, and then, and then ... Well, some of the films a bit unbelievable. But it doesn't hurt to say a little white lie. Believe me, I do it all the time. <br /> <br /> Big fat liar, although sometimes incredible, is fun. This is also very funny. But let me say one thing before I continue this review. If Paul Giamatti was not in this film, it would be really bad. That would be awful. A big fat liar is also quite funny, though sometimes trite. I raise my thumb. <br /> <br /> Big fat liar: *** / ****
