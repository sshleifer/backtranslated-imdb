Sometimes, but very rarely, a film tells the story so well that it becomes almost difficult. This film tells several stories so well at the same time that it was the first time that I could not watch the movie to the end. It was too real ... and the characters are so STRONG that watching it became a personal struggle. Seeing how these three men and their families deal with their difficulties, especially with one, often hits me too hard. Now I looked completely without interruption several times, and I understand what I always suspected. This film is a masterpiece. The script, acting, mixing several stories, without being at least a little volatile, everything in this film is exceptional. Seven Academy Awards? No wonder he definitely deserved them.
