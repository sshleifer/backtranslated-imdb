“Sleight of Hand” is my favorite episode from the Rockford Files series. This episode shows the side of Jim Rockford, which is usually ignored. That is, Jim is truly in love with a beautiful woman and is depicted in the role of the father of her little daughter. A woman recently divorced, and she and Jim recently returned from a weekend holiday with a boy.

Hammer series from an earlier era. After much thought and thought, and with the support of Rocky, Jim stumbles upon a clue that causes him to investigate the disappearance with his usual resilience. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Jim's girlfriend, Karen, unwittingly witnessed some kind of mob activity while they were staying at the Buena Vista Inn. In response, crime bosses killed Karen and put another woman in Jim's car. The impostor, who was allegedly sleeping in the back seat, left immediately after arriving home. This was followed by several hidden murders, and Jim set about resolving them, being under suspicion in the Los Angeles Police Department, even though warrants were issued for his arrest. <br /> <br /> This episode causes more emotional reactions than all other episodes of Rockford Files. taken together. James Garner in the role of Jim Rockford is seen in his most vulnerable moment, and yet he maintains his presence of mind to take up this business. This is personal to Jim Rockford. In this case, he is not hired for work, but he is trying to regain lost love in order to save her life. Unfortunately, this is not possible, but Jim is struggling to sort out his feelings, but it is obvious that he will not soon overcome his pain. <br /> <br /> Despite the attractiveness of the storyline, many key questions were raised, but never answered in this episode. (1) What will happen to Jim's young daughter friend? (2) What did Karen actually see at the hotel because of which the mafia killed her? (3) How could Jim drive an impostor in the back for hours without noticing it? (4) The daughter stated that "mom did not return with us." So why didn't the girl scream and cry when she noticed that her mother was away for a few hours by car? Regardless of these ambiguities, “Sleight of Hand” is an episode of “Rockford Files,” which is closest to being a tear. The wait is compelling, and the story is told in a sensitive and vulnerable style that makes us feel the pain of Rockford.
