This, which was shown in Italian in a Roman cinema (not as bad as it seems) after being presented at the Rome Film Festival, is to a large extent a feature film and festival film, guaranteeing the charm and admiration of such a special style, funny humor; the ability to draw comedies from the sufferings of others; attractive, fun music; point speeches; Excellent sweetness and humanity - but doomed because of their strangeness and the lack of a convincing storyline, so that average viewers wondered what they were watching and why someone admires it, how it happened. <br /> Andersson gives us almost a series of dry parodies. Running through them is a different topic. Money: the guy at the next table (Waldemar Novak) rips off a rich boredom wallet, talking on a mobile phone in a restaurant over a glass of brandy, then walks over and orders a set of chic suits to order; the dead son calls his illustrious father from a difficult meeting to ask him for another loan. He is devastating because of his depleted investment, while his wife pushes him in bed, wearing only a shiny Viking helmet. <br /> <br /> Depression: a primary school teacher (Jessica Nilsson) breaks down in class because her husband called her “harpy”; the spouse of the carpet seller (Pär Fredriksson) collapses in front of customers because he calls her that A few men have depressive dreams. But hey, this is sweden. Isn't everyone depressed? Love problems: a fat bohemian couple is constantly breaking up; The girl fan has fantasies about lead guitarist Mikke (Eric Beckman). Wives slam doors when their husbands begin to practice their tools. (Music, too, is obviously a unifying theme. In addition to the dashing guitarist, there is a tuba and a drummer who are members of the Dixierland group, and also play on marches and funerals. Each scene has an additional piece of music that cleverly links one sequence to another.) A raging storm outside the window of many scenes, heavy rain, people in it, thunder so loud that it looks like a battle raging all over the land. It also unifies the tone and gives the impression that different scenes occur on the same terrible day. <br /> <br /> Andersson is a master of visual composition and a medium-range static image, while the film is hazy gray. The green look created by DP Gustav Danielsson is perfect because he reminds of the darkness of the Swedish winter, but also shimmers with subtle tones of directorial wit, which completes each scene with a smile. Almost no one knew that dullness could be so beautiful. (Or, perhaps, one of them: Alekskanr Sokurov creates such effects sometimes in very different contexts.) In the scenes and in the film as a whole, there is a kind of stillness that manifests itself in the visual style, the rhythm of the scenes and the isolated humanism. general forecast. In a fully developed style there is something soothing, encouraging. <br /> <br /> Not everything works equally well. Some may feel impatient with the sequence of barely related scenes, which are sometimes read too much, like the work of the writer Saturday Night Live, who needs Prozac. As some scenes obviously excite you or cause laughter, it is obvious that others fall a little flat. <br /> <br /> But some scenes are real zingers, and one clearly triumphant climax of pure magic is a dream, described and then visualized dreams, which is another important thread) in which the fan girl imagines herself in a wedding dress , recently married his ideal guitarist, who plays a delicate series of riffs, while a crowd of fans gathers behind a large window. The point of view switches to the street, and the window slowly moves aside, as if the building from which the newlyweds dreams look like was a train leaving the station to take them to the honeymoon. This is a fresh, delicate and rather sublime effect. <br /> <br /> In the end, in “You the Living” (Du Levande) you can feel all the dreams, including the recurring scene, when the bartender always beats the bronze bell and announces the time of the last order, after which all torpid customers get up from their tables and rise to get another drink. <br /> <br /> An Italian columnist called it a “small, wonderful film,” and rightly so. It limits itself to a dozen ways, but there is greatness in it. Roy Andersson is a little master (like a medieval miniaturist) on the domestic comedies of the Scandinavian darkness, and this film is not like any other. Shown this year as the Cannes Un Certain Regard, it is also the Swedish record for the best foreign Oscar of 2007. It’s hard to say what Bergman would have thought, but Andersson worked with him; known for his carefully thought-out commercials, some of which can be seen on YouTube. Bergman called them "the best commercials in the world." It will be interesting to see whether this director, whose skill is as subtle as his point of view, will begin someday to work in longer segments. In the meantime, any good movie buff should really take a look at this. <br /> <br /> “Schadenfreude” is not the right word. It means enjoying the suffering of others. Andersson teaches us to rejoice in the suffering of all of us.
