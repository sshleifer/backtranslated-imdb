let's face it, you know what to expect when you tune in to Corey Feldmanâ€™s movie after 1990, probably there are boobs, guns and cars. saying that in this film there is something more than just naked ladies (sorry), because basically they are people who are killed in various unusual and, as the name implies, often in "mystical" ways. I love horrible horror, and I love this movie. If you do not, you probably will not. but I think most people are worth a try, it's not so stupid that it will ruin your weekend or something. In general, if it's crazy good fun, a little love for the corpses and the 80s childhood superstar you are in, then you have come to the right place. it's a cracker !!!!
