Barney is about “imagination,” which is what you guys don't have if my preschooler never wanted to play fake, like they do in this show, then I would worry. That 2 or 3 years actually gets everything, which in any case is all about flowers and singing. For those of you who say that all they do on Barney is eating junk food and would better recommend Sesame Street, what about the liver monster - that's all he eats, but I didn't see for someone to comment on this. I agree that sesame is the best educational show, but Barney is just a show for fun. Do not be too serious, if you do not like when your child is watching television and is worried that he understands things you don’t believe, then you shouldn’t; First, don’t prop them in front of the TV, because all this - fake, everything - fake, actors - fake, so why don't you take your fake brain, not use it and not think if you have a problem with a fake TV show for children, then turn it off, play with them yourself and teach them to what you want them to learn, not BIG BIRD, not Bert & Ernie or Barney, which matured before watching all these shows and they all turned out.
