This is not so much a review of “Tales of two sisters,” as a discussion of some small plots, so I advise NOT to read this review if you have not seen the movie, because it will absolutely spoil a few surprises for you. <br /> <br /> In a sense, The Tale of Two Sisters is far from the original, at least from a purely superficial point of view - part of its iconography is taken directly from the Ring or Dark Water, while the storyline itself ( Especially what Brendt Sponseller calls the “rubber reality” aspect of the narrative is reminiscent of Fight Club films (the lead character interacts with someone created in their minds), Mulholland Drive (the character creates an alternate reality in a psychogenic fugue), as well as other minor aspects The Lost Highway, Jacob’s Ladders and, in the main, every mental illness film under the sun, plus the films of Amenabar (Others, Abre Los Ojos), Memory (especially regarding the painful nature of memory) , other. Fortunately, all these similarities do not detract from the overall emotional impact of the film, and I personally find The Tale of Two Sisters an extremely exciting and rewarding experience. <br /> <br /> Many people point out the “confusing” nature of the Narration, but I personally found that the plot line is pretty obvious, even if it is partially depicted in an inconsistent manner. The narrative only becomes confusing for some, because, in the middle of the last third, the story switches from a purely subjective setting (i.e. distorted perception of Su-Mi reality) to an objective one, with memories at the end explaining the origin of Su-Mi and nervous breakdown mental illness. The shift in the accent will inevitably make some people be taken by surprise, but structurally I found that this somewhat resembles Mulholland’s drive mentioned above (although we are not dealing with the reality of the character through sleep, but with his own schizophrenic inclinations — something that, in turn, reminded me of another Lynch movie, “The Lost Highway”). Honestly, I don’t consider The Tale of Two Sisters as a horror film as such, but rather a tragic story about the breakup of a family, as well as an honest look at the character’s mental illness (and I hasten to add that fans of psychoanalytic cinema will love this film). <br /> <br /> In addition, the cinematography in The Tale of Two Sisters is incredible, and visually it is one of the most beautiful films I have seen on the other side of Wong. Kar Wai's 2046. The performances are also fantastic without exception, and I expect to see four more leading actors in the future; not to mention music, but then East Asian films without a great soundtrack seem to be a little far between these days. <br /> <br /> It is likely that some people will look through the most subtle artistic moments of “Tales of the Two” sisters and simply reject it as “another Asian horror film”, ignoring its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytic approach. . But then to each his own. If you can ignore some of the superficial aspects of the film and just accept it for being at heart, i.e. an extremely tragic, heart-rending story, then I see no reason not to recommend it.
