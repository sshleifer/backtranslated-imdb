Uzumaki is a visually striking film, but I felt that part of the storyline might have been sacrificed. There is hardly any character development that would make me feel detached from the film, which is ironic, because, despite all the puns, this film really attracts you with its many small spiral effects and amazing transitions of the scene. First, general cinematography has thrown me off, but as soon as you get used to the general appearance, you will begin to see beauty in this distorted film. This is a great movie if you're looking for a viewer who doesn't have too much substance or a deeper meaning. This is a great horror movie that is not really scary or stressful, but somehow ... creepy.
