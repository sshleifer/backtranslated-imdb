Secondary spoilers will follow. <br /> <br /> This film is even stranger and unconventional than "songs from the second floor." There is no main character we accompany. There is no “plot” in the usual way. There is no emphasis on a happy ending. There is no crowd here. In other words, Roy Andersson returned with revenge. Instead of returning to a convention and a fixed formula, Roy Andersson concentrates his film around the idea. I will not go into what this idea is, but even if you do not “understand”, I promise that you will see the greatest visual depth ever embodied in the film. The majestic scenes from the “songs” fade in comparison here. The work of visual magnificence. <br /> <br /> Be kind to your neighbor, because in the end “we are alive” and only you and I can change our lives. At least that's what I thought when I saw the final scene of the film, when inhuman bombers flew over the city in the film to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> And of course, do not forget to watch this movie when it will be released in limited edition next to you. This is one of those films that can really make you better, for example, de Sica's “Bicycle Thieves”. Very warm and humanistic film.
