OSS 117 was fun from start to finish. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to determine why one film is related to or related to you or not, and I will not try to analyze such an ideal comedy, so politically incorrect that even academic papers should be devoted to this :)! <br /> <br /> Everything is old-fashioned here: women's clothing (sigh!), mambo dance, “singing hero” ... (“Bambino” sounds like Italian) Canzonetta is sung in ... Arabic :)!). <br /> <br /> Hubert is impressive but damn stupid. From all the 007s, he's like Sean Connery, but he is definitely prettier because he is ... stupid, talks all the time, giggles, even has some homoerotic fantasies and rumors about him. In short, as an anti-hero, he swings :)! Sometimes he just raises his eyebrows or frowns, and that’s all it takes to make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Berenis Bejo is the real queen of the film. Elegant, cunning, but with ideals. Aure Atika, on the contrary, turns into a kind of femme fatale. It's amazing to see her with this "sex bomb", you. <br /> <br /> You just can't compare it with Austin Powers! I agree with D. Hartley from Amazon (Seattle, Wash.) About his respect for the genre. <br /> <br /> What's your favorite scene? One of my favorite scenes is the “fight of chickens” with a masked villain. But the truly ideal is to communicate in a cocktail with your friends, as they all mumble with confidence ... This scene alone deserves attention.
