Falcon and Snowman is a true story about two wealthy college students from Los Angeles who became spies for the Soviet Union. One of them, played by Penn, is already a smuggler of drugs, and he has problems with the eyeball. The other, played by Hatton, gets a position at an aerospace firm, where his task is to manage top-secret cable equipment. There he learns about some of the dirty tricks used by the CIA against foreigners that America does not like. Do not forget that the film was set in the early 70s, in the time of Vietnam and Watergate. Shocked by what he learned, the character Hatton decides to betray his country and convinces his friend to join him. None of them have enough brains, and soon they are already without a dizzying path. <br /> <br /> This is not a thriller, but a rather slow tempo. If this is not a problem for you, then it is worth renting.
