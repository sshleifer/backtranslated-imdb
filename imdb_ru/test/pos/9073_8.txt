Flatliners left quite a noticeable impression in my head. The story is developing rapidly and leaves you constantly absorbed and in many cases rather tense. About five wonderful medical students (in particular, Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon), among which one of them developed a mechanism that allows you to stay dead (or become even) for a few seconds, and then return to life. <br /> The procedure is rather "complicated", involving many medical trinkets - injections, electric blankets, oxygen masks, and many esoteric medical terms. I strongly suspect that the doctors invented all these words so that they would never be fired. But, oddly enough, they follow the KISS philosophy (original version for engineers: Keep It Simple, stupid) (extended version for doctors: Keep it Stupid, Simple). The risk of being euthanized by any reading doctor avenger, let me continue. <br /> <br /> So, the first guy, who has stubbornness, hopes to find answers to questions of life that philosophy and religion cannot convincingly answer. He hopes to get an answer (and become famous) through applied science. He lasts exactly two minutes, and then returns to our shocked world. At the time of death, he has a vision of the incident when he was young, which left the strongest impression in his life. He accidentally killed another boy when he was a child, and still feels responsible for it. <br /> <br /> With the success of the first flat-liner, the others follow his example, each of which expands its flat time line further and further to test the limits of how long you can stay dead and experience life after death. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, monsters from the past and the future keep coming back to chase them after they have worked. The first flat liner is haunted by a young guy who torments him when he is alone. The second one, who was filming all the women he had put to bed with, sees how televisions play his video everywhere. The third is often visited by a young girl whom he teased at school. The fourth is being pursued by her late suicidal father, for whom she feels responsible. <br /> <br /> They all go crazy with these persecutions and obsessions and think that the past seems to want revenge. The main focus on leveling the line is that your whole life passes through your eyes, at the time of "dying," whatever stage it is, and you are left with mostly the most powerful impressions of life in your mind. . Since they did not die, these strong impressions somehow surfaced and became the center of their lives. <br /> <br /> All of them somehow reconciled (and extinguished) their past demons. All of them, with the exception of the first one, who realizes that the only way in which he can go through life becomes flat again. During this flat-line session, he sees that he becomes indifferent for the first time, and also sees the boy he killed, trying to kill him this time. The boy kills him this time for a few minutes and thus seeks revenge. Within a few minutes in the film, all that remains is to wonder whether he will return. Fortunately (because most of us like happy endings), the boy frees him from his past, and he comes back to life again.
