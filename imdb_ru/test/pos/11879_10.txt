Who would not want to see only a little of the action of the creature. I wanted Brad Brown to appear in this, because it could make him a little better. Those who love a little drama, because ... wait, I won't tell you, you just have to watch it. There are also several popular actors in this film who ... (I won't tell you because I hate when people give spoilers, so I don't want to be one of those people) Well, I think that's all I can say about this movie.
