An old man rides a bicycle on a country road, when a car appears out of nowhere, knocks him down and continues to move. The rest of the film is about finding out who hit him, why he was hit and what the consequences of this murder would be for the rest of the village. “Separate Lies” is truly a British film. I'm not saying that car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but how everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hardworking, respectable citizen with a tough attitude to the tragedy. His wife Ann (Emily Watson), who is twenty years younger than her husband, is more emotional, more impulsive and more prone to drama. <br /> <br /> The man who truly animates life in this sleepy village, Millionaire Playboy William Buhl, played by the adorable diabolical Rupert Everett every scene at my best friend's wedding). In Separate Lying, Everett is cruel, cold, and selfish, but he is an absolute blast on the screen. No, this is not so exciting for the title of the film (“Separate lies.” How did they end up with this shitty and catchy title? Did they simply not have a marketing team? Did they just now make sure people saw this movie?) But for the title is a heartbreaking drama about the power of forgiveness.
