I saw this movie when it was released to the cinema. It definitely needs to be remembered, I just recently forgot the name. A friend found it using an online search. <br /> <br /> One Dark Night is rather unusual for the suspense / horror genre of that time, because there is no blood in it. This is teenage fear, but teenagers are respected in their own way. This is a good old school movie with props and scenes that reflect the times. For example, our hero rides a motorcycle without brains. <br /> <br /> As mentioned in previous reviewers, One Dark Night is currently available on DVD. The original minus was not available to go DVD. Some of the changes in the coil are a little rough, but this does not take away history. The colors are bright and the lighting is very good. <br /> <br /> Adam West plays a rather minor role in this film as RayMara's son-in-law. His role as a powerful and indifferent husband, fortunately, is short. <br /> <br /> The story is built throughout the film. Unlike many horror films of that era, One Dark Night is a great story that gives the viewer time to realize what is happening. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes or so of One One Night make it so memorable. RayMar telekinetic abilities are used to open old graves in a mausoleum, pull out coffins, open them, and move the corpses around. Attention was paid to the smallest details in the final scenes. Rotting worms, riddled with worms look very real.
