Vincenzo Buonavolunta, a man who has worked for years at a steel mill as a maintenance technician, which the Italian owners have sold to the Chinese, comes at the end of the meeting where the purchase is organized, because he wants to tell the new buyers the deficiency he found, and he thinks that he has a solution. He is not very sympathetic to the old Italian leadership or the new Chinese owners. He even argues with the translator about exactly what term he wants to use to express his concern. <br /> <br /> The next thing we see is that Vincenzo is coming to China, trying to contact the new owners. To his surprise, someone new to the head, as Mr. Chong, the man he was trying to warn in Italy, was fired. His next quest is a woman who was a translator, Liu Hua. He finds her working in the library, but she tells him that she unequivocally blames him for having been fired from his job. Liu, who sees Vincenzo’s desperation, agrees to accompany him to find his steel mill. <br /> <br /> So Vincenzo and Liu begin their journey through the gloomy countryside, which includes traveling by train, boat, bus and truck to remote areas of a gigantic country. Finding the right factory at best is elusive, but Vincenzo discovers a completely alien life, and also finds a good soul, which, without hesitation, helps the Italian, despite its initial aversion to it. . <br /> <br /> Gianni Amelio's film is a kind of journey. He takes the viewer to an unknown territory. In some comments, Vincenzo is compared to Marco Polo, the great Italian traveler, although the similarities are not quite noticeable. The film holds our attention in the early stages of the journey, but it begins to become somewhat less pleasant, since Vincenzo is in distress after parting with Liu. Mr. Amelio is an interesting director because he clearly demonstrates this film, which he was working on adapting Erman Ree's novel, which we have not read yet. <br /> <br /> Sergio Castellitto is the only reason to watch a movie. This multi-faceted actor brings a lot to the film, which, in a sense, is for him a tour force, since he can be seen in almost every frame of the picture. The combination of Amelio and Castellitto turns out to be the winning combination. Ling Tai, debuting as Liu Hua, has some great moments and demonstrates good chemistry with her partner. <br /> <br /> Luca Bigazzi photographed the Chinese landscape in all its joylessness. We see China, which is not a beautiful postcard. Mr. Bigazzi captures all the gray brightness, characteristic of those places where the film is shot. Franco Pearsanti’s musical score serves the film well.
