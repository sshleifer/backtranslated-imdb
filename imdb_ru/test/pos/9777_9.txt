I have heard a few comments, especially from prisoners of war, that CHANGI is not historically accurate, and that it is disappointing. Perhaps this is for those who actually had to go through it, and much worse. But for the rest of us who really have no idea how the Japanese treated prisoners during World War II, CHANGI is a great introduction. But CHANGI is not a war documentary - if that were the case, then the aspect of historical accuracy would be paramount. This is a mini-series with fictional characters and fictional situations (although they are based on real events that I have heard and read about), and in the center of the story is the ideal of partnership. This group of young Australian soldiers, captured by the Japanese and in terrible conditions for years, became companions in misfortune, and after the war their friendship lasted throughout their lives. It is also a cultural study of the differences between the Japanese of that time and the Western world with its music, games and entertainment: in part 5, when it becomes clear that Japan will lose the war after Germany’s surrender to Europe, the colonel of the Japanese camp insists that his country should the culture of their prisoners - to win the people, you need to win their culture - and for this you need to understand it. Overall, Australia continues its rich tradition of producing exceptional television mini-series and is the unsurpassed world leader in this regard: receiving the AFI award with CHANGI is MY JACKER, an adaptation of the novel by George Johnston, as well as a worthy winner. The mini-series of recent years includes “Rose Day” (the story of the investigation of the train derailment in Glanville), “Kings in castles” (adaptation of the historical narrative of Maria Dyurak about her pioneer ancestors) , who travels to London, is changing and developing), and (somewhat disappointing) the adaptation of Bryce Courtney's powerful novel, POTATO OF POTATO. Less recently: Nancy Cato's broad saga about life on Murray - ALL RIVERS RUN; Cusack and James's brilliant novel about post-war life in Sydney - COME IN SPINNER; Outstanding innovative saga by Colleen McCullough - "Birds in thorns"; RIVER KING; Roman Ruth Park "Harp in the South"; Bodyline; EUROKA STOCKAD; Anzacs; and so on, etc. (Of course, there were some not very good productions - for example, MOBI DICK, MAKE OR DIE ON THE BEACH, SHORT BIRDS: EMPTY YEARS; and so on ...) However, as a rule If an Australian mini-series meets you on the way, make sure you see it - and this is twice as much for CHANGI, a superbly directed masterpiece. Rating: 9/10.
