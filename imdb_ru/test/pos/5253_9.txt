I had a son for the weekend, and my parents called me and said that they want us to meet with them in the movies together. When I got there, my mother said that she really wanted to see “Women,” and asked if my son and I objected because it was marked as a chick's click. I reluctantly agreed, thinking it would be another film like the First Wives Club. I must say that I was very surprised to find that I really enjoy the film from the opening scene to the credits. It was a great production, and the actors were flawless in their roles. My son and I laughed at the whole film, and we are glad to see it. It was made for a good Saturday movie, and I highly recommend it to everyone, men or women.
