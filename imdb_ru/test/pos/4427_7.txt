Vault by Shaun K. Inlou <br /> <br /> My Architect: Son's Journey 2003 - Nathaniel Kahn Not rated: 116 minutes Vault rating: 7 <br /> <br /> What a thing to be without father. “My Architect: A Son's Journey” follows Philadelphia director Nathaniel Kahn, who is desperately seeking answers from his father, famous architect Louis I. Kahn, who died in those 30 years. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn died at the train station in 1974 and left behind more than one family. The funeral service, when the director was still a boy, was, shall we say, an unpleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> We find that Nathaniel knew his father only passively, because of his sporadic meetings with his mother, which he tells us, he loved deeply. This film is about a boy who is looking for his father and, possibly, himself, visiting his work, as if the magnificent buildings are kept secret. <br /> <br /> Of course, Louis Kahn was a talented architect, but “architect” is a cold word. This man was a large-scale sculptor who spoke about his craft in an airy manner of silence and art. <br /> <br /> Among his notable works, which were studied with love in the film, is the Salk Institute (1965). The Kimball Museum of Art (1972) and the monumental complex of the Capitol in Bangladesh (1983). The part of the film where Nathaniel first visits Dhaka, Bangladesh, finds work, but not this person. <br /> <br /> The film is a big winner due to the large amount of filming of this very public person when he worked in New York. and as a professor at Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania. Many of Han’s contemporaries and associates also help to reveal the director’s father. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the viewer does not seem to have come to a particularly pleasant place. The answers that Nathaniel Khan is looking for seem empty. Not good enough. <br /> <br /> In scenes where the director meets with his half-sisters, as from different mothers, one can feel the stress of years, unhappiness and suffering. We can expect them to get angry, but only the camera saves them from hostilities. Each of these children clearly lost something. <br /> <br /> It could be noted that Khan, who seemed to be a staunch perfectionist, never became rich. Instead, he became noteworthy. As if he sacrificed his family for his art. This is very sad and great. <br /> <br /> April 28, 2005
