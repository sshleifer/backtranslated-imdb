I have been interested in this film for a long time, especially after reading several online reviews of the DVD edition; however, I continued to postpone his purchase due to the excessive price tag and the complete lack of appropriate supplements. When it came out of print earlier this year, I finally gave up - but the entire order (which included many other very desirable names) was lost along the way! Fortunately, the DVD was reissued at a bargain price - and I'm sure glad that I took it! <br /> <br /> In any case, this is one strange film and a real sleeper: an initially confusing but striking occult story that manages to hit the bull's eye in both the inaccessible atmosphere of a small town and the innate eeriness of sinister events — on. A small cast makes a great response to a concise, fascinating and clever scenario: in particular, the lead Stroter Martin, in particular, makes the dialogue sound better than it actually is with its nuances in the role of the city doctor / witch coven head; L.Q. Jones and Alvi Moore (both of whom also produced the film!) Offer solid support as a sheriff who is without any stupidity and his assistant comic fan. <br /> <br /> The plot combines elements of various earlier films about witchcraft. and supernatural, and not just obvious names: the fact that the city is held under a spell that initially cannot be identified, for example, instantly reminds of a similar illness of one particular bourgeois household in the sublimely surrealistic Louis Buñuel DESTROYING ANGEL (1962)! the angle of "obsessed children" was borrowed, perhaps from the Village of the Damned (1960); there were many films — especially the recent harvest — where the witch coven’s satanic rites are shown: from THE CITY OF THE DEAD (1960) to DEVILES OF DEVELOPMENTS (1968), but since the process takes place in modern America today (albeit in remote areas) and revolve around elderly witches (in search of “rebirth”), the film that they most recall is the “ROSEMARIAN CHILD” (1968). <br /> <br /> Occult scenes (accentuated as largely due to foggy exteriors, as well as the dark lighting of a brightly decorated house in which devilish events take place), they are presented in a completely natural way, which makes them alarming. and extremely effective - especially the opening sequence involving an army tank, the crushing of a machine (!), the frenzy of the devil doll (a concept that was done to death over the years, but here, it causes undeniable free-play), a sequence of surrealistic dreams (set inside the ice chamber, where all the victims are kept, as they cannot be buried!), the sequence where the witches attack the doubting member of the coven, the decapitation accomplished by the mounted medieval knight (!), and the long finale of the “black mass” (with the witches in accompanied by the corresponding child, whom they will “capture”, all dressed in red - with the exception of Martin dressed in black, who presides at the ceremony), which ends with ritual mass suicide! <br /> <br /> The film also has the courage to deliver a sad “curtain”; It's so refreshing to meet the title (albeit a low-budget production) from a large Hollywood studio Columbia, which so manages to go against the grain (as I said, the film is rather strange - it also applies to editing and evaluation)! It is also strange that such a cool - and cinematic - horror proposal {sic} should come from a television director, most often associated with westerns and other family fare! By the way, the same topic was almost simultaneously discussed in the n-th collaboration of Christopher Lee / Peter Cushing “NOTHING, BUT NIGHT” (1972; which Lee himself produced!) - a film that I foolishly missed about 20 years ago when it was shown on local television, and which has been MIA since then !! <br /> <br /> P.S. This review of The Brotherhood of Satan will certainly contain spoilers, but then the synopsis and pictures presented on the DVD cover will still be able to be played!
