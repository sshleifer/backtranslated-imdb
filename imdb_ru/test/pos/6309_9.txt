I was a little worried about the cast and acting in Italy, and then came “Le concguenze dell'amore” and Tony Servillo. For a long time I did not see such a charismatic actor on the screen. Paolo Sorrentino wrote a wonderful story about loneliness, and Tony created one of the most memorable characters in the movie in recent years. The film is not quite perfect, but “Titta di Girolamo” will stay with you long after the film appears. Tony, please continue to act in films, you are probably the coolest actor today (and not only in Italy, his performance deserves international recognition). I rate this movie 9/10.
