I saw this movie last night at the “Pre-Code” film festival, and I have to tell you that when Gary Cooper turned his head to his opening close-up, the entire audience gasped. He was just beautiful. <br /> <br /> Aside from Cooper's gaze, this film shows Ruben Mamoulian's directorial perfection. Beautiful scenes, creative camera angles, symbolic allusions - Mamulyan just continues to explore the director's environment and invent innovations. <br /> <br /> This was Sylvia Sydney’s first role in Hollywood after her success in New York, and she’s as cute as the leading lady Gary Cooper should be. It's nice to see her in a role with a tougher advantage than many who have given her - so often she looks as if she is afraid that someone will hit her. <br /> <br /> There are many familiar faces in this. the film, including the wonderful Winn Gibson. The most striking is Guy Kibby, known for playing stupid rich people like a grinning and deceitful assassin. <br /> <br /> To date, there is not enough of such films on the VHS or DVD before the code, so if you can't find the festival pre-code near you, try to broadcast the Turner Classic Movies campaign! As for the reviewer, who believes that Gary Cooper was too stupid to conduct a dialogue more complicated than “Yes” or “No”, he probably should consider Kupa’s performance in films such as “Mr. Deids Going to the City” or "Meet John Doe." Although heaven knows that anyone who looked so good should not be smart.
