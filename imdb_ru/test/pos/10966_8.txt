It ends with the statement that “the film you just saw was an improvisation” - you once felt like an idiot, believing that improvisation was a good film and struck by the genius of Cassavetes ... again. Of course, Cassavetis told some guy that in fact he was not improvisation on his deathbed, so ... this is a story about a light-skinned black woman, Lelia, who is crazy about white, and her family: another fleeting white a brother named Ben and a black and black brother named Huey. When she falls in love with a white jerk named Tony, he is unpleasantly surprised when he finds out that she is black, and from there it speaks of the personal aspirations and shortcomings of the three main characters. Hyuugi is a jazz singer in the process of becoming a loser, Lelia is still hopelessly depressed by Tony, and Ben is generally annoyed and cruel, desperately needs something that could shock him from his outdated models of existence. In general, I believe that this is really stasis against changes in a person’s life. I suspect that Cassavetes had organized a conspiracy enough, and it was just a dialogue that was improvised. The dialogue itself is very uneven - sometimes someone will say something very memorable, and sometimes - unforgettable. What is surprising is the degree of embodiment of their characters by amateur actors. Cassavetis took an acting class he taught at the time when he decided to play Shadows, whispered in the ears of the ten best students, and this was the result ... the guys playing Ben and Huey are very good. At first I didn’t like Lelia, but as the film progresses, you see that she is more and more becoming one of those actors who becomes better as tension and drama increase - not necessarily the best in small talk. Shadows are hailed by many as a precursor to the movement of indie films (created in 1959), and this is definitely recommended.
