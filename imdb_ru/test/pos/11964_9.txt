When someone thinks about the Soviet cinema, Eisenstein’s propaganda masterpieces or Tarkovsky’s dark reflections usually come to his mind. They are, of course, excellent films, but, as a rule, not the most interesting material. However, countries in the Iron Curtain obviously enjoyed their escapist musicals as well as the states. In fact, from the 1930s to the 70s, forty of these enchanting songs and dances were released for great public adoration. However, they were not heard at all in the West, therefore this documentary is trying to correct this situation. He does an amazing job by showing off these films and putting them in the appropriate cultural context. Despite the fact that I was never a fan of musicals, I found that this documentary is completely convincing from beginning to end. This proves that no matter how many films you can see in your entire life, you only see the surface of what is there. <br /> <br /> As for the videos themselves, they are very entertaining. While some musicals are frank propaganda that shows workers singing about how much they like to work under the regime, some films (especially later ones) look quite complete in terms of production. Plus, they are all very polite because of how alien they are to my western eyes. There are several similarities between them and American musicals, to which I’m used to, but having strict government control over the message gives them a surrealistic advantage. They, of course, do not look like musicals made in the West. This documentary is one of the most bizarre and entertaining films I have seen recently, and it is absolutely indispensable for any movie lover. (9/10)
