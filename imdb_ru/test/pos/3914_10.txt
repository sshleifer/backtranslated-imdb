PEOPLE OF STUFF. You should not welcome when Paris is killed in the head with a pipe! That's rough! What did Paris do to you? What if it was you? You would not want people to root for your death! In any case, it was really terrible that I liked, and it was cool when Elisha's finger was cut off. It was strange that they didnâ€™t have two sons, they had a tree and that was all, It makes room for wax figures 2: Resurrection or something. Paris played well on the scene of persecution. Chemistry Elisha and Chad gorgeous, they deserve an Oscar. My friends and I were upset when that guy said that Paris was hot and that her cousin Skeeter was looking at him. Lol.K bye.
