I find it hard to believe that this film has such a low rating. This is perhaps one of the best comedies ever created, and, of course, the best Bollywood comedy of the 90s. The film did not look good at the box office, and people saw it diametrically opposed. I assume that most people did not expect this to be a total comedy, and they expected a regular film. If you like comedy, this is a must see. And Amir Khan is outstanding.
