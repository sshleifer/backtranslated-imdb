A very good movie! I watched channels on my TV and usually ignored channels that broadcast dramatic films, but then I saw this channel that shows old school films, and it was there that I saw this movie. At first, when I saw the name “The Cure”, I thought it would be boring, but then I was hooked when I saw that Brad Renfro was filming this movie (because one of my favorite films of all time is Client where brad is also a star). Then the scenes got better and better. The story is so beautiful and touching! I cried a lot in this film, which I usually don’t do. Great casting! and in this film there are so many beautiful lines / quotes that are very striking and made me cry a lot! Now I bought my own copy on DVD and always recommend it to everyone!
