I went to see this movie because Joaquim de Almeida was in it. Joaquim had a rather small role, so it's good that I liked the movie by itself. In fact, I really liked it! <br /> <br /> The film is about two characters, Albert and Louis. Albert is shy, retiring, Louis ... well, Louis is not The story revolves around Louis asking Albert to allow him to come to Albert for a while. Louis just got out of jail. <br /> <br /> Albert and Louis have known each other since childhood, and, of course, whenever they do something together, problems arise, and it is Albert who always takes a fall. <br /> <br /> The action of the film is based on the adventures that flow from the visit of Louis. On The Run is a chronicle of crazy, crazy situations. However, Bruno de Almeida and screenwriter Joseph Mignon (“After the Workday”) do not always take you where you count. There are twists that add depth to this film. Of course, there is a lot of frank comedy, but there is also a lot of subtle humor. <br /> <br /> There are also some good performances here. Alberta plays delightfully Michael Imperoli. He is well acquainted with these days from the HBO soprano series. <br /> <br /> Louis plays John Ventimiglia, who fills his character with an attractive children's quality. (no matter what he does, you just have to love Louis!). <br /> <br /> Both of these actors are excellent in their individual characters. With Imperoli, you want to hug him and take him home to mom. Ventimiglia, well, you won’t know if he should be slapped or taken to his home (and NOT to mom!). <P> <br /> <br /> There are other outstanding performances. The character of Rita plays Drena De Niro (yes, Robert's daughter). The audience adored her. In a conversation with others who watched the film, it was interesting to discuss whether Albert or Louis was their favorite of the two. But everyone loved Rita! <br /> <br /> Is this movie perfect? No, I can not say that it is. Many times I wanted the director to have a larger budget for the work. There were some scenes that required greater budgetary freedom. (Give this guy a decent budget for work, and I believe that you will see a movie that will make you stand up and notice.) <br /> <br /> The final sequence was a bit of a budget sacrifice. However, with or without a budget, the final screen shot, in my opinion, gathered the talent of an actor and director into an unforgettable, emotionally effective scene. <br /> <br />
