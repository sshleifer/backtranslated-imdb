I am surprised that so many viewers did not find all the symbolism in the film ... this is what made the film an incredible piece of art! This story is about the saddest content that can contain a film, but this is one of the best films I've ever seen, because of the need for my own imagination and brilliance of the plot. <br /> <br /> If you pay close attention, the message is there. The younger brother is killed by his stepfather. The older brother came up with the story that the van flies as a way to cope with the pain of his brother's death. There are those who argue why he should lie to his children with this story. For me, the answer is that he does not want to share this disgrace with his children, or that he blocked him and replaced his memory of this terrible event with the thought that his brother is flying to a safe place. I read some reviews that believe that he was an only child, and that he created a younger brother as an escape to cope with the cruel treatment he underwent. Although this is an interesting idea - I like it when the imagination comes up with it. I do not think that he would lie to his children that they have a little brother. But I think it is quite probable that he lied about the death of his younger brother. However, I like this idea of ​​ending much better than the idea that there was no symbolism in the film at all. <br /> <br /> There are many different options in the film, but if you take the film at face value ..... two brothers create a van that flies to escape from an abusive stepfather - you missed the brilliance. The fact that I could see the subtle messages in the script made the movie incredible for me. It requires your own thought process and your own imagination to make it work ... dig deeper when you watch it. You will be amazed by the genius contained in the film. The only other film that I saw as close as possible to the symbolism and subtle messages is “Pleasantville” ... but this is a comment on another film!
