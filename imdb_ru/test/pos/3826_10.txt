I watched the original External Limits in real time when I first broadcast, and since then I have watched the entire original series again and again in repeated runs and on DVD. I find the New External Limits WELL, rather than just a remake of old reread episodes, as some of the more youthful commentators have suggested. <br /> <br /> With seven (7) years of programs compared to only two (2) Over the years of the original series, producers and writers have certainly added quite a few new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer and very well prepared ( cable series. The plots are intelligent, scientifically accurate predictions of unknown opportunities for a sometimes frightening and inevitable future. <br /> <br /> Although most producers and directors of Hollywood unconsciously consider Sci-Fi indistinguishable from Horror and Fantasy, this series returns to the origins of science fiction in the logical, moral and philosophical projections of modern technologies in their, perhaps, terrible short-term implementation. This series does an excellent job with this task and remains unique in the sense that it avoids the monsters of the “shoot yourself” video games that are presented mentally for the majority of the current generation. He has brains, a story, a message, and good fun. This is an adult TV series without unbearable teenage know-alls. Hooray! <br /> <br /> Now if we can get MGM to release the entire New Outer Limits series on DVD, not just the six bad teaser discs, and the 1st season is only available now.
