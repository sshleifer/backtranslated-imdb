SPOILERS Each major mode uses the country's media for its own purposes. Whether it was the Nazi ban on certain leaflets or the Chinese alternative to Tianyamen Square, governments from the very beginning tried to influence people in various ways. However, in 1925, noting the failed revolt of 1905, the Russian communist government supported the creation of this film The Battleship Potempkin. An important part of cinematic history, it remains powerful and beautiful to this day. <br /> <br /> On board the battleship Potempkin, the crew is unhappy. In terrible living conditions and with food contaminated by the larvae, they are angry at their upper class suppressors. But now, after a rotten meal, enough. Led by Grigory Vakulinchuk (Alexander Antonov), the team turns to its owners and fights for their freedom. <br /> <br /> With regard to propaganda, the “Battleship Potempkin” is perfect. By presenting a positive light on the first, unsuccessful communist rebellion, the film became a useful Soviet tool. However, eighty years after the release of the films, and the USSR completely disappeared from the map. The amazing thing about this film is that, although the country for which it was intended has disappeared, the film remains a powerful and worthy example of a movie. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Sergei Eisenstein, the film is amazingly fun to watch. It is true that this is far from what we now consider "entertainment", but the film is a beautiful work of art. <br /> <br /> Whether the scenes on board the boat or the often discussed scenes on the steps of Odessa are all about this movie perfectly done. The music is powerful and dramatic, the lighting is impeccable, even the action, although slightly exaggerated, is perfect for the play. In fact, there is no way to blame the final product for this film. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to know how the Russian people received this film after its release. Praising a country that has not been for fifteen years, it is difficult for us to understand what kind of spirit inspires the film. Although it is a work of art, it is magnificent. Beautiful from beginning to end, this is not just a watch, but they are worth it.
