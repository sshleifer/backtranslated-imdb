The Diary of Anne Frank is the second best-selling book in the world, and for good reason. However, looking at this documentary about her life, which fills in some details where the diary stopped, I thought: “Another documentary about Anne Frank”. I found it to be competent, but not extraordinary. It was my complacency, because I already knew the story of Anne Frank well; much of what the documentary was supposed to tell me was not news to me. <br /> <br /> However, everything changed when I got to the end of the documentary - when I saw the footage of the film by Anna Frank. The emotional effect of watching this footage, which lasted only a second or so, made everything that was before him a thousand times more real - but not only everything that was in the documentary; everything that I had known before about Anne Frank suddenly became more real, more personal. I was always moved by her story, but when I saw these shots, what I felt was stronger, deeper and deeper than any other experience of my life in the cinema. (I knew beforehand that this documentary contained live footage of Anne Frank, and I even saw the footage in the television review of the film, but seeing it in the context of the documentary was a completely different experience. It will ruin everything here.) <br /> < br /> Now I understand that many people still do not know the story of Anne Frank; sometimes discouraging to witness this kind of ignorance. I think to myself: “How could someone NOT know the story of Anne Frank?” In this case, ANNE FRANK: REMEMBERED along with reading her diary is the best place to start. This is a story that everyone should know.
