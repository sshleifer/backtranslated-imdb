Let's be clear from the start: I'm an asshole with the emotional sensitivity of a cubic stone. Therefore, I consider the dramas of people with disabilities, social stigma or any diseases that they have, and constantly cry about it like stupid movies with bad taste. I mean, if you have a message, you can say it without the help of sick or pathetic people. <br /> <br /> However, I liked this movie. We are talking about people with an incredible failure with regard to personal health, but they do not cry about it, rather, on the contrary, they try to live, and people try to “protect” or “take care of” them, actively removing them from real life. The idea to the full is a living life, even if the ending is as sad as possible. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: as the dramas of sick people go, this one is a keeper. This is sad, but still encouraging. I like James McAvoy, even if he always seems to be playing an arrogant rebel. I also say that Stephen Robertson played very well. Either that or he really has partial paralysis. :)
