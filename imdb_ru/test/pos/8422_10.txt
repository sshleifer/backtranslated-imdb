This is a very moving movie. This is a story about a special connection between a child and his grandfather. A villager (Arun Naladeh) takes his grandson, Parashurama, to the city for eye treatment. But he learns that Parashurama (Asvin Chitale) has a rare eye cancer, he must undergo surgery and lose both eyes. The film tells about the emotions and confusion that they experience, and how they perceive it all. The film avoids any melodrama and tells the story in a simple way. Although the film is written in Marathi, the language is not an obstacle at all. This proves that you don't need songs, superstars and ordinary masala to make a good movie. Great performances. This is India's entry for the 2004 Oscars. I hope she gets a nomination at least. Would rate 10/10.
