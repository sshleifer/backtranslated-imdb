THE RED CIRCLE (Jean-Pierre Melville - France / Italy 1970). <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is the coolest movie ever made, in the most literal sense of the word. Men here never lose control and never - never - show their emotions. No dramatic flashes in this movie. Everything is cool all the time. This is an abstract dream world, where people live by their own code, a gangster code, in which the values ​​of the external world are clearly absent. In this masterfully filmed robbery genre, Melville talks about the American crime thriller in his obviously grim and deserted style, but at the same time superbly made with a huge budget of ten million dollars and with four of the greatest French stars of that time. Alain Delon as the main thief, Yves Montand as a former alcoholic cop, Italian star Jan-Maria Volonte as the escaped criminal, and Andre Burvil in the atypical role of the head of the cynical police. <br /> <br /> Melville described LE CERCLE ROUGE as his penultimate film, and this is a truly masterfully styled film. He also said that he wanted to make a color film "Noir", and in many ways he succeeded. The two main factors that influenced this film were the robbery of the 1950 John Houston film “The Asphalt Jungle” and “Riffi” by Jules Dassin (1955). But unlike these films, where we learn a lot about the history of individual gang members, with all their petty needs and worries that motivate them, making it clear that these are not just ruthless types of the underworld, but ordinary people employed in the everyday world. worries and human affairs Melville, however, tells us almost nothing about his criminals. Why was Corey (Alain Delon) in prison? Why was his associate Vogel (Jean-Marie Volonte) arrested first? Or why the former police shooter Jansen (Yves Montand) left the group, was it his alcoholism? We will never know the motives of their actions and never know what drives these people. Women are even more absent than in his earlier films, with “emotional” connections exclusively between men. They don't even have a private life. A sort of emotional twilight zone, and although the situation is not as abstract as in his early LE SAMOURAI (1967), Melville still paints a very creepy world. Melville's favorite actor, Alain Delon, is perfect and almost surpasses himself in composure, if you can imagine. <br /> <br /> Consciously walking around and lasting for more than 140 minutes, Melville spends time telling a story, but this slowly pace and length seem like an ideal way to show the desert world in which these people live. There is nothing out of place in Melville’s films, and nothing is different here, every little detail seems to be key to the story. Although LE SAMOURAI remains my favorite Melville film, even where there are the best films he has ever made, this film also belongs to the best ones. <br /> <br /> Camera obscura --- 10/10
