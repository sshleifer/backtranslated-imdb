I love the premise, but this replay value is only for certain parts (the opening scene, of course). Some characters are a bit outrageous, but they are nonetheless interesting. I think Ballping Sh-T pushed him. I know it was to show that Nick and Casey were feeling bad in Los Angeles, and to show why Casey gave up on life, I just think that the story of memories could be better. Also the Jamaican guy knocking on the phone is smart and interesting, but once again I think the story was told casually. It really seems incredible. I actually believe Swordfish (another film Woods wrote) more than some parts on Thursday, because the government keeps secrets a secret and has organizations that the public will never know about. <br /> <br /> Thursday is the best Quentin film I've ever seen. I think Woods is creative, smart and quick-witted; however, his work needs more maturation to even reach the level of the Natural Born Killer script (not the Stone film). How old is he?
