After the leading actress of the opera died in a car accident, her young understudy Betty comes to the fore. She was very lucky with one problem: she has a fan who decided that he would kill all her friends and make her look. What is his connection with opera and what does he like with Betty? <br /> <br /> I love Dario Argento with every part of my body. And I'm not an orthodox fan, I think. Many people, especially critics, praise his early work (“Suspiria” and “Deep Red”), but in fact are unhappy with later films, such as “Sleepless,” which I liked. My favorite "Phenomenon" is usually greatly underestimated. “Opera” tends to fall somewhere in the middle. Some consider it one of their last great films, others consider it part of their so-called decadence. I really liked it. <br /> <br /> The picture is clear, the music is excellent (unlike other critics, I love the metal soundtrack), female leadership is the one I feel (not unlike Jennifer Connelly from “Phenomena” ”). And the images ... are wonderful. Great cinematography and some amazing killing scenes. The concept of sticking needles to a person’s eyes so they cannot blink ... brilliantly. My assistant Tina thinks that it looked fake, but even if this is the case, the idea is more than enough to pay off. And any great effects like a knife blade rising in a person’s mouth? Awesome <br /> <br /> Jim Harper calls the film “stunning” and draws attention to “innovative cinematography, well-designed cadres and exceptionally brutal murders.” I completely agree with this - one shot follows the camera through winding tunnels, and throughout the history there is a very interesting visual use of crows. Mike Mayo also calls it "a visually exciting eye candy" and praises "clear editing and smooth camera work." Indeed it is surprising that this is not one of the most highly regarded works of Argento. <br /> <br /> Argento returned to the opera with The Phantom of the Opera, which was a bit unfortunate, despite the casting of his Daughter Asia and Julian Sands. Even more interesting is that in the same year, the release of “Stagefright” by Michele Soavi was proposed, in which (as well as in “Opera”) there is a killer in the cinema that kills people participating in the presentation. Both are great movies in which Soavi plays more on the slasher. (Soavi actually worked as the second director at Opera. ... you can draw your own conclusions.) <br /> <br /> My only complaint in this film is length and tempo. Although it is very beautifully filmed and the murder scenes are great, they are not as frequent as they should be. The first takes more than half an hour, and then we get time between them. The main actress should be in constant horror, but she is given time between murders to calm down, as if everything is normal again. Not cool, Dario. We need to maintain low expectations and high intensity.
