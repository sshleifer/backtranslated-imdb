Although I agree that it was a sitcom of the 1950s, I do not feel that it is “typical.” First, Donna Reed was a STRONG woman, as opposed to the usual sitcoms of the 50s. She declared the value and equality of women (remember the episode in which the TV presenter says “just a housewife”), and Donna stands for all the women who do and represent, especially those who do not work outside the home? And when women rebelled against something on the show, it wasn’t something trivial ... there was always something to show that women had the right to be treated with the same respect as men . Remember, Donna Reed was married to the producer of the series, so she had much more opportunities to make her a stronger character. <br /> <br /> Children were smart, but not premature. They were normal children. And they could ACT. <br /> <br /> Something else that highlighted Donna Reed Shaw was that the children not only looked like their parents, but you could feel the chemistry between all the actors in a real life situation, which the characters then went out. Shelley Fabares and Paul Peterson often wrote and noted that they were treated like Donna Reed and Karl Betz’s children, and that adults brutally defended child actors and treated them accordingly. Donna and Alex also had some kind of sexual chemistry, which was not on other family shows. And the characters may be erroneous, and in most cases, and yet, accept for the shortcomings and mistakes. These were not super parents who did nothing wrong and did not have emotional ups and downs. They were normal people acting like normal people. <br /> <br /> Women's rights, drug abuse, child abuse, lonely fathers, poverty, children who need good health care but cannot afford it ... it was all shown on this show. Pretty revolutionary for the era. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed’s show lasted eight years without a reason. And this could have happened if it were not for the divorce of Tony Owens and Donna Reed. <br /> <br /> This show is greatly undervalued and should be shown so that other generations can appreciate the quality. <br /> <br /> In general, I agree with the original poster, which clearly cares about the show, but I think that Donna Reed’s show has much more to offer than entertainment.
