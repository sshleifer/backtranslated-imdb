This film is adorable, though not perfect by Hollywood standards, it includes a gentle look at the wide gap between rich and poor, black and white, which is true in many parts of the world. It appeals to the audience in children's gloves, providing a truthful look at social issues. The children are beautiful, pay special attention to the young man who plays Sipho. Developing friendships are universal, everyone can be related to the choices these young people have to make. The influence of adults is interesting - it seems to be taken from real life experience, because there are excerpts from conversations and interactions in it - just as a child would remember the experience. I highly recommend this movie.
