I really do not tv. The observer - except at the age of 6 to 8 years old and in the General Hospital there were still Luke and Laura - but there are a few exceptions, and I definitely think that “King Korolev” is one of them. Each decade has its own classics, and I think that this show (or damn well) should be one of the best in this decade. His comedy time is amazing and can sometimes be completely weird. On a more "serious" note, the actors more than succeed in conveying subtle - and not very subtle: - the complexities of their characters, not too contrived. One commenter wrote that it might take a couple of episodes, and I agree; this is definitely the type that grows on you, but once you are, you are pretty much hooked. And not without a reason!
