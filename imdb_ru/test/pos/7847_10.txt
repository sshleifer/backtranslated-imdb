During the Civil War, a wounded trade union soldier hides in an isolated Confederate women’s school; where the main owner and the school teacher decide to care for him and keep him until the problems between single and sexually frustrated women and girls begin. The soldier decides to take advantage of this situation, but in the end everything comes at a price. <br /> <br /> “Dirty Harry (1971)” (which was made at about the same time as “Deceived”) may be my favorite collaboration between Eastwood and Siegel, but seeing this, I tend to think that this is to be the best work of couples together. A very untypical, thoughtful and stylish car for Eastwood is always on top with the richly controlled leadership of Don Siegel and the obsessively incendiary music of Lalo Schifrin. His heartbreaking, gloomy and gloomy nature, which intrusively takes root in the psychological image of the film and the manipulative mental struggle that holds sexual depravity, stands out strongly. He diligently plays out and makes him more thoughtful and coagulating blood when these random shocks and bold intentions take hold of exciting tension. The way Siegel illustrates the tempting, slow screenplay by John B. Sherry and Grimes Grice (taken from the novel by Thomas Cullinan) is effectively implemented through harsh emotions and the hard lyrical context of the script. Siegel's strong leadership captures the idyllic southern Victorian setting with such a powerfully decorated photo, and he creates some strangely piercing images with great clarity and restraint. <br /> <br /> Although the performances are really praiseworthy and of high quality. Clint Eastwood, as a softly courteous, sweet-speaking soldier of the chameleon trade union, is very impressionable and delightfully confident. Deeply outstanding Geraldine Page steals the picture, as the seasoned master of the house, and elegant Elizabeth Hartman gives delicate sincerity to her innocent character. Mae Mercer is very similar to the black maid, and Jo Ann Harris is harvesting young students with her temptingly sly persona. <br /> <br /> Honestly, while Eastwood's charismatic character plays a field for his own selfish needs, there are still mixed intentions that what is played (where rivalry between women creeps in) turns out to be no better than their guest in the end. Everywhere in the material there is a dark sense of humor and an ironic touch. What is demonstrated here is just more than your simple little shocker with little thoughts, but one that is thickly overlaid with intrigue and a sense of realism that is hard to shake. This also applies to his extremely creepy title and final song. <br /> <br /> Efficient, discreet, discreet hospitality.
