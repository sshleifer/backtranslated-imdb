Do they no longer make such films ?? although some may say it is good. Although it was one of the first Disney rated PG films, it looks more like the G films that their studio released in the 70s (i.e. Freaky Friday, The World's Greatest Athlete) than the PG movies that came out at the beginning The 80s (i.e., “Sentinel in the Forest”, “Throne”, “Something Wicked That Comes So”). Due to Disney’s support, Midnight Madness clearly had a big budget. The huge cast and many different locations show it. But the madness, the hunt for a crazy and exciting visual style was not enough to save the film from a huge failure ... Failure at the box office, most of us were introduced to the film on HBO in the beginning ?? 80s, in those times when the same films were shown 29 times a week (wait, they still do it!). In fact, HBO did for this film what CBS did for “The Wizard of Oz” ?? they created a huge cult audience for the sweet-sweet mega-flop .... <br /> <br /> The biggest problem that makes this film "bad" is that there are too many characters in it, and very few of them are meat of ?? The "squad" Eddie Dizen does not even have names! The blue team, despite the fact that they are villains, are the cutest and most invest in their characters (except for the girl who can not act and does not have enough action). Harold, whom Stephen First played very well, is truly the only one whose character is fully realized in the film. Another outstanding character is Melio, playing with a huge amount of charm by current director Andy Tennant. Although then - the doctor. Pepper star representative David Naughton was to become a star, his character often turned out to be nasty, especially when he was compared to his brother Adam, Michael J. Fox. Although everyone has their favorite characters, I don’t think that someone who loves the film may not agree that Furst and Fox are the only two characters that you really will know about. <br /> <br /> Despite the many shortcomings of the film and the bad actors (most of whom fell from the face of the earth after this film), it still works because the actors seem to be having fun - and having fun on the set is like having fun on the screen. Come on, what college student doesn’t dream of swimming in a beer-tub, and what kind of zoftig girl doesn’t dream of stealing a show at a local disco ... uh ... I suppose this will be delighted nowadays. Campie, dull-pure entertainment for everyone who was young in the 70s and 80s, is perfectly fitting that this finally got the massive release of the video he deserves. But where the hell is the release of a widescreen DVD with comments, a trailer and the full version of the song that plays in the disco?
