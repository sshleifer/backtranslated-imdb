Watching this movie is difficult, and it would be even more difficult if I knew that the actor playing the main character was actually killed in his house by the police at the age of 19. Pixot (PeeWee) is a street guy in Sao Paulo who is caught in a news bulletin provoked by a murder in which he did not participate. He is put in a juvenile prison, where he is a witness to cruelty and exploitation, which ordinary citizens try hard to believe that they do not exist. When he finally runs away, he and the three comrades survive only thanks to the means they know, crime. What makes a film so heartbreaking is that both Pixot and the actor depicting him clearly do not want to be the characters who made their life circumstances. Pixot tries to trust, love and bind, but in his world there is simply no room for the tender side of human nature. One stays at the end, desperate to do something for Pixotes of the world, but what? Building new children's prisons with higher walls is certainly not the answer ...
