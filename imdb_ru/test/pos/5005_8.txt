Talkshow with Spike Feresten is one of those shows that definitely polarizes the audience. Either you like it or not. Personally, I find most bits funny, but they have "eh?" moments. <br /> <br /> Brackets like “Idiot Paparazzi” are always good for laughter, but my favorite piece is the one-time “Hollywood murderer”. “Comedy for Stoners” is the only regular song that usually leaves me confused (which is part of the point!) Spike and his writing team manage to release a lot of fresh comedies over and over again, so the show never feels outdated. Perestin's mark of humor may not be for everyone, but it is definitely worth a try. <br /> <br /> Mass has spoken! We like this show and we want more. Please note that I am not a friend or in any way connected with Spike Feresten, the employees of Talkshow with Spike Feresten or the Fox network and its affiliates. This is ridiculous!
