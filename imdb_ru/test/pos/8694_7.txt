This film pops up from time to time on ABC in Australia around 3 am <br /> <br /> It starts with a bus wreck in London. <br /> <br /> The films have memories of each character as the movie progresses, plus a Big Ben slow motion photo, going back to symbolize events that happened thirteen hours ago, right down to the bus crash. <br /> <br /> It took me some time to figure it out, but it was nice nonetheless. <br /> <br /> If Shaun Cunningham and Quentin Tarrantino got together and shot a film, this could be the result - because of the memories and small stories related to death. <br /> <br /> I’m not sure about the main characters since I’ve seen him a long time ago, but in fact this is a rare gem.
