Two young friends grow up together in Afghanistan. The events of their lives have separated them, and one of them has been living in the USA for many years. When he receives a phone call, it becomes clear that he must return, because there is trouble in the air. <br /> <br /> This is a film about friendship, mistakes and repetition of fiction. But also a film about darkness, pain and endurance. From joyful young days when I grew up and played games, before decay, back to games in games. This is a slow movie, but not too slow. <br /> <br /> He plays on emotions, and this is perfectly true for drama, but in my opinion, this is too much. This makes him too much tear, losing his little quality that he carries. This is still good, but not fantastic. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 kites are stranded
