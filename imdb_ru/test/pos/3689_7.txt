Unconditional Love begins with a great promise. As directed by P.J. Hogan, the film works fine down to the last third of the film when it falls directly on the face. The screen plays, written by Mr. Hogan and Jocelyn Moorhouse, have shown many possibilities that are eventually lost. It seems that the artistic team behind the film really hoped that he would play differently. The reality is that it is a film that looks in different directions, how to bring it to a resolution, which ultimately fails. Do not get me wrong, the film is incredibly attractive and will resonate with many viewers. <br /> <br /> Coming from a strong cast, we decided to take a look. Extremely talented Katie Bates is the perfect choice to play Grace Beazley, a woman who finds at the beginning of the film that not everything is in order in her marriage. Ms. Bates is a great actress who deserves much better, even when her heroine does not help what the authors force her to do in the film. <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett is always reliable in performance. His role as the lover of the late Victor Fox is well written, that is, until Dirk is lured to Chicago to find the killer of Victor. This is strange and defies any rules of logic. Dirk does not look capable of harming the fly, let alone hunt down the killer with the help of Grace and her daughter-in-law, incredibly funny, Modi. <br /> <br /> In the performance of Meredith Eaton, this little woman, Modi, is one of the best things in the film. She is cheeky and tells when she sees it. Peter Sarsgaard, one of the best actors working in the cinema these days, has nothing to do with the film; he is completely wasted. Dana Aykroyd also has nothing to do. We see him at the beginning and at the end of the film, and his Max does not make sense. It seems that he wants a change in his life and in his marriage, only to return to Grace without explanation, everything is forgiven. <br /> <br /> English actors are good. Lynn Redgrave has the best opportunity, as hysterical Nola. Jonathan Price is seen in the film as a ghost, singing soft songs. Julie Andrews makes a funny contribution to a couple of priceless scenes. <br /> <br /> In the end, the TV show hosted by Sally Jesse Raphael is turned off and adds nothing to the film. The best part is to hear Katie Bates singing. What a beautiful voice she has! In fact, Miss Bates is the best excuse to stay to the end.
