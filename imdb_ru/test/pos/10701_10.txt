Ninja 3: Domination Sam Firstenberg mixes martial arts with Exorcist like horror. The elements of horror thrown on the screen are ridiculous, but the film works like a thoughtless action / martial arts. The fight scenes are well set and exciting, and the film is never boring. Forget about silly conversations, settling action and annoying soundtrack - take some beer and check it out! Highly recommended!
