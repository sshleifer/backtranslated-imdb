Wow, what a great movie! Mr Im done it again! <br /> <br /> His last work, Chun Hayan (2000), was a great movie, but this one is even bigger. This 66-year-old director, selected as the official feature film at the Cannes Film Festival for the second time in two years in a row, is getting better and better at what he does with Korean culture. <br /> <br /> Chihwaseon is about the great Korean artist, (Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up, who was considered a child prodigy in the late nineteenth century. The main story of this film tells about the life of Chang, the Son-up and the historical origin of his time. He was an orphan, but as a teenager he was picked up by a noble man named Kim Byung-moon. This Mr. Kim becomes the mentor of Yang and his lifelong friendship, and continues to support his great talent, which he knew first and foremost. Thanks to the great efforts and natural talent of Chang, his fame is growing faster and faster, as the strength of his country falls on Korea. <br /> <br /> The personality of Chang, portrayed in the film, is very complex and is one of the best actors in Korea, Choi, Min-Sik, deeply entering Young's soul. Suffering eyes reveal the struggle of the life of a great artist. Sometimes he is very serious, but suddenly he turns into a wild maniac. He drinks like an alcoholic and sleeps with courtesans at any time. Even he said in the film: “Without alcohol and a woman, I cannot draw. (Alcohol and women are my only inspirations). In the midst of fame, in order to develop his own style, he travels around the country, and will never give up his pride as an artist for power or money. I do not want to disclose all the details, but I think that you probably got some ideas about the film. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing about this film is cinematography. It’s just so breathtaking, how they captured every beauty of the scenery. Yes, every scene is like a painting by Young. And the script is also perfect. Basically it has a deeper meaning to what a real artist does. For example, Kim advises Jangu in a film that “before you take a brush, you need to set a goal in life.” This is a very touching and inspiring line, and there are many more. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you are going to participate in the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Chikhvasun will be the greatest film ever made that deals with the artist's life in cinema history.
