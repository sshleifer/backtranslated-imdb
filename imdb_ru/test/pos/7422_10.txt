Terry and June, in my opinion, a classic for all times, at the same time bless this house with the late Sid James and the late Diana Copeland, but Terry Scott will be sad to miss, even if he died in 1994. I have all the DVDs before the press, and I look forward to getting all 9, it would also be nice to see that "happy after," released on DVD <br /> <br /> June Whitfield is still strong, and Terry Scott will always live in my memory <br /> <br /> Terry Scott Reap Today there are not so many comedies that I can think of that they will remain in the list of legends, and yes, the middle class bit really affects the wicks of some nations, but I don't mind, I think it would be great to see some kind of celebration of Terry Scott's life
