This review is long overdue, as I consider The Tale of Two Sisters as the best movie ever made. I’ll add this gem to any movie in terms of script, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing or any other aspect of filmmaking. Is it almost perfect in all of them? a real masterpiece in the sea of ​​artificial "masterpieces". <br /> <br /> The structure of this film is perhaps the densest in the history of cinema. I can’t remember any other film where every minute something vital happens. In a literal sense, Ji-Woo Kim seems to have made a film that practically mocks the viewer to analyze it at the most detailed levels. Can a seemingly insignificant object be shown ?? a rack with dresses, two diaries, a drop of blood emanating from a crack in the floor, a bottle of pills, etc. ?? but with careful inspection it turns out much more ?? a hint that helps to sort out this particular scene (or, perhaps, the film as a whole), which almost always contributes to an exciting reflection on the psychological concepts that are hidden in the background, until the viewer's intellect causes them to jump to the fore. Such an event can occur several times during any other film, but in The Tale of Two Sisters such events occur so quickly, ruthlessly, that the viewer should watch the movie in a state of constant vigilance so as not to miss something important. In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill out a dozen other films. How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything else from the movie other than this? It's just the tallest, most excellent form of cinema imaginable. <br /> <br /> The most frequently quoted criticism of The Tales of the Two Sisters is well laid out by Zaphod B. Hood, who falsely claims that the story is an incoherent, unresolved disorder, which uses the disorder to instill a false sense of intelligence, because it does not provides the final set of facts underlying intriguing questions. He claims that Ji-Woo Kim threw a dozen possible explanations and left it at that. In reality, however, nothing could be further from the truth. The Tale of Two Sisters provides a series of irrefutably objective facts that help the viewer identify EXACT cases in each scene of the film. If our good friend Zaphod paid attention, would he notice ?? eg ?? a series of obvious memories that provide enough factual information to understand the film. These memories convincingly contradict the statement of Zaphod about complete subjectivity. The objective elements of the “Two Sisters' Tale” are so obvious to anyone who wants to see them, that a simple statement about the lack of objectivity can only cast doubt on the patience of the viewer, who obviously does not want to put forth even the slightest effort at all. to see them. Can Ji-woo Kim really be accused of impatient viewers who have no desire to understand his film? I think not. <br /> <br /> Please note that I will not insult the intelligence of critics like Zaphod, who cannot “get” the Tale of Two Sisters, because it really has nothing to do with lack of intelligence, since almost like lack of perseverance. The film tells about itself so effectively that the only possible explanation for the confusion is the lack of effort on the part of the viewer. Yes, this film requires a fairly significant solution to the puzzles, but the pieces are combined to create a beautiful picture. You only need to put them together. Remember, the script was written by someone who already had in mind the picture? he simply separated the pieces and skillfully arranged them in pieces to provide a magnificent brain exercise, which when finished ?? bestows the final form of satisfaction and state of awe. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. There are films that seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble by design. Spider Forest (2004), Perfect Blue (1998) and Donnie Darko (2001) are excellent examples of this. The tale of two sisters is not. The irony is that Zaphod argues that Darko is more elaborately constructed than the Tale of Two Sisters, especially considering that Darkco not only does not provide almost ANY objective facts, but also completes the turn, which is the most significant cliche deus ex machina, which could be dropped at the end of any film ever made to provide maximum artificial intelligence. I am ashamed of the fact that I mentioned two films in one sentence, but contrast is important. Although it really bothers me that Zaphod will refer to a film that collapses when subjected to even the slightest intellectual effort, as a way to criticize a film that becomes visible only with significant use of intellectual effort. He apparently likes his “smart” films in the most superficial form. This is obvious when he makes 17 consecutive questions in his review that the film itself quite convincingly answers. Just read the topics of Opiemar in the IMDb A Tale of Two Sisters discussion forum. Anyone who carefully reads these topics and still claims the lack of an objective solution to this film can also stop watching intelligent films altogether, because the answers are so damn obvious. <br /> <br /> I would like to say more, but I came to my limit of 1000 words. All that was said here was to be said. So say it!
