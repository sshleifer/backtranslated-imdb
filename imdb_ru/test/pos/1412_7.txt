Johnny Crawford is great in this film of a restless teenager who came of age in a generation that experienced cultural and spiritual upheavals. Billy Graham does a good job portraying life in this sweet, sometimes banal, but still sincere film. He gives us a look not only at the social scene, but also gives good, solid advice that is relevant today about morals, decisions, generation gap, acquaintances with adolescents (some of the statistics presented in this film amaze today's statistics). It is worth seeing only Billy in his early years. This is a terrific movie. It made me realize that human nature does not change, although hair, fashion and language may change, people still struggle with the same problems that they have struggled with for thousands of years.
