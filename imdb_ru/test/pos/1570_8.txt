This is a sad state in corporate Hollywood, when the film surprises you with the fact that you do not choose the routes that you have seen in the cinema from day one. I literally had no idea how this movie would end, because he went to the left, when I expected him to go right, zigzagging, when I expected that zag, and so on. but he remained a course in itself until the end. This is a sad story. Not because of what happens with Alice, but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads her along this path. <br /> <br /> The plot has a quiet dignity of form, which is usually given to the theater, but the tempo is to use some delay. In any case, this is a very good film, and for some reason I suspect sour grapes from those who scored this low score.
