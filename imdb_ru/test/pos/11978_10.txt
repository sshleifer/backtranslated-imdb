All the people who voted meager 1 in this film are all I have to say: you guys are not mature enough to enjoy this kind of movie. It takes a certain dedication to achieve this level of appreciation. And this is the part of the people that this film is aimed at. You are not ordinary movie lovers! , Back to the film. This one was a gem and was definitely included in the Bollywood Hall of Fame. I would give him the title number 2 for all time, surpassed only by the legendary Gunda Kanti Shah. This film had an impeccable storyline and created a great combination of science fiction and science fiction. Pan's Labyrinth would actually be ashamed of the balance created between parallel stories. And now I really need to mention the star cast and even the star performances (that is the word from NOW) of them (special mention goes to Mr. Nigam for the best debut in the history of any film on this earth). Each actor in this film was very carefully selected, and the role was made specifically for them (and for their age, I must add). Manisha Koirala still looks like sheâ€™s 18 years old, and yes, with this figure I would have raped her too. Are you wondering where this rape thing came from suddenly? Yes, rape is what this movie is based on. And this is not like your usual Bollywood movies. If you happen to be an atheist or agnostic, this film is for you again. Because this film can heal your faith. I do not think it would be too far, saying that this film can cure cancer. Only the people who need it most cannot appreciate its strength, charm and never-dying beauty. HH, so sorry! <br /> <br /> The only flaw in this movie: In a dream, baby! It was impeccable. <br /> <br /> The only minor complaint: the director also did not act in the role of Mithun Yes. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil it anymore. Just go and see. TODAY. And if you like it, here are some more recommendations from me. Gunda, Desh Drohi, Aparichit, old horror films of the Ramsay brothers, Loha, the tiger Indra and Shivaji.
