This is basically a comedy with fools, with a strange rhythm due to some dramatic elements. For Michael J. Fox and Paul Rubens, this was their first film (previously Fox was shot in a short television series and a television film). <br /> <br /> Since the movie is basically a type of race / scavenger hunt In a movie like Cannonball, This is a crazy crazy crazy crazy world, or more recently, Rat Race, there are no main characters here. Instead, there are character groups that break screen time and take into account tons of mini-plots. Usually such films are a way to squeeze the maximum number of stars (or half stars) into a movie. <br /> <br /> There are teams in this, one of which is the main team that owns Fox, which is the only characters to be developed. Their plot is more of a Disney stereotypical view that the college boy doesn’t pay attention to his younger brother, whom he considers a lazy punk. Since they are forced to work in a team with a friend of their older brother, they are forced to work together. Since this is the main plot, it gets more time on the screen. <br /> <br /> Some other silly plots stand out. "Blue Team" talks about a rich overweight child, whose father just wants him and his girlfriends out of the house. As a result, they got a cool custom van, which was on-board computer (in 1980!), To instantly solve riddles and also play video games with time saved! One of the participants, Stephen Furst, continued to play Dr. Axelrod in “St. Elsewhere ”, and later was in“ Babylon 5. ” I also admit that I’m still laughing when Barf, trying to decipher the word a'la Scrabble, comes up with: “Fagabaf?” In my opinion, this is much funnier than Bart Simpson’s “Qwyjibo”. <br /> <br /> The other three teams have stories that are somewhat related to each other. The green team is a bunch of boys from the brotherhood, mostly with beer jokes, which end with the hunt leading to the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery. They have a chance to intimidate the red team with two feminists and two merry twins. The team of white nerds is headed by Eddie Dizen, who was previously in Lubricant, but continued to play an important role as a computer geek in War Games, and then assistant Tim Conway in some of the Dorf series. <br /> <br /> If you grew up in the 80s, then there are classic moments in the film that bring back memories. Early video arcades, when they were cool, have always been a plus in my memory. Look for Paul Ruvims and his guns. There is also a miniature golf course and a disco on the rollers. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is a family film, simply because the profanity is almost non-existent, and a small amount of sexual humor is completely innocent. A strange move thanks to the creepy dramatic moments of the yellow team will make parents sleep, while their children can giggle over the giant melons in Fat Burger (oh, do they actually have a special dish with melon? Does that have to be true, right?)
