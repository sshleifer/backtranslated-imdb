Like several other reviewers, I am surprised to see a lot of negative reviews about this film. Dan O'Bannon's previous project was the pioneering 1979 Alien. Because he and Star Wars introduced the “Used” or “Dirty Space” stylistic approach in the artistic direction for such functions, this does not mean that it was the only way to produce them. <br /> <br /> Instead of throwing Lifeforce out of control, as a kind of trait and primitive exploitation trait, it is important to recognize that the film is based on the “respected” traditions of British horror and science fiction — in particular, Hammer and American International, such as Quatermass (in particular, Quatermass and the Pit, 1967), Doctor Who and Day of the Triffids (1963), if not the works of Jerry Anderson (UFO, Cosmos: 1999) and "Petrels"). But none of these influences would come as a surprise if other reviewers recognized the scientific assessment of the writer O'Bannon for “The Queen of Blood” (1966) and “This! Terror from the beyond the boundaries of space "(1958) - the direct sources of the" Alien "(1979). <br /> <br /> Of course, there are some “hereditary” elements in this film, but perhaps it is worth comparing this film with its more direct peers - “American werewolf in London” 1981 and “Company of wolves” (1984) - other films of the 80s, which are divided “looking back”, while they adapt these stories to the spirit of the time of the 80s. All three films were based on earlier incarnations of the same, but largely shared their themes (because they could), and at the same time they recognized the mocking, humorous aspects of their projects. <br /> Neil Jordan's Wolves played in many psychoanalytic memes that surfaced in the 80s, while American Werewolf called its adult film theme. This is called an “art license”, and the adaptation of these three films is no less relevant than the last-day drama inherent in the Scream franchise, “I know what you did last summer” and “Final Destination”. But these teen-oriented films seem part of the box office trend, while films from the 1980s, such as Lifeforce, belong to the canon of British science fiction — even if this one was written by an American. <br /> In many respects, this film stands up much better than recent disasters and films about alien invasion (Independence Day, Armageddon, Deep Strike) in the sense that “solutions” are not in battles, armed payloads and testosterone. At the opposite end of the pole, unfortunately, Stephen Soderberg and James Cameron did not explore Tarkovsky and Lem more thoroughly until they redid Solaris ... <br /> <br /> The goal of this film was funny, not heavy and not stupid. <br /> <br /> 7/10
