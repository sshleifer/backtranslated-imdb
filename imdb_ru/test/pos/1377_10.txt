Well, maybe it's because I'm from the northeast of Scotland and speak the same way as the guys in this film, but I found it very funny. Of course, cheap entertainment, but a lot of effort was spent so that the film looked great, and the actors, of course, give it all. In fact, I was amazed when they died. In particular, when the captain finally fell. Scenario? Well, this is a 2-time game. The first half of the film is well written and cutting. The last half hour is not so good, many questions remain unanswered. This will surely annoy others, because it annoyed me. But, nevertheless, good fun and very smart first feature from Sturton.
