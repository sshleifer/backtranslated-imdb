Yes, I know, Roscoe Arbuckle did not like being called “Fat Man,” but I could not resist the joke. <br /> <br /> This is the wonderful Lloyd Hamilton, from his peak period directed by Roscoe. They work together with a variety of good gags and Roscoe's usual attention to detail of shooting a picture in an interesting way. Most comedians preferred flat lighting and a camera to make them more interesting. Roscoe uses a couple of long shots and some nice tricks to tell his story and show Ham as a great actor, as well as a talented comedian. <br /> <br /> This story plays with some interesting themes, such as the Lloyd's Classic film MOVE ALONG: here we are talking about the perception of reality and the confusion that films create from them. Or you can ignore such problems and laugh over your head.
