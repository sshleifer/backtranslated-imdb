This movie was fun! Sometimes it went too far, but didn't we expect it from them? The theater roared with laughter and ooooochen all the incredibly insane stunts. It is rude, rude, and sometimes frighteningly intense. The whole gang has returned and is even more crazy, which, in turn, provides excellent entertainment. I do not want to give anything, but small fragments of clips that go over the network are nothing compared to what will be after. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie to watch with friends. Try to see it with a big crowd. You will not be disappointed. Just do not go with someone who cannot accept it (see above). It will not work well, you can be sure of it. But it is pretty obvious in the first place. If you liked the first one, you will love this one.
