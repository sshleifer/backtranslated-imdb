Some mistake in indecent dialogue and / or rejection as archetypical characteristics accurately reflects how people spoke, lived and were before the Second World War, not to mention those years when “The Great Footprint” is depicted in the film. <br /> <br /> The film took my breath away when I first saw it many years ago. Reading the boards here helped me understand why it didn't work out at the box office and why movie lovers got an advantage from Wayne at B Westerns for another ten years. Wayne, in my opinion, was better in the Big Track and the Bee years than most of his stellar turns after 1939, with Ford’s incredible cavalry trilogy, True Grit and Shooter are Big Time exceptions. <br /> <What a terrible theater missed the boat on this occasion in 1930. If this film were a hit, we could enjoy more movies with more realism and less hokum. In my opinion, this is not only one of the best westerns ever filmed with accurate dialogue and accurate realization of characters, but also among the best representations of excerpts of any kind ever filmed. <br /> <br /> This still requires my exhale. Especially the dialogue and the exact characteristics of the types that simply do not exist. Some celebrate the superficial homogenization of our culture, which actually hides the greatest cultural degradation (“people like us” and “people like them”) and the political split (corporateists versus major street artists) in US history, but for me a time when our surface differences were more obvious, but under them most people wanted to overcome the failures of the nation, and most people sought to build a great culture and a great nation. <br /> <br /> “Big Footprint” is an epic about a melting pot in motion to the American dream. Of course, the best movie on this journey that I have ever seen. This item has ever been filmed.
