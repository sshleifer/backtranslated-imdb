Hitchcock would be proud of this film. Even when nothing happens, it is disturbing. Directed by David Lynch uses here and there a few cheap tricks with thrills, but mixes them with other cinematic techniques so that he does not become dull. <br /> <br /> In general, surreal, this film is like a dream awakening and memory, but not enough to make it reasonable. I'm still trying to figure it all out and probably have to see it again to catch things that I missed and that can help me better understand it. This is a very detailed story that gets together very slowly, so you have to be patient and attentive. Take your trip to the bathroom before it begins. And yet the plot is clouded by the theme, mood, character development and shooting technique. <br /> <br /> The double roles of the main actress, Naomi Watts, demonstrate her great talent. That is, when I could take my eyes off her colleague. What an acting couple. <br /> <br /> Lynch surprises throughout the film with unusual camera angles, length / time editing fragments, jumping back and forth between scenes. Combined with the clever use of music and sounds, all this helps to create tension in our minds, undoubtedly, the main goal of the director. Well, he kept me on the edge of my seat, even made me talk to the actors to be careful here and not be so naive there. You know, those things that you want to spank with your children for what you do in the movies.
