This film has two new features regarding the message transmitted by other equally good death penalty films and executions. It is the stress that the drama endured by the parents of the victims — for this reason not hiding the hatred and desire for revenge they experience, or reducing the horror that the execution represents — is also put in place and the Christian vision of all implied questions. We should also note that in this film a convict is not the usual sweet innocent person we see in other films about executions, which does not force us to abandon the idea that execution in any case is nothing more than legal murder. Last but not least, we have to mention the extraordinary emotional load attached to the last moments of the execution, with all the catharsis shown by the convict’s last words, and the details with which the act of execution itself is viewed in parallel with images of the murder scenes in the forest to emphasize that we are faced with another murder, as ruthless as the last, but in a perfect cold and supposed “legitimate” way.
