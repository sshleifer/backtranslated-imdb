The first season told largely how all elements of the Marine Corps would act (that is, land, air, helicopters and airplanes) as a team. This is the season in which I give a high rating! (True, there are still a lot of “liberties” in the first season, but the stories were more believable.) The following seasons were a terrible attempt by Melrose Place to meet Top Gun! <br /> <br /> At that time, I was a marine in Miramar, and I remember how they filmed a show in the San Diego area. I need to talk to Rod Rowland and James Brolin. <br /> <br /> Rowland's character was apt. <br /> <br /> Brolin's character was good only in the first season. For some reason, he relaxed after the first episode of the second season. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a LITTLE how the Marine Air Ground team works, then you should watch one season. /> <br /> If you are in Melrose Place and the soap opera as scenes with an attempt to combine them in Top Gun, then look at the last two seasons.
