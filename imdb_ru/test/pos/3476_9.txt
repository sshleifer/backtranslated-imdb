Good. You saw the movie, and I saw the movie. True? If not, then there are many story reports, and we have absolutely no reason to waste time on any of my weak attempts to create another one. <br /> <br /> The most amazing aspect of the film is undoubtedly the performances of two young men and the young lady in the lead roles. Their emotional honesty was just as compelling, if not more so than any speeches that I have seen in recent months. I found myself laughing, crying and cringing with them, and that says a lot, because I’m often called a haggard and cynical jerk. <br /> <br /> As was to be expected, the story is replete with clichés and I believe that this is the Achilles heel of the picture. This is a story we have all seen many times before; we all know how it will end from the moment they introduce Rory. Although you may not know the exact mechanics, you know that there will be a transformative friendship, a bittersweet novel and a painful conclusion. If it were not for the strong cast and direction, this film would be nothing but a sleeping pill, which is eighty percent of the schedule for the Hallmark Channel program.
