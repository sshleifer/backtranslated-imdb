The Vicious Circle is a very unknown British mysterious story. As in many Hitchcock films, we are talking about a man who is accused of a crime he did not commit, and is doing everything possible to prove it. This time it is Dr. Latimer (John Mills), who finds a murdered German actress of her gender. As an honest person, the doctor calls in Scotland Yard, which is a big mistake ... <br /> <br /> There is nothing special about this little movie. However, watching a movie is a fun way to pass the time. I liked to follow the development of the plot. Beautiful actors are a plus.
