Karim Hussein's masterpiece of art / blood - this cat is definitely talented. We have several longer vignettes interspersed with shorter segments. In general, this is a very powerful film based on intense graphic images and symbolism, and not for all viewers. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a short film titled Egg Eye. A very short segment on which a naked woman lies naked on a table. The hand of an invisible woman covers the face of the woman with a red cloth and makes an incision on the abdomen, from which the eyeball stem is removed. I have nothing special to comment on because of its brevity. <br /> <br /> HUMAN LARVA is one of the cinematographic films, and it is a completely unshakable depiction of a perverted act committed by a worried person who has incestuous love for his pregnant sister. This is one of those things that "must be seen to be believed." I will say that this film has some of the best effects I have seen in the indie horror film, but the subject will make this an undeniably unpleasant experience for most (not me, though - I live for it). <Br /> <br /> REVIVAL could be cut from this film all together. This is the weakest segment of the film, and it has a bunch of naked people who are bloody bloody holes in the field and whatnot. Very short, but this kind of blows beats the movie. <br /> <br /> THE RIGHT BRAIN / MARTIRD is one of the most desecrated ideas about religious images I've ever seen, and it completely kicks ass. Think "P iss Christ" or menstrual bloody pictures of the Virgin Mary. Very tough sexual / sexually brutal / bloody images are presented in this part, and this is definitely not for those who will be insulted by blasphemy. <br /> <br /> Subconscious cruelty is one of the best films that I have seen under the Banner of extreme horror. It will be a very controversial film among horror fans and the general public. Some will call it rubbish, some will call it brilliant. I do not see much average. I thought this movie was damn original, and I would recommend it to anyone who was brave enough to try it. 9/10.
