I first saw “All the Rivers Run” on TV when I was a kid, and I liked it. It was great to see a mini-series that was installed and filmed in a place so close to home. Living quite close to Echuca, I loved to go to the historic port to see the steamboats. The first I ever rode was Pevensey (Philadelphia in the film). I like the time it takes for events to unfold. Nothing is in a hurry like most movies today. The game was fantastic. All the Rivers Runs were great, and I just love the Philadelphia team. Mac is always fun to watch with your signature onion sandwich after a big night. Easily deserves 10 out of 10 and is one of my favorite mini-series of all time along with Dirtwater Dynasty.
