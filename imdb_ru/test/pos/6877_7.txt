I remember seeing this comedy in 1978 on one of the most expensive matinees that I took when I was looking for a training break in my college courses. Walter Mattau and Glenda Jackson make some effective throws and parry in the style of Tracy-Hepburn in this welterweight fight, which is directed by reliable Howard Ziff (he starred in "Private Benjamin") about the aggressive return of the recently widowed doctor to the dating game. All this quickly passes, first of all, thanks to the clever scenario of veteran screenwriter Julius Epstein (“Casablanca”), along with Alan Mandel, Max Schulman and future director Charles Shyer. <br /> <br /> Dr. Charlie Nichols has just returned from Hawaii after the death of his wife. Upon returning, he learns that he is an instant catnip for all women in Los Angeles. He works in the hospital, which is managed by the increasingly senior head of staff, Amos Willoughby, whom Charlie must pacify in order to maintain his place of residence. Enter Ann Atkinson, a transplanted English woman who bakes cheesecakes for life and has certain specific opinions about the medical profession, which she freely expresses on the PBS talk show. Of course, Charlie is on the discussion panel of the show, and the sparks, as they say, are flying. This leads to standard complications as to how seriously Charlie wants to become because of Ann. At the same time, the hospital has to deal with a potential lawsuit for the death of the widow of a wealthy baseball team owner who died in the hospital under the careless supervision of Willoughby. <br /> <br /> It’s just nice to see a mature but invigorating love story between two characters, populated by actors who play strings with the skill of a surgeon’s scalpel. Matthau is his usual arrogant tramp of the 1970s and a pretty sight wriggling in his clumsy hands, held together in his forceful gait. Away from her heavy, award-winning Elizabethan roles, Jackson is hardcore and charmingly vulnerable, like furious Ann, who believes that all doctors should strive to become Albert Schweitzer. Art Carney plays Willoughby with predictable noise, while Richard Benjamin provides friendly support to Charlie's colleague, Dr. Solomon. It's all very compact with a few good bumps in greed among medical professionals. There are no extras on the 2005 DVD.
