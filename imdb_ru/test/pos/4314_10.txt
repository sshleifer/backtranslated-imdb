For me, this is a good series. I am partly disappointed that Ana Lucia and Libby died, but more upset that Michelle lied to everyone about who killed them. And if someone can answer this, as the name of this guy, who was allegedly called "Henry Gale", then he was still the leader of others (or was it Miss Clu? Good trying to figure out what could happen next after finally didn’t press the button. It messed up the whole DARMA project, and I personally thought it was cool, how did they have this key thing underground that Desmond used to turn off the magnet, and what’s the point? I’m just glad that they didn’t finally press the button, but what happens to the people in the hatch? Like Mr. Echo, John, Charlie and Des mond probably died, but what about the others? I think they survived, I forgot? well, it's just my little thing about what I thought of this season finale !!!
