Not as well known as English, American, German and French cinema, although the cinema from Sweden in the 1920s was also quite good, interesting and revolutionary. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is very good story. The story is told in the form of a “Christmas song,” in which death itself confronts the deceased with his past, present, and what could be. This, of course, is a story that concentrates on morality and does it very well. The message looks very powerful and efficient. This, of course, is also associated with effective directing from the father of Swedish cinema; Victor Shstrem. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the novel by another Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf. The plot is adapted by Victor Sixst himself, who may have had to extract a few more elements in order for the story and film to evolve better. It may take too long before the film begins to take shape, and the story becomes clear, but when the film really takes shape and pace, it will become truly remarkable. <br /> <br /> The film not only has a great story, it also looks good. The film uses some early and effective effects and uses several different color filters to create the right mood and indicate what happened in the past, present and "future." <br /> <br /> Sestrem not only wrote and shot this film, he also plays the main character. Of course, from time to time, by today's standards, there are too many films, but not as bad as in early German films. And in the end, this film is more about its history and morals than about acting, so it really doesn’t matter or distract. <br /> <br /> A truly remarkable and effective underestimated classic silent film from Sweden. <br /> <br /> 9/10
