This is one of the best television productions of the musical. I heard the album of actors Merman, the album of Angela Lansbury, I saw Tina Daly live, and I saw the film Rosalind Russell countless times. I think that Bette, if not the best, is associated with the best. She captures not only bravura, but also the pathos of Mama Rose. I have never been a fan of Natalie Wood, so I really liked Cynthia Gibb in her, perhaps, better role. Everything from costumes to scenery and ancillary performances is wonderful. Three strippers headed by always reliable Christina Eberzol are hard to overcome. A few years ago there was to be a television play "Mame" with Cher, but I think that Bette would be the best bet (pun intended) for Aunt Mom.
