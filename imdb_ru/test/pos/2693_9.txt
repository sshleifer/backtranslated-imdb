This is one of the funniest shows on television today. It reaches the target 99% of the time. Usually after watching the sitcom after a few years, the actors become cartoony, as if they are trying to become the favorite characters they play. These actors, in my opinion, remained true to their roles. The chemistry is still there, the letter did not go down, and I still look forward to seeing it. Family dynamics still seem real, and the situation after all this time is not so contrived as to create the impression that the writers are climbing into an empty bag, trying to save the show one more season. This is one of the few shows that I watch without a remote in my hand for a quick switch.
