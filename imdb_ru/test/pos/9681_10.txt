Family Guy was fun for so long, but I feel that I lost his keen and casual humor at the beginning of season 6. Although I enjoyed Blue Harvest, it seemed to me that the remaining episodes were the “final” episodes, where the producers A small attempt to maintain the reputation of Family Guy in american social satire. <br /> <br /> I saw all the episodes of the seventh season, and I was extremely surprised and happy that the Family Guy regained its true colors. In the 7th season you will find a lot of fantastic episodes and a lot of jokes about the current situation in America, and this is exactly what we need now - more fun. <br /> <br /> I feel that the Simpsons have lost their spark together, this show, however, made a terrific recovery from the drop to the proof of how satirically they can be. Great job!
