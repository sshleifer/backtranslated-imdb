On the one hand, Hari Om is a film that uses a familiar genre - a road film telling a familiar story: a curious western man explores the mysterious East. But the film is based on a film about two people: a young French beauty (Ise) seeking to experience life to the full, and a motorized rickshaw driver (Hari Om) with Bollywood aspirations from completely different cultures, their slowly growing attractiveness to each other, and a wonderful mad chaos that is in India today. The gap between them can never be bridged, but the director manages to bring them as close as possible to the verge of the novel without compromising the credibility of the story. India and its people are important components of the narrative, and, with the exception of the main characters, the roles are perfectly and convincingly played by the locals recruited during the filming of the film, on the road between Indian cities and villages, which form the atmosphere of the film. One serious drawback for this viewer: the pursuit of "Frozen Cop" next to the conclusion of the film, when Hari runs away from gangsters prone to collecting gambling debts. But the final scenes where Isa and Hari are forgiven are sharp and unforgettable.
