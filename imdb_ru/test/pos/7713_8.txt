Eighth, and therefore the second-last, short of Animatrix alone, is the only one that takes two of the main types of filming inspired by the Matrix's entertainment, and combines them incredibly well. This is very true for the trilogy in this aspect, tone. Animation - great, breathtaking animation. The style that is omnipresent in this is Noir. The plot is appropriate, and the story, like the music, is accurate. The sound as a whole is fantastic and really helps to strengthen the mood and atmosphere, along with the drawings and design. The voice acting is flawless. This is one of the two where people also replay their roles in films, and both have Ann-Moss, who is the only one appearing in it. This is one of the best of the nine, as well as one of my favorites. It's about ten minutes. The pace is perfect. It never slows down much, but it does not suppress either. The end could not be more suitable for this. It shares nine and a half minutes with Kid's Story, and it is well done and informative. I recommend it hotly to any fan of the universe and the two genres from which it is made. 8/10
