Angels are a bit of an American obsession, but often they are pretty boring. They are the messengers of God, as well as the angels of the arc — great warriors (Lucifer was the toughest and most beautiful until he was cast out of heaven). <br /> <br /> So what happens if you don’t believe in anything, let alone angels, and you are sent to investigate the story of angels, only to meet a person with wings and a less than angelic attitude. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is what America needs, being a Puritan is different from being good, Michael is a rude, nasty, God's messenger of heaven who will fulfill your desires and make you take enough care of the world, to whom you will be touched by. <br /> <br /> Funny, but not very touching, but not too sentimental, intelligent, but not smart ... it's just a good simple little comedy. See a lazy Sunday afternoon.
