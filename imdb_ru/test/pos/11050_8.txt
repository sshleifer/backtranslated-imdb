I would read all the negative reviews about "Anna Christie". You know, complaints about the static camera, the outdated game and the verbosity of the script. But when I watched it yesterday, I found it to be amazing and pleasant. Yes, Clarence Brown’s camera for the most part remains motionless, and I’m almost certain that one of the microphones was hidden in the light of the ship. Yes, there is a lot of dialogue and there are no exciting sequences of actions. This is an early walkie-talkie with primitive technical aspects. But ... then there is Garbo, Marie Dressler, George F. Marion and Charles Bickford, who prove that great acting is timeless. <br /> <br /> I believe that Anna Christie is still one of Garbo’s most iconic performances. And this is a wonderful presentation from the Divine, in a role that is really atypical for her. Yes, we saw how Garbo was tired and almost beaten, but never held bags under her eyes or her otdelivnyh portions of whiskey. Garbo played so many (delightful) costumed roles that it is very interesting to see her modern woman. She is not burdened by heavy dresses or makeup. This performance seems rather raw from Garbo. <br /> <br /> The plot from O'Neill's play follows a tired Swedish former prostitute Anna and her reunion with her drunken father-seaman. Anna had enough problems for any twenty-year-old girl, as she tells a drunken untidy Marty (Dressler) in a bar. She finds solace in life at sea and an affair with a rude but kind-hearted fisherman (Charles Bickford). But her past threatens to destroy it all. <br /> <br /> Charles Bickford is overlooked in the long line of Garbo (largely inferior) leading men. He is one actor who can really share the screen with her and not be absorbed by her magical presence. The couple had excellent chemistry together, and she seemed to enjoy working with each other. Dressler can never be blamed for underestimating, and again the great lady responds to her old tricks, but she is amazing and convincing in her role, never annoying, as in the terrible "Dinner at eight." I had never heard of George F. Marion before, but he was Garbo's wonderful father. <br /> <br /> This is a preliminary code, and by the standards MGM is rather gloomy and gloomy. I really enjoyed it, and although it may creak in some places, it is still wonderful.
