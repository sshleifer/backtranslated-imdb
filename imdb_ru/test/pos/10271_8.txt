Excellent production, which causes interest from the very first scene, where Max chooses a ring in a jewelry store. Much of what follows reminds us of Shakespeare's "Midday Night", in which Demetrius and Lysander fall in love with each other's girlfriends. Here, Max and Lucien, prone to love at first sight, mingle with Lisa and Alice, and Alice complicates the situation when she calls herself Lisa. In addition to the fun confusion, Max is prone to being involved in incidents that bring back memories of two years ago. And since Max has a lot of these dreamy episodes, we are exposed to one memory after another, in my opinion, too many, because when I first watched the movie I was not quite sure whether I was in the present or the past. many run along corridors, stairs, through doorways, into elevators, etc. I take it all in a fast-moving film, but do so many people need to run into each other? After four collisions, he ceases to have any effect if you excuse the pun. High marks for artistic design! The apartment itself is really beautiful with its exquisite decor, but I ask myself how a couple of young women can afford such luxury in Paris. The salvation of a person who is trying to commit suicide by jumping out of a window is always exciting, and it is in this film that Max almost immediately leaves the game. However, one or two kisses soon make him feel better. If you manage to find a way out of all the memories, you will finally find yourself at the airport, where Max's faithful sister gives him the most tender kiss. We can say that it is she who resolves the complications of love, like Pak in "A dream in the middle of summer."
