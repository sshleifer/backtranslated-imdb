I like this movie above all else. It is "multi-layered"; there is so much to see and appreciate. Each view brings a new assessment of the storyline, plot and characters. Impeccably acted and extremely pleasant if you took the time to watch it and evaluate it. I love the interaction between the players; fine relationship; period atmosphere. Ralph Fiennes played well as a thoughtful lover, and Jeffrey, the offended husband, is perfectly underestimated by Colin Firth. The sandstorm scene, where Katherine and El Masi discuss various types of sandstorms, is one of the highlights of the film, and this is where the novel begins. The other relationship between Hannah and Masi is another layer of the film that is completely charming (and heartbreaking). A worthy winner of many awards.
