Gamers: DR is not a fantastic film, but rather an amateur video. Awful magic effect, really fake fireball, terribly made dungeons, castle, village ... sword, ax, shield, mantle, nameplate ... okok ... everything. It will take you about 10 minutes to adjust your expectations visually, and then you get 105 minutes of fun. <br /> <br /> I'm from Hong Kong, and it's very hard to find RPers, none of my friends play RPGs and I always want to be one of the characters in the D & D. world. Watching Gamers: DR just show me what it is be a gamer. You see rulebooks, cubes, play sets, etc., Etc; You hear terms such as “fighter”, “wizard”, “point of hit”, “level”, “character”, “burning hand”, “chaotic evil”. <br /> <br /> What I like about RPGs is that Let you do everything you want are not connected with a program RPG. Gamers: DR provides the same element, you will not know what happens next, and this will probably just make you laugh to death. The film tells both about the real life of gamers, and about the world of D & D. You will hear the player throwing the dice when the character in the game begins to act, which makes you feel that you are truly involved in the game. <br /> <br /> I do not want to spoil anything, but in short, gamers: DR must watch a movie for RPG fans. For people who never play role-playing games, I am sure that you will still get a lot of pleasure from it.
