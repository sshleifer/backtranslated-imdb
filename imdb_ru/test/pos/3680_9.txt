This film is the most touching and funny film that I have seen in a very long time. As a housewife (“housewife”) and a fan (Rupert), I found it sympathetic. Anyone who misinterprets Dirk’s evil explosion is mistaken. Kathy Bates is not really an actress, I know, but she is perfect, the whole cast is perfect for their roles. Julie Andrews made me sew. I watch this after reading Rupert’s autobiography, so turning it on was even more exciting. At times it is terribly touching. I'm not really a fan of that music in the film, but you are fond of romance and discover that you sing songs for several days. This film deserves to be more accessible. Our favorite Scene includes Dirk and the gun and his pants, look and see!
