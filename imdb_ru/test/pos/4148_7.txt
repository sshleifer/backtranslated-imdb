An interesting look at the experience of immigrants, told as a fable with very strange images. <br /> <br /> I was attracted by this film because it tells about immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine the same thing as my grandfather at the time. Traveling in the steering wheel to provide ballast for ships, I cannot imagine that this was very convenient, as shown in this film. <br /> <br /> There were laws restricting immigrants. I guess these laws were stricter for those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants should have been free from contagious diseases or hereditary diseases. In the film we see physical and psychological exams, the latter because of the opinion that low intelligence is inherited. Single women could not enter the country on the condition that they become prostitutes, so most of the married single men are already in the country, as it was foreseen in advance, on Ellis Island before entering. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a British immigrant (Charlotte Heinsburg) who arranges a marriage with a poor Sicilian (Vincenzo Amato). He is trying to do away with his family with a dumb son and mother (Aurora Quattrocchi), who is considered to be feeble-minded. By the way, she was fantastic in this role. <br /> <br /> You will also see character actor Vincent Schiavelli in his next, last appearance. I don't know if his last movie was released. He plays matchmaker, and is also very good. <br /> <br /> It was a strange but pleasant movie. This is not for everyone, as I believe that those who are not interested in the experience of immigrants will find it rather slow.
