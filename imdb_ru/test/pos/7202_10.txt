I have to admit that I slept in a movie while watching the first Asterix movie ... but this one is just FANTASTIC! It's really fun, and it leaves the first miles. There are a lot of jokes and funny situations in it that made me laugh from the first minutes of the film, and I stopped laughing only when I reached the car to get home. I repeat: this film is impressive ... Obelix is ​​really funny, and Cleopatra is a real baby !!
