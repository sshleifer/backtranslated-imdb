This is a great example of the classic movie Full Moon Pictures. Any fan of a horror movie / vampire should check it out. The original plot and good, easy to follow stories. In addition, there are several heartbreaking scenes in this film that combine horror with action. At the moment, the only sequel I've seen in this film is Part IV, which, I must say, is almost better than this original. <br /> <br /> I give it a 10/10 <br /> <br /> "Horror Fans." Films such as this one should look at the Puppet Master, Party Slaying, Skinned Alive, Sleep Away Camp and other Full Moon Pictures movies.
