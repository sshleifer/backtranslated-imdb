WARNING ABOUT SPOILER <br /> <br /> We all heard the legend "The Boy Who Cried, The Wolf". But what if the wolf was a man in the modern world. Well, it could be something like Big Fat Liar. Fourteen-year-old Jason Shepherd (Frankie Muniz from Malcolm in the Middle) always lies to avoid getting into trouble. One day he is pressured to write an essay in English, but in the hands of the grubby director Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti) who plans to turn Jason's story into a Hollywood blockbuster. No one believes Jason when this time he is telling the truth, and he ends up in summer school. However, Jason is determined to prove his truth to his parents and goes to Los Angeles with his girlfriend Kaylie (Amanda Bynes). When Wolf refuses to admit that he broke his story, Jason plans to turn Wolfâ€™s life into hell. B.F.L. This is not a masterpiece, but it is a good way to spend 90 minutes of your time. I wish they could do it a little longer, although not so many jokes, although they are smart enough (I like the pool paint the most). I would not like it so much, as if not Paul Giamatti. He's just fun in that. If you have 90 minutes to kill, try this. You can just enjoy it.
