I was most fortunate this year to see a few films in the art museum of my university. Sometimes, well, about half the time, I can't watch movies there. I systematically tried to watch each of the skipped films. So far, Plagues and Pleasures on the Solton Sea and Who Killed the Electric Car? other films that I had to watch in this way The film covers an intriguing plot and is well theorized (I’ll emphasize this later), but not as successful as "Plague and Pleasure", but far superior to "Electric Car". <br /> <br /> The thesis of the film about the future of the American concept of country life. This casts doubt on the feasibility of such practices as rising oil prices. So, the film tells about the origin of the suburb and its evolution until the beginning of the 2000s. One theme that the film discusses in detail is the alienation that the suburb creates among its inhabitants. Although several people can live together, they do not “know” each other when we define a word. For me, this is the film’s strong point: its appeal to real human emotions. We can understand the argument of the filmmakers much easier, because they do not have to convince us of the legitimacy of their arguments. This is also one of the reasons why Solton-C is such a wonderful documentary. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Suburbia loses its message in an explanation with the firewall in support of its central argument. As the respondents say, their arguments are becoming more similar to the arguments of militant environmentalists. We are told that oil production will reach its peak in this decade, but we do not provide any scientific evidence (professional reports, statistics, graphs, etc.) to support this statement. We are given little information about how this date was calculated. Fortunately, this was the only significant flaw that I was able to detect in the film's argument, but, nevertheless, this is a clear flaw. Another less important discrepancy that I noticed was a liberal (political) bias that could polarize some viewers. However, this bias is revealed by solid clips of various events, and not by the directors themselves. The clips, especially from the 1950s, seemed a bit unnecessary to me. The film was no better with their presence, and would have been more concise in their absence. <br /> <br /> As I was thinking more about this movie, before writing this review, I thought about why I found his argument more convincing than other documentaries I recently watched. Finally, I realized that the filmmakers really offered an analysis of the suburban problem. They offer a decentralized village system in which people will live together. They argue that this practice will reduce the need for fossil fuels and reduce wasted space. They define the lost space as, for example, long sections of parking between marketplaces. What is incredible about this assumption is that it is truly conceivable. Most documentaries vaguely claim that some problems should be stopped, but they offer no way to do this. Reflecting more on the film, I decided that this analysis was what saved the film for me and why I gave it a favorable review. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that “The End of the Suburb” is neither completely convincing nor flexible in its presentation, it is a worthy investment of its time. It not only solves the modern problem of sprawl, but also gives a realistic idea of ​​how to fix it. The audience can also enjoy high production value due to the various clips of the 1950s, glued together with modern arguments. People living in Atlanta, Georgia or in the Triad region of North Carolina will especially enjoy this documentary, as sprawl is most common there.
