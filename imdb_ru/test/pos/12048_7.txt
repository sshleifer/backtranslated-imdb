I have seen many films of Shahrukh, and this is a very good role for him. He has this versatility, but he basically remains in positive roles. Like Rahul, he is very gloomy and anxious, but I sympathize with him most of the film. If not for anything, watch this movie for Shahruh. He plays a very complex and real character very convincingly. The story is very typical and was made before, but the character development is very strong and entertaining. The discovery is a bit confusing, but in the end, it doesn't matter. The songs I found are very pleasant and give an idea of ​​what the characters think. Very clever. I think this film was very good and would recommend it to all Shah Rukh Khan fans. This is a must see!
