The efforts of the new group of young talents, supported by Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, by two extremely gifted actors, make the evening exciting and exciting. And I can add that Hal Holbrook shines like a Senator. This film deserves five stars. I give him ten on your scale. And the ending is perfect. I am constantly amazed at the ability of British actors to deal with our American accents. I was convinced that all the actors were born in Louisiana. And what a mystery is more beautiful than New Orleans! Big Light, also known as Crescent City, permeates every scene. As a writer and director, Sebastian Gutierrez deserves high praise.
