As the reviewer said earlier, Travolta stole every scene he was in. Recognize a character? It was Winnie Barberino, an adult and a bit sloppy, but still pretty, oh yeah! <br /> <br /> They disappointed William Hurt and Bob Hoskins, perhaps because their characters were poorly written, or they just didn’t care. I continued to see one of the Baldwins (I can never remember which one) as Herth, therefore Hert’s incredible talents were not in vain. <br /> <br /> Andy McDowell - nice, but not very believable; partly writing. Character development was simply not the big thing in this movie. Just watch Travolta, sit down and enjoy.
