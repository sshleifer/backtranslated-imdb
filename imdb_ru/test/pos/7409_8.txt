This is one of my favorites, a rare little gem that doesn’t seem to be discovered by the population. Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson make up the heart of the play in a well-chosen composition. Few films ever reflected the real hostilities that led to the civil war, but this one seems to reflect all the right tones and moods. If you are a fan of the book “Cold Mountain”, try this film and see if you consider it a good companion.
