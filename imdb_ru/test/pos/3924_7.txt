Well, maybe it doesn't deserve an Oscar. Or the Golden Globe. Or any reward, for that matter. The acting is not outstanding, there is no reason to pay tribute to the direction, and this is actually just another tricky slogger of the 21st century, which most people will consider just decent. Or maybe even terrible. But, in my opinion, all this does not matter. And that's because I had a great time watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the first 40 minutes are rather slow, but in the course of the movie you will like something, if you are like me and someone else should be watching this movie. And this: look for 2 hours of fun, meaningless violence. (And a finale that I won’t spoil.) Yes, there are many flaws in this film, but don’t let the cast on the front cover fool you. Hilton shows a decent performance, which no one expected. Even her greatest haters, such as me and my friends, were forced to agree that she greatly surprised us with her almost believable acting skills and striptease, which was not as unpleasant as promising her in an online pop-up window, but all not so unbearable to fast forward or turn off the DVD. <br /> <br /> Violence in this surprised me; no one at school or on the horror board talked about this, as if they were about "these new films called Saw and Hostel," but I could say with confidence that Wax was more visual than Saw , And some death scenes were actually quite anxious. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I am not surprised that House of Wax did not make it into the IMDb Top 250, but it is definitely worth seeing.
