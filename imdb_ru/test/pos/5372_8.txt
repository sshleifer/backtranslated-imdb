Ben (lovely Charles Bateman), his young daughter KT. (pretty Jerry Reishl) and his new girlfriend Nicky (extremely attractive Ahna Capri) are going to KT's birthday party. They unexpectedly fall into a dead end in a remote southern city where no one can leave, and, with the exception of Ben, K.T. and Nicky, nobody can get there. To top it off, children disappear and adults are killed at an alarming rate. Ben helps some of the local people — Sheriff Pete (LQ Jones), Toby (Alvi Moore) and Jack (Charles Robinson), the local priest — try to solve the mystery. <br /> <br /> In the early 70s, a thematic horror film actually precedes Exorcist and combines a bad day on Black Rock plot in a rural city with a huge big skeleton in its closet with elements of horror for interesting results . This actually caused several chills along my spine, as it inexorably moves along the sinister path. The capricious and solemn atmosphere is established quickly and persists throughout the time; the ever-growing sense of panic gives him a real hit. Some of the catchy decorations include the bizarre opening of a toy tank, turning into a real one and crushing a car apartment, not to mention Nikis’s twisted nightmare, brightly and stylishly realized by director Bernard McEvity and his team. Jaime Mendoza-Navas's music is slightly ominous and gives her an extra sense of eeriness. <br /> <br /> An unshakable and professional cast does a great job, especially Stroter Martin, who has ever been attracted as friendly Doc Duncan, and LQ producers / actors Jones and Alvi Moore. <br /> <br /> The fact that the whole plot is right under our heroes’s nose makes it even more scary. Priest Jack begins to lead them in the right direction, but will they end things in time? This is a nice little chiller that is worth visiting again; Speaking for myself, I was able to rate him a lot more, giving him a second chance. Now I can say that yes, it is really undervalued, telling a good story in an interesting, unconventional and effective way. <br /> <br /> 8/10
