I think the Posse film by Mario Van Peebles is a very important film. This is an excellent film dedicated to the story, which many do not know. This is the story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American war with a cache of gold. The protagonist Peebles is haunted by the memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to new black settlers and foot soldiers is seen in this film with an excellent cast of actors, including Melvin Van Peebles (Marios' father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and Kane Big Dad's wonderful performance. <br /> <br /> It is felt that Peeples sought to use as many of the famous black (and some not so noticeable - smile) actors :) Perhaps too many, some famous people (Isaac Hayes, Pamela Greer) - only the scene in cameo, others briefly, such as Tone Loc. Peebles’s feelings and efforts to expose these actors will be understandable to some. The big cast (a feat for any director) works well and tells a good story in the classic Western style of “revenge and the fight against justice”. <br /> <br /> The most remarkable was the remarkable narrative role of the veteran. the actor Woody Strode (from the movie Once Upon a Time in the West), whose own life was a destroyer of barriers, in the context of a previous era, not yet complete, has disappeared from memory. No other actor could play this role better. Read the mini-biography about Woody Strode here as a tutorial: http://imdb.com/name/nm0834754/bio <br /> <br /> The film does a good job of balancing actions with a small amount of sardonic humor. The dialogue was excellent, if a bit modern! And as others have mentioned, the profanity was not accurate by that period. Sex scenes were few - not very necessary. There are some historical inaccuracies, such as the seeming electronic branding of cattle, etc. But Posse is a good attempt to open doors for new historical and creative works reflecting other innumerable stories and events. Real photos of these cowboys in the final credits were very pleasant.
