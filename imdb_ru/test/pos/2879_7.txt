Ladies and gentlemen, this is a truly modern B-film. The dialogue is raised and staged with wooden rigidity, the premise is predictable (there are several decent turns), and the characters remain 2D in most cases. And yet there is a certain ... charm. WWE wrestler Kane revives a sick, perverse monster of a man with great pathos (although his character has been playing for about ten years), and I find it quite funny when people say that this “not for him is a big reach,” but Glen Jacobs, apparently pretty good guy, so in fact it is. In any case, he plays great, like clumsy cattle, and deaths are correspondingly superior (Jason would be proud), but I heard at least four applause for four different murder scenes. Honestly, go to this movie, thinking that you have fun and get Gorefest, oh, this is really Gorefest. R-rating is deservedly deserved, and I really got a little nauseated in some of the brighter times. In any case, a very, very funny, but rather bad movie.
