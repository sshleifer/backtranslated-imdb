Lana Turner proved that in this 1940 spellcaster she could actually play the storm of the ultimate sacrifice her sister (Joan Blondel) brings to her. <br /> <br /> When both sisters come to New York, they follow the blonde Blondel Beautiful George Murphy in this film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, fate impressed director Turner, but nothing was foreseen for Blondell, except for working as a cigarette-holder. Blondel doesn't just miss the glory, the guy Murphy (Eddie) also falls in love with Turner. In order not to harm her sister, Turner is ready to marry the producer of the series, a rich womanizer who married 4 times. <br /> <br /> The story ends as best as possible when Blondel quickly returns to Nebraska. Look for Paul Ford as a gossip in the film. It is difficult to know because of the date of the film and because it is much thinner. The film leaves you with the question of whether Ford and Blondel will ever come together. <br /> <br /> Blondel, as a faithful sister, sacrifices both career and love for her sister. This film is sentimental and would probably work better if it were made in Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Few people understand that George Murphy, the future Republican senator from California, was once a real singer and dancer.
