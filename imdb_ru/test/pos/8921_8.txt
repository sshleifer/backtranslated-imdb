Ok, so some of the plot points may be a little obvious, but overall an interesting idea that works in the narrow end. The acting, especially Lahi Hulme, plays one of the main characters of this ensemble. He certainly has a screen presence, and he is interested to watch. He has a low budget sense that fits the thriller / horror genre to which Four Jacks belongs. The film does not try to take itself seriously, which adds to the overall charm. The character of Phil (Dave Serrafin) must be one of the most annoying characters seen on screen from the time of Rupert Pupkin / King of Comedy. It should add to the weekend a bunch of DVD.
