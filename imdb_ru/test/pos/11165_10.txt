When I first heard that this film would be shot, I was very happy to see it. Ideas to make a film of this magnitude, no matter how good it was, had to be very complex. I was not sure if anyone would be able to embrace all the dad's amazing qualities in the film, but the film justified his memory. In my opinion, the most important task was to reveal to people how dad started. Until his days in Poland, up to his last days in the Vatican, this film followed every aspect of his life. Thomas Kretschmann, the man who played the Pope in his adult life, and so on, did a very good job of conveying emotions. In general, this film was informative, but also very interesting.
