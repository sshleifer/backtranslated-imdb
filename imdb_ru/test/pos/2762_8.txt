I have seen so many bad reviews about Supervivientes de los Andes that I felt obligated to defend him (or at least try). First of all, of course, it looks outdated, it was made in the seventies with a very low budget, but this is part of its charm. I like modern films, but I also dig old ones for what they cost. I am not the one who feels the desire to watch or love films with modern methods of treatment and effects; besides, almost every movie buff loves old-fashioned movies (who doesn't like films from El Santo or Plan 9 from space, regardless of their overall quality?). In terms of tempo, this is just a tool to cover (again) its low cost, and I think that the ongoing dialogues are designed for better character development and situations. Of course, Alive has better FX, but I will not despise the old just because of this, and I do not feel attracted enough to speak English in an event with people from Uruguay and for me, which gives plus Supervivientes de Los Andes. It looks like even if Kanoa, starting from the seventies and based on a real event, would now have a better rework thanks to the progress of technology, but I think I would stick to this, based on the emotions that it offers, regardless of the production date . . <br /> <br /> This is all based on the impact that had on me, because when I first saw him on TV, and now I don’t think he lost some of his original strength. Of course, it was a long time ago, and I saw tons of the best films in every aspect of the movie, but that does not detract from its true value. This is a good film, and I without hesitation place it over the “Live”. Just let him rest.
