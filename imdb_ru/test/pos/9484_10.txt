Having seen this DVD, I was amazed. It's so wonderful. He not only captures Led Zeppelin during organized speeches, they span several years. It only shows the growth of the group and the growth of their great music. This DVD MUST HAVE! DVD more than 5 hours, with additions. Add-ons are also great, some of them come out in Denmark and other promotional videos. It contains frames that were once considered lost, fortunately restored and carefully restored in 5.1 Dolby Digital under the direct supervision of Jimmy Page himself! It includes many timeless classic works, such as “Stairway to Heaven”, “Trip to California”, “What is and what should not be,” Moby Dick and many others. Great acoustic songs are also included. This will correct any suggestion that Jimmy Page is not the ultimate guitar legend!
