I was lucky to see this sequel in front of the original, because I'm not sure that I would have tried my best to see it if it were the other way around. I found Cleopatra’s Mission better than its predecessor for various reasons, but the main one is this: it was almost literally an adaptation of one book, and not an amalgam, as in the first film. The physical similarity of some of the characters to their animation was very funny, especially the bad guy (whose name escapes me, but he is a different architect). I do not know how this film played in English; My first language is French, so I did not have this problem ... I think some jokes were not so easy to translate. I learned a lot over the years, it’s better to watch a movie with subtitles than with dubbing, maybe you don’t understand what is being said, but you won’t lose the rhythm, and I think that is also important. I would recommend this film to anyone who truly loves Asterix and Obelix.
