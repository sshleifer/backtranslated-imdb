I remember seeing him in cinemas, when he came out, having no idea what he would be about, and was so pleasantly surprised that I swore to buy a video when it was released. <br /> <br /> Although I will not go too deeply into the analysis of this film, I will say that I gave it 8/10 for all the reasons that you can read in reviews of other users. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™ll say the following: <br /> <br /> The first 10 minutes of this movie are incredible. This is as close to the grabber audience as I have ever seen. Once I put this movie to a party where everyone went and were about to leave. I just wanted to see what happens if I show them the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> All who watched the discovery remained until the end.
