This is an amazing movie. Elizabeth Taylor does a wonderful job, as does Mickey Rooney. The film makes you feel happy. It is inspiring, and although some parts are a bit overly sentimental, it is easy to say goodbye. I could watch this movie again and again. The race at the end is exciting every time I see her. Highly recommend this movie.
