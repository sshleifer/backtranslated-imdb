Jarl and Moodysson are part of a dying breed of political filmmakers. The population of Sweden should appreciate the fact that it is trying to uncover the truth when the government and the media actively distort and highlight events related to the EU meeting in Gothenburg. It is heartbreaking to see the Swedish police brutally abuse these innocent children and drug them, and also sentenced them to political imprisonment for sending text messages and revenge for the actions of others. The only drawback of this film is that it will not reach the masses in Sweden, since it will only be shown in cinemas, and will not be shown on video or on the air. <br /> <br /> A political film is important because it can bring new perspectives and an understanding of complex issues and plays the role of educating the masses.
