Usually, Alan Alda plays characters that are too “soft” and overly verbal - this is probably how he really lives. This time it fits the character. Although he replays when the verdict is rendered. <br /> <br /> The reaction of Attica in the 1971 prison and the reaction of the State of New York were remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. Only a few journalists have told a true story. This film gives a quick overview of the horrors and excesses associated with riot / rebellion in Attica. Attica had a great influence on this country. Perhaps the film will encourage someone to explore the story. <br /> <br /> I cannot recall a feature film made from the prisoner's point of view, although there is a wonderful piece of PBS with real survivors / participants in Attica. The point of view of the hostage guards is explored in “Against the Wall” with Kyle MacLachlan, Samuel L. Jackson, Clarence Williams III and Frederick Forrest. <br /> <br /> We used to shout: Attica Attica! It was nice to hear this in the film. Brought back memories. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the film is Morris Chestnut's natural wigs and other African Americans. These people would be easy to grow Fro.
