As an American fan of the League of Gentlemen, I had to wait months to finally see this movie when it was released on DVD, but it was worth the (agonizing) wait. Apocalypse is fantastic - funny, quirky, damn smart, full of jokes and mysterious references to the television series; basically everything you expect from gentlemen. <br /> <br /> The plot has already been discussed in other reviews, so I will not worry about its repetition, although I will say when I first read it, I was a little indecisive. Obviously, this device — fictional characters entering the real world to confront its creators — was used earlier, especially in Wes Craven’s underrated “New Nightmare” books and Stephen King’s “The Dark Tower” (where King himself was a character). Gentlemen have fun, breaking the fourth wall, and even add a new element: the second fictional world ("those days"). Soon, all three realities intertwined, and the result was exciting: Jeff Tipps was knighted in the Middle Ages (and tried to look after Queen Victoria Wood); the real Gentlemen League in Royston-Wasi, faced by characters like Pauline and Dr. Chinnery; David Warner calls homunculus at Bernice church. I heard that some people didn’t like the plot of King's Evil, but I found it funny, especially the character Reese (who seemed to give Judith a Witch from the third row). <br /> <br /> Speaking of characters, I was relieved to find that, although Hilary Briss, Jeff and Herr Lipp were firmly rooted in the film, other, more familiar characters were given a due. Bernice's confession at the beginning was fun, returning to a faster, more sketch-oriented feeling of the first series. Polina and Mickey have cameos (admittedly, it’s strange without Ross), although I would really like to see Mrs. Campbell-Jones more. Papa Lazaro, as well as Tubbs and Edward. All three are used very sparingly, giving their meager screen time an almost magical feeling (and what the hell did dad hack like an obscene hair ball? According to the DVD commentary, "a pack of greasy pubic hair"). /> <br /> The movie looks incredible, but what's new? Music, as always, is breathtaking. I was excited to hear about Joby Talbot's thematic interpretation of thematic music and his insignificant reworking of a magnificent, beautiful piece that closes both the Apocalypse and the last episode of the third row. <br /> <br /> I have some minor complaints - it would have been nice to see more of Royston’s old acquaintance, Vasya, and I felt that the creatures stopping in motion (beautiful, by the way) were a bit undervalued. Both of these problems, however, can be justified by the budget of the film, so they are understandable. However, no matter how much I love the new church of Bernice, it would be great to see the final battle on the main street (the original vision of the gentlemen, according to the commentary). <br /> <br /> In general, Apocalypse This is amazing, especially if you are a fan of the show. I can not recommend this highly enough. 10/10
