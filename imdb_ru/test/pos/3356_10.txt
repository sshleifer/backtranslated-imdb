When I was engaged, my fiancé and I often visited adult bookstores. He will search for his favorite magazines, and sometimes a video that catches the eye. As much as I liked one on one with him, which caused the media, there was never a video that I really liked. I saw only one other film back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it dealt with a private eye, revealing the matter), which actually had the right plot and was enjoyable. All the rest grumbled, puffed, blew and whatnot. Only so many times can you see how a blonde slut portrays "this." <br /> <br /> This film caught my eye, and I migrated, allowing it to roam the store. He remarked (how hard was it not too?) Chuckling. I was really interested in something, laughs (!) In the video section!) And came up, buying a slightly used copy for me. We took him home and I liked it. There was a “porn” with a plot. I was not sure that even classified as porn, but I use the word loosely. <br /> <br /> The librarian was a character I could identify. Alice rejected the success of her boyfriend. She did not feel comfortable because of her own sexuality and modesty in her comments. Bill left, and she kept checking the books. The White Rabbit ran through the library (I suppose one book, if you noticed it carefully (it’s been ten years since I watched the movie) was Lewis K.) and Alice for the same reason that teenagers run into the woods after him It should be a mannequin with a chainsaw, and not in the direction of settlements. This is the best way to advance the plot. Alice is in Wonderland. <br /> <br /> I hardly remember all the details, but I remember well the swimming in the lake and how it "dried up". I liked how they got Humpty Dumpty again, the size of a member of the Mad Hatter wearing his hat to wear it with pride, and the sister of the team Dama and Di but I could never say no matter how many times I watched it). The woman from the knight who said to Alice, go away and find your knight (what kind of sweet girl like you and a knight like that?). <br /> <br /> This really caught my attention when I looked. After about a year or so, there was one of the cards (I think 3 hearts) that exactly resembled my ex's current wife! We could not help teasing her in the film! The King of Hearts was interesting, and the Queen was even more interesting. Because of the openness of the forum, I can’t go into details, just say that it was based on an "orgy", and we will leave it at that! <br /> <br /> When we broke up, I was allowed to take a video - he knew that I liked it - but since it was lost in borrowing. Someday I will find another copy. <br /> <br /> By the way, if someone could tell me on the mailing list which scene was cut from the Amazon version, I would be very grateful. <br /> <br /> I wholeheartedly recommend this film to viewers over 18 years of age. It was soft, sweet, and really 70, but I really liked it. <br /> <br /> ***** out of 5. D.
