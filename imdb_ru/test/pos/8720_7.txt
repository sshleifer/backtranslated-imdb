A swinging bachelor Mattau, a successful dentist, strings his blond lover Hawn, telling her that he is a married man with three children. After attempting suicide, Mattau decides to take responsibility and marry a girl. Concerned that she is going to be a “housebreaker,” blonde Hawn wants to meet his wife and explain everything to her. Mattau hires his loyal nurse Bergman to guide his wife, and then everything becomes really difficult. <br /> <br /> A farcical comedy with compelling roles quite often hits the target, but not for one second believable. The scenario asks us to believe that we, men, are such one-dimensional poops that it is really impossible to believe. But perhaps this comedy does not need to be analyzed too deeply, just sit back and enjoy such a funny Mattau, very charming Bergman and debutant Houn, who basically created the role of a stupid blonde.
