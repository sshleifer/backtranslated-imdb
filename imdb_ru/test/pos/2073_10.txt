In the past, I was never interested in this play, although I love Shakespeare and saw most of his plays now, and some I studied with enthusiasm at school. Something in this story and all this fuss seemed to push me away. I never tried to see Hamlet until recently I decided that I should at least try to look at him, and I borrowed the version of Olivier from the library. Well, I struggled with this. Olivier seemed too old, not only in his appearance, but also in his role. The performance was extremely cut out to fit the more usual length of the film, and I think I must have missed too much because it was difficult for me to focus on it, it soon became bored and annoyed. I still think that Henry V Olivier is the best version I’ve ever seen from this exciting game - admit, I haven’t yet reconsidered the Beeb version and can’t remember how it was when it was first shown. <br /> <br /> I heard about the full-length version of Hamlet Bran. Although I enjoyed his Much Ado, I think the Beeb version is much better, and I was not completely impressed with his Henry V. But I left Branagh a bit after seeing his disappointing effort over Love's Labour's Lost musical, which is a game I like and was so well done beeb. <br /> <br /> Finally, having recently received the complete compilation of Bib Shakespeare's play on DVD, I soon revised one of my favorite Shakespeare's plays - Richard II, and Jacobi simply subdued him, so I immediately convinced him to watch Hamlet in next, What a revelation this play is for me now! Yes, it's great, but I feel that I need an actor with whom you can emphasize to play Hamlet, but for me this is Jacobi. Amazing. It is interesting to note that, although he is older than I understand the character of Hamlet, he does not show, although it was in Olivier. Now I note that he is also in the Branagh version and has a lot in common with Branagh training, so I’ll have to look at it to see what Jocobi is doing with Claudius! I’m curious to know that Jacobi trained Bran, how yes, you can certainly see the influence. <br /> <br /> And now I'm going to look again and again ....
