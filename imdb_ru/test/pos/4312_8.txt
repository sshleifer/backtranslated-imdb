This is a good watch, if you have time - sort things out with three friends who enter into an unnecessary bar fight and get into serious trouble. they fight with some kind of dark people and cannot cope with them. very, very disturbing image of Japan, the arbitrariness of modern life ... some intense scenes, but something like a float <br /> <br /> The spoiler was that the plot was not very clear based on English subtitles. Obviously, I do not know Japanese. <br /> <br /> The only other Japanese films that I saw were kurosawa, which differs much from this modern genre. so I can not compare. otherwise, it compares better with the majority of Hollywood blockbusters in plot and plot. <br /> <br /> taptieg24
