Independent indie horror director Todd Sheets returns with another funny, useless nickel-n-Dim film, shot on video, which is, in fact, just a weak excuse to get bloodshot and shiny guts as often as possible. An evil demonic effigy resurrects the dead in the form of evil, evil zombies, so that they can eat alive. A bunch of quarreling guys from college, a trio of dangerous runaway criminals led by angry Slade (Byron Nicodemus brought him to disgrace), two equally wild slug-hooligan and three beauty sisters must do everything possible to survive this painful ordeal. That's all because of the unjustifiably confusing and confusing plot, but, fortunately, this cheerful, terrifying scream lacks a narrative connectedness (abundance), which he more than compensates for with a pleasant abundance of wonderfully coarse and graphic smell. Disgusting moments include a woman whose fingers have been cut off, a fatal shot in the groin of a young maid, an attempt to rape with necrophilia, gutting and, of course, more disgusting eating of the intestine than can be shaken by a pile of moist intestines. In addition, we also have rough, grainy cinematography, which constantly alternates between blurry color and dirty black-and-white, ineptly staged fight scenes, lousy actions from evenly pathos nameless cast (in particular, Jerry Angell copies the main obscene theme) is dishonorable for his ridiculously horrible story, like slimy psycho-criminal without an account of Joe Bob, thrash metal soundtrack with a rattling head and a common shivery'n'ominous synth score. Let's not forget the ridiculous ending in which several of our survivors stumbled upon several bottles of bacteria that eat flesh to use them in the quivering hordes of the undead. Sure, this click is a pure git, but it has a definitely amazingly disgusting quality, which, in turn, makes it very terrible - it's an amazing Class Z pleasure for hardcore fans of bad fear fare.
