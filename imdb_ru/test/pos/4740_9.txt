I have seen many documentaries in which it seemed that the law was from the wrong side of the fence - first of all, the Thin Blue Line and Lost Paradise come to mind. But this is the first film that made me seethe with anger after I saw it. From the evidence presented in this film, it seems to me quite obvious that what happened in Waco was, at least, unprofessional and inaccurate confusion on the part of the FBI and AFI, and at worst - murder. Like most people, when the siege occurred in Wako, I assumed that David Koresh was an absolutely evil madman who led a violent cult. Seeing this, I think Koresh was most likely a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently attracted the attention of the US government with his eccentric actions. Of course, in the complex Davidian had a lot of weapons. But none of this was illegal. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see the videos of people inside the complex, they all looked very nice and harmless. And it was vicious to see the insensitive testimony of people responsible for government forces in the Waco sector, the senseless testimony of Janet Reno, and the partisan defense of the attack on Waco, the defense led by several members of the Democratic committee. Most of all I remember the representative of New York and the current senator from New York, Charles Schumer. I voted for this man when I lived in New York - I am a Democrat, also quite leftist. After seeing his actions on this committee, I would like to go back and vote for D'Amato! For those who are remotely interested in the government, this is a very important film that you definitely need to watch. I even think that this should be shown in the classroom - this is so important.
