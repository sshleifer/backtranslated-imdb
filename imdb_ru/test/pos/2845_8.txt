Nurse Betty has this strange, but winning combination of repulsive, disturbing plot with unusual characters. In the same way, I hated Fargo when I first viewed it, and then I realized that I still thought about it a few days later and somehow enjoyed it. I liked nurse Betty more the day after I saw her. Difficult to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, this is pretty much mandatory, but it seems to be part of what makes it so amazing. <br /> <br /> Greg Kinner's honest work, excellent work from Morgan Freeman (although I’m worried that he’s being stereotypical as a principle villain). Chris Rock was good, but not outstanding. Rene Z. is so natural that he is nervous - that is, it is nervous that he is “natural”, playing someone not very well in his head. I also liked Allison Jenny’s production as an “abrasive shine” in a small part. <br /> <br /> Do not expect as much “road film” as you can imagine from some of the synopsis. (There is a “road”, but it is hardly appropriate.) Grade 8/10.
