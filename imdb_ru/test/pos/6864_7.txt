Anatomie (Anatomy) - entertaining and attractive film that does not cause discomfort, which should be associated with the subject of the film. The idea of ​​ethical ignorance in the world of medical science pushes the viewer to discomfort, and the realism of institutions (Heidelberg) and special effects make it not quite a simple film to watch. <br /> <However, the characters, screenplay and brilliance of the film seem too familiar with the films “Scream”, which repopulated this genre. Unfortunately, then, although the subject to take care of, the viewer is presented with another film, full of student heroes, which we really cannot take care of, unresolved stories and Hammy’s murders that were reinvented. Since I remember the debut scene of Drew Barrymore in Scream a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Steven Ruzovilski is trying his best to portray the script and direction, but does not put any limits, except for a common theme. While we are shown an entertainment film with some reasonable actions, we unfortunately remain with the old feeling: there is nothing wrong with this film, but there is nothing extraordinary about it either. <br /> <br /> An interesting film and an interesting chance to see how foreign filmmakers were influenced by the horror culture after the scream. 6 out of 10
