**** Spoilers through **** This is a very strange film - especially for its time - in all respects. For six years, American films showed American soldiers as a son, brother, and father of each. <br /> <br /> In films such as “The Best Years of Our Lives” and “Until the End of Time”, our hearts are drawn to the difficulties that cute returning soldiers are adapting to the world and their families. However, in the same year, in this film, the soldiers look somewhat worse than the viewer - one of the ideas of this film is “lock up your daughters”. <br /> <br /> Even good soldiers - with a lot of time in their hands - all the time are gambling, stunned drunk, and they don’t care if they even have wives. And their police response to the murder investigation is a conspiracy against them. Mitchum, the most sympathetic soldier, says something like: “I don’t know if my wife wants to deal with this” now after the war. I have not seen her for two years. Does it bother me? Not really. Maybe we can handle it, maybe not. ” <br /> <br /> Another soldier is shown as unusually sensitive, because after years he would like to see his wife again. <br /> <br /> Later, when this soldier declared at the police station that he spent the evening at the house of the whore — not knowing that his wife was sitting right behind him, there was no doubt that everything would be fine with his wife. Indeed, she - I think it is "Hey, the soldiers will be the soldiers." <br /> <br /> A police detective, played by Robert Young, who is trying to solve a murder case, says convincingly and with infinite fatigue about someone's message about their actions on the night in question, <br /> < br /> “I care about it? Not. I don't care anymore. I think I've been doing this for too long. ” <br /> <br /> A man appears in the apartment of the whore. He says: "I am just a man like you, interested in" a whore. Then he says: “No, this is a lie, I am her husband. I would like to be in the army, I was refused earlier. ” T <br /> <br /> When he says: “No, it's a lie, why should I be a soldier?” He goes through another series of lies when the police ask him who he is. Until the end of the film, we have no idea who he is and why he is there! He is one of the strangest characters in the history of cinema! <br /> <br /> A man stands with his girlfriend in a bar and talks to four soldiers when an awkward soldier knocks on his girlfriend. She leaves to change clothes - and again puts on another, no problem. However, the man does not leave with his girlfriend - who just disappears - but follows one of the soldiers when he leaves to go to another area of ​​the bar! Then this person extrapolates the minimal information he learned about the soldier — to grandly philosophize about the problems of returning the soldiers — and immediately invites the soldier home because he is drunk and feels sick. This is a strange thing. <br /> <br /> In the same way, a girl from the dance hall is annoyed by a sentimental soldier who would like to take her with him “for a real dance - and maybe a dinner.” And yet she dances with him - and immediately gives him the key to her house! <br /> <br /> In the late 1940s, did people always call upon soldiers to come to their homes after they had just met them? <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan kills his master, a stranger, when he is angry that the Jewish master is trying to get a steadily drunk Ryan out of his house. The reason for the murder? "No Jew tells me how to drink." "How to drink?" BUT? What does it mean? <br /> <br /> This film is always crazy, quite deliberately - the soldiers act consistently with total violation of the law, and all the characters are as cold and tough as any movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> And yet the film is absolutely exciting! You simply have no idea how these people will behave - or what new strange character will appear - and no one will think that the actions of a person are strange to a lesser extent - for example, the behavior of his wife. <br /> <br /> Acting is the best I've ever seen - from Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Gloria Grame (who received an Oscar nomination), Paul Kelly and other actors I never I heard. <br /> <br /> I have never heard of this film - and it’s a complete pleasure that I discovered one that I want to see again and again and again. it is really strange, but it is impossible to look away, because you have no idea what these creatures will do next.
