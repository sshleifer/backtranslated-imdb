Residents are a band known for their strange performances and unusual musical styles, so obviously their music videos will not be completely normal. In fact, these small videos are unusual and bizarre, but they have great artistic value for them. The atmosphere is built with lighting and thoughtful visual effects. This is a great experience to watch. <br /> <br /> Essentially, Icky Flix consists of a variety of Residents music videos created for their songs. The music itself ranges from rock to synthesized music, which sounds like it's straight from an 80s horror movie. What does not change is the quality of these videos. They are wonderful! <br /> <br /> Any fan of feature films will love them. They are so original with their visual effects and angles, and the lighting makes them so interesting. The music is eerie, catchy and very original, and these short films are mini-classics that deserve repeated viewing. This is an almost perfect collection of short videos. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** of ****. 56 minutes
