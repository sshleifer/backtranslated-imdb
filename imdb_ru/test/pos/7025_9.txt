I did not understand what this line meant ... I am doing now. I really didnâ€™t want to see Dirty Dancing. I rented it, but never watched it - and today I did. And I thought it was a really funny, wonderful movie that makes you get up and dance. Well, sometimes it was stupid ... but it's still a great movie. I can't believe that Jennifer Gray was 27 in this film - my friend and I thought she looked about 18 or 19-20 years old. I think this is due to her acting talent. And she did sometimes look awkward. Patrick Swayze is also very good, but you can say that he is over thirty, and he is a little old. However, still very good. I love the songs of the 80s, so it really struck me, and the love story (yes, I'm romantic) was so wonderfully finished. I really liked this movie. Exceeded my expectations!
