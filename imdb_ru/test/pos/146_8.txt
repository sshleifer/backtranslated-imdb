A beloved and devoted priest from a small town voluntarily participates in a medical experiment that fails and turns him into a vampire. <br /> <br /> Physical and psychological changes lead to his romance with the wife of his childhood friend, who is depressed and tired of her worldly life. <br /> <br /> Former priest deeper and deeper falls into despair and depravity. As things turn for the worse, he struggles to preserve what is left of his humanity ... <br /> <br /> The vampire film was supposed to die out due to the weak efforts of the Twilight franchises and Underworld, but the director brings new blood into the vampire story by looking at simple things. <br /> <br /> These vampires have reflections and no fangs, but they still feed and die. The transformation of the protagonist into a priest really opens a can of worms for doubts about their actions. The priest first feeds himself to get better, but when he meets his friends who have not realized his wife, carnal instincts begin to manifest themselves. <br /> <br /> What makes this film extremely erotic is that when the couple first agrees, they experience what they never had, a forbidden passion, which makes the script even more sensual. <br /> <br /> Chan-Wook adds some much-needed humor to the film, but this is only realized in the last third of the film. movie. We see how the daughter raises the mother in the chair in front of everyone, and when she realizes her own strength, she simply lowers the chair and continues. Happy. <br /> <br /> and the last act will not be out of place in the continuation of the film, or even in the three “Stoches”, since the couple is fighting for survival / death, respectively. <br /> <br /> CGI is subtle and fantastic, and the scenes in which they jump from building to building are so graceful that you could watch ballet. <br /> <br /> The vampire genre seems fresh and vibrant after that, but, more importantly, it has eroticism and intensity that most vampire films do today. This is violence, but from the director I would not expect anything else. <br /> <br /> A very interesting story with fantastic characters and excellent cinematography.
