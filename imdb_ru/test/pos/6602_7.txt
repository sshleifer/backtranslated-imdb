I hate movies about sports. I believe that a ready-made Hollywood sports film is a little difficult to swallow, because every year the most identical ideas follow, and I try to say that there is not much creativity in this genre. Use exhibit "A" ?? A “game plan” as proof of this, if you will. So, needless to say, I did not dare to watch this documentary because of the sports theme element, but at the same time I could not wait, because I like surfing documentaries, such as “Step into the liquid” and “Odyssey Billabong ". I took a step, plunged into the unknown, and, to be honest, at first I was not happy. I didn’t like the direction, the people, or the style that the film embraced to present these young sports entrepreneurs. During my first viewing, I thought that the story could not be completely recorded, so I thought that Stacy Peralta glues video footage with artificial actors acting as if they were from the late 70s. The music was intense, it was well suited. Peralta made a mixed tape of this generation for our pleasure, but the visual effects were not at all stimulating. The elongated scenes in which amazing music was used seemed reddened and too long for my attention. I wanted to meet the pioneers, and not just watch them ride for ten minutes in an empty pool. I wanted to get a combination of who these children were, where they went during their heyday of fame and where they are now. It seemed to me that I was watching the birth of our nation with a huge bill for the settlers, who row in boats all day. I wanted to get to know the people behind the myths. <br /> <br /> Then, thinking that I would have another negative review, I watched the film again with Peralta’s audio commentary. His passion, his voice, his knowledge of people and what he had to do in order for this film to reach a “stunning” me. It suddenly turned into a film that I wanted to watch. Peralta gives us more information about where these children are today, what they are still doing, and how difficult it was to get some of them on camera. He has not seen many of them for more than 20 years, therefore, having heard these challenges, he returned the human factor to the surface. He was sincere; he was sympathetic, but he showed so much devotion to this project. Although I do not agree with everything he decided to do (that is, Sean Penn did not spoil punk rock), he revived this film for me. It is because of this comment that I rate this movie much higher than originally intended. <br /> <br /> jay adams Tony Alva. Jeff Ho. Peggy Oki. Wenzle Rumla. These are just some of the names that need to be mentioned and constantly praised if skateboarding wants to continue the fast-growing trend that he is now seeing. While the name of Tony Hawk sells products, it is these guys, these idiot sidewalk bums, who have changed the whole sport. Of course, others probably did it in the Stone Age, but these guys did it with style, elegance, and carried it to the next level. It was a hobby for them, but it also moved them in the direction to which, I believe, none of them was ready. “Dogtown and Z-Boys” is a story of evolution: to be in the right place at the right time, to live in a generation without televisions, to be seated, and about friendship. We have seen so many stories over the years that show the progress of humanity, and this is certainly a story that needs to be added to this. I cannot say that I liked this film, as I did, but it should be standard for everyone who is learning or wants to experience an increase in the trend of skateboarding. It was sad, it was emotional, and these guys are not multimillionaires again ?? these are people with passion, and very rarely do you see this in documentaries. <br /> <br /> In general, I can no longer watch this film, but I will recommend it to friends and family time after time. I think the fall for this film, for me, was a shot ?? attempts to be avant-garde with a style that ultimately drew off characters and events. As mentioned earlier, there were some elements that stretched too much, and we had little time to find out where these guys are now. Peralta obviously had a passion for this sport, for people, but at times he seemed out of focus. The music was rich and worked great with the film. Sean Penn, although he was decent with his voice-over, was not needed at all. They could spend money elsewhere. As for the positive aspects, the audio commentary captures everything that was absent in a regular movie. Peralta’s voice instead of Penn’s voice brings a stronger human factor to the scene, while he tells us better stories about people, places and events. Watch this movie, but don't expect to be carried away. Listen to the audio commentary; I think you will be impressed. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** ½ out *****
