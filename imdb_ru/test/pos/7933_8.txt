Out of so many wonderful and so on in Nevsky, one of the particularly compact * zing * of them all tickled me so much that in the end it became for me an absolutely amazing moment in the film. <br /> <br /> Or at least the one that makes exhausted people watch a movie, waving the disc in his hand for emphasis. <br /> <br /> The existing vague abstract confession of a rather simple and concrete guilt, connected with the guilty pleasure of this, can really gel and push me to pay the intellectual bill in the end. <br /> <br /> Until then .. <br /> <br /> The demise of the organist was so good.
