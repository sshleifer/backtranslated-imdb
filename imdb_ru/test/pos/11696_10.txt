Crackerjack is a funny movie, everyone in the bowls saw it and everyone says the same thing. The wheel of cheese was a great part of the film, as well as the speaker, "Dear Mr., and so, you left the right indicator on." Or, when Jack goes home, lies down on the sofa and drinks beer, “bowls are hard work,” they pissed me off. And when his roommate is interested, joining the club and calling the bingo number. Jack buys all the lottery tickets to win a tray of meat. A damn good movie, if you like garden bowls, how can you treat it, if you don't feed the lawn, take care of that, I think. Evans Head Bowl would have been recognized as the best club in Aus, friendly people, excellent company. Hi Evans Headou Bowleau Steve
