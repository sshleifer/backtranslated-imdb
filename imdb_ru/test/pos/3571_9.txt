Bluff has been shown in cinemas in Bogota for several months now, and today I finally got to see it. I really did not know what to expect, but I was very happy surprised. This is a criminal comedy of the same kind as "The Trick", etc., And she manages to balance the elements of waiting with comedy beautifully. The style of the film was established at an early stage thanks to the cheerful music and the Argentine narrator, who looks away right in front of the camera - strangely the first time, but afterwards quite naturally. <br /> <br /> With my less perfect Spanish, I still found the plot and dialogue easy enough to understand, and many comedies are situational. My Colombian girlfriend laughed a lot at the various images of people from different regions and social strata who bypassed me a little, but, for example, a well-played image of a pompous idiot in a position of power is funny in any language. br /> <br /> I think that this is the merit of this film in that it has a global character: I was not often reminded that this is Colombia, which I watched. However, it is important to note that many rich Bogotano people live like some of the characters in this film, and this is by no means an erroneous portrayal of Bogota or Colombian society, just * a selective * image - like any film supposedly depicting a “real” situation / culture. <br /> <br /> I don’t know how much comedy will be lost in the subtitles, but if we are talking about your country, be sure to take a look: this is a Very pleasant and enjoyable movie with great elements of black humor. And all in a tightly packed 90 minutes.
