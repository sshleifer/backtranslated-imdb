This is the fifth part of the Animatrix, a collection of animated short films that tell us a little more about the world of The Matrix. This time they represent Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) in the story of a detective who is hired to find her. With great black and white animation and an interesting story, this is again a great animated short film from the Animatrix.
