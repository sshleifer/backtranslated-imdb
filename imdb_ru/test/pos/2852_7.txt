This is a story about a guy who came to see a comedy, and it turned out to be a horror movie. The real story is about a guy who is fascinated by photos and was frightened when he unexpectedly identified himself with one of them. The incredible story of a guy who became even worse when the heroine deceived herself just like a male villain. Damn it, is that life made us be? People are deceiving themselves in relation to the ideal person, imagining how this person should be perfect inside? "Toto, I think we are no longer in Kansas."
