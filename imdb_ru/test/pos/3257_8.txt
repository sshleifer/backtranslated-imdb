This deceptively casual, low-key, carelessly acted-out Australian crime thriller unfolds with easy ease and relaxed self-confidence, which is good to see. The fast-moving, beaver-boy of working class Jimmy (the attractive, unhelpful Heath Ledger) is eager to do something out of his ungrateful ordinary life. Jimmy gets a big break when the local crime boss Pando (the outstanding Brian Brown) assigns him a light courier concert, which entails a delivery of 10 dollars for the old lady. Jimmy finds himself knee-deep in serious trouble when he loses Pando's money. Writer / director Gregor Jordan talks about how things are not always what they were invented, young love, all actions have their consequences, and this gray-haired old chestnut that crime does not pay off, works like a charm thanks to an amazing array of well-watched small bizarre details, strong undertones regarding the ability of a man's duel to good and evil, a wonderful feeling of unrestrained irony, a frighteningly real way of representing violence and an amazing rationale for a variety of Complicated Paints rsonazhi with a low standard of living in the instantly recognizable and completely believable banal everyday reality (for example, shows a panda, playing Scrabble with a tasty morsel, and at some point, interrupting the business conversation with an interlocutor with his son on the phone). Judging by his thinly concealed and two-handed depiction of tricks that should not be joking with Pando, Brian Brown is undoubtedly considered one of the best actors who have ever caught celluloid. Strong and satisfying little sleeper.
