/ * may contain spoilers, but, of course, it does not matter :) * / <br /> <br /> Battleship Potemkin - this is one of the stunning spectacles that haunt the images. The visual direction is inspiring, yes, the scale of the film is impressive, and the technique is certainly innovative. What is really surprising is, in my opinion, the depth and effectiveness of the film, without a proper literary script, sound (preserve the soundtrack), decent image quality, false (self-) referentialism of modernity, exceptional acting, pretense, etc. What you get is just a visual experience that you need to remember. <br /> <br /> By the way, the previous poster said: “Eisenshten felt after many sufferings to give the heroes what they wanted. What do you think that Eisenstein is preparing for a big final fight, and then deceiving you. It is a bit cheap. I would prefer to see a huge final scene. "<br /> <br /> I have to warn you that the end is not cheap, and Eisenstein was not generous to the heroes. The story, however, was. Potemkin did go through the squadron, as shown in the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would strongly recommend seeing “The Battleship Potemkin" to anyone who is more or less seriously interested in cinema. Look at it with the movie lover, it made me talk for hours. However, if you tend to count films that are commonly considered “Great” or “classic”, “slow” or “boring”, this movie It’s not for you, there’s not much cheap entertainment. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a full 10/10.
