By doing this briefly and to the point. This movie was great! I like it! I actually took it on a $ 3 Hollywood video on VHS and watched it about 5 times in the last couple of weeks. I'm a big fan of Bogart, and I just took on this film. I thought the song was funny, and now it sounds like a ring on my phone. Robert Sacchi is great and does an excellent job with Bogart. His nose is a little big, his voice is a mix of Bogart-Colombo, and he does some awkward things, but otherwise he was fantastic and this film was wonderful. No one could be the perfect Bogart, but he was great. Remember, Sam Marlow is a Bogart fan and is not going to do everything he did. He mentions many other films and does some things that have never been part of the character of the real Bogart. But it's so funny and fun, and he has a great cast, including some beautiful women. Watch and have fun!
