A man arrives in a strange, beautiful, sterile city, where no one experiences any emotions and instead fixates on interior design. The essence of his days is reminiscent of the Groundhog Day; strange passages to and from this world are more reminiscent of "Being John Malkovich." But in reality, this is a Scandinavian film, a fragment of self-improvement, which is also Scandinavian in style: the tone is harsh, and even the most fantastic scenes are played directly, daring to laugh at the absurdity. In my opinion, the combination is not entirely successful: there is not enough sincere laughter to compensate for the difficulties associated with the perception of the play as pure drama. This is of course original; Perhaps my problem is that the world he makes fun of is not the one I recognize. Maybe I should move to Scandinavia!
