The very first talking picture is back from oblivion, and now you can hear and see it! In the fall of 1894, in the Edison laboratory complex in West Orange, New Jersey, Thomas Edison's assistant William Dickson tried to combine two existing technologies (phonograph and kinetoscope) for joint recording of sound and image. In this case, Dixon was unable to synchronize the reproduction of sound and images, so this experimental film was never released for a paid audience ... and therefore (unlike many silent films that Dickson has made for Edison now), he It has no official name. The silent image (recorded at 40 frames per second) has been in the Library of Congress for years, known to film historians as silent curiosity. It was also known that the “soundtrack” was recorded on one of the raw wax cylinders languishing in the Edison National Historic Site ... although no one knew which one. <br /> <br /> But now everything has changed. Recently, the curators discovered a wax cylinder, which broke into several parts. They were reassembled: the reproduction was received and the sound was digitized. Walter March, a veteran of the Hollywood soundtrack editor, removed the background noise and set up digitization to synchronize it with the image of the film, which March digitally squeezed up to 30 frames per second. Sound and image are finally synchronized! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a voice of a voice-over man who calls: “Are the rest guys ready? Succeed! (The invisible speaker remains unidentified, but was probably Dixon's assistant Fred Ott.) On the screen, Dixon plays the violin in a huge funnel mounted on a tripod (one of Edison’s sound recorders), with a full camera view. two male laboratory technicians hug each other to dance a little to ballroom dancing at the pace of Dixon's music. <br /> <br /> The film lasts only 17 seconds: long enough for us to be surprised by this crude technology, before we were provoked to laugh at the sight of two men waltzing into each other’s arms. Speaking of this, here is the WARNING: a well-known, but extremely inaccurate handbook (Celluloid Cabinet, the late Vito Russo) includes an increase in the frame from this film and identifies it as the Gay Brothers. This is not true. The Gay Brothers is a completely different film made by Dixon at Edison's lab during the same period. The Gay Brothers never had a soundtrack: this is a short science fiction film about two brothers who are NOT “gay” in the sense in which Rousseau understood it. The deceased Mr. Rousseau, for his own reasons, wanted us to perceive Dixon’s experimental sound film (perhaps the first musical film!) As an artifact of 19th-century homo-erotism. (Hm, what about gays and musicals?) Sorry, but there is simply no such content here. <br /> <br /> This vital film deserves a rating of 10 out of 10. I have often argued that no “lost” film should ever be considered irretrievable unless it was deliberately destroyed: I am happy to announce that this film finally available to viewers, as suggested by its producer, more than a century after he was shot!
