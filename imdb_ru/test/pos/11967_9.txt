East Side Story is a documentary film about a musical comedy in Stalin’s Russia, and later in Eastern European satellite comedies, with many clips from the movies and commentaries of survivors. Although some of Stalin’s films look ridiculously bad (“The Bright Way” (?) Is a notable exception), the films of the sixties actually look pretty good. “My wife wants to sing,” “The White Mouse,” and “Midnight Review,” look especially entertaining. Producers had to contend with censors, who had the right to decide what was politically correct, which led to some confusion, with humor in retrospect, because the people whom the censors tried to appease were the very people who supported making films for beginnings! Since behind the Iron Curtain musical comedies were quite rare — about forty were made in forty years — they had a disproportionate influence on their audience, which made the main hits of some films. <br /> <br /> I noticed that the sound for the sixties films was much better. Directors often had to use obsolete equipment and strict energy supply rules — they had to be removed in seven minutes or less — and dangerous officials. <br /> <br /> I also noticed that West Side Story seems to have had a strong influence on Hot Summer. Later films may not be "Singin 'in the Rain", but they definitely look like they are knocked out of "Bye Bye Birdy"
