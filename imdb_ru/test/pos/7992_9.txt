The "Return of Batman" in 1992 was Tim Burton's second round as a director, and yet he was successful again, making this film dark and gloomy again, as in 1989. Again, Gotham City is a place of darkness and darkness, where crime and corruption are boiling at every corner. It was also smart to see how Burton used politics as a subplot, which was well and neatly associated with corruption in the business of businessman Max Shrek (Christopher Walken) and a plan to make the Penguin Mayor (Danny De Vito) in Gotham! In any case, Keaton returns again as “Batman” / Bruce Wayne, and he gives another stellar role to a strange and torn man who simply cannot find love in the normal world, but is challenged when he meets another lonely soul in Selina Kyle, only miss. Kyle has her own dark secret, which is very tight, and she is just a frank vampire in the role of the sexual and mysterious, but dangerous “Cat” (Michelle Pfeiffer). Between the two villains, a plan is being created to destroy Gotham, and most of all they want to get rid of the bat. Indeed, this film, in spite of the fact that it is brutal and somewhat rude with many scenes of penguins, is undoubtedly an exciting and exciting trip from beginning to end, as you will never find a boring moment and thank Tim again for studying dark and controversial characters, he just made the film more interesting. The performance by Michelle Pfeiffer was the best, since no one could play Catwoman better, and Devito was beautiful, because Penguin, in which his body corresponded to his character, simply played excellently, even though he looked at him it was fun. “The Return of Batman” is a fascinating exciting journey, from which it is impossible to take your eyes off the viewer, you will like it many times, it is exciting and explosive.
