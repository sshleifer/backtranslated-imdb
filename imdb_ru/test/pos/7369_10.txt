This film is about a group of four friends who crashed a car while driving. They make a fire to spend the night and wait for help. To pass the time, they tell each other scary stories. Talking about it would spoil the movie, so rent it and enjoy it !! <br /> <br /> I will say that it starts a little slow, but with each story it gets better and better. In this film, some of the hottest actors of the day are Christina Taylor (Brady Bunch films), James Marsden (disturbing behavior) and Ron Livingston (office space). So you can see that there are celebrities, not real ones! GO or rent it ASAP !! This movie is awesome !!
