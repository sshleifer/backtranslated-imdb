Alistair Simms inspired the image of Miss Fritton beyond the resistance. This is one of the greatest comedic characters in the film. No less remarkable character Joyce Grenfell - Ruby Gates. <br /> <br /> This is a movie with which you have to curl up on the couch on a wet Sunday afternoon and go back to ancient times when horrific, rampaging schoolgirls just won our respect - not our anger! I heard that with Rupert Everett in the role of Miss Fritton, a remake will begin soon? He will have hard work competing with a master - or must he be a lover? - Alistair Simms. <br /> <br /> Go and rent it - it's much better than going to a comedy today.
