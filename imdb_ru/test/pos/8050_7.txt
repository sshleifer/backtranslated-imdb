Although I rate the film at 7 points, I also have to note that it is historically interesting (since it starred May Marsh, Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore when they were all younger and less known) his day . <br /> <br /> The plot is strange for the West, because all the problems with the Indians begin for the strangest reason I have ever seen! The Indians decide to arrange a giant banquet for dogs (no, they do not feed the dogs, but feed the dogs), and when two Indians are late, there is not a single puppy left! Thus, they steal two dogs belonging to two orphans from the nearby settlement of Belykh, and this actually causes a total war !!!! This is not only stupid, but seems to play on the prejudices of the audience. I donâ€™t know if the American Indians really ate the dog, but this is similar to the stereotype that was later applied to other ethnic groups. All this for dogs! The film has excellent battle scenes and exciting moments - for example, when Miss Marsh crawls around the battlefield to save a child! Thrilling stuff! But STRANGE too!
