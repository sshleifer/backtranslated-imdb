It was a great movie in every sense of the word. He touches on the topic of tribadism in a society that absolutely does not tolerate any deviations from the norm. He criticizes many Indian customs that many consider despotic - such as marriage of others, the importance of status and person, religious hypocrisy, sexism, an assessment of women in terms of their ability to give birth, obligatory concepts of duty, and so on. The film is based on a touching love story that goes beyond the limitations of society, in which the two main characters find themselves. The film is well-functioning and genuine, completely believable from start to finish, unlike most Bollywood films. The main drawbacks of the film, as I saw it, were that they fell in love with each other in the first place, not necessarily because of their natural proximity to each other, but also because they were stuck in dead-end marriages without passion and without reward. . This may play a role in the sexual awakening of the characters, but most people stuck in one situation will not become "homosexuals." From the very beginning of the film, it is clear that these two characters are very heterosexual — when Radha is shot at the end of the film with Aashok, she makes it clear that “without desire she was dead,” and this meant that if he wished for it, he could to fully satisfy her, and also when Sita seemed very disappointed when her husband did not seem to like her. Such situations do not turn people into homosexuals - they may seek solace in others in the same position, but in the film it is not at all clear that they are lesbians from the very beginning - quite the opposite. True, some people are bisexual, but most are prone to heterosexuality or homosexuality. In the case of the ladies in the film, both had unfeeling jerks for their husbands. If this were not so, would they naturally find the need to express their desire in a relationship that they could not otherwise have considered? The film ignores this. Another mistake is the naming of characters. The names Sita and Radha were deliberately invented to shock and resent (imagine a film in America that depicts a funny relationship between a man named “Jesus” and others called “Pavel”!), using names associated with various the writings of the Hindus. The film is strong enough to withstand it, and, in my opinion, such devices are not required. In any case, the flaws do not take much away the power of the film. This is really a very touching and powerful story - images and characters will stay with you for a long time after you leave the theater.
