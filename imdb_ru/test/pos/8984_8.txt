In this film, Peter Lorre plays an exceptionally good guy who immigrates to America. Unfortunately, shortly after his arrival, he fell into a terrible fire, and his face was terribly burned. Because he looks so terrible, no one wants to hire him, and out of sheer despair, he resorts to criminal life to earn the money needed to buy a mask to hide his deformity. From where the movie comes from, you just need to make sure of it yourself. <br /> <br /> I got 8 points for this film, because for the money spent on it itâ€™s a damn good movie with a lot of good turns in the storyline to keep it interesting. The film could have degenerated into a simple horror film or a crime, but it goes far beyond that and offers some genuine surprises. In addition, the excellent game of Lorre shows that he was not only capable of supporting roles. This is an excellent film that gives more than most of the "A-pictures" of the day.
