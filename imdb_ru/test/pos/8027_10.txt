This film was overshadowed by The Jackal (Bruce Willis, Richard Gere), which was released the same year. After watching both films, I can honestly say that this is an excellent film. <br /> <br /> Of course, the production value of the “Jackal” was very good, probably it had a significantly larger budget. However, the “Task” is well written and has a fascinating history. Aiden Quinn is flawless in two roles. Aiden Quinn and director Christian Duguay did a great job in establishing deep and multi-layered relationships between the main character and his family. I especially liked the finale. <br /> <br /> I was reminded of the character Jack Ryan in films about Tom Clancy. Both are naval officers with incredibly dangerous roles, as they secretly work on behalf of National Security. And yet, both Harrison Ford and Aidan Quinn reveal their characters as heroes who manage to be both courageous and gentle. They are genuinely tender and vulnerable in their relationships with their families. <br /> <br /> What I don’t understand is that the opinions of everyone who posted this film (including me) can be much more positive than the warm welcome the film received. This is a film that has enough complexity and subtlety, so that it remains irresistible after several views. If you are a fan of spy movies, I enthusiastically recommend the “Task”.
