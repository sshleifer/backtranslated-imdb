This is not the "real" car of James Cagney, because his screen time is unusually short. Frankie Darro plays tough guy Jimmy Smith, the leader of a gang of street thugs who is sent to school reform along with several of his hooligan friends. Cagney is played by Patsy Gargan, the most gangster leader, who has been given a symbolic position as deputy commissioner. When he learns first-hand about the abuse in reform school, he is forced to make some major changes with the help of a reforming nurse (Madge Evans). <br /> <br /> The Mayor of Hell is developing rapidly and is still having fun after all these years. The cast is well rounded with: Dudley Diggs, Arthur Brion, Farina Hoskins, J. Pat Collins and Allen Jenkins.
