The Walking Dead is one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. I find it hard to believe that anyone who sees the film can feel indifference to the film or its message. Tim Robbins does not try to impose his ideas and convictions on the audience, but he manages to make a film that mostly sympathizes with both views on the death penalty - is it right to kill the murderer or not. I always knew where I was standing on this issue, even as a child, and this film - despite the fact that it really does not take any side - convinced me that murder could not be right * Anyone *. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn beautifully portrays Matthew Poncelet, his nomination for the Academy Award was well deserved. Even if Nicolas Cage did a great job at Leaving Las Vegas, I would be happy if Penn won the award. Susan Sarandon is also gorgeous, and she deserved the Academy Award she received. And Tim Robbins certainly deserves the voice I gave to this film: 9/10!
