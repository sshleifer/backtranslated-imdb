The most vivid portrait of the strangeness of a small town that I have seen in a long time - and I’m not only talking about Australian films. This piece of work seems to have been done “under the radar,” and in fact, this is a completely exciting piece of work in which the worldly world has not been seen recently in Ost. Shooting a movie. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is rather slow and strange - it seems that it flashes back and forth, and is not quite sure that this is a thriller or "main film". But the stunning aspect of Alex Frein's film is its iron fist, ruthless leadership. He never hesitates, he is well controlled, accurate and absolutely confident. Cinematography is one of the most cunning, beautiful and lyrical I have seen. The sound is all psychological, the music creates tension. <br /> <br /> In the third act, the plot unfolds, the episodes collide and converge - do not try to put together the riddle of the last 20 minutes. This is something like an impost - but by the time in the film you have a little trance, a kind of hypnosis, and you have sold the riddle - there is no real answer to this.
