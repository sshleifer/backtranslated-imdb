I watched the whole series when I was a child in elementary school, by choice, and not because it was necessary for school. I used to read plays in the tempo of the series. This experience gave me a lifelong love of Shakespeare and history. It even gave me a small acting mistake, albeit at the amateur level. Whenever I read any of Shakespeare's plays on history, first of all come images taken in black and white, which can be seen on a large “furniture” TV with a rabbit ear antenna, with all the ghosts and vibrations it. <br /> <br /> Although the sets were minimal, if I remember correctly, it was completely irrelevant, because the game was very good. At that time, I had no idea who the actor was. Now I see that many of them have become famous over the years. I especially liked Hotspur and Hal, who, I now see, were played by Sean Connery and Robert Hardy. I would really like it to be available on video, especially since many plays are rarely performed, and even less available on video. It would also be valuable as a document of television production of plays of the mid-20th century.
