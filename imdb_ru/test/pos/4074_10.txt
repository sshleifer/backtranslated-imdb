I don't care what some reviews say, this movie was funny. The essence of this film is that you can not expect anything else but to have fun. This is not some kind of intellectual comedy, this is a clever movie about popcorn. The three main actors are great and work great with each other. Shatner is a prominent supporting actor, as he himself, a former television police officer, led by Rousseau to teach the police how to be "television police" This is definitely the funniest scene. If you want to be entertained and just laugh, see this movie.
