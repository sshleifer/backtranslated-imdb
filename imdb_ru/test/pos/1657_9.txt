What a gas from the movie! “Film Noir” has always been one of my favorite genres, but this one stands out among the rest. Only "Big Dream", "From the Past", "Kill Me Sweet" and "Murderers" can come close to this classic caper. I know that these four American films that I mentioned are not caper films as such, but rather detective stories with complex plot lines that still exude a "Noir", a dark quality similar to "Rifi". <br /> <br /> What is different here is how Jules Dassin sets in motion the general atmosphere of the film, not only in the harsh realism of the directors, but also in using the streets of Paris as a subconscious character and accomplice. ! The film tells about "Le Stephanois", a dark, whimsical and complex former film, which is drawn into the last shot of a huge win. Despite the fact that he is an unsmiling and stubborn tough guy, he still feels depressed about some kind of redemption when he is freed from the demons of his past (hey, he saved little Tony!). Dassin chose the right guy (Jean Serveyce) for this role. <br /> <br /> The rest of the development of history falls into place when we travel through the famous "silent" scene with capers to the possible death of the main "criminals." Survive only their women, except Ida, Mario honey. They seemed to understand better than anyone the futility of all this!
