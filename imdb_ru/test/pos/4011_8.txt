I watched this show when I was growing up. When I think about it, I remember it well. If you ask me, it was a pretty good show. Every time I think about it, I donâ€™t remember very well the initial sequence and theme of the song. In addition to this, everyone was ideally. In addition, the letter was very strong. The performances were also top notch. I hope that some network will return it so that I can see every episode. Before finishing, I would like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, although I am not sure that I have seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, if some network ever returns it, I hope you catch it the day before it goes on the air for good.
