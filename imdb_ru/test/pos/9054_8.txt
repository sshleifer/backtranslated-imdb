“Hick Trek” is a film that envies even the budget of the level of El Mariachi ($ 7,000). However, the creators can from time to time get decent effects (often due to good editing), such as rays, situations on the cat ship and the unique communication method of Slim T. Jerk with their ship without using traditional device communications. <br /> <br /> The actor has his own irregularities, but the image of MacHoy's “Horns” is excellent, and Fluffy, of course, is not too picky about the eyes. <br /> <br /> I wish this the film was longer than its approximate hour - and this should be considered as a compliment. This film is a success thanks to the sincerity and hard work of those who participate in it.
