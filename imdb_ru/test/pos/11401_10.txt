Stylish and persuasive to take Paul Thomas Anderson to the 70s of the porn industry as follows Eddie Adams, aka Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), after six years of sex, drugs and disco. His casual encounter with pornography director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) begins his career as one of the greatest adult actors of the time. Dirk's character is based on the real-life porn actor John Holmes, who, like Dirk, was known to be very well-to-do. It is here that Dirk gains initial success. <br /> <br /> The main themes in “Boogie Nights” are obvious related to the film of this genre; pornography, drugs, sex, betrayal, violence and music. Boogie Nights deals with the theme of pornography with some control. This is not exaggerated, and the sex scenes are surprisingly minimal, but mentally explicit when they occur on the screen. <br /> <br /> Cocaine is abused throughout the film, and the setting for the film, Los Angeles 1977-1983, reflects the popularity of the drug at the time, which the film captured perfectly. However, Boogie Nights does not advertise cocaine, as there are some addiction and overdose scenes. For example, at Jack's party, they find a girl who has recently and graphically overdosed; blood pours from her nose and she starts unconscious. Prior to this film, the film was rather optimistic and comical, but from this point on it foreshadows the darkness in which it will occur. <br /> <br /> The music scenes are performed brilliantly, from the superb disco stages to Dirk sings awfully in his new musical career. The soundtrack is also great, with tunes from The Emotions, ELO, The Beach Boys and an unforgettable sound. The outstanding scene throughout the film comes down to music; Dirk, Redd Rothschild (John S. Reilly) and Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) visit the home of drug dealer Rahad Jackson (Alfred Molina) to quickly make money selling fake drugs, except for the sister of Christian from Night Ranger, who plays in the background, incredibly increases the intensity of the scene, proving that music can bring much more depth to the scene. Boogie Nights is filled with such scenes, which makes the movie even more fantastic. <br /> <br /> The outstanding performance “Boogie Nights” is Bert Reynolds as a mysterious but capricious director. In the scene where he attacks a young guy for shooting his films, this is shocking to the audience, because until that moment he was pretty calm and content. Other notable performances are Julianne Moore, Heather Graham as a beautiful Rollergirl, John S. Reilly and Mark Wahlberg, who showcases his career. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights is also an amazingly original film that uses common Themes, but is sharp and realistic in its own way. Anderson's approach completely captured these characters at a time when it seemed that everything was going wrong, or at least until the 80s. Since then, everything has become very gloomy, and all the signs of recognizable characters and situations from the first part of the film have disappeared. This, however, does not reduce the high level of attractive entertainment offered by this film. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights were not box-office successes, earning just £ 2 million in theaters in the UK. But this is not a film or a director’s concern. Anderson recognizes quality, not popularity, as shown in his three other films, Hard Eight, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves a simple parable, filled with excellent and variable situations, because at the end of this film you will understand that Boogie Nights is a simple moral tale, but it will be remembered a few days after how you look at it. Boogie Nights are both shocking, funny, destructive, and visually and audible.
