Despite the fact that this film begins with the usual: something goes wrong, as the spacecraft crashes, people find themselves in a quandary, etc., It still works and introduces the viewer with some new ideas. Riddick is to some extent a bad prisoner and has changed his eyes so that he can see in the darkness, which is very much in demand because of the situation in which the crew of the ship is located and he gets into it. The cut in the film is very good and underlines the mystery that envelops the anti-hero and male protagonist: “Riddick.” The story in Black Hole, as already mentioned, is to some extent very unoriginal and dissatisfied, but the clipping and trimming in the film, mixed with some amazing elements that were added to the story, help him still maintain himself very well, and one subsequently left with a hybrid sense of satisfaction and thirst for more. Vin Diesel performs very well in the role of Riddick, and, despite the fact that his character is hardcore, cruel survivor, he still makes moral decisions almost on the verge of good, but this does not mean that his decisions are not in his favor at the very end ... why destroy the already impeccable reputation? In general, this is a very good movie, although not perfect. The story seems very unoriginal on the surface, but beneath it shines enough originality to entertain. In some scenes there is such a wow factor, although in general it is slightly better than average. Perhaps this can be called a cult film, and this is definitely a recommendation for people who want to get a fantastic science story, mixed with some minor psychological points, and an intriguing main character, namely Riddick.
