I did not expect much of this film when I went to the theater, but I waited for it for many years. To summarize, it was damn good! Chad Michael Murray was pretty good, I thought he would be another Chris Flynn from Wrong Turn, but I was wrong. Elisha Cuthbert was also good, but the best performance is Brian Van Holt. He played the bad guy too well, I mean, he was sick, sadist and very cruel. The background between the brothers was good, plus I liked that no killings occurred until after about 40 minutes of the movie. It gave you time to choose the character you wanted to see live, and the one you wanted to see dead. John Abrahams was pretty good at CMM's stupid best friend. I liked how Chad cried when he found him dead was better than when he just said, “Anything, my friend is dead, who cares?” It showed how he really cared. All in all, it was a goddamned slash god with great effects. Bravo!
