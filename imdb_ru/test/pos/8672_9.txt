One of the best films that I have seen in a long time, accurate in its vision, beautiful and very creative in its implementation. I can’t say a lot without giving it away, and I don’t recommend you actually read so much about this film before watching it - just take a look. <br /> <br /> But yes, you need to come up with ten lines of text to have an overview in IMDb. Conundrum What can I do? Tell me about the movie? Nope I can not do this. I think I liked this film precisely because I saw it without prejudice. Please do the same. <br /> <br /> I suppose it can be said: the acting is excellent and understated, and what I like in foreign films is that films are actually about cinema, not stars.
