This is a video version of stage production, with additional shooting for video publishing. The result is the drama of the scene with the impact of a well-prepared film. Seth George Tsypin with sculptures and masks of Julia Tymor is great. <br /> <br /> Jesse Norman is awesome and you can hear (and see) young Bryn Terfel. These products are awesome, emotional and stately. If you do not see this, you missed it.
