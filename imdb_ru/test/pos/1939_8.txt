River Edge is more than just a murder story. This is an accusation of a wave of apathy that has plagued young people for decades. Our main characters are a group of what my high school would call “stoners”. One of them just decided to strangle his girlfriend, because she obviously had the courage to "talk to him." This dangerous young man, played by Daniel Roubak, has the power to amaze you. He takes the other guys from the group to show them the body of his girlfriend, and, oddly enough, no one seems to be really scared by this. The balance of the film emphasizes the desperate circumstances in which these people live, and how the guilt can eventually penetrate even into these indifferent children. <br /> <br /> The edge of the river certainly does not justify or protect the behavior of its characters. We clearly see the dangers associated with such uncontrolled apathy and the desire to just get drunk or flinch. We are shown the dysfunctional home life of these children, and perhaps this should explain their terrible behavior. But can there be only unstable houses that lead to such a destructive lifestyle? Crispin Glover is his usual tortured me. He drives around the city in a state of complete paranoia after the murder. He is trying to sympathize with why his friend committed the crime, but he clearly does not understand what could have caused the young man to do this. Dennis Hopper plays an old man, from whom these children get drugs. Although he is certainly a rebellious figure, he cannot relate to the apathy and rage of the young generation. Watch his confused reaction when Roebuck describes how killing his girlfriend made him feel. As wild as Hopper’s, even he knows that this young man should not walk on the ground. <br /> <br /> What do you think of these children? Well, there really is no way to please your characters. Some of them are less contemptible than others, but you can't help but hate or pity them. Twenty years later, apathy is still alive and healthy in so many young people. When are these kids lost? What makes so many of them want to act antisocial? This film and questions about teens will stay with you for a while. It is a fact. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Dog.
