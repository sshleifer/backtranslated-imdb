The stars of Chaplin play the dual role of a Jewish barber, who with amnesia is mistaken for dictator Adenoid Hinkel (that is, Hitler). The film, shot in 1940, when the war was in its dark days and in no case was won by the allies. .it was banned in Germany by Hitler and in a sense was dangerous for Chaplin, because if the war were lost, he would certainly have been sent to "reeducation." <br /> <br /> A funny satire with a classic scene about Hitler hanging around a giant balloon of the world .. well, but with a message .. a little sermon at the end It was the last movie with Chaplin's little mustache. on a scale of one to ten.
