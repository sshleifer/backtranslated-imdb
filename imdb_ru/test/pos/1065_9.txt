In the end, it hit me when I watched my VHS Christmas in Connecticut, which this movie reminded me of. If it were not for the fact that the other one was made 20 years later, I would say that it was a remake. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson was a fake Abercrombie & Fitch fishing expert who needed to get a little while training at the workplace in the fishing tournament Barbara Stenwick plays a forty year old version of Martha Stewart. <br /> <br /> Stanwick is a culinary commentator who created this whole lifestyle on a small farm in Connecticut, where a husband and child cook all these amazing delicacies. The problem is that she is single, childless, writes her column from her apartment in New York and does not know how to boil water. But her work was a hit to the public. <br /> <br /> The trouble is that she hijacked cooking a homemade Christmas dinner for a sailor-hero of the war, played by Dennis Morgan, who will also sing a couple of songs. Must support image at any cost. And her publisher, Sydney Greenstreet, likes the idea so much that he invites himself to dinner. <br /> <br /> So with the busy farm, baby, and Reginald Gardiner, who would like to bring her to life with Stanwick, she tries to bend over. it's through. <br /> <br /> Christmas in Connecticut is now a classic of Yuletide and deserved. The leaders are warm and humane, and they get a lot of support from the assembled players. S.Z. Sakall, as the owner of a Hungarian restaurant / friend Stanvik, from whom she receives information about cooking, and Una O'Connor, who works as a housekeeper, have a pleasant chemistry between them. Reginald Gardiner and Stanvik have no chemistry that is obvious to everyone except Reggie, and he is funny in his stuffed shirt. <br /> <br /> Most people remember this film as one of Sidney Greenstreetâ€™s few adventures in a comedy. If he's not a frank villain, a cynical life watcher or a tyrannical tycoon, Greenstreet is a few other things on the screen. Christmas in Connecticut gave him a rare opportunity to portray his own image, and he made the most of it. <br /> <br /> In the biography of Barbara Stenvik, she mentions that she liked to make Christmas in Connecticut, as a welcome change from some villainous roles, such as Double Indemnity, which she was doing recently. One of the things that made making the film so enjoyable was that between the takes, director Peter Godfrey and Greenstreet arranged improvised entertainment for the actors and the crew with English music hall numbers. Made for a relaxed and warm atmosphere, and the actors responded accordingly. <br /> <br /> Now, if someone shot these numbers.
