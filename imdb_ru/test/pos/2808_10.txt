In fact, itâ€™s all the same that no one here likes this film, I do, and this is what this review is about. Lou Diamond Phillips is great in this comedy role. this line is about the ab and c trains now for me is an instant classic, cg is great I think this is what the prison does to you ... The fast train travels to Las Vegas with the senator to give a great speech, the meteor just hit, and now all of a sudden we got aliens running free on the train our policeman must save the day to make his ex-wife's situation aboard, arguing with them. I just thought that this film was so wonderful, and I have to see if you like the action.
