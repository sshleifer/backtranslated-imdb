I really liked this film - not so much for the story (which was fine, but was a bit slow in places), but more for the incredibly beautiful landscapes of Greece and the Greek islands! Susan Sarandon is very interesting because the carefree love interest of John Cassavetes is a man on the verge. But the scenery! Oh oh oh!
