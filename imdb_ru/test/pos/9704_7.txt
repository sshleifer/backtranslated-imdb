Like the first, the JACKASS team is back to try and kill themselves in any way they see fit. Either it fits into the tractor tire and rolls down the slope. Or deliberately break themselves bull. Or something worse. <br /> <br /> The first one was crazy, and here's how you can describe it. It was really a very funny movie. But this film is completely crazy. He has even more dangerous stunts and even more laughter. So, I think, looking at stupid idiots who kill themselves will be the funniest thing this week. <br /> <br /> So, before the release of BORAT, I will laugh at my A **.
