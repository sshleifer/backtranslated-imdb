A child from a small town working in a big city becomes a huge star and then gets out of control. He shows you the rise to glory, and then fall from glory and back to a small climb. Great cast and great director = great, great movie called Boogie Nights. <br /> <br /> P.T. Anderson. Amazing director who made Boogie Nights awesome. From the moment the movie starts to its end, you can feel how beautiful this movie is. Some scenes are literally breathtaking. Great story, great movie. Mark Wahlberg was fantastic, Philip Seymour Hoffman was wonderful, as he is in everything. Thomas Jane was also great, and although he only played a small part, he played it to perfection. There is one scene in this film that I cannot overcome, “The Drug Deal Gone Bad Scene”, it was awesome, the music game and cinematography are combined to make it amazing. I have not seen “Boogie Nights” and, thank God, I did it, it is so well rounded, and now I am a HUGE PTA fan (Paul Thomas Anderson). <br /> <br /> Do everything you need and watch this movie
