Don't ask me why I love this movie so much ... Maybe it happened at that time in my life, in which I desperately wanted to fit in, maybe these are the amazing effects of monsters, maybe because I liked the novel “Cabal” But probably because I love Clive Barker. I think it will be fair to warn you that the film and the novel do not have true determination, and, like me, you will probably have a WTF moment at the end. At least two sequels were planned, but did not take place due to the fact that the film failed for several reasons. The studio made a radical change in the film, cutting it out after about 30 minutes, and did a terrible job of promoting it. Advertisements made him look like another cheap slasher, featuring mostly Decker "Button face / Mask" character. This is a monster movie! Oh fantasy! About a place called Midian! This is a story where monsters are good guys. There is nothing more like it! I guess this is not a movie for everyone, but this is one of Clive’s many great works. Relax and be prepared for the fact that you will be taken to Midian, where the monsters are located.
