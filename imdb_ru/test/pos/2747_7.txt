Many of the early comments are right on the money, but some, well, not so much. <br /> <br /> This is hardly the movie "B" ... it is well thought out, the live flying episodes are really excellent and the model sequences are first-class. It is not cheap". <br /> <br /> Ricard Bartelmess is good at this, and he is a good addition to Wings of Angels Only. <br /> <br /> If you want to notice John Wayne, first determine J. Carol Nash, they will end up together. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown is quite juvenile (and somewhat dull), but when they saddle him with the most miserable pencil mustache in Hollywood history, this makes his character even less believable. Sally Eilers is much more. <br /> <br /> As for later influences, it’s Wellman in the early zone of the airliner in distress ... the initial sequence of this film, when the airline operations guy arrives at Grand Central Airport, would fit very well in The High and Mighty ”... just imagine Regis Toomey ... and the 1955 Buick.
