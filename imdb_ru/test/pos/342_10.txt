I am a big fan of Indian films, especially Malayalam and Tamil. <br /> <br /> The shame of India for not sending this film as its official Oscar record. I saw this film, and he clearly showed me the maturity of Tamil cinema in his script and narration, which Bollywood is better at catching up with. By the way, to all of us, westerners, Tamil cinema is of better quality and is very different from Bollywood, which is all about its attractive appearance and publicity. <br /> <br /> To what extent did India think when sending the film “Devdas” to the Oscars? It was a really masochistic move. I think they are trying to punish judges Oscar from boredom by sending Devdas, since the judges overthrew Lagaan last year. <br /> <br /> “Devdas” is just a bright, but stale and predictable melodrama of Love, destiny and destiny. I would stay away from that. In any case, not sending a film like “Kanatil Mutkhital” shows how much the Indian administration needs to update in order to save them from poor administrators who lack intelligence. Now I know why there are so many problems in this country. They are very talented, but not shown properly.
