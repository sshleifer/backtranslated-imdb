The narration of the classic story is based on the music of Bert Bacharah and the lyrics of Hal David. Actors seem to be real people in this fabulous meeting of the outside world with the mystical Shangra-la. It is nice to watch Bobby Wang, whose game makes me remember “Red Buttons”, and, as always, George Kennedy (Luke-cold-blooded), who always manages to carry seriousness in his roles. <br /> <br /> The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the senior Supreme Lama. Who would know? <br /> <br /> Star composition, including Michael York and Olivia Hussey, makes this work the guardian for those of us who value people.
