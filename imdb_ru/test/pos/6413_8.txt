This is less intuitive than the only other film about Tsai that I saw (“Vive L'amour”), but the idea of ​​doorways (holes) in the emotions and existence of other people is vividly depicted here, because Tsai puts a long shot after a long frame. with long takes, suggesting alienation in Taipei. Musical breaks, inspired by Grace Chang, are confusing, but welcome the mile marks, which add new dimensions to the slowly evolving relationship between the young man at the top and the woman below. This is not necessarily an easy movie to watch (although it is not heavy, by any means), so I warn all casual viewers who are looking for some kind of "indie" entertainment (for example, Tarantino or Guy Ritchie). But if you want to learn something about isolation among the citizens in Taiwan and something more universal about the alienation of the city and the romantic longing, then immediately watch this movie.
