I just saw "Check Out" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. What a terrific combination of heartbreaking plot and great cast. Directed by Jeff Hare did an outstanding job of inviting viewers to the fragmented, but cheerful world of Morris Appbaum and his family. Family life is presented in such a way that we enjoy crazy antics, but we feel real pain and anxiety that they feel for each other. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m usually not a Peter Falk fan, but he is Morris Applebaum and plays a role with great humor and humanity. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone can see this wonderful movie and enjoy it like me. <br /> <br /> Hats off to the director, actors and crew for a job well done!
