The essence of the story is that the main character must win a high-stakes public kung-fu tournament. The flesh of this story consists of many battles, a love triangle, betrayal, rivalry and revenge. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of things in this story. The protagonist is very cute, like a balanced, meek and very strong country boy. A good film against a bad one is the same as the villains, and the main villains are tough and smart, not to mention ugly, cunning and cunning. <br /> <br /> If there is one weakness, then this is the scene where the groom from the main character imagines her and the main character running towards each other in a flower field and hugging when they meet. I thought I was watching “The Sound of Music” for a second and almost lost hope of the film. Fortunately, the film quickly recovered with a fight scene.
