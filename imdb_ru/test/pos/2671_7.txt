It is sometimes difficult to watch such generally accepted “movies with messages” from an earlier, seemingly simpler era without a certain degree of cynicism. The problem of racism and religious tolerance is a problem that we face from an early age, and as we grew up, teachers and authorities were looking for less glaring, but at the same time effective ways to convey information. "The house in which I live (1945)" is about as unconvincing as "movies with messages", and Frank Sinatra seems to treat his audience as a child ?? indeed, perhaps this was the essence, because the short film was undoubtedly intended primarily to influence young viewers. However, I was surprised when Sinatra began his sincere, patriotic speech about what it really means to be an American ?? and I'm not even an American! Released just two months after the end of World War II, director Mervyn Leroy welcomed viewers who were tired of war with a message of tolerance, unity and, above all, hope. The music is also not bad. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra with a new face ?? already a star, but not yet a superstar, which he became ?? opens the film in the recording studio, rattles "If you, but a dream" with full orchestral accompaniment. When, between songs, Frank goes outside to smoke, he watches a large group of children mocking a young Jewish boy, ridiculed by their very different religion. Ol 'Blue Eyes quickly stops this childish behavior, delicately brands the Nazi werewolves' hooligans and scolds their irrational prejudices. He then lectures to the group sincerely and good-naturedly about the simple folly of racial and religious discrimination, assuring them that every American culture, even if it is different from ours, is still American at heart ?? unless, of course, you are one of those bloody Japs. There is a hint of hypocrisy in that he advocates racial tolerance, presenting one nation as a collective enemy, although Hollywood can hardly be blamed for being less than enthusiastic about the plight of the Japanese in 1945. <br /> <br /> Sinatra leads her to point out the house with the surprisingly touching performance of “The House I Live In”, which was written in 1943 by Abel Meeropol. When the songwriter first heard the song in the film, he was furious because the filmmakers completely excluded three of his poems, which he considered decisive for the message. These omissions were most likely caused by time constraints, but Meeropol, for obvious reasons, did not treat them too kindly, and, as reported, had to be thrown out of the cinema. When he was first released, “The House I Live In” was considered such an important short film that he received a Golden Globe for “Best Film for Promoting International Goodwill” and an Honorary Oscar for all participants. In 2007, it was rated as “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant” and was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, as I learned about it. Although his approach may seem a little strange after sixty years, this film remains quite watchable thanks to a young guy named Frank Sinatra.
