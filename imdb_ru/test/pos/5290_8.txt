I read a lot of different opinions and reviews about this film, and I understand why many people have mixed feelings about Ponyo, be it storyline, animation, dialogue, and so on. And I believe that the easiest way I can answer this is that this is a film for a much younger age group. The age group is much younger than Tonarino Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro). <br /> <br /> As a Miyazaki fan, like most surfers on this site, I expected great animation, musical composition, complex history, great sustainable character development, how history is intertwined with today's society, and so on. etc. a typical film about Miyazaki, with whom we grew up. And, frankly, I did not quite understand what the hell this story was supposed to tell or what the hell happened up to an hour and twenty minutes (when there were twenty minutes left in the film), that this film was NOT for deep thinkers and cruel giblist, but for kids, young and happy Japanese. In addition, I believe that this film is based on simplicity and creative animation; straight root vegetables in the style of Ghibli Studios. <br /> <br /> I was struck by the fact that there is no villain, except for the father and maybe this crazy typhoon. But other than that, this movie is just fun; stimulate the mind of a young man and enjoy a pleasant pastime. It's all. <br /> <br /> The animation dates back to the period of the old school of the mid-80s when Miyazaki films started, where very specific details were not in the spotlight, unlike Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) and the latter. I admire the simplicity that seemed to create a little nostalgia when I first watched Ghibli films such as Tonarino Totoro when I was a kid. The reaction and movement of children is very similar to the reaction of children, and the body language of the studio Ghibli is very noticeable. Ghibli Studio has added a few creative moments and scenarios that they can only do with its wonderful animators, but it probably won't take the Ghibli-ist ritual at bay. <br /> <br /> The Japanese dialogue also sounded very friendly and many scenes and dialogues are very, very relative to what Japanese children and mothers would say and act on. Music, if it is very funny and "fluffy", I think you can say (by analogy with Totoro) from beginning to end. Even the darkest scenes did not seem assertive. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film is one of a kind. Almost every aspect of this film is for kids. And I waited a full 80 minutes to figure it out. Frankly, I have never seen a film tell or show it like Miyazaki. It's nice to see that Studio Ghibli can still tell a story to a wider and different audience and still keep the impression of the Ghibli brand.
