Having just seen Walt Disney's “Skeleton Dance” on Saturday morning blog with a link to YouTube, I used the same sources to watch a remake made in “Technicolor” for the cartoon “Colombia” and animated by the same person - Ub Iverx. The colors, compared to earlier blacks and whites, are really used here with great imagination, and many of the new plugs look like when one of the skeletal players constantly hits the wrong note, or when one loses its head and removes the other, or when one dancing with another with a part of that other was gone - as funny as the previous short. It gets a little boring at the end. Nevertheless, Skeleton Frolics is worth seeing for any animation lover who wants to compare this with the early Silly Symphony.
