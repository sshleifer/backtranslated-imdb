So it may not be entirely historically accurate. And there is little or no real character development. But for Jake (son of Ridley) on the first attempt of Scott, the price of the ticket is quite worth it. <br /> <br /> Captain James MacLean (Johnny Lee Miller looks just as good as before) may be a gentleman, but he didn’t get the money or the clothes to prove it. Plunkett (Robert Carlisle in clothes) - a pharmacist who has become a criminal. The circumstances of their strange encounter include a dead body, a ruby ​​and, ultimately, a partnership of gentlemen-road builders. As the line reads: "They rob the rich ... and everything." In fact, there is no particular background or even in-depth development, but the goal seems to be to free the aristocracy from enough money and precious stones to pay for the passage of two road builders to America. One little problem: Macklin falls in love. With the arrival of the Chief Justice, Rebecca (Liv Tyler). The one who accidentally caught the eye of the General Thief. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite original, the cast is excellent (especially Alan Cumming as Lord Queen Lord of Rochester, Carlisle and Miller - also together in “Trainspotting”, they have not lost their dynamics) and the music is techno with hard edges with strange classical overtones. Jake Scott has light and shadow, a good sense of balance between the spectacle and the plot, and he is not afraid to show the more unpleasant side of London of the 17th century. And fortunately for us, he likes close-ups of faces, especially the eyes. The eyes of Johnny Lee Miller. And Liv Tyler, too, but hey, who is this movie about? Rebecca? Plunkett and Macklin. But there is more to this film than just beautiful faces. With the risk of cliché, this is a quick, fierce, and sometimes disappointing ride with the most noble brigands since the days of Robin Hood. Scott’s decadent, messy and brutal debut film turns into an entertaining movie night. <br /> <br /> As Macklin says, “I was awesome and it was a damn good laugh!”
