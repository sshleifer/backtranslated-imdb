Seriously, where is the nomination for Oscar Al Pacino for this? Is this what we take for granted at this stage of his career? Pacino here is extraordinary ... He gives a complex, heart-rending presentation, like Shylock, a Jewish money lender ... The film as a whole was quite wonderful, with wonderful Venice footage to watch, and a wonderful score to listen ... all the other actors do an excellent job, but the real reason to see this is Pacino ... I saw all the Oscar-nominated performances of 2004, and I must say that Pacino was dismissive ... blame the anti-Semitism associated with this. with the play, the absence of agitation from the studio, the late release date without any serious push, or, most likely, all of the above ... in my opinion, the best performances of the year belong to Jamie Fox in Ray, Don Cheadle at the Rwanda and Al Pacino Hotel in the Venetian merchant.
