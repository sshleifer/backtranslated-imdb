I was surprised to read the comments of a man who did not like this movie so much. It's really quite funny. There are definitely a few ridiculous lines that my boyfriend and I quote to each other. Some situations may be alarming (bisexuality, drugs, especially the childâ€™s strange look at sexuality), but at the same time believable. It is about communication and misunderstanding between men and women.
