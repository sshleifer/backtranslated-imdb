This is a great movie for pure entertainment, no more, no less. This is a nice and vaguely nice movie. <br /> <br /> A minor, but nonetheless annoying thing in the film is that we donâ€™t know why Justin and Hour broke up. Well, most of the first relationships don't work for one reason or another, but they more or less looked like a good pair. <br /> <br /> In short, you should avoid reality.
