It was this film that I wanted to watch in cinemas, but I never found it. When I finally rented it in the summer of 2001, I liked it so much that I soon went out and bought a DVD. Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake have done a wonderful job with the script and are great at listening to the audio comments that are included on the DVD. They have done a lot of work on creating characters that you really care about. I really felt a whirlwind of emotions from watching this film, including sadness, anxiety and joy. The film also beautifully shows the importance of the family (a rarity in today's film), which is a reflection of director Bonnie Hunt, based on the comments she made on DVD. David Duchovny showed me here that there is life behind Fox Mulder, which gives a beautiful performance with quite sharp scenes. I highly recommend you watch this movie. I am very grateful to the creators of this film. They gave me a wonderful cinematic review, which I would recommend to all my friends. I have seen many films over the years, and very rarely, when I leave with such a sense of satisfaction after watching a movie. I will watch it again and again for many years. “Return to me” reminds me that there are still filmmakers who know how to sincerely please their viewers. Thank!!
