This film is about as good as the first donkey, but with a little more disgusting scenes. I would not say that it was as good as the first, but it was very close. Donkey fans will not be disappointed, but if you do not like the first film, you will hate it. There are scenes that will be viewed as Jackass classics (older costumes with “additions”, “taxi ride” and many others), and those that you would like you to never watch (eat shit, drink semen, etc. ...) In general, this film was a good watch, and I am glad that I could see it. I am sure that this film will not have a better rating because of the critics who rate it (I sat in the press section, and most older viewers seemed to be disgusted), but don't let it enjoy it.
