Director Don Siegel really hit me with this movie. This is a terrific snapshot, graphic, without visual clarity, well played by all interested parties, and covers some of the most taboo problems of any day in working, almost expected normality, still not seen in any other film by this reviewer. I did not know what to expect to sit down to watch this: a film about the civil war or something like a soft game of the 70s, when Eastwood descends to the school for girls in the south. But in reality it is not about these things, but rather about research, research and immersion in the soul of men and women - a gloomy comment about what lies at the heart of the civilized. as one reviewer noted earlier, none of the characters liked the end of the film, and yet everyone is interesting, complex and mysterious. Eastwood plays Corporal McBurney, a Union soldier, found young Pamelin Ferdin (you will recognize this voice as soon as you hear it), a girl in the school of morals, led by Geraldine Page, amid the chaos of civil war - especially in the south. Soon, Paige, teacher Elizabeth Hartman, sweet young seductress Carol, and even Ferdin (Amy) have emotional / sexual connections with Eastwood — each of them has her own needs, secrets, and problems. Eastwood is not a good person. he beats the girls apart, always trying to gain a sexual advantage. In the deployment, we get some really interesting things, from hidden lesbians to incest. “Seduced” for me is a masterpiece that surpassed all my expectations on every creative front. This may be (except for “The Invasion of the Body Snatchers”) by Siegel’s best film. This is by far one of Eastwood's best REAL performances. the page is always very good, and Hartman, Fe5rin, and others are excellent. The gothic school kit is effectively claustrophobic. Some of the sexy-laced scenes are disturbing. And what happens to Eastwood is part of the competition for a creepy, creepy, insane movie.
