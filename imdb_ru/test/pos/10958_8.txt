Seven months after a frank review of Faces, I finally found a suitable DVD copy of the first Cassavetes function. Filmed on a small stage in Manhattan and in his acting workshop on special sets, Shadows were the culmination of several months of improvisational rehearsals in which (mostly amateur) actors developed connections with each other, invented their characters and honed their tricks to give their shot performances just the right direction of natural dating. This intimate approach led to an incredibly daring work in the “Faces”, that is, Seymour Kassel, clutching his hands in the throat of Lynn Carlin in an attempt to revive her from an overdose - just as the complete conviction of the actors here leads to incredibly honest moments, such as Lelia and Fast Tony's koitalnaya assessment of their relationship and Ben’s disgust at the touch of a black woman as a manifestation of his racial confusion and self-hatred. Self-made production in the best sense, asynchronous dubbing and sound recording, as well as granular cinematography and close settings of the camera create an exciting atmosphere that ideally corresponds to Cassavetes’s nuanced view of human relationships as eternal unfinished works, marked by desperate emotional vibrations and thoughtful attempts at communication and understanding. The largely improvised jazz score of Charles Mingus is the perfect complement to the film’s vision of life at the moment, the mantra in which Cassavetis worked and seemed to live.
