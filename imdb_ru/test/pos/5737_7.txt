Why did Ram√≥n (Carlos Fuentes) lead his five college mates to an eerie abandoned school building that used to serve children from rich black sheep? This answer could simply lie in a diary at his disposal, allegedly written by his dying father. What they come into contact with is, in fact, an experienced episode in which another group of six people is involved, five of whom are likely to encounter graphic fates at the hands of a sadistic security guard (Paul Our), which occurred 20 odd years ago. But when they are looking for a way to escape from this place, they are terrified, because this horrific moment of time repeats when the group runs after their lives, often in a state of panic, when the killer begins to hunt and destroy them in various bloody places. of the way. Will Ramona and any of his friends manage to survive this night of horror or become ghosts, repeating forever the same night as those before them? <br /> <br /> Stylish Spanish slasher has such professional brilliance and powerful, shocking violence. Some witty exchanges between the characters .. in their dialogue can be traced references of popular culture to American horror films, which can annoy some viewers. Crazy Naschy is really fierce with the guys when he happily attacks them ... a rather bloodthirsty maniac who gladly performs his cruel acts with pleasure. I find the loud music signals a bit annoying, and the filmmakers often use the memories of previous events in the film as a reminder to the audience. I do not think that these tricks are necessarily necessary, but I felt that the director wanted to talk in detail with the audience, so they used cues and memories. A slight deviation from the plot of this film continues to move, and the camera monitors the pace of the characters and how they react to the chaotic situation presented to them. Your pleasure from this movie may ultimately boil down to the fact that you agree with the paranormal supernatural aspects of the plot. Moments in time came to life and the killer, who continues his work, it would seem, from the grave. The turn seems a bit sharp and sharp, but it may (or may not) work, considering how the story unfolds about why Father Ramona is shown among those ghosts who have played these terrible events two decades earlier. I would say that this film probably would not have survived if it had been studied in detail, but, like a slasher, it is a breath of fresh air.
