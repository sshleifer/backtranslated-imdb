In the film it is always interesting to track the storyline, which is to some extent prophetic for the future actor. In this case, I was intrigued by the statement of Edward G. Robinson to Barbara Stanwick - “I promised you the valley” when he discusses lonely attempts to keep him from trying to control all the land in Logas. Ten years later, Stanwyk will play a major role as the matriarch of the Barkley family in the “Great Valley”. Somehow, I thought that she could look older in the previous picture; I believe that all these bright dresses and fashionable riding clothes have a way to reveal their youth. <br /> <br /> As for my summary line above, this is Lee Wilkinson’s assessment of John Parrish (Glenn Ford), one of those Excerpts mentioned earlier, shortly after Parrish uses his knowledge of military tactics to take a few hands Wilkinson after they attacked his ranch and set fire to his house. I liked the way the film explored his character, starting with how he dealt with master Wade Matlock (Richard Dzhekkel) in a calculating standoff. Installation for an ambush was also a clever maneuver, diametrically opposed to the strategy of hurriedly attacking the bad guys from both sides, fighting to the last man standing. For this, Parrish also had something to say: "Never meet an enemy on his terms." <br /> <br /> “Cruel people” is a good name for this film, and he was probably at the head of his class in the mid-1950s, although by today's standards blood does not come close to what can be found in “ Tombstone "or" Open Circle ", where bullets cause terrible wildness. But it was formed by good directors' actions, with a subplot investigating infidelity, which seemed almost ironic, given that it was Stanvik's character who was deceiving.
