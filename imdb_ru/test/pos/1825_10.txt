The girl from the valley will always have a special place in my heart: I would say that this is certainly the best comedy about sex for teens of the 80s, but this is a hand-made compliment. This is a good movie, period. It is very specific in time and place - after almost twenty years it is an amazing picture - but its history remains eternal. (It's just Romeo and Juliet, except for death! Deborah Foreman is the revelation of this film, and I can't believe that she had no greater career; someone rediscovers her FAST. It's sweeter and softer than most films of this genre - the necessary nudity seems pledged by a contractual obligation - and, although not innovative, it is certainly nice to see a film that respects its heroes and does not crucify its small young girls for entertainment - even the team of Foreman’s best friends, never It doesn't seem like villains.

Seeing this is an amazing little movie! Fer Shur !!
