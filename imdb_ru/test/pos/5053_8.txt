If you are tired, the first hour can be slow. The plot takes place at a natural, unhurried, unhurried pace, which gives us time to assess the type of everyday life and the situations in which the main characters are located. As soon as you reach the climatic segment of the plot, the turn of events will save you. hooked: how everything will turn around, what will happen to our precious Fanda (which veteran Czech actor Vlastimil Brodsky portrayed to make a quiet perfection), his wife (played wonderfully by Stella Zazvorkova) will treat him, what will happen to Fanda's dear friend Ed (his plays Stanislav Zindulka - assistant Brodsky) and Yara, a son with a selfish hidden plan, blind to the goodness of his parents (sigh!) <br /> <br /> Vladimir Mikhalek intelligently directed the film with sprinkles of humor, keeping insightful script Jiri Hubaka. Thanks to clear subtitles, I was able to notice for each phrase “complaining” that Fanda’s wife utters, a hint of “caring”, showing / buried between the lines - and the sensible lady-judge also noticed. Fanda '76 goes to 80 ', and the love of their long (charming) marriage manifests itself even in their humorous arguments. His playfulness can be contagious. <br /> <br /> This is “We're getting old 101” for (at least) fifty years of age, as well as lessons learned for sons and daughters so as not to take parents for granted. It may be necessary to rethink, assuming that the “home for the elderly” is, so to speak, a means to achieve the goal. The film gently encourages us to live life to the fullest while we can. (Hint: there is a joy that you stay and watch how the captions end.) <br /> <br /> We are lucky that we can watch a Czech film from time to time. The "dark blue world" of the father and son "Sverák" ("Kohl") of 2001 was revealed with pathos. Well, when you do it slowly and from time to time, and appreciate a foreign gem - its subtitles, decorations, melodic scores and fascinating human history with elegant performances. Autumn Spring (aka Babí Léto) is available on DVD. Enjoy!
