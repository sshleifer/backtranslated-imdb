Maybe my rating should have been 9, but the film completely stunned me at the first viewing, and my last viewing confirmed my initial conviction. Stylish, yes, every scene has thoughtful panoramic views, stunning angles with the perfect sound accompanying them. <br /> <br /> Put on a great game, especially from Toni Servillo, present it to one of the most beautiful and charming women in Olivia Magnani, and a wonderful story, and you will eventually see this little masterpiece again and again. <br /> <br /> Paulo Sorrentinos, the next film "L'Amico De Famiglia", which will compete this year at the Cannes Film Festival, will look forward to it.
