I expected FAME to be an inspiring film, but in the end it was the other way around. The overall conspiracy that follows the lives of several determined students attending a school of performing arts has great potential. Nevertheless, FAME beautifully creates its characters, and then leaves us many questions when it is all over. I was very surprised when the graduation scene came up - we thought the DVD was missing or something like that. All characters have some kind of internal and external conflicts, and almost none of them is resolved when the movie ends! You might think that there are too many characters, but probably too many scenes. Obviously, the film was cut and shortened, because sometimes it lacks a transition. I think that Laura Dean in the role of Lisa Monroe is my favorite character. I am really connected with her character's ambitions and behind her heart. Boyd Gaines in the role of Michael, a stereotypical poor student who cannot read, but is a divine dancer, is also very good. I didn’t particularly like the role of Koko in the role of Irina Kara, but this is not Kara’s fault, as her script is weak and her character is not revealed. Her voice is beautiful, and hearing her songs is guaranteed to watch the entire movie. Thus, the film can use many improvements, but high-quality actors and great music take their place in the history of cinema.
