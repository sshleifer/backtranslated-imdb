It is always nice to see a film that tells us about the history of Africa, because they are definitely too few. Nevertheless, the film portrays Lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old colonialist ... it was difficult for me to sympathize with such leadership, but the film is partly like a tribute to that person. There was too little content explaining how the person rose, and the whole context of Belgium “let them go”. So, of course, it is worth seeing how the actress and the photo act, especially Mobutu herself. I just would like a better political analysis.
