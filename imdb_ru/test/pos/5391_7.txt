Dallas stars Gary Cooper, Ruth Roman, Steve Cochran, Barbara Payton and Raymond Massey. This is directed by Stuart Heisler, a photograph from Ernest Haller, and the pen's responsibilities shifted to John Twist. Produced from Warner Brothers, Dallas is brightly filmed at Technicolor from Iverson & Warner Ranch in California. Very similar to the film with a hard language, the film is a return to the westerns of the past, existing without any claims or deep insightful meanings. <br /> <br /> In the story, you see the renegade Cooper Civil War, Blade "Reb" Hollister, pretend to be your own death, to kill his reputation and free himself to persecute the brothers who killed his family in Dallas. In essence, the routine plot, the story of Twist along the way is fascinated by many fun and exciting entertainment. There is a change of roles, fashionable fashion, chasing horses, gunfights, a love triangle, energetic dialogue and dexterous little twists and turns to prevent the work from being purely painted with its numbers. <br /> <br /> It seems that Cooper also likes it, which further enhances the feeling of a good offer. It is true that he is not asked to do anything more than to be a concise dude in a mission. But when he is called to action, he delivers the goods that his fans have expected during his successful career. The villains entertain {especially the vile and befuddled Steve Cochran Bryant Marlow}, because each of them has his own little pekadilla to keep them from their usual lethargy. Both girls look great and hold on well among courage, while the high performance allows Haller to truly process the eyes with a lush Technicolor and work with the camera around the seats. <br /> <br /> This He has ideals to be the list that Outer does in Dallas, which he simply cannot achieve. But this is not due to the lack of attempts, and the end result is pure entertainment, which, in truth, should be enjoyed on a cold winter day, when the viewer has to pick me up. 7/10
