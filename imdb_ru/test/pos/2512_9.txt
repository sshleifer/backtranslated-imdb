This film is often shown on premium cable channels, and I find myself continuing to watch it again and again. The performances are wonderful, and there is so much material that there is always something new that can be learned from the film. <br /> <br /> Maybe I get distracted too often when I watch movies at home, you know how to do it, dogs bark, the phone rings, popcorn ends during the credits. But this film is about people and what motivates us, what revives us, what causes controversy between us and what inspires us. <br /> <br /> For me, these are films like “Love Letter” that give me a chance. on new movies. Honestly, I'm surprised that the film is no more famous. I would like to see Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwen in many other roles. It's nice to look at them. Kate Capshaw is wonderful, and I had no idea what she would be. Ellen DeGeneres plays a much more complex role than just a comic relief. <br /> <br /> This film provides interesting visual effects as the right background for the characters and their interactions. I find it refreshing every time I take the time to look at it.
