I enjoyed it for several reasons. The tangle of emotion was sometimes confusing and imperfectly resolved, but the combination of newsreels with film narration was often convincing. Another element I appreciated was the image of the Werewolves, the fanatical Nazis, who continued the struggle after the formal surrender. I do not know of another film that is related to them. For example, they killed the burgomaster of Oppenhoff in Aachen on Palm Sunday, 1945, and created problems for the occupation. The film thus challenges the purified version of victory and occupation with some grim realities. "Human problems" are presented not so much through the characters here, as through the historical reality that engulfed those who survived Hitler - both the vanquished and the victors.
