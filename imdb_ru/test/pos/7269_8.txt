I have been waiting for this film since last October! (he was supposed to be released in October 98), and now I finally saw him, I am not disappointed. Damn wonderful! Well, at the beginning it was a bit slow, but once it started, it’s very exciting, tense time, Robert Carlisle is so different from Gaza in Full Monti and Begby in Transspotting) that it’s hard to recognize! And Johnny Lee Miller, no longer with his “Sick Guy” of fair hair “Trainspotting,” plays with his dashing gentleman on the highway with the right humor and sensitivity, it's easy to understand why Liv Tylers Rebecca falls in love with him. A great movie. As Hades would say in Disney's "Hercules": "Two thumbs up!"
