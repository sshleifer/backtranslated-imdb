Having worked professionally with young girls on the run, I found this film surprisingly authentic. I would never have found that his friend did not lend his videotape. There are classic themes here: coming of age, alienation of the mother / daughter, limited choice of the disadvantaged, who is a good Samaritan, tragedy in every life and many layers or relationships. Memories make sense (when Alice gets a gun, we know that she is a little familiar with how to use it), and this does not end with a cliche. The cast really "sells" their roles. This material is for adults, and the sound is a bit grainy. Allow him 15 minutes to draw you.
