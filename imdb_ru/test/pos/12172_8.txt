First of all, I'm from Munich, where this film is taking place, and, believe it or not, there are guys like Ercan and Stefan, including a silly dialect! I know their comedy show from the very beginning, and my main fear was that the film is just an assembly of their already known jokes, but it is not so! Jokes evolve through history and have a special meaning. But if you absolutely do not like Ercan and Stefan, the hands of this film. Everyone else is worth a look!
