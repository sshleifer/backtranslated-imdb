The thirty years that have passed since the creation of this film have somewhat eased tensions and will not make the public be as attentive as I am sure it was in 1979. Nevertheless, it is still quite interesting - and it regains its strength when its sad relevance becomes clear today (read the history of FirstEnergyâ€™s Davis-Besse nuclear power plant). With existing players and a steady pace, you can learn to ignore the outdated environment of the 70s and see it in political criticism. However, I doubt that he will stand the test of time. This may not be completely forgotten due to its composition, but otherwise the dialogue, adjustment and evaluation will make a remake of this film inevitable. Since the oil situation is now comparable to the situation in the 70s, and alternative energy sources are becoming a hot topic again, we can only hope that the current generation will receive warnings about the blockbuster about the risks of (privatized) nuclear energy, like this one.
