Vanadzha (2006), screenwriter and director Rajnesh Domalpalli, is an extraordinary film from South India, Mamatha Bhukya, who plays the 15-year-old Vanja, who lives in the countryside with her loving, but alcoholic father. If she is going to succeed in life, she will have to overcome the obligations of the lower caste and poverty. <br /> <br /> I went to the film, waiting for the image of the unfortunate girl who was crushed by society. This is not what "Wanaya" shows us. A young woman is attractive, smart and ambitious. She will not accept her fate with tears or simple resignation. She wants to succeed, and it is never clear that she will not succeed, despite the odds. <br /> <br /> The actions that Mr. Domalpalli draws from his lovers are miraculous. Mamatha Bhukya plays a prominent role, and Urmila Dammannagari does an excellent job with the role of Mrs. Rame Devi, a wealthy landowner who used to be a famous classical dancer. <br /> <br /> In the film, Wannay learns South Indian classical dance, as she did in real life. I could not say how good Vanadzhi dance was by Indian standards, but many dance scenes were fascinating. (Do not think that Bollywood is a classical dance. It is also very different from ballet, because in ballet a dancer breaks off her heels from the floor. In Indian dance “Sound”, the heel is the main point of contact.) <Br /> <br /> This A movie not to be missed. This will work on DVD, but it will be better on the theater screen, because the dances will be shown with more benefit. However, if the DVD is the only option, look at it this way. Just be sure to see it.
