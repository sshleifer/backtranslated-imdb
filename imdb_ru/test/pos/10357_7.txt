The “blood brain” begins with the fact that Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley), the leader of a country called Khalid, is close to dying because of cancer, however, if he dies, Khalid will be torn apart and no one can bring them, Dr. Robert Nigserian (Grant Williams) and one devotee of Amir Mohammed (Zandor Vorkov) developed a plan to transport Amir’s body to America, where the mad scientist Dr. Lloyd Trenton (Kent Taylor) transplanted his brain into a fresh body, and with the help of plastic surgery no one ever may know that he was even dead. Things are not going according to plan, although when the time comes to replant Amir's brain, Trenton’s ugly assistant Gore (John Bloom) brings the dead body of someone who fell from the balcony, Trenton needed a strong living body, and since he no longer has to decide use the body of Horus as a temporary break until another, more suitable one is found. Unfortunately, when Amir wakes up in his new body, he is not very happy with what he sees, I mean, if you knew that your brain was inside a badly burned monster? <br /> <br /> Also known as brain damage, "Brain", "Revenge of the Creature" and "Immortal Brain". This cheap film on exploitation was shot and filmed by the same Al Adamason, and, frankly, I was offended by the pathetic “Brain of Blood” rating of 1.5 on IMDb, I personally think that it is amazing. so fun, that's a good way. The very interesting script of Kane W. Lynn and Joe Van Rogers is as stupid and stupid as the transplant script impregnated with inaccurate brain blood to a crazy scientist, from freaks with acid scars of 7 feet high, who play with toy machines, to a medical miniature of 4 feet. Assistant, from underground dungeons to roof races, from car accidents to murders, kidnappings and screaming half-naked women, from Regina Carroll's hairstyle, which should be mentioned during admission titles for teenage girls imprisoned in the basement for blood for laughter. - loud fun ending, which includes a deep meaningful speech! It's all here, and the Blood Brain has high-quality cheese, which says that if you are a fan of bad low-end games, with a sense of fun, then this film should be at the very top of your “must-see” movie list. Despite the low rating of 1.5 points, I proudly admit that I really liked Brain of Blood, I thought it was an absolute cry, look at the end slows down a bit when there are too many pictures of people wandering around without doing anything something special, but up to this point it was moving like a rocket, in just 85 minutes it is relatively short, it’s hard to guess the stupid plot, and I just think it’s a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> This is the director As far as I know, Adamson’s masterpiece with Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1971), which he did a year before. Those who have seen the Adamson film before will know about non-existent production values, cheap special effects and cardboard sets, and all this adds to the fun, this film perfectly copes with incompetence and seriousness, creating an unforgettable viewing experience. I like the first shot of Khalid, which obviously is just a photograph of the Taj Mahal in India, where stately people stand in the foreground! It seems that Regina Carol's hair is a separate entity, she changes styles between shots and, frankly, is terrible, do not start me with her makeup, which she must apply with a paint spray! There is another funny moment when we see that Amir's body was transported to America, wrapped in something like ordinary tin foil, why the question I asked myself, why? The effects are variable, there is a horrible-looking fake spider, burned makeup work. The mountain is pretty bad, although there is a surprisingly bloody brain removal that is actually quite impressive. <br /> <br /> The budget for Brain of Blood should practically not exist, I have to admit, I thought the Trenton lab was pretty good with various computers and medical tools, although the rest of the film looks cheap and unpleasant. The production figures are low, the music was taken from another film, “The Bloody Beast” (1971), and the game is terrible, but in some way amusing. <br /> <br /> “The brain of blood” may have the best name for a film about exploitation ever and, as I understand it, this is a very entertaining piece of nonsense, for which I had a great time watching and laughing. They just do not / can not / will not make them so, it is impossible to recommend them to those who are looking for a good movie, but fans of a bad movie will like it. I liked it, but again I'm just weird.
