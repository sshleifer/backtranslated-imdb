I seriously do not know why this film received such a hostile reception when it was first released. Undoubtedly, it is too long and somewhat free in its images of sexuality and violence, but just like many other famous films. I seriously do not think that people who hated the “Heaven's Gate” really understood this. The Heavenly Gate, in its uncut form, much like the Deer Hunter, shows gross differences in the life of an unsafe and dangerous life (like immigrants and averils in Wyoming) and lives in comfort and privileges (like settled Americans) in Wyoming and Averile in the prologue and epilogue). Living a hard life is painful, but it can also be invigorating, unlike the boring life that Averil leads in an epilogue. In addition, since Michael Cimino made great efforts to make the picture historically accurate, it is fascinating as a document (and, possibly, an indictment) of American life in Old West Wyoming. The dialogue is often truly intelligent and emotional. In combination with great music and cinematography, the film works as a truly poetic work of art. Of course, the “Heaven's Gate” with their refusal to patronize the viewer is not for every taste. However, Hollywood produces so much commercial junk every year that is much easier to throw away than pointless lollipops (even when the blockbuster becomes an example) that Gates and Cimino really deserve more respect. All people should see the uncut version at least once, and then they should make their own decision. <br /> <br />
