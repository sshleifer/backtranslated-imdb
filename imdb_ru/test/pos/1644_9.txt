The true episode of the first season is what Ice is. The icy location, claustrophobic conditions and the general feeling of paranoia hanging over the icy air make it a must-see episode of the first season. The previous inhabitants of the art station Mulder, Scully and four others go to either kill each other or kill themselves. The virus causes deadly aggression and is responsible for identifying deadly paranoia and fear. Mulder and Scully are actually starting to question each other's sanity. Authors should be greatly appreciated for creating such a scenario where the atmosphere is so tense, Mulder and Scully come into conflict in such a direct way.
