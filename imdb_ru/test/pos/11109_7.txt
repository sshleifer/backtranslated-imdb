I always wanted to watch this movie, and the first three quarters showed that I did not wait in vain. But what the hell happened at the end? Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. It definitely made me nostalgic for the realistic, unique New York of the 80s, which we lost thanks to Giuliani. But he still lacks half an hour!
