At first the film seemed a bit slow. But she picked up speed and got to the point. He showed exactly how the government and the scientist defended humanity, and the reasons for the "gadget." I enjoyed it. This is very close to reality, like any film about atomic bombs that should have been dropped on Japan. I recommended this to friends. I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schulz.
