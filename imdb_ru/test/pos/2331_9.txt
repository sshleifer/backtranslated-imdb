A surprisingly good and quick-witted adventure in which Kelsey Grammer (presumably in his first starring role in the film) plays the role of an unconventional commander of the navy, who nevertheless wants to control his own nuclear submarine; he earned it by competing with the US Navy in a series of war games with a team of untested, questionable and attractive men (and women too). <br /> <br /> Directed by David S. Ward ("Major League") and its authors made up a hysterically intelligent and optimistic comedy that tries to make the film easy to understand, which they are doing quite well. Secondly, in addition to the character Grammer, most of the film crew provides a little or a lot of film humor, which is seen as a double-edged sword. Three members of the support team - Harland Williams, Toby Hass and Rob Schneider present the funniest scenes, which include strange gestures, imitations and, well, in general, their personalities. <br /> <br /> Down Periscope is more than the Naval version of the Police Academy or the Dirty Dozen. What the film does is do the job right, and I liked it.
