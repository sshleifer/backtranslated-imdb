I spent most of my childhood lying in front of a wireless connection, listening to “Round Horn” or “Half Hour of Hancock” or watching films “Carry On”. Probably the most famous line in the comedy "Shame! Shame! They all got a shame!" still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> This is a rare understanding of the man behind the comic figure, and the whole performance is a brilliant mix of tragedy and comedy until the final quotation from the coroner's court read in four different voices of Michael Sheen. He was great in this role. Most of the other members of the Carry On team were so-so, and their Kenneth Horn was very good, but Michael Sheen carried the show, and there must be some kind of reward for him. <br /> <br /> This left me feeling "wow." According to Kenneth Williams, a cynic who says: "Life is a joke," the only answer may be, "Yes, well, let's make it good."
