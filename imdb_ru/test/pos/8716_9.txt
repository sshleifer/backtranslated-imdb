I have to agree with all the previous commentators - this is simply the best of all the foamy comedies, with Bardot, as sexy as Marilyn Monroe ever was, and certainly with a more beautiful face (perhaps there is less mysticism, but look how Marilyn paid for it. I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a succulent woman on a screen so beautiful that even a gay person like me was excited about it - and not just for purely aesthetic reasons (if idiotic evangelicals really want dial the number “new fledged ”, they really need to raise their standards, as church mice do not need to be used here ...) Her breasts, the rest of her figure, her delightful voice, cheerful lifestyle she shakes when she walks around the room ... only to facing a man, her breasts are literally pointed, as if in a refined confrontation ... <br /> <br /> I think Boyer is one of the greatest leading people in the whole history of cinema. No one played against more great female stars than he: Garbo, Dietrich, C. Hepburn, Colbert, and here Bardo, among many others. And he was also in “Fanny” with Leslie Caron, and had small roles in “How to Steal a Million” with A. Hepburn, as well as in the Denew's film “April Fools” (although not opposite it). the only thing I could disagree with in my remarks is that even loud, nasty music over the opening captions is appropriate - I mean that Bardo is not meant to be thin over everything else and its substantial loudness ( I do not mean her voice) is part of her irresistible and, one might even say, exemplary charm. <br /> <br /> Vidal is very handsome, even if the plump Bridget says at the beginning: “I don’t know why I'm in love with you, you’re not even handsome. <br /> <br /> Dear, dear Bardo! Truly one of the wonders of the 20th century, not to mention the joy that she is still with us, when so many truly distinctive ones leave so quickly, in all its eccentric glory.
