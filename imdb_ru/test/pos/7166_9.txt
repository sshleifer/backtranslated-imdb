It was a wonderful little film that was really creative and fun - something you rarely see in a movie. The film begins in Russia immediately after the fall of the communist government. As a result, society seems to be in chaos, and life has not yet improved when the old regime disappeared. Dirty cities, crime and housing shortages still haunt the poor residents of St. Petersburg. <br /> <br /> An idealistic music teacher comes to this scene of gloom and uncertainty. He is among those who do not have a home, and he finally receives a letter from the government stating that he has a tiny room in the next apartment. When he arrives, the place becomes erratic, but people seem friendly enough, so they all have a great party. In the middle of the night, an old woman woke them up, leaving a giant wardrobe in the room (I almost expected Lucy and other children from Leo, the witches and the wardrobe to come out, but they donâ€™t). At first they are too shocked to do something, but they soon decide to investigate. Instead of being just a wardrobe, the wardrobe opens to Paris! The way the inhabitants of the apartment react to this magical gate really intrigues. Some, like a music teacher, are delighted and thrilled. Most of the others are more pragmatic and mainly engage in the looting of everything from Paris before the gates are closed once and for all! These Russian thieves are terrible people - greedy, rude and rude, but deep down - VERY DEEP - golden hearts. I like how this metaphor for the nation is now on the verge of capitalism. At first they run as hard as they can, grabbing everything they can, and only later they reveal some depth - but mostly they behave like guests at the Jerry Springer show! The film has a lot of twists and turns, and it's funny and fascinating. The only negative is that because of some harsh language and naked scene (albeit very funny), this film is not for children. This is a real shame, as with a little editing it could be a great family movie.
