I consider this love and sensitively written story to be one of the real masterpieces on the screen. After I first saw this film on a movie screen with my mother in Los Angeles, California, when it first came out, many years passed before I had the opportunity to see it again. The beauty, the quiet, simplified elegance and tranquility of the film for me, distinguish it from many, many others of its kind. Yes, tears still appear in my eyes when I see it, and I hear the refrain of this song once in a lifetime. maybe still, today is my number one favorite movie of all time. I hope that this classic love story will please and be appreciated by our future generations.
