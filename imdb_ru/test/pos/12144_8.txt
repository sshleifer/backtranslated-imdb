Abel Davos (Lino Ventura), a professional criminal and criminal authority, has been on the run for more than 10 years, hiding in Milan, Italy. In his absence, he was sentenced to death at home in France for his crimes. Frustrated with his life in Italy and the police approaching him, he decides to return to his old arena in Paris. By sending his wife Teresa and two little sons ahead to Nice, Abel and his next teammate Raymond Naldi commit the last robbery to finance their new life in France. The robber offers a meager half a million francs, which is much less than their sources suggested, despite this, and pursuing the police, they both get to Nice, where they hide for a while. After stealing a pleasure boat from a local resident, they strive to make it in Sanremo a tourist destination, where they will merge more readily, but they are stopped by armed customs officers on a deserted beach, after which the shooting begins, and Teresa and Naldi are both killed. Now the wounded Davos with two children in tow will be easily noticed by the police, so he urges his old friends in Paris to send help, but they went further, as their old friend hid and was not too inclined to take the risk themselves, so they send little temporary thief Eric Stark (Jean Paul Belmondo) to save him. Davos is disgusted that such a modest thief is sent to help him, despite the fact that he immediately attacks him with the help of charming Stark, he tries to find out why he was kidnapped, but their betrayal does not stop there. /> <br /> The class of Tos Risquez (also known as Big Risk) was written for the screen by ex-prisoners on death row and forensic investigator Jose Giovanni (Le Trou, Le Clan des Siciliens), and Ventura is already involved in the project, Giovanniwanted who was the unique project manager, Ventura offered an assistant director who drew his attention to the previous project, one by Claude Saute, known at that time thanks to the help of Georges France at Les Yeux sans Visage. Sote immediately agreed, and the rest as they say is a story. Sothet created a great gangster movie that greatly influences characters and relationships. Davos, constantly hiding, has enough time to think about his life, past, present and future, his friendships, which no longer seem to be what he considered himself, his late wife and what will become of his two young sons . Ventura as a characteristic actor always amazed me, being both comfortable and convincing both in the police and in the criminal fraternity, here his tedious performance in the world is sublime and powerful, as his world collapses around him, like the loneliness and loneliness of a man running forward. The former profession of Ventura as a professional wrestler is very useful, as he scatters Parisian hooligans with unsurpassed ease. Belmondo in the role of Stark animates another storyline in the film, telling about his promising relationship with the girl he meets on the road. With his frank charm, his purity to this woman who is in danger, that he is only “Volar” and that “the only thing that is good about me is my leftists”, when he knocks out her aggressor, it’s also a joy to see, since she equally falls in love with him. The performance of Belmondo was missed at that moment, because just three weeks before Godard, the Duel of Soufflet had been released. Godard was recognized for having discovered a new guy on the block, his versatility in these two films, and also the fact that he is available to everyone to see and admire. Sote's film is a cool affair that uses many attractive places, the film also has a very rare dialogue, Sote prefers to allow actors to do work with simple looks or looks sufficient to continue the story, needles to say that this Noir fan will check out more Sautet work in the future .
