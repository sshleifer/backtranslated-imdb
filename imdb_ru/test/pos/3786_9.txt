This is one of the first national films of Chaplin, created between his gorgeous Mutual shorts and the more mature characters of United Artists. Richer than “Reciprocal Films”, he continues Chaplin’s striving to perfect his comic expression. Most people forget that the film is actually a dream that Charlie sees while waiting to be sent to the front. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of farces from Limburger cheese, which is used to refuel the enemy, and Chaplin's raid. The enemy territory is dressed like wood. <br /> <br /> To this stage of this career, a great man is so immersed in cinematic expression that his films give the impression that they are making themselves. Undoubtedly, this was not the case, but, nevertheless, it gives the most realistic picture of life at the front, as far as I remember, albeit from an ironically humorous point of view. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, acquaintance with Chaplin’s entire work should be a prerequisite for all film fans - do not delay!
