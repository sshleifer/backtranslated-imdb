A refreshing interview with the legendary Italian filmmaker-producer-director, who passed away in 1999 with nearly 200 roles in his capacity as a director. Much of it is spent on erotic sex films by D'Amato, including his notorious EMANUELLE recordings with Laura Gemser. They will also take a brief look at his porn career, which kept him afloat during his last decade or so. More interesting for me is the section dedicated to his horrors and actions. D'Amato has many wonderful jokes about the actors and his low-budget films, including the story of an assistant who accidentally collects real bones among the fake while shooting in a 2000 year old catacomb. Other respondents include George Eastman and Al Kliver. I would like to talk a little more about his production in the films "Stateside Filmirage" (not a single question about TROLL 2; if it were not a cult film, as it was now).
