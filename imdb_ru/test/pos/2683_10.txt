In short, this is a comedy series with the best actors in history, as well as the cutest. Each of them is a comedian firsthand. I know only one series that was better (for example, "Moon Life"). ) This had Willis as a leader, but he only had Willis, while King Queens has many actors who are as good as possible - Kevin James, Lea Remini, Jerry Stiller, Patton Oswalt, Nicole Sullivan Victor Williams, Gary Valentine and even everyone else. I liked it spontaneously, constantly and quickly, but my age still did not spoil the fun. <br /> <br /> In some words, the series is intelligent and original, miraculously spared from the current television stupidity and rubbish. This is politically incorrect and does not persecute minorities in the usual disgusting way. <br /> <br /> Comics are very nice and tasty. <br /> <br /> I read, mostly approvingly, several IMDb writers, and sometimes they write about their favorite TV shows, but, although there are several of these authors, I haven’t met any mention of my favorite TV shows (- but it is true that critics who do not like those with whom he finds complete approval, but those who at least offer a general basis for disapproval), are mainly “WILD WILD”, “LUNAR LIGHT” , “QUEEN”, “FANTOMAS”, The Twilight Zone of the 80s, Bradbury TV Show and SandoCan. Most of them I saw when I was 13-14 years old; I already wrote about some of them flawlessly.
