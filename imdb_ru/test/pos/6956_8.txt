The adaptation of director Jay Craven to the Howard Frank Mosher film “Where Rivers Flow North” is one of the best transitions from literature to the screen. Craven is a fan of the work of Mosher - he also took off the "Stranger in the Kingdom." <br /> <br /> The cast is great, especially Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal. Thorn offers what may be the best role in his career - Noel Lord, a fiercely independent former woodcutter who is at the center of this story. Tanto Cardinal portrays the living maid / common-law wife of the Lord, as well as the dead man. I am surprised and disappointed that none of them was nominated for an Oscar when this film was released. Submissions of this caliber must be recognized. The only character I find hard to swallow is the executive director of the energy company, played by Michael J. Fox. He is just too much like a child in this role. I believe that to a youthful appearance lies a curse, no matter how much people want it. <br /> <br /> Craven did a great job of displaying a Vermont character from the beginning of the 20th century — the places, corners, sets, everything unites to transport the viewer to the time and place of the story. The cinematographer Paul Ryan was exceptional. The “Horseflies” score is also top-notch - it fits perfectly in the mood and setting. <br /> <br /> And the story itself ...? One of the most convincing images of the cruel, independent American spirit of the pioneers that ever existed is a trait that is disappearing in our day. When it appears in our time, a person is often looked upon with suspicion and contempt. In Noel Lord, we have a character who we can admire for his values ​​and even his stubbornness. <br /> <br /> This is not a boring “historical period”, but a vivid look at a bygone era and the type of character that has almost disappeared. These are not gilded heroes, but real people who have strengths and weaknesses. struggling in harsh conditions to live their lives and at the same time be at peace with the world in which they live. Like today, there are those who have the power that would otherwise have it.
