Not for those adrenaline maniacs, etc. This is a good film, which looked after the war, a mental problem from another point of view. <br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez is great in his youth, he is haunted by the demons of the Vietnam War, causing problems in the family. <br /> <br /> Marin Shin is as good as a conservative father. <br /> <br /> It all comes down to how to deal with the past, with whom <br /> <br /> Emilion Estevez's character seems to be unable to cope, and Martin Sheen's character does not want to deal. <br /> <br /> A protective mother looks at this problem with a warm and open heart, but with a closed mind for an obvious reason.
