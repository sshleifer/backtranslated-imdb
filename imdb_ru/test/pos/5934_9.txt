Shaun Michaels vs Edge-8. It's hard to believe that Sean Michaels is in the first match, but still a great match for both men, Edge, whether you like it or not, a great performer in the ring, and Sean Michaels is just not at an age when it comes to his performance of The Undertaker vs. Heidenreich . Casket Match-2 - OK, after a good opening match, this is what a crappy match. The Undertaker gave some great matches at Royal Rumble, and the 1998 Royal Rumble vs. Shawn Michaels was the same, but it is much worse than in this match. <br /> <br /> Kurt Angle vs. the Big Show vs Bradshaw. Triple threat of WWE Championship-6 - Everything is in order, I feel that all three could show the best performance, it simply did not show them at their best. <br /> <br /> Randy Orton vs. Triple H. World Heavyweight Championship-9 - Triple H gets a clean win, can you believe it, of course, he pulls out a sledgehammer, but does not use it. Randy Orton did an excellent job when he acted as if he had a concussion, but how he was concussed is really funny. I really enjoyed this match, it was the best performance I have ever seen at HHH. <br /> <br /> The Royal Rumble Match-7 - It was very interesting, and I usually do not score the roar of the roar of this high Once again, the winner is very predictable, but there were just a lot of points that were very interesting to see. Segments with Flair and Guerrero are the best I've seen lately. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great PPV, and it definitely should be for lovers of wrestling.
