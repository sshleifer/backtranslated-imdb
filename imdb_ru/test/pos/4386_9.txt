I have seen almost all the films of the Cohen brothers now, and I must say that this is one of their best films. I would not dare to say that he is better than the “Big Lebowski”, but by himself he was very good. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought the story was very interesting and fun. I liked all the characters, especially Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete). <br /> <br /> Actually, I can't say anything bad about this movie, but this movie is not for everyone. It’s safe to say that if you liked the films of other Coen brothers, I hope you will like this one. And if you liked what you saw in the trailer, I think you will like the film, but do not hold me for it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I hope you enjoy (d) the movie just like me. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> - Chris
