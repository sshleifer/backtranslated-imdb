This film was really well written and was very interesting. It was also great to play in it. Luke Perry did a very convincing job. (as he always does) If you are looking for a rich movie to watch it, this should be at the top of your list. There is a mixture of comedy, drama and action movie. You can literally feel what the actors feel in certain moments. I was very impressed with this movie. The special effects were very well done. The whole movie was very convincing. This movie is one of my favorites. What happens is that North America can be torn apart, and Jack and his team should try to stop the eruption, destroying North America. It was a very cool and creative idea. I liked this movie, and I know you too.
