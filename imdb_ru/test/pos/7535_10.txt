I think this film is undervalued. For me it was like a breath of fresh air. Some people complain about the improbability of the plot, too long episodes and lack of sex (the latter, I believe, is the main cause of "improbability"; and how is it that there are no drunk teenagers talking dirty?!) But this is not their business and good for them if they cannot relate to the story. The performances are excellent; I would really like to see more actors in other films. Emotions are real. All unrequited love thing is presented with supernatural subtlety. And it gives you the tingling you expect from a good movie.
