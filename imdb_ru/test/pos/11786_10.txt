I just want to say that I was glad to find these comments about the show. In the past, I tried unsuccessfully to find information about shows on the Internet. I loved the show. It's hard for me to be motivated to exercise, but this show made it fun. Another comment mentions that it was not as difficult as it is today. It was the perfect training that did the job! I would give everything so that you can buy a copy of only one workout. I remember a lot of moves, but not almost all. Someone, please try to get it back on the air and also make it available on DVD. It's so great to know that I wasn't the only one who enjoyed this show! Thank you for making my day!
