I recorded it as a teenager in the mid-80s, based on a brief overview in the cable guide (I liked the aspect of hunting for rubbish), not knowing and not waiting for the film. what a nice surprise when i looked at it! It was such a funny movie, and I remember watching it repeatedly. I thought the concept was well executed, I enjoyed the harmless competition between different groups, and I thought the scavenger hunt itself was pretty clever. Sometimes it seems that people have too high hopes for films. Not all films will have a weighty “message” or star game, production values ​​or special effects. sometimes films are simply meant to be fun and fun, and this works out on both levels. It was so nice to read the comments from the actors who played the twins. I have not seen this film for years, but if I did, I think that I would have had the same warm and enthusiastic reaction to it, as in my teens. even when I type it, fragments of a raw, but suitable topic run through my head: "When midnight madness begins to reach you ... no matter what you say, no matter what you do." ..! ”
