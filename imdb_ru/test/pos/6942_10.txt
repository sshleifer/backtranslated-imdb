In one thousand nine hundred and eighty second year, when it was announced that the dismissal would be committed, a stormy controversy began. It was an event that still left open wounds in the hearts and minds of the Australian people. After some changes (listen to timely phone calls to hide names), the dismissal went on the air. It was just brilliant. Drives were perfect. Max Phipps as Gough Whitlam leads, followed by John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and evergreen John Mellion as Sir John Kerr. Time was created well, people's feelings were well made, and political elements were not two-dimensional turned into a melodrama, as in many American TV shows. The dismissal was a true re-creation of time in Australia, which some would prefer to forget and which we cannot forget. it did not take sides, and it pointed out the mistakes and lies of both sides. This leaves those who wish to preserve the rage and change the constitution that still allows this to happen again. Firing is now available on DVD in Australia.
