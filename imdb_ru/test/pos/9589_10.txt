Well ... I think it's time for a little rant. Two wonderful years have passed since I sent my original comments, praising this popular sports comedy ..... and this damn thing still has not hit the video or DVD (or did not even repeat it on television!)!) !!!!! <br /> <br /> Does anyone know why not? Did a BBC-style error occur that caused the original copy to be deleted / incorrectly installed / erased? <br /> <br /> Listen, you are responsible for ITV a lot - burn it on DVD now !!! Do you even understand how funny this program was? This makes "Mike Bassett" look as bad as the current team of pants "Spurs". <br /> <br /> Wrecked. At the moment.
