Waco: Rules of Engagement does a very good job without drawing conclusions for its viewers. It simply presents interviews, footage, videos of congressional hearings, telephone conversations, expert testimony, etc. And it allows you to make your own conclusion. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m hardly going to mean that the data presented here was done with 100% objectivity, but this is very convincing. Koresh you will not like it more when you see it than you have seen before, but I am inclined to think that you will believe, as I am now, there is a lot that we were not told about what happened before and during the confrontation
