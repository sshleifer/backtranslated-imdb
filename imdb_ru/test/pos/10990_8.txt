Being from the Buffalo area, I was well aware of the film, having read many articles in local publications. What impressed me most was the film, especially its clever plot, acting and local scenes. It's nice to see so many older, quality stars in various roles. I feel that especially those of us who are over 50 will find the film excellent, and you can leave the theater, feeling that your time was well spent.
