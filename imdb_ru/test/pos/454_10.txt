great movie, with a rather obscure political message. This is a theater style, i.e. Most of the action takes place inside. Mayor Surov and Diana Ashcroft seem equally suspicious of each other. Emotions run high, since Western tourists and businessmen seem unwilling and unable to succumb to the Eastern Russian charm of the mayor, although he makes every effort to understand their point of view. two opposing worldviews are clearly marked, but the film also shows that human emotions cannot be controlled by politics. He was powerful and had a strong emotional impact on the film of the 50s.
