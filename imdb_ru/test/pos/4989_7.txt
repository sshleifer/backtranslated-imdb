Too much has been added, too much has been taken away from the great Western, which McMurtry wrote about Texas Rangers against the Indians. This script removes it only to fill this mini-series with a variety of warm fuzzy relationships, which in fact were secondary to the storyline. It ends in a completely incredible and independent ending, not written in the book, which makes you wonder how to transfer us to the Lonely Pigeon. <br /> <br /> In fact, the main characters of the series were actually very good, the filming locations were excellent, but this mini-series had to remain true to the great book.
