The reason why I think this film is incredible is because there are so many emotions in it. From the script and the incredible game, you can say that history is behind all the senses. You understand why characters perform certain actions, and why others do not. You can feel sympathy, joy, love and sadness for them at the same time. You see humanity at its best and at its worst. You can relate to characters because, although you may never have been in their exact situations, before you see in them the qualities and flaws that you see in yourself. To some extent, this film makes you think, but in the end it explains everything, and you feel a certain peace and understanding not only in you, but also in the characters. I will say that I have never cried so much in my life and have not received so much from something. I beg you to watch this movie and take it to heart. That there is only one true thing, and that is ... love.
