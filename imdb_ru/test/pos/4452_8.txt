I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the plot and character. Fulci was a master at creating a terrifying atmosphere, using ingenious camera work, vivid cinematography and, yes, surprisingly frank blood. <br /> <br /> This film, however, is no exception, compared to his later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2). “The city of the living dead”, “House at the cemetery”, etc.) The characters here are extremely well developed, and the emphasis goes away from the supernatural and depends more on the expectations created by the classical stranger among the lush hills of Italy. Landscapes at some moments remind of treasured folklore, and then immediately contrast with mud and blood-soaked horror, shrouded in crumbling ruins. The blood in this film is not so widespread and seems restrained compared to the later Fulchi films, however, spray and hyallo fans will most likely be satiated with several close-ups of oozing wounds and the last 5 minutes of the film. <Br /> <br /> In general, a fantastic and mature film from one of our great Italian horror directors.
