I love this film. and the Disney Channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. I think they should definitely put Suzy Q back on air for at least one night so we can record it !!! but if not, does anyone know where I can find it ?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com, please email me if you know where I can find this movie. Online or anywhere. I told my children about this film, and I think they deserve to watch it too. All these Disney films that are coming out now are fake and boring. I need Susie K backwards !! It was a great movie with great actors, and I donâ€™t understand why it was aired. If everyone likes this film so much, why was it taken off the air? Please take note of my comments and along with all the other comments on this film. Thanks, have a nice day.
