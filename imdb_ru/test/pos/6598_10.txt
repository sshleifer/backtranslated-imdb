I have to say that this should be the best documentary I've ever seen in my life. At first I speak the film in the house of my friends, and I have not had the opportunity to finish watching it. From this point on, I spent my free time trying to find a movie. I never found him, but on my birthday my friend, who knew that it was the most difficult for me to find a film, received it as a gift. Sean Penn does an excellent documentary story. I liked how he told the story of each of the Z-Boys and the story of Dogtown. I have been to Venice and the surrounding area many times and never knew what happened until I saw the documentary. I did not have the opportunity to watch the film itself, and I heard that it does not look like a documentary at all. I don't know if I really want to watch a movie, but who knows.
