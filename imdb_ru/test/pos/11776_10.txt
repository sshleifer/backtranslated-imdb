<br /> <br /> Fourteen of the funniest minutes on celluloid. This short parody is at least as much a part of the Star Wars saga as the Phantom Menace, and much more interesting if you ask me. Hardware Wars were the first in a long series of parodies of the SW, which today form its own subgenre. I hate to describe it too much - it is so short that the premise is almost everything. Suffice it to say that many of the most popular and familiar aspects of Star Wars enjoyed themselves. Household appliances, such as toasters and vacuum cleaners, depict spaceships and robots, the character Princess Anne-Droid wears real buns instead of the famous tangles of braided hair, and Fluke Starbucker is even more dumb than his original, if so. possible. Ernie Fosselius is one of the crazy sons of the dollar, he is also the source of Porklips Now, a parody of the Apocalypse Now.
