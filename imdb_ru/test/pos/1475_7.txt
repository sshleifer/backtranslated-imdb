Oh! When good actors take soft stuff! If you think of this movie as a hardcore police thriller, you may be disappointed. While the situations are very plausible, the plot unfolds in a very predictable clip, and you can see pretty well what lies ahead before the actors take you there. Many of the criminals and minor figures are actually just stereotypes in motion. Most of the dialogue is just dumb. <br /> <br /> But! If you like to see how good actors rise above this material and make something of it, then you will love this movie! Sam Elliott is nothing more than a brilliant man who took note of the character of Detective Falon, revived in depth and pathos. Those of you who have never seen Elliott show emotions so far from his usual sassy racks will be delighted with the range of emotions that he portrays in this film. And also, in his early fifties in this film, he looks fantastic! His naked chest gives hope to middle-aged people everywhere! Esay Morales does a wonderful job, enhancing his role in Det. Passionate beaver Falona, ​​a new partner of the police. He could easily play him in the role of Robin for Batman Elliott, but instead he breathed authenticity and passion into this role. He makes it work, despite some of the sloppy lines that he is given to say. <br /> <br /> Paul Sorvino is fun to watch! He plays an eccentric police captain. It seems he knows that he is dormant in this film and does it with a ball. He also makes it fun for us. <br /> <br /> This film is very plot, but it compensates for this with great performances! Sam Elliott fans must get it, because it sucks to see how he spreads his wings and does much more than he is usually allowed to do!
