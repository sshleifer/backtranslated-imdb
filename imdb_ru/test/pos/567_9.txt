I watched this movie with my mother. She is 81 years old and she grew up to be a fanatic. She even acknowledges this. I do not think that she really understood what was happening, she had already decided that the child was guilty. Fearfully. I felt for this child and his family. What torture they survived and remained faithful. This is real faith. Back to the movie. Police forces and their ineptitude disgust me. I am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work on this case. For this family it was very fortunate that they had a man who cared enough to see through the shit that was passed to him. I could tell when one of the cops lied. He will not face the defender. His eyes moved to the side when he answered the questions. Unfortunately, a black man must be punished because of the color of his skin. I read a book about a black man who is being dragged behind a truck by three white men. They were finally found guilty after many years. I can't remember the name, but it was the same premise. Whites do what they want with black. I am sure that the child in the film will be traumatized for a long time, if not forever. I told mom that most serial killers and pedophiles are white. No comments from her. I want to thank the director and producer of this film. I feel that the revelation they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project. I am an avid viewer of Indian films. I feel that they are well written and have content. I am glad that I managed to take this film on the shelf. I felt obligated to write a comment because of how much I feel about the film and the prejudices that continue to exist in our modern society.
