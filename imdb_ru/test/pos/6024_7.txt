I have this film, and I love Canadian films, but I donâ€™t understand hiring an actress like Rose. She is completely useless in this film, only the name and all. I was surprised by the plot, which is not used for the first time. But these unknown actors played well even Jergen, I am not a big fan of him, but I liked him in this film. If you have a chance to see it, go for it.
