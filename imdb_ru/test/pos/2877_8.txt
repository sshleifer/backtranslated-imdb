So the WWE did it. They join the film, their first film is “See No Evil” with their own Kane. I caught this film and entered without expecting it to be a great movie ... It just seemed like a cliche and did not look anything new. To my surprise, it really wasn't half bad. The viewer stated above that this is a good horror film, and, frankly, this is the best way to describe it. Now the question I asked myself was how Kane was going to hold out ... Well, let's just say that he made an absolutely bad ass from the character "Jacob Goodnight". He sold the role very well, and really looked threatening. But what can you expect from a man who is almost 7 feet tall and weighs about 320 in strong muscles. The game was decent, and the story, of course, was not something new, but we all know it. The direction as well as the cinematography were very well done, and the background of the hotel really looked dilapidated and well done. With this in mind, it was directed by a porn film director, I was very surprised. I would recommend this movie if you are looking for mindless blood and murder and just a little fun. Think of this movie as a modern day on Friday of the 13th movie. And leave room for the final, because it is good. And hold on to loans too ...
