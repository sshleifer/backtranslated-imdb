I watched the movie "Beep" and immediately decided to comment on it. The truth is that NATURE needs protection from us because we are the dominant species of this planet. Some people think that if they have money, they can do whatever they want, which is probably similar, but if they think more about the future, they think about themselves, they will do something useful! This film is not only about children, this film shows us that children tend to care more about it than adults. When I was twelve, I saw several water lilies and knew that they were protected by law, and did not even dare to touch them without fear of the law, but fearing that I could actually harm them. (I'm 15 years old now) No matter what, the acting was great, the 3 main characters are well interpreted, and we all need to learn from them. I hope you all think about what you saw in this movie !!! and enjoy!
