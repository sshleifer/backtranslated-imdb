Blademaster is definitely a memorable entry in the Swords and Magic movie category. I found Blademaster with Quest for Mighty Sword in a consignment shop where people with mental disabilities were sitting, and was very happy to pay 2.00 for each. Believable scenery and costumes, a good sword fight and a beautiful warrior, Mila makes this watch enjoyable. Several problems, however, had many details that did not quite fit, such as cavemen. I did not understand their purpose. In addition, this film really could win from a few more monsters. The snake was cool, but I think she borrowed a little from Conan. Nevertheless, any primitive kind of film where someone ends up with a hang glider suits me (see “Yor” and “Battle for Endor”). I think Ator is cool! Oh, and has anyone else reminded Gallager a villain or is it just me? I give the blade 7/10
