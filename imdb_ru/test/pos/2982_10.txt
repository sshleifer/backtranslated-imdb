Michelle, Anise Alvina, was very sweet, and I really fell in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. "The Seasons" by Elton and his arranger Paul Backmaster sing forever in my head ... Please, if you know where I can find a VHS film, write to me !! My husband is 26 years old and I saw this as juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend then and remains so. I think we both cried. I think that maybe we were attracted to the film by the music of Elton John in it, but then we were swept away by the teenage fear of it all. Paul and Michel were about our age, when we watched the film - so easy to identify with it !! It's nice to hear that Sean is doing well, I am also in the "help profession" (RN). I thought his performance was good and very believable. "Michelle" seemed very sweet, fragile and vulnerable. I think that the main topic is that if they did not have to deal with the "real world", they could be happy and continue to love. How many times have we all wanted to have a “Calgone moment”. If we all had no external worries and we could just cope with our "basic needs", it could be a little easier. I have a 15-year-old daughter, and I will not have problems so that she watched this film. Nowadays, children see much worse than ever. For those of you who are trying to find a CD, my husband (a big fan of Elton John) was able to get a set of two CDs that was released in 1992. He is called "Elgram John's Studios - a rare master" Polygram. It has all the songs of friends, as well as many others. As far as we know, this is the only CD with music "Friends". We also had LP a few years ago, and we were glad to find this CD. Good luck. I recommend this film to anyone who loves the theme of "young love." I just want it to be on DVD now !!
