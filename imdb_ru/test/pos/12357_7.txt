I thought it would be a more fantastic story. But this topic is rather mundane compared to the story about the “Death Coach” that I expected. In fact, the social drama is much more. As usual in the "European films of the authors." <br /> <br /> Actors are interesting, not replayable, like on average silent film. Images are not so good to memorize as in Bergman's Smultronstället. <br /> <br /> It is true that the comparison of two films is the main thing. Smultronstället begins with the vision of the death crew, in which Shesthrom's character can see his own body. There is a clock without hands. He has to look back on what he did wrong. There is a vision of his happy family in the country. In Körkarlen Sjöström, his wife does not cheat on his eyes, but she wants to escape with small children, because with him he will never be better. In the end, Edith's confession is a kind of living judgment. <br /> <br /> Well, I would just add that the Sixter is destroying the door with an ax, because his wife locked it and plans to leave with the children, reminding me the Shining One. Which was a much more fantastic tale with Death hanging around.
