Victor Sjostrom, the grandfather of Swedish cinema, made this harsh existentialist film about redemption, betrayal, death, forgiveness, guilt, redemption and the darkest moments of the human condition. He is acting in the role of David Holm, a worthless young man who reacts to a moment of kindness, returning to his drunken ways, and only then has to bargain for his soul with the driver of a ghostly carriage - death. /> Unlike many silent films of that period, there are practically no over-voltage scenes in the film. The pace becomes tedious with his too familiar Dickens narration. However, considering the film in retrospect and in comparison with the others of his time, this is a very bold and unique film. The audience of that time was not subject to such a subject, and the cinema is huge, symbolic and accompanied by double-exposure effects and multilayered memories. This is a really creepy and frightening movie for young people. <br /> <br /> When watching a film, it’s easy to see how this film later influenced the Swedish master Ingmar Bergman. Most of the great themes of Bergman are here in full display. Sjostrom, of course, later appeared in Bergman's masterpiece about alienation and solitude: strawberries. This will be the last performance Siostrom as an actor. Sjøstrom founded the script based on the novel by the Swedish writer Selma Lagerlof. *** out of 4 stars.
