There were a lot of films about people returning home from wars and forced to cope, but “War at Home” is worth seeing. Depicting a Vietnamese vet, Jeremy Collier (Emilio Esteves), who is having trouble with his Texas family, most of the film is probably annoying. But nothing can prepare you for what will eventually be revealed. <br /> <br /> In part, this film is so good that it gives the viewer the feeling of both Texas and the gap between generations. The parents of Jeremy Bob (Martin Sheen) and Maurin (Kathy Bates) clearly have problems with their son’s attitude both to the war and his rejection of Americanism. His sister Karen (Kimberly Williams) is not sure who to side with. But after dinner there can be no neutrality. <br /> <br /> So we Americans can never completely overcome the Vietnam War, but this film can probably help us take a serious look at how this affected us. many people. Emilio Estevez, of course, perfectly coped with the management. Also starring Korin the German and Karl Gugino.
