I was excited at the opening to hear the Chevaliers De Sangreal part, but I wanted more, so I bought this play by Hans Zimmer. Perhaps the most inspirational and beautiful 4 minute music ever written! This film is a thriller masterpiece, even without religious considerations. You get to tour the Vatican and parts of Rome with superb cinema. The discovery at CERN, where the “Particle of God” or the greatest amount of Antimatter is created using STUNNING visual effects, is a direct clue, foreshadowing the superiority of this film. Who doesn't love Hanks? The storyline and twists in this film are simply gorgeous and well crafted until a surprisingly twisted climax. This film offers a satisfactory compromise between Science and Religion, although many closed heads will remain on both sides. "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind." A.Einstein
