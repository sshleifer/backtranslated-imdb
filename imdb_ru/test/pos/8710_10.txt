This is one of the best and most capricious vampire tales! I really love this movie. The character is excellent, even the location and plot. In fact, the picture does not require a large budget, but it is absolutely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Well, there are some flaws in this film (especially the names of the castle and the location), but such errors as a rule, they are in almost every horror movie. <br /> <br /> The scenery fits perfectly into the story and is close to reality, I can say that this is honest, because I visit them once when I was on vacation in Romania. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the best part of a series of subspecies.
