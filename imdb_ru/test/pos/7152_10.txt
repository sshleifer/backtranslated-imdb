I watched this movie and loved it very much, the characters are wonderful. This is definitely my film, you are not bored in this film. I like independent films, they are much more useful. My husband and I really enjoyed the style of Jay. If you are an open-minded person who loves thought-provoking films and loves talking after everything ends, you will love this movie it definitely provokes thought. the movie will definitely tread on some fingers, but who cares is probably not going to watch this movie. It's amazing to see how the characters develop. Jay Floyd really captured both sides of the table. Applause, applause. Jay, I hope you are working on another movie.
