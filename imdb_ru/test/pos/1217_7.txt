“Hand of Death” or “Countdown” in Kung Fu (1976) is an underestimated early work by director John Woo. The movie stars are Dorian Tan (Tan Tao-Liang) and Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and James Tien in the lead roles. Many people believe that deceptive advertising believed or believed that this is a film about Jackie Chan. This is not a Jackie Chan film, Dorian Tan is a star, but Jackie gives one of his best (most serious) early performances. <br /> <br /> “The Hand of Death” tells about a Shaolin apprentice named Yunfei (Tan), who is sent on a mission to kill a Shaolin traitor named Shi Xiaofeng (Tian) and protect a revolutionary named Zhang Yi (Wu). Along the way, Yunfei meets a young woodcutter named Tan (Chan) and a shameful sword fighter (Chang Chung), known as the "wanderer." Both men suffered from the hands of Shi and want revenge. Three teams team up to defeat Shi and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety. <br /> <br /> Martial arts are above average under the guidance of Sammo Hung. Dorian Tan uses his signature high kicks very effectively as the “northern eighteen styles” along with some “southern five boxing styles”. Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan also provide excellent martial arts. James Tien is not the greatest martial arts master on Jade's screen, but does an acceptable job. Some of the early battles are a bit slow and seem overly choreographic, but the final bouts with Chan, Tan and Hung are very good. <br /> <br /> Directed by John Woo provides many interesting character developments in the film, which is refreshing. Cinematography Leung Wing Kat is very stylish, unique and beautiful for the Kung Fu movie of this era. Music by Joseph Koo: a combination of soft flutes and orchestral works in the style of the 70s "Shaft" is the best in kungfu movies. Hand of Death is not the usual comedy of kung fu Jackie and Sammo. “The Hand of Death” is a serious, straightforward story based on revenge. <br /> <br /> “The Hand of Death”, known as “Countdown” in Kung Fu, is an undervalued classic in the old school kung fu genre. The film is one of the best in artistic terms of its time and is a preview of the wonderful things from Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. Hung's great choreography is presented here even before his directorial debut and early charisma and Chan's talent are clearly visible. <br /> <br /> “Hand of Death” is a solid, stylish film about old-school kung fu and a brilliant early work by the legendary John Woo. <br /> <br /> Rating of the genre of kung fu 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Wanderer Teng (with reference to his new weapon): “The winged spear of the wing of the eagle”. <br /> <br /> Tan: “Just a Bauble.”
