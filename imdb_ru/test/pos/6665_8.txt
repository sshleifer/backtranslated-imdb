I really enjoyed it both times when I watched it. And both times I left thinking about it, and the “moral of history” is excellent. I agree with another reviewer that the film is not about the science fiction aspects that can be expected from an alien film on Earth, but rather about the human condition. The characters in the mental hospital give a good idea of ​​this and how they move from hopelessness to hope. In this film, there are touches of sadness and humor for sympathy for the final "he or not." This last question was well developed, and although some may argue that you don’t know what happens at the end, and the question remains unanswered, I feel that this is done in much more detail than something very simple, such as the film “ Ronin (with Robert De Niro), where you never know what is in the box, and you feel very upset about it. I highly recommend K-PAX. 8/10
