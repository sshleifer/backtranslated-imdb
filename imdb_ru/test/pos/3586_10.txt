full of surprises, beautiful, cruel at times. just like life itself. leaves one to ask for more. The best parts are, of course, fighting scenes and chases. I really have to wonder how much work these guys have invested in creating some scenes (whaling, polar bear hunting, etc.) This is a wonderful experience that one cannot miss if someone dives, surfs or occasionally goes to the beach. the music is tempting, and the story is excellent and very well developed. certainly one of the best documentaries ever made and worth no less than a very respectable 10 (for its type). Some shots are very cruel and cannot be recommended for people with a weak stomach (each killer whale video is cruel).
