This strikingly perverted and strange film about the corpses of teenagers of the 80s may never reach the surprisingly curved pinnacle of the deeply disturbing and criminally undervalued murderous mopetta “The Devil is Five Times”, but, nevertheless, it is above-average killer’s opus. less. <br /> A thin, but sound plot consists of three inappropriate Taikas - two brave boys and one eerily flickering, though angelicly looking little girl - they were all born during a solar eclipse on June 9, 1970. When the strange antisocial trio who keep together in a closed and closed circle reaches ten years, they suddenly become obsessed with murder and declare the open season unlucky, unsuspecting local yoke of sleepy and quiet California suburbs in Meadowville. , Writer / director Ed Hunt, usually incompetent unsung hack, responsible for such monstrous jerks as delightfully stupid "Star invasions", obscenely meaningless parable of Jesus Christ (!) "Alien Warrior" and incredibly stupid "Brain" performs a rather solid and skillful work : scenes of murders are abundant and rather cruel (the gag with an arrow through the eyes is especially unpleasant), there is a significant amount of unreasonable nudity and soft sex, considerable tension is neatly created and maintained, some are pleasant servings of dark humor emphasize badly distorted chaos and unexpected grim finale manages to really shake. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the cast of the upper box raises the process even further to perfectly watchable and exciting: José Ferror as a doctor from a small town, the future star of the series "Jake and Fatman" Joe Penny as an amateur astrologer, Lori Letin as Predators as a brave heroine nanny, Susan Strasberg as a bitchy school teacher, American Ninja Michael Dudikoff as a chowder, and Cyril O'Reilly (a lonely misanthropic vampire in a haunting melancholy Dance curse in a melancholy Dance curse, there are no more dude who n falls in bags, carrying only what you think with some hot naked girl behind a parked van. Billy Jacobi (who starred in such films of the late 80s as Doctor Alien and Demons), Andy Freeman and especially terribly delightful Elizabeth Hoi are sincerely eerie and convincing as a terrible trio of frighteningly evil and immoral pranks. And yes, this is none other than Julie Brown, the brass comedienne who received an unexpected blow from the Top 40 with the cheerful novelty of "The Guncoming Homes Queen's Gotta Gun", as a sweet, meaningless, full-breasted red-haired girl who makes a very long, perfect an extraneous but still sizzling and highly appreciated nude striptease while dancing in her bedroom to a merry screaming rock song! In general, this child is rated as a strong and satisfying subject slasher.
