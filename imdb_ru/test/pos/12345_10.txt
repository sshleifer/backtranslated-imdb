This is my favorite horror movie, close to Poltergeist. “One dark night” I saw when she first appeared in theaters in 1983 in the theater where I worked. <br /> <br /> I was born in 1963, so I have a certain love for the horror films of the 80s, even though they are a bit outdated, and the dialogue is poorly written. What seemed original to me was that the phenomenon of “mental vampirism” was not addressed (at least as far as I know at the time) and is a very real phenomenon. <br /> <br /> I didn’t know whether Adam West was in it (nothing against him, but his supporting role was not memorable), but I thought that Meg Tilly was a good actor. Unfortunately, the little-known Donald Hutton (from "Brainstorming" and "Invaders from Mars") as an ambiguous scientist who oversaw the research on the capabilities of Ramar. Being gay, I paid more attention to David Mason Daniels, the unfortunate but gorgeous guy Meg Tilly. He now sells real estate in Texas. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film was “realistic” for two reasons: Reymar, who was discovered murdering 6 girls in his surrealistic apartment, had a funeral that was rare in attendance, reflecting the fact that not only he is mysterious, a recluse, but a murderer. As is known, these species are buried without fanfare. Secondly, if the corpses were going to be telekinetically mobile, they would be stuck dragging their feet. The filmmakers could go for a walk, groan, stretch out the hands of zombies, but made a choice in favor of what would be plausible. Kudos! A humming electrical discharge from the eyes of Ramarr in his "throne grave" (as if he is watching his realm of the dead), throws a terrible purple light into the mausoleum, which will stay with you for many years! If you ever went to the mausoleum, even on a sunny day, you will notice that they have their own outlet lighting caused by stained glass windows. Don't make me start with cavernous silence. Even Ramar himself looked like a man who could look like an eccentric, perverted old man. The score was one of a kind and memorable, and I keep kicking myself for not getting on the tape when it first appeared. Shooting on the track was done where it was supposed to be. I especially liked the carefully planned characteristics of each corpse: a bride, a poorly decomposed child still holding her teddy bear, a grandmother, a tall, thin black guy, and a semi-veiled World War II veterinarian, and the green-eyed eyes of an elderly gentleman who first welcomed the initiators of the Sisters clique . I guess even corpses can be good actors. The only thing I had to moan about was a hand that had come out of one of the vaults, and it was impossible to strangle Julia's boyfriend, unless they first laid the corpse on his stomach and legs, but why? It also looked a bit fresh. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the fact that we never see the face of Ramara (until the last quarter of the film, which is similar to unpacking a birthday present), when he picks up a teenager, the girl ran away in a mental flash of his daughter. Then we see the coroners taking away his body in his one-bedroom apartment, where we see that he experimented with his telekinetic art, gradually introducing plates into the wall. The rest are really pulled when the Sisters group, like Heather, lures Julia to the final dedication, spending the night inside the mausoleum, but this is a good place for the unfolding horror later. The film is not bloody in any sense of the word. The worst thing is when daughter Ramara uses a compact mirror to return his strength to him, and he starts to bubble and then melts. I always felt that such a power as that of Ramar would never die, and the sequel is worth a look at it. I see it now: One Dark Night II: Turning In The Grave. But let's face it - the film stands alone. I heard that the film had other names, but the original fits. <br /> <br /> A remake will be meaningless. But if he was, I would have written the best dialogue and would have lengthened some scenes, for example, would show studies of Ramara's abilities carried out in the laboratory, instead of hearing about it on a tape recorder. In our information age, something like this would be well documented on DVD. And more corpses! Why just raise those in the mausoleum, when the power of Ramara can spread to the cemetery? Let's just say, I would not want to be one of those who should have put things in order at the end of the climax; what can also be shown. I think that if one of the initiating Sisters had recognized one of the corpses as a relative, it would add some good, if disturbing, character. With the effects of computer graphics, some amazing scenes with Ramar animating cremated remains would be behind the wall! <br /> <br /> Tell me what you want, “One dark night,” but it has everything. So at least once in your life, see ... or death!
