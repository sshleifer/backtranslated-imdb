This film about the robberies of 1955 tells about Tony le Stefanua, recently released from prison for theft, when he commits the plunder of his life. He teams up with his old buddies for robberies, and they lead an experienced safe cracker, Cesar from Milan (played by Jules Dassin, who also led. He managed only because he was on the black list as a Communist in the US and could not work in Hollywood.) The brilliance of this film is 1/2 hour during a robbery. All this time there is no dialogue and no music, only the muffled sounds of digging into the floor or drilling a safe. It increases tension and draws you towards you. They receive jewels worth several hundred million francs, but the jewel offered by Cesar to the dancer attracts the attention of three cruel brothers. They intended to get a cache for themselves and bring misfortune in their way. Excellent robbery / gangster film, but I prefer J.-P. Melville films in this genre. <br /> <br /> This film is like the lemonade I drank last night. I went to a Caribbean restaurant, and the lemonade was made from sugar cane juice instead of sugar. He also had a lot of ice and was heavy on lemons, leaving him rather sour (which I like). The sugarcane juice gave it a thin, slightly milder taste than real sugar, and the ice made sure that it was cold and refreshing while I was sucking it. 7.5 / 10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
