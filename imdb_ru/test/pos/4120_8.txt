Almost every commentator mentioned the way in which some interview shots are superimposed on the concert shots in some places. This is true, and this is the biggest flaw of this film. However, this is not so often or so bad that this video is not worth watching. If you're a Black Sabbath fan, you should see this. In addition to watching Black Sabbath in the 70s and early 80s, I saw them in 2005 or 2006, when they also titled OZZfest, as in this video. The concert was awesome and very similar to this, so I rented it first. This is just the best geizer rock. Check this.
