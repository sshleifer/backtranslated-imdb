An orphan boy named Tom (Tommy Pender), who works for a couple of shady chimney sweeps, is falsely accused of stealing from the mansion where he works, Mr. Grimes (James Mason) - a real thief - and goes to run. Tom's only alibi is the niece of the owners of the mansion (Samantha Gates, a slender blue-eyed blonde with long wavy hair who, I am sure, was the main reason why I repeatedly watched this in my childhood). He and his dog jump into the river, and the witch turns them into water-breathing cartoon characters! Being under water, he provides support and rescues a group of children breathing water, known as sharks. <br /> <br /> Very interesting and always fascinating fable, created in 1850, which should appeal to all children. The animation (42 minutes of HBO VHS print 85 minutes) is average, but it is preferable to the most modern daytime animation - even computer animation! My only real nuisance is a hole in the plot caused by a deleted scene. At 42:06, after the first verse of “High Kakalorum”, the film turns into a scene with an octopus swimming, followed by the meeting of Tom and Jacques with Terence. This leads to a scene in which a murderous shark (voiced by Mason) leads our heroes into a trap. Then the shark greets Tom: "Young Tom, it's so nice to see your ugly mug again," but for the first time in print, HBO Tom meets the shark! Most directories have a working time of 92 or 93 minutes, and it was previously available from Sultan Entertainment and Nelson, so it is highly likely that the HBO print is edited and / or compressed in time. In 2002, MGM released a 76-minute full-screen DVD print! Let's hope that the restored version will appear in the near future. <br /> <br /> The film is copyrighted by Ariadne Films 1978. "Ariadne" is an aquatic child, voiced by Samantha Gates. Bernard Cribbins, who plays Mason's crime partner, also voiced electric eel. A.K.A. Slip Slide Adventure.
