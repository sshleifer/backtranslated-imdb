After watching many other Wong Kar-Wai films (Happy Together, Fallen Angels, Dust of Time), I knew what to expect from the theater; the cinematography would be lush, the use of space and perspective would be diverse, the action would be excellent, and at least one of the characters would be consumed by unspeakable loneliness. In the end, it is these methods that make Wong Kar-Wai's art what it is. What I didn’t expect was how much I was dragged into the film, which some reviewers considered “unfinished” and forced characters who “seemed absorbed in longing”. <br /> <br /> I wonder how people can be so indifferent to a film that so vividly reflects the emotions and attitudes that many of us take for granted or diligently forget: an irresistible feeling of grief caused by betrayal; guilt caused by the thought of becoming no better than a traitor; ordinary, but deeply intimate moments of relationships, where the need to express themselves orally is completely unnecessary. This is what Wong Kar-wai is trying to portray in the film, and what he achieves so well. <br /> <br /> Too many Americans are consumed with the need to fill every moment of the film with dialogue; witty banter, disgruntled sarcasm and excessive confessions seem to be the pinnacle of “best” American film. Wong Kar-wai sees things quite differently. Instead of a character who needs to keep the audience informed of all her feelings, perceptions, or beliefs, the characters of Wong clearly express their feelings and understanding through gestures on the face, body positioning and, yes, silence. <br /> <br /> If viewers simply view this film in terms of character development and action, then they may be disappointed with what it has to offer. If they want to allow themselves to try to understand what the characters feel, they may have different attitudes to what Wong can offer them.
