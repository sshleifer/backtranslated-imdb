A variant of the same storyline was used in the episode "Simon and Simon" ("Thin Air"), which was originally broadcast in December 1982. <br /> <br /> The victim's floor was changed, the surviving spouse is one of Rick's “old flames.” It is also interesting to note that Gerald McRaeney played a part in this episode of the Rockford file. <br /> <br /> Both The episodes were based on Howard Brown's short story - as noted in the “caption writing” list. <br /> <br /> Anthony James plays one of his classic bad guy roles on television. <br /> <br /> Continuation of the concept between Rockford Files and Magnum PI and Simon & Simon are quite interesting.
