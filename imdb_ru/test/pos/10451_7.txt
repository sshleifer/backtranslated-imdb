Yes, it is an imitator of the Fast Times, but it’s still worthy entertainment. <br /> <br /> Some comedic episodes are really funny. A scene when three guys visit a Spanish lady, cheerful, with a little flamenco music in the background. The reaction when her husband, a sailor, comes home is a riot. The exploits of the guys in dealing with crabs are also fun when they try to “drown them” and when they visit the pharmacist. <br /> <br /> A scene with abortions is also quick times, but it copes well with the situation. You really feel that Karen is going through, and Gary in his insane fight for cash, to pay for the abortion and adapt to her recovery. <br /> <br /> The end is painful, but refreshingly realistic. Beginners will not be ready for this, and it will be a shock. <br /> <br /> Guys with young girls and a milf Spanish lady have decent chocolates, but heterosexual guys will probably want to skip the penis dimension competition. <br /> <br /> Under-rated soundtrack too. Check out early, early U2 (!), Cars in their prime and the suitable James Ingram tearjerker song for an unexpected finale. <br /> <br /> Some people will hate it, and this is somewhat outdated, but those who like teen films or grew up in the early 80s should like this.
