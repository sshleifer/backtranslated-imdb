I get pleasure from new Who fans who call it great. They have the right to this opinion, but the new series is not quite ready yet, it already exists. This is definitely good. <br /> <br /> Good things first. The special effects clearly improved 20 years after the last episode of “Doctor of the Battle” was aired in “Doctor Who”. <br /> <br /> One thing that the BBC always liked was the Doctor Who (except when they tried to cancel in the 70s and 80s). Nevertheless, the expectation and pressure were great, but I think that the New Series has passed the test, it’s good, it’s still not great, because it has its drawbacks. Some of the stories "Far away" were very poor. I believe that it was written a couple of minutes later by some idiot who never tried to remake the Dalek character or never tried to watch the old TV series. <br /> <br /> “Aliens in London” was undoubtedly the best episode so far, he started a new storyline about Aliens, which continued in several episodes, including “Bumtown”. <br /> <br /> Now the other bad things, Rose's companion, Billie Piper, are not great. She is in fact very annoying, but, like the doctor, who ultimately had to be chosen by a young baby, and she got the role. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is quite respectable, he began to occupy his niche. He tried to play a character, right then funny, always skipping the correct line of impact, but he took it much more seriously, and it shows. <br /> <br /> There are some problems in succession that cannot be solved well, Paul McGann Before that, he was still a doctor, but he was not brought back. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the series as a whole is quite good, I did not miss the episode, and it is never boring, so I recommend Any Doctor Who a fan to check it out and see the new Doctor Who series.
