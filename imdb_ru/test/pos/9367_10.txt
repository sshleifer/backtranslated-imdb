This best picture of 1947 also deals with anti-Semitism and surpasses the GENTLEMEN AGREEMENT Elia Kazan (the possible winner of the Academy Award this year) in virtually every department. Edmar Dmitrik's near-perfect direction, John Paxton's short script and Expressionist J. Roy Hunt's skillful lighting are wonderfully backed up by an excellent cast. Although Robert Young (playing a frivolous, methodical and very handsome cop) and Robert Mitchum (who does have an occasional catchy witty remark) are nominal movie stars, they are Oscar nominees Robert Ryan and Gloria Graham - and also Paul Kelly, in a small but the key role of the miserable husband Graham - which gives the most memorable characteristics of the film; Ryan proved himself so convincingly as a racist killer that for a while he was a typical actor, surpassing the same villainous roles in films such as Act of Violence (1948), CAUGHT (1948), Racket (1951), “CLASH BY NIGHT” (1952) Nude Spur (1953) and Bad Day in Black Rock (1955). The film is also known for its atypical structure in that Ryan’s “retrospective” sequence, completely fabricated, is shot in a straightforward way, while the actual truth comes from the vague, distorted memories of the real hero of the film, which, moreover, is not even played one of the movie stars! In addition, CROSSFIRE originally had to relate to homosexuality (according to Richard Brooks’s original original novel “The Brick Chanterelle”), but this forbidden subject was unacceptable for the Hayes Office at that time - this is far from the situation we have today, when (by at least) 3 films on the topic of gays are preparing to release the main Oscars of this year! <br /> <br /> The print used for DVD Warners shows some unfortunate signs of wear, but audio Good comments by noir experts James Ursini and Alain Silver are good, although I do not inadvertently share their view that Dmitry’s career has declined steadily after his problems with HUAC, such as excellent shots, such as Sniper (1952), Cain MUTINY (1954), BROKEN LANCE (1954), YOUNG LIVES (1958), WARLOCK (1959) and MIRAGE (1965) clearly prove; saying that his collaboration with RKO with producer Adrian Scott and screenwriter John Paxton is MURDERING MY SWEET (1944), ANGULAR (1945; I hope this will be part of Warners' next film Noir Box Set) and his best Job. In any case, in my opinion, the latter is not only one of the key films of the 1940s, but also one of the best works of noir in history.
