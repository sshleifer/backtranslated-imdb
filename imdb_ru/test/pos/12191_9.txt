The film, although not true to the original novels, succeeds in creating a modern gothic vampire vision. Someone tried to insult QotD, calling it a 1.5-hour music video. In fact, this addition. The omnipresent gothic music, combined with frames like a music video, made the film so capricious, and Queen of the Damned is a story driven by mood. <br /> <br /> I don’t understand fans who complain about history modifications. The plot has been modified to be less confusing for viewers who do not know the novels. The number of characters has been reduced, and I have no problem with changing the creator of Lestat or skipping the character Mekare. The biggest change, the romance of Lestat and Jesse, seemed to me a very good addition. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think that correct adaptation would be a complete failure. The slow and gloomy mood that was ideal for the 19th century New Orleans and Louis did not correspond to Lestat’s rebellion and his music. And although the book can be slow, descriptive and combine many elements, but at the same time transmit them well, the film simply cannot do it without becoming chaotic. "Vampire Lestat" and "Queen of the Damned" can be divided into at least three films - the creators had to choose something. <br /> <br /> Some of the special effects, such as flying or exiting the flame. were the only thing I really didn’t like about this movie. But the death of Akasha was very sweet. The cast was good, Steward Townsend was as convincing as Lestat, especially at the concert, but I preferred Banderas as Armand. Although I loved Jesse, Maharata and Marius. And, of course, Aliya was beautiful with her quasi-ancient Egyptian accent. <br /> <br /> So if you're into gothic music and the vampiric dilemmas of loneliness and eternity (and you don't consider books to be scripts from films) “Queen of the Damned” is one of the few films in which vampires are more than bloodsucking monsters. But please do not compare this with the movie "Interview". He has a completely different style, exactly the same as that of Louis and Lestat. Personally, I find it exciting to first observe the existence of a vampire from the point of view of Louis "bottle hunger", and then switch to a man deprived of all morals, but surprisingly sociable for a vampire, Lestat. <br /> <br /> I’d give 8 to 10 to the Queen, as she had some technical flaws, but I decided to give her 9, because she’s greatly underestimated by people who hate her simply because not consistent with their vision of books, which can be clearly seen by looking at the breakdown of votes.
