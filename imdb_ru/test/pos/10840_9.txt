So far, only the first episode has been shown, and a lot of noise has been made about lesbian sex scenes. But for those who are trying to look into the past, they will find an incredibly beautiful love story, and the one that ended in this episode with a frustrating menopause. I found this story so powerful that I was inspired to read the novel on which this fantastic TV series is based.
