In December 1945, the train departs from Stockholm Central Station to Berlin. There is not much left when he arrives. Not about the train and not about some passengers. <br /> <br /> This is a black comedy shot by Peter Dalle. She acted as in the 40s, and also took a picture (b / w), as before. during this period. The actors must have had a lot of fun doing it. They are not such heroes as in the 40s, but the story is well told, and everyone has time. <br /> <br /> Deadly black and deadly funny movie. See if you didnâ€™t think the Swedes were capable of humor.
