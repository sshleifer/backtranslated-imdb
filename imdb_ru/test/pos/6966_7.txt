Seeing that this movie was at the bottom of IMDB 20, I just had to rent it. <br /> <br /> Surprise! Suprise! I do not regret seeing this film at all. Actually, I really liked it. In this film, there is a camp level that shames the cult classics of the 80s. This is stupid? yes, but Jim Winsky proves that stupidity is not necessarily bad after all. <br /> <br /> Take it down for a laugh that seems unintentional, but should actually be funny. Winsky is a genius. I hope he will be the director of the next film about ninja turtles
