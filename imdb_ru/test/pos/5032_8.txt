Michael is probably too kind for most action movie fans and too Hollywood for an intellectual crowd, but I find it very funny and very touching, despite the fact that he is both cute and formal. <br /> <br /> When three skeptics go to Investigate a man who claims to be an angel, they end up accompanying him on a big tour of the countryside of the Midwest, only to find out that each of their hearts needs an investigation. <br /> <br /> Taking it apart from the film, as in most modern films, there is not much new material, but in general it has a refreshingly original approach and is unusual enough to entertain it throughout. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this is not a family film, it is suitable for all ages and a good film that can be shared with the whole family or this special person. <br /> <br /> “Michael” is not a very good film, but he is definitely a good film, a touching film, and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> KWC
