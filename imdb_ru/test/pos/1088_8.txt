No music. Not a silly masala. A fairly realistic depiction of the police system in India, based on the real “meetings” specialist in India, Daya Nayak. This is Ab Tak 56 (56 symbolizes how many criminals were killed by the leader of Sadhu Agash - well, you already know that a little) The diamond emits Nan Patek as a relaxed and prudent Indian policeman. One liner is just fun. The plot, although a bit predictable in the review, is still intriguing. Another of the films from Ram Gopal Vermas The Factory. Films that are either decent or really good, Ab Tak CHappan is meandering close to very good. But still remains one of the Top 70 films released from India, including commercial and artsy. <br /> <br /> It’s great that the story is told calmly and finally shows (in an Indian film) how the police network works. The cast is really damn good but seriously, these lines are funny as hell (although I don't know if the subtitle version will look ridiculous). Manufacturers are trying to release a release in Cannes, which is interesting. Made by debut director Shamit Haman (I think this is his name). <br /> <br /> Again 55 years old. Nana Patekar, I am brilliant from his silly screaming roles of the past, just shows what a good director can do with a good actor. Really good stuff. If you are interested in Indian films and are disgusted with the nonsense that some of our guys are preparing, then this is definitely a relief. <br /> <br /> Again, Patek is the guy who happily carries the film on his shoulders and embodies the style of the film - relaxed, cheerful, intelligent and calculating. Good dialogue, good acting, excellent direction. Recommendations: Gangaajal, Ram Gopal Verma (both Indian films)
