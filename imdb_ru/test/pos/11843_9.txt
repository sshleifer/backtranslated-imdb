Joe (Wes) and Jim (Adam) once again acquaint us with the beauty, isolation (both psychological and physical) and the complete horror of "killing most birds" in the southwest of the Navajo. personal motives leave us with a desire for “more” ... with some interesting alternatives regarding who made it? Memories (for example, Peter Fonda. Glad to see it) give hints, but they don’t go as you think. Comical sides (for example, the Preacher) are soft and appropriate. Where "Skinwalkers" and "Coyote Waits" are starting to pull ... "Thief" turns on the clutch and rolls out four wheels around the next corner, never knowing what is there. I do not agree with Joe Liphorn’s manic commentary to Jim Chi to “slow down” the potholes. Wrong ... there are no potholes on the plot, only traces to follow. To the next episode! Excellent photo (as always), attractive characters and more to explore!
