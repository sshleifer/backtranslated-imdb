Now, more than ever, we need Peace and Love in this world! <br /> <br /> This film truly demonstrates the wonderful music of the Broadway show and the amazing choreography of the legendary Twil Tharp! I saw it again after many years, and it still feels good. <br /> <br /> Thank you, MGM / UA for recording this on DVD! I like the ability to view in widescreen. MGM is eager to do this in many of its DVD releases. <br /> <br /> I should like to treat Williams as Berger, and John Savage as Claude. They could not choose the best actors and actresses for this film! Beverly D'Angelo is such a “hot mom” in this film - I already forgot how hot it is! WOW! <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is great, <br /> <br /> the late great Nell Carter is being featured in several episodes of the singing role, as well as the strange Charlotte Ray (Mrs. Garrett on The Facts of Life.) > <br /> By the end, the story has weakened a bit, but the antiwar sentiments of the late 60s still remain and are relevant today. <br /> <br /> This is beautifully filmed (quite a bit in place), and so colorful and beautiful, and it really brings the spirit of 1968 back to the big screen. <br /> <br /> I saw this film when it was released in 1979, when I was 15 years, and was moved by him then, and he still moves me by 40 now. Some other reviews here say that they think it should be done earlier - I don’t think Hollywood was ready to make such a film back in the end s - early 70s. <br /> <br /> The Vietnam War ended in 1975, and it all happened too close to home, I think this story will be shot before it was (as in 1969, 70 , 71) <br /> <br /> Bravo to director Milos Forman! I like this film !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Nice to see him again, this time on DVD. It never looked better!
