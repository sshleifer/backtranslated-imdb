In 1242, two sides invaded Russia: from the east, from the Mongols and from Europe, the Germans, the Teutonic knights of the Holy Roman Empire. The city of Novgorod is the last free city in Russia. The population, in order to organize the defense of Novgorod and the lands of Russia, calls on Prince Alexander Nevsky, who defeated the Swedes in a previous battle. His successful strategy defeats the Germans after a great battle on a frozen lake. This film was shot in 1938 due to the threat of the Germans of Russia in the period before the Second World War. The idea was to make propaganda pro-Russian. Nevertheless, it is a stunning, marvelous, stunning, powerful masterpiece. Amazing battle scene on a frozen lake. The current generation is very accustomed to the special effects, as in the trilogy "The Lord of the Rings", and perhaps can not understand how fantastic this black and white fight. If the viewer can forget the ideology and look at it as an art, he will undoubtedly be surprised by such a masterpiece. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): Alexander Nevsky
