Perhaps the best role of John Travolta. Saturday night fever was a great movie and role, but a long time ago. I can't remember many of his films or roles that I even liked, and it’s easy to think about rotten ones. He can do small things like Pulp Fiction, but he does the perfect funk angel, and it’s hard to imagine someone doing the best (equally sloppy) job with him. Summary of the plot is available everywhere, but the plot is not in it. Just go for a walk and enjoy the cunning little fun along the way. There is nothing in this film that might not please, unless you are looking for something deep. I wish there were more such films. We need a break from deep or surprising or terrible or difficult or hysterical.
