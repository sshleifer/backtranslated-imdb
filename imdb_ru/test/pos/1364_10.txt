Believe me when I say this show is just ridiculous. The main story of Kintaro Oh, who travels from city to city, gets a part-time job, persecutes women and learns everything he can about life. Kintaro should be one of the easiest characters to do. He takes everything to the extreme, and every time he just laughs out loud. From his constant endless pursuit of life to tiny things that he instantly explodes in life or death. <br /> <br /> One of the funniest things about this show is that Kintaro always extremely exaggerates expressions and reactions. He spends a lot of time in various super deformed modes like Dragon Half or Trigun. In other cases, in less than 0.1 seconds, his face will become not just serious, but an expression of life or death in the style of a manga fighter, for example, a weightlifter trying to set a new record. It's fun. <br /> <br /> If this was not enough, the writing is excellent and the English voice acting could not be better. English VA Kintaro is perfect and makes you ride when he doesn't even say anything. The only thing worth mentioning is, without a doubt, the Ecchi series. It practically defines the word. If you're an adult anime fan and can make fun of movies like American Pie, you'll like it. <br /> <br /> - Rirath_com
