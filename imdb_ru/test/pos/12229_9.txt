A gentle film that presents how our daily lives are the catalyst that makes us turn our thoughts, behavior and emotions into people that we are not. This story is a love story where real emotions arise. I thank Malcolm Jamal Warner (win) and Challenge Cates for outstanding results. Cinema is definitely worth seeing, a festive route that turns into an emotional twist. I suggest to see this.
