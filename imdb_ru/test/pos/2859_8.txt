Neil Labute dramatically changes his first two films, “In the Company of Men, Your Friends and Neighbors,” with this funny and original thriller / comedy / road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her bad husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a strange kind of amnesia, and she runs into his car, not knowing that there is a large supply of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hired killers who follow her. <br /> <br /> Betty pursues, apart from the new beginning (although she cannot remember the old life) of her beloved, Dr. David Ravel (Greg Kinnear). The only problem: Dr. David is not real, he is a character in a soap opera on The Cause of Love, and he is a truly selfish actor named George McCord. <br /> <br /> Another thing to say is that there would be too much, but Nurse Betty is definitely original. His hired killers, like the hired killers of Pulp Fiction, are aggressive, but philosophical, his brothers from soap operas are amazing material about deception, and his playing is the best feature of all. This is supposed to be one of the best films in recent years. Renee Zellwegger is ideal for nurse Betty with a constant gleam in her eyes, which pushes her to search. Morgan Freeman brings his constant grace to the role of the killer at the end of his career, and Chris Rock his partner, a man of rage and impatience. Greg Kinnear is the best comedian, like a conceited actor and doctor of a soap opera. There are also great performances by actors such as winner Emmy Allison Jenny (West Wing), Harriet Sens Harris (Fraser’s agent Bebe Glazer) and Kathleen Wilhoit (Chloe on the ER). Actually, the auxiliary cast is “Who is who” of the best actors of the television characters. <br /> <br /> A unique film that makes you laugh and stagger in an instant, “Nurse Betty” is a combination of great acting, casting and a terrific actor. scenario.
