This film is the best movie I've seen in a long time. It is also the best film in which the drama was filmed to tell a story without going into speculation, for example, with John Kennedy, Nixon or Hoff. It cleverly depicts the vise of Belgium on the Congo. It also easily reveals for us the European and American forces that were behind the power that inflicted the Congo today. This film is undoubtedly definitely a part of the United States in the murder of Lumumba. This film can never be made in the United States, and the United States rarely criticizes itself for acts of imperialism and murder. (Save Stone's JFK) This also allows us to deal with the problems that were present in the Congoâ€™s internal conflict between Lumumba, Mobutu and Katanga. We can see how unstable countries are creating new governments when their history is connected with colonization, and those who were colonizers continue to pull strings of force and strength. The film is beautifully shot with Eric Ebuany, a great Lumumba. The cast is great and they really draw you into the climate of Congo at the time. <br /> <br /> Again, this is a must-see for those who love drama with the right historical past. See my notes on Quilombo.
