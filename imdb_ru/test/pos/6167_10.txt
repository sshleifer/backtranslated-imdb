If you want to see the true, ugly nature of communism, watch the movie DARK BLUE WORLD. (Tvamomodr√Ω Svet) It tells how brave Czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to England to join the fight against the Nazis. After the war, the Communists feared that they had picked up dangerous Western ideas about freedom. Thus, these heroic Czech pilots were thrown into a nightmarish prison, where some guards were the same Nazis whom they risked their lives to win. <br /> <br /> If Hollywood wants to understand why so many of their films fall flat, they should compare the parts of the drama of the character "Pearl Harbor" with this film. In Dark Blue World, you really connect with all the characters. At Pearl Harbor, everyone looks like some kind of funny cartoon version of a real person. <br /> <br /> There are countless examples of brilliant writing in this film. One funny scene that I remember is when the character Karel was taught English by a rather formal Englishwoman. When he cannot utter a word, he mocks a lesson. In a typical Stoic English manner, the teacher calmly but firmly opposes Karel and shames him for his behavior. <br /> <br /> The sequence of air battles in this film is amazing, and they help keep the film alive. I read that renting a plane costs $ 11,000 per hour, but it was worth every cent. <br /> <br /> Ladies, you have to cry because of sad movies, but guys, be careful! This film would make General Patton cry. And if you're a dog lover, you'll use half a Kleenex box. Do not say that I did not warn you.
