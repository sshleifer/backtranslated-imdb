One True Thing proves that the characters make the film. The strip will most likely receive an Oscar nomination for its role. The wonderful drama One True Thing is a prime example of film making in the late 1990s â€” there are still people who care about making and watching movies, except for the big blockbusters with million dollar special effects. This is not the best picture or anything else ... do not be silly. But the amount of emotion that was delivered by both the actors and the writer struck me like a shock wave. I cried twice in this film, which says a lot about a 24-year-old man.
