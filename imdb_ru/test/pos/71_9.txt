I have always loved this movie. Music, history and action. I especially love the opening and closing of the film. The music has stayed with me for many years. The fights on WW1 were great, and comedy is typical of Blake Edwards. In the end, the Blind is his forte. Julie sings amazingly and keeps me glued to the screen. The sets and scenes are wonderful. Characters are attractive. I liked the scene with the wounded soldiers and Julia singing for them. I would like her to sing to me in Vietnam. I also enjoyed the old cars of the period and the music of the First World War. I was glad when the DVD appeared. Now I can whistle in the dark, watching over and over again.
