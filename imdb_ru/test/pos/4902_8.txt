One of the best and highest-grossing Warner Brothers films in the thirties was this charming family drama about a widower who lives with her sister-in-law raising four daughters. But not four type daughters every day. All of them were trained by their father, a musician, on instruments and alone as a singer. They do compose great music together, even if it is for a long-haired set. <br /> <br /> You can observe the endless variety of roles that Claude Raines has played over the years, and you are still amazed at how he shows you another aspect of his creative personality. The opportunistic captain of Vichy in Casablanca is just as different as the scientist who has gone mad in Invisible Man, and the patient and wise Job in Mr. Skeffington. All the same man and everyone is so incredibly different. <br /> <br /> Here he brings up four girls with love, flavored with a slight grumbling desire to embrace modern music. Sisters Lane and Gail Page may know Beethoven, but they are also hepatitis cats and can beat daddy eight at a bar every time. And if Raines gets too irritable, then Aunt May Robson can put him in his place. <br /> <br /> The moment you know that the four daughters are not married, this will change. All sisters have romantic interests regarding Dick Vorant, Frank McHugh, Jeffrey Lynn and John Garfield. Of course, the marriage process is a little more complicated, and one of the sisters is going through a tragedy, but promises to work after the film ends. <br /> <br /> Four Daughters is also called John's debut film. Garfield. Besides the tiny role in the Light Light Parade a few years ago, Garfield had no other movie roles. But he was recognized on the New York stage by his performance in Golden Boy, and Warner Brothers signed him and found the perfect debut film role as a cynical musician who just can't get a decent break in life. He received him in the category “Best Supporting Actor” in 1938, but lost to Walter Brennan because of Kentucky. <br /> <br /> This film was so popular that it actually spawned a small cottage industry for Jack Warner. Sequels with such actors as Daughters of the Courageous, Four Mothers, Four Wives, were cleaned up at the box office before World War II. And Warner Brothers remade this with Frank Sinatra and Doris Day, playing the roles that have arisen with John Garfield and Priscilla Lane. Now these two have composed great music. <br /> <br /> In the film “Four daughters”, an eternal form was created, and the film stands 70 years after it was first seen.
