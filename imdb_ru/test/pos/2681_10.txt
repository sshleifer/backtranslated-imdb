If you set Seinfeld aside, this is the best comedy, no doubt! Just great! <br /> <br /> “King of Queens” has just finished the eighth season of home happiness. The show takes place in the working class suburbs of Queens, New York, and accompanies Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), an amiable delivery man, and his wife, legal affairs secretary Carrie Heffernan (Lea Remini), who explore the daily problems of love, life, family and marriage. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie deal with everyday realities that reflect our time and allow us to laugh at ourselves. Their love for each other ultimately permeates them through every dilemma they face, be it Doug's obsession with food or Carrie’s obsession with expensive clothes. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie also have to deal with a third, highly-serviced member of the Heffernan family, Carrie’s twice-widowed father, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in their basement. His constant presence and often strange behavior complement their daily adventures. Doug and Carrie stumbled upon an unorthodox solution to reduce their burden and to please Arthur with his regular excursions with the trustful doggie Holly (Nicole Sullivan). Friends of Doug Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams), Spence Olchin (Patton Oswalt) and cousin Danny Heffernan (Gary Valentine) complement the cast with their youthful humor and diverse looks. <br /> <br /> In the manner that causes Honeymoon, the king of queens finds inspiration in everyday life situations. Just last season, Doug "borrowed" Carrie to a childless deacon for helping him at Thanksgiving dinner; Heffernans suffering from irritation and financial stress from mold damaged their home; and Doug and Carrie, seeking to copy a couple, whose photographs of a more adventurous life than Doug and Carrie, they accidentally took home. We also watched as Arthur began to be jealous of the new dog that Holly had added to her route, and Doug found out that his overly protective parents had replaced his childish dog, Rocky, three times behind his back. Throughout the series, James’s incredible physical comedy, Remini’s keen mind and Stiller’s unique comic presence are on display. <br /> <br /> You can't ... You shouldn't miss it!
