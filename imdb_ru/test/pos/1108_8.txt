OK. Warning for anyone who is a parent or guardian. Be careful with who you see this movie, i.e. DO NOT CHILDREN TO SEE THIS MOVIE. I will explain why. <br /> <br /> 1 - the name is misleading, and the film has nothing to do with the novel - I guess it was completely intentional on behalf of the producers, but annoying 2 - the film itself is really very very disturbing. I have some problems - firstly, the fact that the film is neither violent nor sexy, and therefore not a horror film. But this is a very disturbing film involving a child, his parents and a small town. <br /> <br /> Okay, it all comes down to this. The film is not suitable for minors, because it contains sequences and images that disturb and can confuse the child. He has a strange quality, and ONLY because there is a child in him that makes me feel unfit. As a parent, I feel strong enough to want to tell people, because only recently I read that it will be shown in cinemas. <br /> <br /> I hope I don’t insult the directors by saying this, but I think this is my right, because he gets a release, and only has M. rating (because he’s not violent or sexy). Just weird and anxious, but pretty good in itself.
