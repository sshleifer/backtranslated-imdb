CONTEXT is all that is needed to appreciate a movie. When evaluating this film, you need to take into account the time in which it was made. We didn’t really know WHAT those days were inside the Earth, so you can’t put too much on the film for the plot (based on a much older book). For that era, these were first-class special effects, and the quality of production was superb. I watched this movie in a masterfully restored HD master. So far, makeup and effects almost make the guys in rubber suits look believable, like a monster. This is a clean cottage cheese film with bad rubber suits, models and eerie costumes. COOL. PS Doug McClure ROCKS!
