In the drama of Wilde’s novel, John Osborne summarized events, eliminated a number of characters and, as a rule, implied, and did not demonstrate, Dorian’s significant malice. If you want a clearer visualization, watch the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived at about the same time, but they certainly were completely different people and writers. This story does touch on a topic similar to Stevenson’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but note that Wild decided to view his story as a fantasy, while RLS chose a scientific path. Both protagonists are people in whom good wars against evil, with evil, in the end, win. <br /> <br /> The actors in this BBC film also follow a different path from the 1945 film. John Gilgud says all the same caustic and cynical jokes that George Sanders, in his role, really projects Wilde himself, but with subtle differences. You will suspect that Sanders truly believed what he said, but Gilgud can say what is expected of him, and not what he truly believes. Peter Firth also shows two sides of his character with restraint, but then we will not see as many of his antics as Hurd Hetfield had the opportunity to show. <br /> <br /> This is a very good production, with dramatization, reflecting the foundations of the novel, if not all of its consequences.
