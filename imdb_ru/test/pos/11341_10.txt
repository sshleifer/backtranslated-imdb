Beautiful, emotional and subtle. I watch this film in the art center with a smaller screen in the cinema with 95% of the elderly. I would like a large cinema such as Lowes to show it here. Great cinematography by Wong and Christopher Doyle. Since I understand Cantonese, it is much easier for me to understand the film. No matter how simple the story, many English-speaking viewers did not understand the whole story. Three old women next to me continue to yelp and have no idea about the film. <br /> <br /> Spoiler; They were surprised when I mentioned that Mr. Chow was sleeping with Mrs. Chen, and they have a son. She went to Singapore, trying to tell him, but did not. <br /> <br /> Spoiler <br /> <br /> Translating the name of a movie to Mandarin actually means a blooming moment or a memory. The phrase is commonly used to describe a beautiful and beautiful memory that was inconstant and short. The whole movie is pretty much in line with the title. Not to mention the flower "Cheung Sam". <br /> <br /> My favorite scene was definitely the corner of the street in the alley. It looks so beautiful, the sun shines on the old and faded wall, at night in the dark, in the rain, a truly poetic moment. I felt a strong sense of their closeness, seeing how they were standing against the wall and talking quietly. I felt terrible heartache when Mr. Chow was rehearsing his passing moment, and Mrs. Chen was crying on his shoulder .... Bravo Wong Kar-Wai! <br /> <br /> No matter how much I like this, Changking Express is still my favorite top. However, I will give it 10 as well. For reference, CTHD received only 7. <br /> <br /> If you love art, you will love this movie. Do not miss it.
