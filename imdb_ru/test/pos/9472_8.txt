I watched this movie today (opened yesterday here) and was absolutely delighted. <br /> <br /> I saw a review that said the reviewer thought it would be just another movie for teens, but then I discovered that it was based on Shakespeare's twelfth night ... and then started try to justify the sympathy of this click on Shakespearean grounds. I really think it goes far overboard: the only connections I could see from the Twelfth Night are (a) the main vanity of a girl disguised as a man; (b) extensive male and female humor resulting from this basic vanity; and (c) some names (including Viola & Duke). <br /> <br /> In addition to these names, thematic similarities (a & b) are really excellent themes for any script, and the script of this film is no exception. Besides this, it is really a delightful and very modern / traditional film for teens. And this is a completely legitimate genre, even if high-ranking people need to find a reason to please them ... for example, hinting at Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The film is bright, dynamic, emotional, stylized, fun ... full of hormones of adolescents and humor of boys and men / women, suitable for all ages. And this is really the best part of IMHO: in fact, almost every male stereotype and every female stereotype is depicted in incredibly attractive fun. These stereotypes are parodied mercilessly, but affectionately, with such complexity of invention, that I am still a little confused ... but in fact I donâ€™t feel disappointed in this respect at all, this is not such a film: things come to you quickly and merrily, you get a laugh and a groan, and then move on to the next moment. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is really amazing, like Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum makes a wonderful duke; David Cross copes with the top gold. All actions and characteristics were in order and in order. The cinematography was excellent. <br /> <br /> Great fun from start to finish ... look!
