Some of the reviewers here stupidly rated this silent film by today's standards of political correctness. <br /> <br /> “Battle” was an excellent film for several reasons, correctly marked by more rational reviewers: a great cast, many action films, innovative editing and photography. <br /> <br /> His stars were in reality D.W. Griffith, a joint-stock company, and this fan of silent films is enough incentive to watch it and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I saw it many years ago and just watched YouTube again; it was a very bad print, but in combination with my memory of a good print in a real theater, I can rightly recommend it to sensible people and film historians.
