If you are in alternative realities, thinking about what is real and what is just a fantasy, this is a thriller that will make you think and make you think. Try to get a copy of it and see for yourself! I recently watched him at the Los Angeles Film Festival, and he was by far the best in the band I saw. It helped that it was about something, unlike the others that were tested. It is very well directed, and the cost of production is top notch. I would compare it with "Jacob's Ladder" in that it makes you guess what the true reality of the world we are in is. You should definitely try to track down this film and, if it is shown at any festivals near you, try to check it out.
