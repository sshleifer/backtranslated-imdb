I first saw The Couch Trip (1988) on night television several years ago and immediately fell in love with it. The funny thing is that I usually catch all the comedies made, but I never even heard about it until I saw it. Dan Aroyd is a simple and simple mountain period. He made a couple of great movies from Belushi and do not forget Saturday Night Live. But I think Couch Trip is probably the best and funniest. With a good cast of Charles Grodin, David Clennon and Walter Mattau, this piece of movie shines with comic gold. Akroyd's wife, Donna Dickson, even does an excellent job with her work. My favorite moments of the film are related to the character of Ackroyd and David Clennon, Lawrence Baird. These two played well with each other. So, if you haven't seen a good comedy soon, go on a trip in 1988 and rent or buy The Couch Trip. I just did, amazon 78 cents. What a deal, really bad, I got hit with a 2.50 shipping charge. Oh well, still worth it. Any guy will like this movie, check it out.
