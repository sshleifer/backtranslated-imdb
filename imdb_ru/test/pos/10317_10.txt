Not wanting to repeat what everyone else noticed, I’ll say the following: <br /> <br /> Almost everyone says that they liked Curly most of all ... but I’ll wear a HOMEBRIT on ANY other Stooges short. <br /> <br /> I think this is the most fun from beginning to end, as well as the most re-viewing. <br /> <br /> The secret singer ... Christina McIntyre's cousin "Basil" and, of course, JP Emile Sitka are high points, but only around the perfect time of Stojah and excellent composition! <br /> <br /> Nuff said.
