Viewers of Motorrama are already happy for other unusual films of class b made in the desert, such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which more or less occur in the desert). It also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially the eccentric trail of characters) of the comedy by writer Joseph Mignon, "After an Hour." In a kind of fantasy of traveling in the desert, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, Gus (well-played by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever 10-year-old boy, cashes money in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents, It starts like a journey through salvation (which is evident in the scenes with John Deele), but as soon as he enjoys playing from scratch under the name Motorama, he is easily tainted by temptation and loses his childish innocence. He travels from one crazy, fictional state to another, inventing ways to get Motorama cards from participating gas stations, and this is enough so that he can utter the MOTORAMA prize word and qualify for a cash prize of $ 500 million. <br /> <br /> On the way, he fights with dozens of strange characters, such as Flea, who plays the arrogant guy, Mitloaf, who plays the crazy biker, as well as Mary Voronova and Sandy Baron (a regular from Seinfeld) as two violent kidnappers. <br /> <br /> DVD re-release can be very deceptive, like previous attempts to first sell this film in the uncultured market, using slogans that compare it with Home Alone and Thelma & Louise. The newest calls it a love story with a slogan implying that Michael Jordan's film about Jordan is in an adventure to meet the girl of her dreams ... which, despite the size of her picture on the DVD cover, is really only about 1 second cameo Drew Barrymore in the role the fantasy girl Gus dreams of. Why didn't they just sell it for what it was? At first glance it may seem strange, but in fact it is a well thought out plot. <br /> <br /> Motorama is great stuff for fans of strange b-grade comedies. It was a rather interesting story, especially because of the strength of its main actor - Jordan Michael Christopher (who, unfortunately, had few other notes on the screen) - and the clever metaphor inherent in the plot. I hope his re-release on DVD will ease the search for worshipers.
