I love this film! When I watched this movie on TV, when I was a kid, he scared the hell out of me. Probably because of the dummies I also lack in the game in horror. Chuck Connors is great, like Mr. Slausen. I was glad to see that he was playing such a different roll. Other actors in this film are great too! Tanya Roberts (Becky) and Robin Sherwood (Eileen) are great actresses and I hope to see them in future films, especially Jocelyn Johns! <br /> <br /> So if you like scary movies, but are tired of watching the same thing, watch this movie!
