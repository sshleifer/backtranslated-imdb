The head was supposed to be a proud moment not only for its stars (“Monkeys and Victor Mature”) or for its director / co-author (Bob Rafelson), but also for its other co-author (and short cameo) Jack Nicholson. In their current form, most of them seem to shun it, and for outsiders the film is viewed at best as a curiosity. <br /> <br /> While the series was famously based on the Beatles' tricks, "Help!" “This film is also judged by the same principle. Nevertheless, far from the banal and painfully overvalued films of The Beatles, and even from the outdated TV series TV Monkeys, Head has a depth layer. The hidden nature of a person’s darker nature works here, and although it may sound strange when it comes to a ready-made pop group, the use of certain themes and images (beating of women, laughter from cripples and real Viet Cong shots). an advantage to which many “serious” films dare not strive. <br /> <br /> There are also funny moments, from the James Bond parodies to “Big Victor and my personal favorite, Mickey Dolenc under the pretext of Arab soldiers riding a horse. (One of them turns to Mickey and hisses “pssst!”, Only to “pssst!” Appear in the subtitles!) The group is aware of their made image in the film (“I am a fool, Mickey, I am always a fool” - says Tork, neatly summing up his one-dimensional role in the series), meaning that their characters ?? do they play "themselves" by acting and not acting here ?? more are revealed, and therefore less common and annoying than they were in the series. This level of parody and self-awareness takes even their startling origins, with more subtle techniques of Maharishi and frank confessions with a waitress who asks: “Well, if this is not God's gift from eight year olds ?? are you still paying tribute to ringo starr? Also listen to Tork whistling “Strawberry Fields Forever” while you are in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Of course there are songs. Six of them are here, a little more psychedelic than usual, which might have pushed their fans, and even Frank Zappa's cameo would not have delighted an adult audience with their charms. Probably the best is the charming “As We Go Along”, although the first one, “The Song of the Porpoise,” written by Carol King, interestingly tells about the desire to live while time mercilessly ticks and death approaches. On a lighter note, his guinea pig laughs seem to be a straight mickey double I am the Walrus. <br /> <br /> Constantly inventive, with direct references to silent films and the culture of drugs, perhaps the best feature of Khed is its narrative structure. Not the only one ?? but most importantly ?? The reason why it is improved through several views, the story goes left, right, forward, backward, in a circle and through several levels of reality. In essence, a series of sketches hung loosely, their cohesion is enhanced by a plot that challenges space-time, which integrates internal logic with memories, a sequence of dreams, a mind prison and a remote control channel switch. <br /> With a perfect beginning and end, this intellectually written, knowledgeable film was not what the Monkees preschool audience expected, and subsequently received a negative critical reception. Now these expectations were met, this one is in dire need of a serious reappraisal.
