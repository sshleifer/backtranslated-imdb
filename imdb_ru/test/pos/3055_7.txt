The film is not as half as bad as people want you to believe in it. <br /> <br /> Why do so many people hate this film? Is it because Laurel and Hardy are the last time together and not the best? Or is it because of the lack of regular customers Laurel & Hardy? Or because it's not done by Hal Roach Studios or 20th Century Fox? <br /> <br /> It is quite true that this film is not a successful attempt to revive Laurel and Hardy and bring them to the 50s. It is also definitely true that the film is far from the best, but, to be honest, the film is still well entertained, which makes this film also not the worst. Not the most worthy “farewell” film that you can imagine, but, nevertheless, an interesting and suitable farewell. After completing this film, they both left the cinema. <br /> <br /> There are still great episodes in the film, and there is still strong chemistry between Laurel and Hardy. It also makes this film better than most of their films along with the 40s. It is quite surprising that the humor of farce still works as well as it does now, considering that the days of comedy farce have passed since the 30s. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the story is not as exciting as it could be, and there are too many intimate characters and characters in it, as a result of which the film loses the focus on the boys from time to time. Shame, because they are still the ones who really carry and make the film. <br /> <br /> It’s sad to see how bad La Stan was in the making of this film. He really looked sick and old, which of course he was, too. He was already 60 years old. But after the operation he fully recovered and still lived for another 15 years, and then died in 1965, 8 years after his good friend Oliver Hardy. <br /> <br /> An entertaining, though not perfect, farewell to the boys, Laurel and Hardy, and the end of three decades of funny, humorous and high-quality entertainment films that people all over the world still watch and love. <br /> <br /> 7/10
