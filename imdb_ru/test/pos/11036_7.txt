The feeling of the need for someone to play the role of an Arbitrator of public taste and political correctness always manages to penetrate our skin. These self-cultivating, self-cultivating, pseudo-intellectual types seem to appear everywhere; whether in the family, in the church or in the bowling league. <br /> <br /> These are guys who would completely ignore the society and ignore everything that was before us; unless, of course, whatever it is, this does not contradict today's “acceptable” language, morals, and general “standards” of “correct” behavior. <br /> <br /> SO, that these are the last days of high-tech book burners aimed at much of what was Hollywood’s greatest achievement; namely, their participation in our own Allied Propaganda through their disinterested messages and subject films. <br /> <br /> WELL HARD in its generation, the Forbidden Code and the List of Unacceptable now applies to wartime cartoons that are not encountered with new touchy, socially oriented “official” views; which these "police thoughts" imposed on us. <br /> <br /> We were really surprised to see that there seemed to be a lot of such lively short stories. We know that most of them are from Moonner Melodies by Warner Brothers and MERRIE MELODIES; with the participation of Bugs, Duffy, Elmer and Porky, all in conflict with Hitler, Gerring, "Il Duce", Tojo and the like. Surprisingly, we found a sufficient stock of cartoons from MGM, Walt Disney, Lanza, Paramount-Famous Studios and Brothers Fleischer. <br /> <br /> YOU - SAP MR. JAP (Famous Studios / Paramount Pictures, 1942) is a prime example of what we are talking about. <br /> <br /> Be virtually indistinguishable from cartoons released earlier by Max and Dave Fleischer Studios. the 1941 business coup that ousted them by bringing a new name to Famous Studios, YOU A A SAP MR. In JAP, there was not one of the plot elements that would allow the latest “Popeye” cartoons to be reduced to the level of a short film using the final formula. <br /> <br /> We all remember how we would have Popeye and Olive Oil together. Enter Bluto, as a rule, the indicator of a wolf whistle and the acceptable on-screen version of the male reaction to women's poverty. Olive falls on Bluto less than honorable attention; until he gets too physical and invariably blurts out: “Hey baby, what about a kiss?” At that moment we hear: “Help! Help, Pope and a miniature sailor appear to save the day; replete with the obligatory can of Spinach! Are we exaggerating, Schultz? ONCE, again this cartoon about JAP SAP is not like any of this. ” Of course, this corresponds to the storyline in which the Papay is now in the US Navy. The Fleischer brothers sent a little guy to the service in 1941 to match the mood in the country and as an open gesture of support for the men who are now called to the army. the first project "Peacetime" in the history of the United States. Max and Dave even sent Popey to service on the mythical battleship US Pensilatsky ship. <br /> <br /> Our point of view is just like that. YOU - Mr. SAP JAP and others, for example SPINACH FER Britain - this is not at all a cartoon transport for the comic relief in the program of the Theater. In essence, this is a kind of group of editorial cartoons, similar to those in the Great Capital Gazette. These animated shorts, very similar to another panel of illustrations, have a character that is very symbolic and characteristic of nations, ideas and ideals such as a just and lasting peace. In most cases, the hero (Popeye, Bugs Bunny, or someone else) is left alone with the symbol of the enemy. Both are greatly exaggerated visual metaphors for abstract concept and thought; even if they are disguised in humorous attributes for greater taste. <br /> <br /> OUR liberal stupidity (the antithesis of the intelligentsia) may not look like this; but for such behavior they are nothing more than neo-Nazi scribes. <br /> <br /> PLEASE give future generations the opportunity to look at past events, both historical and humorous, and appreciate them. <br /> <br /> Poodle Schnitz !!
