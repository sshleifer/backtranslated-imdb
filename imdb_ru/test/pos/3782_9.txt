A fantastic film of Chaplin with many memorable moments when Charlie enters the army to fight in the First World War. <br /> <br /> First he goes to training camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and walk in turns. This is a really funny scene, because the tramp is not used to keeping his legs straight! <br /> <br /> The next thing you know, he is in France in the den. Fun scenes here include starving Charlie, who eats mousetrap cheese and reads a letter from home over someone's shoulder. <br /> <br /> When Charlie falls asleep, he discovers that his bunker is completely flooded and his roommate is snoring. This is such a fun part! I can't describe it, just watch the movie. When Charlie wakes up, his legs are numb, so he tries to "wake them up." It made me roll on the floor when it turned out that his second leg still felt numb ... while Charlie was actually rubbing his roommate's leg! <br /> <br /> The film becomes a bit bleak when Charlie shoots a couple of Germans from his trench (though this is done in a very funny way) and his personification as a tree to get closer to the enemy, saving his friend from the death squad. <br /> <br /> The last part - getting him a French girl in trouble, hiding in his house. Then he must save her, and in doing so he also captures the German Kaiser. For this, he pretends to be a German colonel or something like that. I like it when Charlie asks something in German and he is like nein nein nein. The soldier looks at him funny, so Charlie changes his mind: ja ja ja! Kaiser is captured, and Charlie becomes a hero ... but then he wakes up again in the bootcamp, it was just a sweet dream! <br /> <br /> Charlie did one of these “dream sequences” before (Bank comes to mind) but who cares, this film was so funny that it made me laugh all the way. Chaplin also has something to say with this film (since his later work became more likely a social commentary on several misfortunes in the world), and this is best explained in the last sentence of the film: “Peace on earth, good will to all humanity. <br /> <br /> In short, the classic Charlie, very funny, timeless. 9/10.
