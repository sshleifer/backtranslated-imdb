I just watched this movie this morning and found that it perfectly demonstrates the richness of faith. Babette gave them a different perspective on life; not a replacement, but an improvement. She shared everything she had with those who gave her the little that she had. I see the story of God here. He sent his only son to man. Man could not give anything that could compare with this. So, for our little sacrifice, we are given the final treasure, and because of this we are transformed. In this film, the quarreling townspeople are so absorbed in a small interpretation of God. Babette showed them that life and God can really be beautiful in the full sense of the word. The love that God's son has shown man is the love we have to show to one another, and our life will become richer for her. Even a movie is a metaphor. At first it seems slow, but the time spent and attention to detail is rewarded at the end. It was really a holiday.
