An interesting comedy that takes place in a train from Stockholm to Berlin, December 1945. One can not but feel sorry for the poor writer / critic who leaves work and jumps on a train to Berlin. His ambitions are to change the situation and participate in the construction of a new united Europe after the end of the war. <br /> <br /> I like the black and white format of the film, as well as the closed scenery The train is in motion. <br /> <br /> Robert Gustafsson shoots the classic “role of Gustafsson” in this film. If you are his fan, this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> The philosopher Wittgenstein, saying, “We cannot assume that something is what it seems,” is mentioned several times in the film.
