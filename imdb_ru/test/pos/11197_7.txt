Examining one of those well-known physical and / or emotional states: isolation. I think the film also tells about cultural movements. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the experience of two Turkish men (cousins). A person has money (and convenience, which gives what he "did" with a steady income); the other does not have and goes in search of work. Neither is happy. Do not expect any celebration of life here - it is loneliness, warts and all that. <br /> <br /> The film manages to offer a powerful dull journey through the "lowlands" of the human condition. Brave filmmaking. In my opinion, well acting and well shot (my favorite shots outside the harbor). A film that should be grateful to everyone who is no stranger to happiness and pleasure in life (not to mention employment); everyone else will find a companion in this film. The film with all the warmth and speed of the ice. Expect a bitter pill, not a "happy pill."
