S. Epata Merkerson shines as a nanny in this touching and bright look at the life of Ruben Santiago Jr. (Marcus Franklin) when he grew up under the care of a nanny. The film gives a good idea of ​​the character of both Nanny and Ruben, and he manages to capture realistically the ups and downs of life, unlike many memoirs shot in the film. The supporting cast adds a lot of spark, and many recognizable faces appear in small roles, including Mos Def, Macy Gray, Terrence Dashon Howard, Rosie Perez, Louis Gossett Jr., Liv Schreiber, Jimmy Smiths, Ernie Hudson, Delroy Lindo and Patricia Wettig. By the end, it loses steam and vibration, and the final sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling. But in general, an excellent film with a truly outstanding performance of Merkerson.
