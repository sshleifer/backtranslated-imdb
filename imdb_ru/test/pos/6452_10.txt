City streets are amazingly modern in the technical relation to the film, shot in 1931. Also, those who could not be hypnotized, fascinated by the powerful magnetism of Gary Cooper, which attracts the attention of the audience. The plot is quite complex and understandable. Scenarios, decor, are exceptional in every detail. All the actors are above average. I continue to guess how the director and his staff, including editing, sound, lighting, photography, could be so brilliant. I could not find a flaw, realizing that the scenes on the road (a bumpy ride) with a large movie screen in the background were the best that they could get in 1931. In general, I found this movie superb and so alive thanks to Gary Cooper charm.
