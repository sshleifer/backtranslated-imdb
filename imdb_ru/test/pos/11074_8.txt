This is a very realistic movie. This is the most realistic thing I have seen in urban youth. The actors were great. I will search for other Gomez films. I never heard of the movie until someone recently mentioned it. I bought it on DVD. I was impressed. I have not seen anything like life, as I know it in Philadelphia. This is very close - in fact, one scene where the accident occurs (I will not spoil and give details), reminded me of an almost identical situation in Philadelphia. At first I thought that Gomez took the scene from this real event, but then I realized that he had shot the film several years before this situation. I also agree that this film did not try to expand its appeal by inserting Hollywood shit. Gomez also sent the "Laws of Gravity" - I really want to see it.
