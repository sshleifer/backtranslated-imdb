Finding an intriguing background, reading reviews and being an Angel fan, I watched this movie. It is sexy and original, and quite interesting. David Boreanaz is a whale. He is a strong married man, stay at home, dad, and he feels a bit inadequate in his marriage. He makes a mistake by penetrating a close circle of teenage girls who are fascinated by the idea of ​​doing it with an older man. They will do everything to get into his bed, including begging, lying and blackmailing, but mostly they are trying to press his buttons. The daze that follows sends Keith to stagger, and pushes the friendship to the edge. David Boreanaz shows a bit of skin in this - and he looks hot. Yes, he plays a dirty deception - but he shows enough vulnerability and tenderness towards stupid teenagers so that you end up rooting for him. One more thing when someone moans "oh yeah, ooo ... oooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa !!!"
