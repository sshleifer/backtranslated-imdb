I was fortunate enough to be extra in this film when I was about 13 during roller scenes. My high school drama class was invited to participate. It was a fantastic experience. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey, Charles Martin Smith and Don Stroud played live music all day! As a musician, I can appreciate the tireless work and dedication that these guys endowed with their roles. They must have played these songs 20 times. Under these conditions it is very difficult to maintain consistency and energy. This can be seen during the close-up clipping on the topic “It will be a day,” but, fortunately, an unsuspecting public would probably not have picked it up. <br /> <br /> Skating all day, getting a day off from school and being in the past was an incredible thrill. I also had my first "date" on the film. I had to take the girl to the ticket office. Woo hoo! Even with an outdated haircut and hot lights that melted petroleum jelly in my hair, it was still worth it. Funny things. <br /> <br /> The film is top notch and overall very enjoyable. Busey plays her best role in the story, and the cast is great. I'm glad I took part in the great movie of the day. To think that I could be in the Summer Corvette or something like that. Not. <br /> <br /> The funny ironic ending of this is that years later I was at a video store in Malibu and watched a movie in the week when it was released on video. Gary Busey entered and stood right next to me. I showed him the cover and babbled about how wonderful he was and how extra I was and so on. Quite strange, but very cool, whatever it takes.
