The film, first of all, should be a good storytelling. It has to be interesting - and entertainment doesn't necessarily mean “laughs,” and it doesn't necessarily mean “light.” This basically means that you are not bored while watching. <br /> <br /> No matter how brilliant 2001 was, this film is difficult to watch, especially for the current generation (playing video games / messing around with iPod). His slow pace and the sometimes unbearable amount of time it takes for an actor to perform one action (for example, trying to save a crew member floating in space) will extend your patience. On the other hand, the cinema is a brilliant, ingenious film, a final, thought-provoking, and musical score ... the score is cold, especially when the transport crew approaches the artifact on the moon. Boy, I had goosebumps, great time. This does not often happen when I watch movies, and is evidence of the skill of director Kubrick. <br /> <br /> This is considered a classic, and many people consider it the best science fiction film of all time. One is a good reason to watch it if you have not already done so. However, the fact that everyone thinks it is a brilliant film does not mean that you need to force yourself to love it. You either will (like it) or not. Perhaps the slow pace is not so bad after all. Directing your attention to something rather static and slow for 2.5 hours can teach you a lesson. It will certainly be a different experience for all these fast moving images that we are exposed to these days (be it commercials, music videos, or video games). <br /> <br /> I myself think that this is a “memorable” film. But not the one that I would like to see again soon (if I have no particular mood for slow films). <br /> <br /> Consequently, 7 stars out of 10 are from me.
