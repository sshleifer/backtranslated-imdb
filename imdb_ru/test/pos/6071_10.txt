I heard a lot about the “English Patient” and finally decided to take a CD and find out what the whole of this belliho is about. What I discovered was cinematic delight, and I must repeat that “must” always look with an open mind. If you are a religious, moral fan, I am afraid that this is not a film for you, since you will not be able to see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece, because you will continue to solve the moral dilemmas that this film creates. As I remember correctly, before watching this film, I read a review on this site, and I was disgusted by the opinion of the person I quote, who said that “the main characters fully deserved what they got.” When it comes to morality, I agree with him, but this is not the way to comment on a film of such magnificence. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I rarely saw such a wonderful film. I keep hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious. First of all, this is a love story, and yes, it is an extra-marital relationship (be careful with moralists), but let's not focus on this. Instead, let's focus on how the story was told. It is a mixture of memories and the present. This happens in World War II and tells us the story of a plane crash survivor (Earl Almagi, who is beautifully played by Ralph Fiennes), followed by an army nurse (Juliette Binoche) in the war-torn Italy shortly before the start (defeat the axis of forces). A patient with burn scars, very painful, continued to recall the hot connection he had with the English woman Catherine (Kristin Scott Thomas), shown in memories made in pre-war Africa. The past and the present are so skilfully woven into the story that you seem to be transported into the story and get the feeling of the viewer at first hand. Places in the desert and in Italy are beautiful, as are the characters. I am a romantic and I am not ashamed to say that I had tears after it was all over. Watch it with someone you really love. The film begins and ends with the same shot of the desert, where sand dunes meander and bend like a woman’s body, and it is breathtaking. The feeling of loss and grief was transmitted by the actors so much that it makes me wonder why God is! Why do we have wars that destroy beauty and the most inexcusable of all, the destruction of innocence. <br /> <br /> In any case, he deservedly won a bunch of Oscars, and I will go hunting for other works by director Anthony Minghella. It sort of brings back romanticism in the David Lin movie genre. It almost reminds me of 'Lawrence of Arabia, which was also founded in the desert.
