Renee Zellweger is a housewife from Kansas, whose imperious husband is involved in drug trafficking. Two professional killers - Morgan Freeman and his son Chris Rock kill her husband in his dining room. Zellweger, who is not noticed by the killer, testifies to this and undergoes a dissociative reaction, assuming the identity of the nurse — the same-named Betty — the character of her favorite soap opera. Believing herself to be a television character, Zellweger takes off in her husband's car, which has a drug in the trunk, and goes to Los Angeles, where she hopes to connect with another character in this senseless afternoon drama "Dr. David Ravell." Greg Kinnear. Not realizing that she is being pursued by two assassins, she travels to Los Angeles, where she manages to contact Kinnear, and in fact enters the series as a nurse named Betty. A handful of knowledgeable people, including the local sheriff, find out about what's happening and are looking for Zellweger in Los Angeles. The end is believable and sharp. <br /> <br /> If this sounds crazy, it is because it is so. And this is the responsibility of the author, John S. Richards. It is curious that Richards and director Neil Loubut, with considerable help from the performers, are about to cope. This is not a plot that was cast in its usual form. Nope I give him bonus points for clear originality. Someone came out on limbs. Someone ventured to make a film that was NOT a copy or a remake of something that made money ten or fifty years ago. I imagine the people involved falling to their knees every night and praying fervently. I do not know whether the film was profitable, but basically it is aesthetically successful. <br /> <br /> This is what can be called a film of the “original premise.” You start with one transforming event, in this case, the murder of Zellweger's husband and her acceptance of a truly new personality, and realistically follow the following logical paths. Groundhog Day is another better and more elaborate example. "Nurse Betty" has its own logical cracks, where incidents give up their believability. For example, at a party in Los Angeles, Zellweger finally runs into Kinnear, the guy who plays her former fiancé on TV. She is stunned (because, after all, she thinks she is Betty, who has long lost her fiancé). She approaches Kinnear and several of his colleagues and presents herself as "Nurse Betty," a character. She refers to Kinnear on behalf of his television character "David Ravell." At first, the group is puzzled, and then becomes convinced that she is a novice actress who insists on remaining “in character” during the conversation, and also after Kinnear got carried away by her and the rest of the people. Kinnear leads her home, and even when she kisses him good night, she is still in character, leaving Kinnira eyes wide open with surprise from the tireless way in which she captures Betty's character. On the next date, Kinnear returns his love. This development, the relationship between Zellweger and Kinnear at the moment, is a crack in logic, such as is not found in Groundhog Day. By the end of Night One, Kinnear, like any other person, will realize that Zellweger is missing several clowns in a circus. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film, which includes a lot of digressions, exceeds all expectations. The relationship between Morgan Freeman and his insolent, nihilistic son is beautifully described. Morgan is flawless in his annoyance. He manages to fall in love with Zellweger's image when he finds the keys to her whereabouts and actions, and in the end he cannot bring himself to shoot her. She is too cute to shoot. After turning into Betty, she left a note in Kansas. "I want to help all life, whether animal, plant or mineral." Who can harm the author of such an absurd kindred statement? His admiration for her comes as an epiphany when he stands near one of the spotlights on the edge of the Grand Canyon. Zellweger, dressed as Dorothy, or maybe the Good Witch of the East — well, characters who, like Zellweger, either, from Kansas, seem to Freeman, he embraces her and kisses her tenderly. This scene is both creepy, romantic and a bit creepy. One day I stopped at one of these lanterns and threw a few pieces of paper into an ascending stream from a dark canyon, and found myself surrounded by thousands of circling bats that incorrectly perceived fluttering shreds like a moth. <br /> <br /> True. Where was I? Good. I tried not to run out of space. Speech Zellweger deserves praise. Everything she does, every movement, every utterance, is naive and uncertain. She is a really cute character - and this is despite the fact that she is not a glamorous girl by Hollywood standards. But - what an actress. Compare her performance with the noisy 19th century hake in Cold Mountain. Just the opposite. But then everything is in this nice movie. Allison Jennings copes with the role of a secondary role. Look at her when she tells Greg Kinner that she is considering killing his character in a soap opera as a result of drowning. Kinnear is one of those daffodils that wear such thin black leather jackets for ten thousand dollars that were popular at the time. He giggles and says, “Oh, one of these escapes, right? Well, how do I get back? ”Jennings is not responding. She just smiles at him with those huge blue eyes and mockingly tilts her head. <br /> <br /> Not a masterpiece of filmmaking, but a good, original, professional work of all interested parties.
