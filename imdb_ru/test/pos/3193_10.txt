It was a television show that I watched in the 1960s, when I was a child, and I was fascinated by it. Over the past many years, I have often thought about this show and how good it would be to watch it again, but remembering that the things of the past are not always as good as you remember them. It was a great show in the 1960s and lost nothing, even now, in 2007. Of course, there are some strange production mistakes that you see when watching old shows, and it takes several episodes to get used to the duplicated voices, but having done that, I was as fascinated as in the 60s. Samurai plays Koichi Ose, who plays a very modest role. I remember, in the 60s, because of the popularity of the show here in Australia, he toured, playing with swords, etc., and was overwhelmed by the interest in and to the show. It was great that one of my all-time favorite shows still held the magic that it did during my childhood. Must see the series.
