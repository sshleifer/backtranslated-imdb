I just watched this thriller, which used to be considered one of Hitch's lesser efforts. How wrong you can be! Maybe because I'm older, or maybe because the film gets better with every viewing, but now I think it's amazing. Every piece of obscurity is squeezed out of the smallest details, and this final scene on the carousel is simply breathtaking! Ideal in all respects, highly recommended.
