Garlin transcends himself as a writer-director-actor in his indie production of a big guy (Garlin), wandering around Chicago, looking after every woman he sees. Laughter continues almost every minute. This is a rather dramatic and serious story about a man who is looking for love, but written with a great comedic script and acting. The supporting roles are also very well made and very funny and really make the film rich. <br /> <br /> Rose Abdu is hysterical in her admin role, taking you straight into the mood of the rest of the film. Sarah Silverman is great with some of the wonderful things she does with Jeff. Bonnie Hunt is classically gorgeous in his role. I only wish the film had more of her, as I think most would agree with. Of course, it is nice to see her in tight leather outfit. <br /> <br /> David Pasqueci was a detached supporter and voice of reason. Mina Kolb plays Jeff's mother, with whom he lives. There were many other cameos, and they were all made very well. <br /> <br /> At the premiere, Jeff mentioned his inability to do more with Bonnie due to production problems. Nevertheless, it is good that you want more. I think this is an indie thing, to keep some things ambiguous, to allow the audience to think about themselves, to fill in the blanks. Verbose name should tell you about it. <br /> <br /> Jeff said that some of the main characters were based on his past relationships. This explains why they work so well. Real people are always extraordinarily colorful and make great characters. He deviates a bit from what you would expect if you saw “Curbing Your Enthusiasm” and some of his other works. This is one of those unexpected things when an actor risks doing what he may have always wanted to do, but he could not. <br /> <br /> I think it is worth noting that the improvised background experience of Garlin in the Second City and Hunt for this, regardless of whether you set the style of action here, being the center of history and direction. It is, perhaps, a new innovative hybrid of improvisation that meets indie-filmmaking.
