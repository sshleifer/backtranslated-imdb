This film is a pearl! This is the story of Juliet, a completely ordinary cleaning woman who works in the big corporate office of the yogurt company, and Romuald, the president of the same one. He does not notice her, he does not notice anyone, while several conspiracies to wrest his company from him have not suffered at the same time. He is lost, he has no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers Juliet. As a cleaning lady, no one pays any attention to her, so they say and do incriminating things in front of her that she is smart enough to grasp and use her to help her helpless and unhappy boss. > For many years, I followed the DVD of this film, and the previous comment about its release in September 2007 gave me hope. Alas, I can not find the DVD, does anyone know if it is there?
