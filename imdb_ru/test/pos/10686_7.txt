In this film, astronauts sent to investigate a newly discovered planet must solve several dilemmas, and they do so intelligently. The film is uniquely suited to the main theme of the plot and unfolds it gradually, although this can be guessed in advance. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good, although sometimes tough, because some of the acting games of the late 60s can be, It can also be somewhat verbose and even melodramatic, especially after the plot is revealed. Visually, he has a scene that looks like the scene in “2001: A Space Odyssey” of the previous year, and this tends to date the film. Some of the actors starred in the 1970 television series UFO, which is delightfully amiable and worth watching on DVD. <br /> <br /> Despite these small moments, the space flight itself is realistic, and taking into account it was 1969, the scenes inside the cabin of the spacecraft also looked realistic. (See which video technologies of the 1990s and 2000s are also used!) One thing: I suspect that the love scene was cut, but I can't prove it! In any case, it would be a distraction. <br /> <br /> Unlike most science fiction films, this film makes you think about the plot, and it's worth seeing. I am glad that this film is in my video library.
