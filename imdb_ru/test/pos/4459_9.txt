Being an experienced fan of Italian thrillers and directors Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Sergio Martino and Aldo Lado, I thought of Lucio Fulci as an overrated hack. I saw The Beyond, which, in my opinion, is completely overvalued, I found that The New York Ripper is just awful, and I didn’t particularly like The House By the Cemetery. These three films made me conclude that Fulci is the least interesting of these Italian directors. But my stubbornness prevailed, and I had to check out more of his films. "City of the Living Dead" - a film that seemed very interesting to me, but "Do not torture the duckling" - almost a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Located in a small town in an Italian village in a repressive religious community where young boys are killed. The authorities do not know who is behind these crimes, especially after their main suspect was released. A young reporter and a rather dissolute girl (who seduces young guys) investigate and finally get to the bottom line. <br /> <br /> A brilliant atmosphere combined with a good story and a good actor (not always the case). with Italian 70s thrillers) make “Don't torture the duckling” a crisp good thriller. The plot is well built, not so easy to understand, and the final conclusion is very nice. Fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of repression and guilt in a very unforgiving and ignorant community and creates very strong images, especially in a scene where some local people beat a woman to death. Fulci's social commentary on religion and innocence is quite sharp, and every aspect is well handled. When he thinks about his zombie films and his ultra-brutal New York Ripper, it's amazing how well he balances his criticism with sheer violence and makes an even stronger comment. Until now, I have not seen a single film Fulci, shot as professionally as this. <br /> <br /> Although not a traditional film “Giallo”, the duckling has many genre trademarks. Fulci demonstrates full control over the format, only once leaving the board with an unconvincing moment of bloodshed, but in general he seems to do riddles even better than full-blown blood epics. Extreme scenes here are much more powerful and truly impressive. <br /> <br /> So far, in my opinion, the film “Do not torture the duckling” is the best film of Fulci. A sharp social commentary combined with clear scenes of violence and a crisp, kindly mystery.
