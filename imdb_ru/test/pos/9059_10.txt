On a scale of 1-10, “Suicidal lover” received 11 from me and from everyone else at this show. The picture was incredibly funny. I told my wife: "Obviously, this man is walking on water, but through a bed of fire, it is not much." This is one of the best combinations of comedy, satire and insinuations that I have seen since the days of Mel Brooks, Young Frankenstein. I can not believe that this picture was not filmed by a large studio. <br /> <br /> The audience of this “Film Festival” was sophisticated and could catch every comic hint, visual, oral or implied. The characters are real, and the combination of a great script and excellent casting was obvious. Max and Grace are real people with real problems that are solved regardless of the chances of success. It makes you smile, being serious and laughing, with all the indirect humor, brilliantly embedded in this performance. <br /> <br /> To summarize, we can say that this is a photo that you need to see.
