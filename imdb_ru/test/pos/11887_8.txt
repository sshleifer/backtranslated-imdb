This is one of the best modern kung fu movies. Many reviews seem to overlook the fact that comedy is based on quite subtle times (sometimes right on your face) the contrast between old and new China. For example, Kara Hui is called a village swindler and gets into trouble whenever she tries to adapt to the new, but in the end, to save her families, they consider the dresses to be an old-fashioned heroine unlike the modern military style of Xiao Ho. Gordon Liu seems to have played his part with laughter, playing up to his serious monk persona with silly wigs and a guitar. The final battle is fantastic and ends in Johnny Wan’s defeat, not death. Kwan Yung Moon should be mentioned for his great gangster game with “invincible armor” - just amazing. And Kara Hui is great playing and fighting. A great movie.
