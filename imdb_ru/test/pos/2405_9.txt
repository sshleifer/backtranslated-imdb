Well, it took them 4 attempts, but they finally got it right! In this 4th continuation of the Karate Kid franchise, the producers have really achieved success! Well, first of all, I applaud them for finally getting rid of Ralph Macchio. I felt that he never served the role of the Karate Kid. I would prefer to see Danny "Ralph Roth" Bridge in this role. Macchio turned out to be the best movie in the series, and see where his career is now! Instead, they put in a girl! They have Hillary Swank, known for the fact that she played different roles of Sheman in each film in which she starred. I personally do not care for her teeth, but this is a personal preference. But still, see how Karate Kid 4 launched its career into orbit! She won the damn Oscar. Jiminey Christmas! Meanwhile, where is Ralfi? He has to put out some amateur porn tapes, like Yelp or something. <br /> <br /> In any case, my only disagreement with the film is that they have a girlfriend doing a carat. As a self-proclaimed master of karate, I have been the proud owner of a white belt for the past 8 5/8 years. The first thing I was taught was that in martial arts there is no place for girls ... well, except for judo ... but it's kind of gay. So for the sake of accuracy, I think they had to stick to another man for that role. I thought maybe Dennis Franz. He would give the role the necessary depth. <br /> <br /> They will probably listen to my suggestions and make corrections in Karate Kid-5. He, too, Pat Marita is no more. I thought Justin Guarini was the perfect replacement for the attractive Asian guy Miyagi. He will give "wax wax" a completely new meaning. Ha ha ha ha ha Funny, huh? In any case, if you are looking for an exciting movie filled with karate and the triumph of the human spirit, Karate Kid 4 is for you. Do not waste your time at 1-3. This is karate baby for you! This is a karate kid for centuries!
