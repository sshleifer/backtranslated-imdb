I made this film with very low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. This film is very good material. And no one would have ever thought that this was a low-budget project. <br /> <br /> Eighteen years old, the director of Richard Bell has been engaged in 18-year-old Pip, who is played by the excellent Paul Anthony, who leaves his home due to the death of his elder brother. He is defeated by this event and falls into the hard life of an impetuous teenager on drugs and alcohol. At 18, his father tracks Pip and gives him a tape left by his grandfather, which he was supposed to listen to on his 18th birthday. <br /> <br /> How is the whole movie told? with two simultaneous stories unfolding simultaneously. Pip's present life and the past life of his grandfather during WW11, which Pip listens to on tape. <br /> <br /> Three outstanding performances in this film - “Paul Anthony” in the role of Pip and “Brenden Fletcher plays Jason, a young 18-year-old soldier of WW11, his grandfather. Also the role of the wounded medic WW11 "Macauli" performed by Mark Hildret. All put on good performances. <br /> <br /> A couple of problems and scenes that I didn’t really like ... the priest, Father Chris, played by Alan Cumming, cheerful and pick up a local street in broad daylight, which the entire district knows about. And then we have a local vendor named Jeff, the sweetheart played by the attractive David Beasley, who just wants to be loved, and for some unknown reason, he is attracted to a very unattractive and nasty baseball player, the clerk who sleeps with any and, in all likelihood, this is a walking poison time bomb. In addition, he is not a very nice person. This piece did not ring true. <br /> <br /> Most of all I liked the memories of the war. They were so well acted and very moving. In the end, there is a scene where one soldier dies and the other Jason to calm him down and show him love when he is badly wounded and dying. This is such a wonderful and touching scene, she left me in tears. Beautifully played. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. It is love, redemption and the power of the human spirit to survive.
