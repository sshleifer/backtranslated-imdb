I watched this movie over and over and over - every time it makes me laugh, it makes me think, and it makes me cry. Robin Toney does an incredible job of portraying Marcie (and I'm kind of glad that Kate Winslet and that other lady abandoned her role) - this is just one of those shots that, as you know, no one could even compare. > <br /> This is a beautiful love story of these two very different people in lousy situations that come together. They stand next to each other, in spite of everything, even if it is in a strange situation and crazy relationship. <br /> <br /> Now Iâ€™ll tell you that this is not for everyone - of all the people I showed, I would say that the results are 50/50, but if you like it, you will like it and you will want share it with others! 10 stars completely!
