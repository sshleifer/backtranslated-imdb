Gorgeous horror comedy from Michael Davis. I laughed so hard that I almost pee! Eric Jungman's magnificent performance as a good guy who saves the day, and Jack Black-Esquire's magnificent performance, like Justin Urich's performance. He was simply divine in this film. This guy deserves to be a big star. In addition, Amy Brooks was good at the film, as was the girl in danger along with the guys from the killer, reminiscent of Jeepers Creepers. The blood was given in copious amounts, and I liked it. I just hope they release a non-priced version. Great low budget horror comedy. Dead cat on the sex scene in the hotel is just awfully funny! ***** outside *****
