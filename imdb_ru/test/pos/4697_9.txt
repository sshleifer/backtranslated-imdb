Fantastic series, one of my favorite few (Miami Vice and Tour of Duty - the other two, and this series is right with them). <br /> <br /> These guys do not like to wear tight tights - they dress more like loggers. Everything in this series breathes a stream of realism, artistic license or not. <br /> <br /> He paints a picture of Europe, only a little hidden from paganism, since most of the villagers still have their local deities, and there is Satan, who worships nuns, and magicians, witches and sorcerers who cast spells. <br /> <br /> However, the most important thing is that this is a series of time. Instead of the fifties version, which was weeping against the centralized government and the persecution of the McCarthy era, this series is based on the grim THATER tradition of the 1980s and has a strong tendency to protect the environment. The protector of Robin is a nature fan named Hearn Hunter, who often appears in the deer's head and is a personification (like this Robin) of the Green Man, an alternative version of Osiris (the Egyptian god of vegetation and resurrection). It is interesting to note that in these TV series “Robin in the Hood” is not a person, but a concept: when the old are killed, Hearn telepathically calls the new - the person may die, but Robin will live in the hood forever, hence the concept of resurrection). <br /> <br /> The music and score are truly outstanding and are performed by Clannad Irish education. Watching this, I could not help but think about how boring authentic medieval Anglo-Saxon folk music would be. :-) <br /> <br /> All this is perfectly filmed in the magnificent forts of Wales, which merge into the "New Forrest." <br /> <br /> The only drawback is that in the initial episodes of both In the series, the actors have to overcome their own skepticism and convince themselves that this is really serious work. After that they get into it, and the game is great! Michael Pride as the first Robin (the second is played by the son of Sean Connery, Jason), Judy Trott makes the beautiful and fragile red-haired Marion, Phil Rose as the lush and truly kind-hearted monk Taka, Ray Winston as a changeable and passionate Scarlet, Clive Mantle in the role of giant shepard Little John, Peter Llewellyn Williams as a strong friend and companion Shepard in Little John, and Mark Ryan as ex-Hashishin / Assassin Nazir - they all give excellent performances. Also great are the regular Bad Boys, Nicholas Grace as a creepy eye, the cunning Sheriff of Nottingham, and his aristocratic, clumsy assistant (and, as it turns out, Robert's stepbrother) Robert Addy as Sir Guy from Gisborne. The really cool designer Richard O'Brien, like the evil lord Owen of Clun (Oliver Cotton), is the magician Gulnar (he appears closer to the end of the first series, and then to the second). <br /> <br /> The Tithe Barn in Bradford on Avon replaced Sheriff's Castle. (Check it out at bradfordonavon.co.uk in the "interesting places" section.) <br /> <br /> So, if you are fond of mythology, medievalism, romanticism at all, don't waste your time on Xena or Hercules - this is the real thing so go out and watch! <br /> <br /> Alex
