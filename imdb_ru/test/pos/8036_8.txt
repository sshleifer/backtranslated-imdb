I will not comment on the story as such. I agree with the comments of most people that this is a good multi-faceted action movie with a well-told story and good acting. <br /> <br /> This film deserves 100% cinematography for its initial sequence. The first shot is terrific, and I have not yet figured out how they did it. The film is worth watching just for this shot! It is a pity, therefore, that the DVD that is currently being released is just a film, and no information is given regarding the making of the film. Let's hope that someone will come up with a special edition. <br /> <br /> And even better is that the initial sequence also becomes final, leaving you to guess! Quality goods. A must have for the collector of classic movie moments.
