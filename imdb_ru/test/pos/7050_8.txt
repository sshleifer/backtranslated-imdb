Fortunately for Bill Murray, this is such an easy project, because he pretty much has to carry it. The meatballs are the story of the cheap Northstar Camp and how its consultants work with someone as well as with each other. In addition, many of their wealthy rivals from all over the lake called Camp Iroquois reach their climax in a two-day competition. Besides all this, Bill Murray fools around and makes his debut in a rather memorable film. <br /> <br /> In the film, the average sizes of laughter, laughter and many dissatisfied along the way are laughing. The biggest laugh is jokes played by the director of the camp for nerds. Three of them involve consultants who move his bed to different places while he sleeps. Morty, or “Miki,” as everyone calls him, wakes up along the side of the road, stretches on trees a few feet above the ground, and finally floats on a raft in the middle of the lake! There are also some funny moments when advisors beat each other, but this is a movie with a PG rating that has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> In the film, a serious note with the participation of a shy tourist named Rudi, who plays Chris Makepeace. Of course, Murray should teach the child to open up and give him confidence that he should run a marathon during the Olympiad. Rudy's sentimentality seems to be largely resolved. Notice that when Murray first sees a child sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus, he tells him: "You must be the depressed guy we ordered." Makes you wonder if this line was really in the script, or if Murray was just inserting an ad while the cameras were rolling. In other words, Murray might just as well say to Macpeus: “You must be the actor we hired to play the stereotypical single child that you see in most summer camp movies that isn’t suitable.” But before all this ends, Murray's performance makes this device more than tolerable. Looks like he really knows Makepeace. <br /> <br /> The film ends with games between two rival camps. There are very few events that are shown to us, even a little believable, but “it simply does not matter. This is a pretty good movie on many levels. Do not let the absurd assessment of 5.6 of this film currently scare you. Murray will keep you laughing all over. Just be careful ..... avoid continuations !!!! Especially the one with Corey Feldman! 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Dog.
