I really love action movies and adventure films, and this is one of the best. Of course, we like the stars of this genre, Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone, Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell, Arnold Schwarzenegger and others, but this is a story that really matters. The best is somewhat doable, but we can tolerate those that are a bit "excessive", as in the style of action comics. The more turns, the harder the situations in which the characters are involved, and the more shocking moments in the film; the more we are fans of action / adventure, the more they like them. "In the firing line" is ALL the elements necessary for an exciting action movie. He has Clint Eastwood as a secret service agent who almost retires, and one unpleasant moment of failure haunts him. He has one of the most evil, vile, manic villains in the face of John Malkovich, a type in which you canâ€™t wait to see him, "get him his due." This is Rene Russo as "love interest". It has twists and turns, random shock and even a touch of warmth and humor. Director Wolfgang Petersen plays at a very good pace and even has an excellent score by Ennio Morricone. This is a real ride on a roller coaster thriller! Do not miss!
