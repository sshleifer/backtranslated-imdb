Coming from Oz, I probably would not have to say this, but I find that in many local films this cohesive stream is missing with a weak storyline. This comedy lacks nothing. Great story, no replay, no melodrama, just a brilliant comedy, as we know, Oz can do it. Do yourself a favor and laugh until you fall.
