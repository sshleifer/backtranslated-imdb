The story of a dirty, thick, dirt-like middle-aged woman who lives outside society should be known as the dirtiest woman who ever lived. Can anyone take her crown? There is one pair ..... A wonderful film for people who dislike ordinary comedies and do not pay attention to some kind of anxious sense of humor. I was very surprised to see some scenes, and I loved their sharp look. <Br /> <br />
