You know, sometimes you just have to have it? That's how this movie is with me. I am almost ashamed to admit that I like it, in some places it is so stupid, but I feel that I strive for this when I fall down and just want to laugh ... and believe me, I'm just not a "stupid movie" like a guy. <br /> <br /> You can read a quick review, so I wonâ€™t bore you with this, just be sure, if you like Kelsey Grammer, you will probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> Another thing, MUST keep an eye on the end of the credits. You do not need to read them, just watch them and catch the "In the Navy" presentation by People People ... and friends.
