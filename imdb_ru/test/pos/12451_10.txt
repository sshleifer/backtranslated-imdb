The way his charter developed as a man and a monkey was outstanding. Not to mention the scenery of the film. Christopher Lambert was the awesome Lord of Greystoke. Christopher is the soul of this masterpiece. I was so carried away by his playing that I felt my heart beating. The integrity of the film still worries me to this day. His image of John was Oscar-worthy; how he was supposed to be nominated for that.
