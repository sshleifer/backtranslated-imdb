After the first time I saw this, I thought: “Wow, this is the most exciting movie, visually speaking, which I have ever seen.” Since then, I have seen someone who led him, but he is still considered one of the best in this department. I just hate that the long-awaited DVD was so poorly made, the quality of this program is hardly better than that of a VHS tape. <br /> <br /> Jungle scenes are shot in Cameroon, and "lush" is the best adjective to describe what you see. Except for the jungle sounds, “vision” is, of course, almost everything at the beginning, since there is almost no “hearing”, no dialogue, until Tarzan (Christopher Lambert) makes friends with Jan Holm and vice versa ... so be prepared for this You have not watched this movie. <br /> <br /> In the story, all I’ll say is that this is not Tarzan, which many of us have learned in Johnny Weissmuller’s films ... but this is not a complaint. For these cravings, and I don’t care about cinema, like me, you just need to go through this period of silent acquaintance. <br /> <br /> In this version of Tarzan, our hero returns to Scotland (his roots), Adapts to this environment (for the most part ... and, frankly, too quickly for trust) and then returns to the jungle without Jane. Presumably, this is more true of Tarzan’s books written by Edgar Rice Burrows. <br /> <br /> Rick Baker, one of the best in the business, made special effects here. Sharp DVD or not, this is still a great movie to watch and very interesting for 2 hours and 15 minutes.
