This film would have worked much better if it was the first Nibbler movie, it’s a low-budget film that only showed two (2) Nibbles on the screen. Why it looks like a failure, because this is the last Critters film, and it is so low-budget that the director seems to have made the whole film with his pocket money. However, I liked this film, I compare it mainly with the third film (which was bad). Critters 4 has a more serious tone: in the first half of the film (even if you haven’t yet seen one Critter) you have a terrible feeling when you watch it, it’s too bad that they don’t milk Critters, I mean, even they were only two (2) puppets, they could use them on the screen much more often. In this movie, Nibblers also have different deaths, which made it a bit special, especially at the end with Frozen Nibbler. Ug is moving in this part and is different in this film, which took me by surprise. Finally, I liked this one, because it also has some sort of conclusion to the series, so at least we will not see Critters 5 anymore. Oh, the last one, I missed one scene in this film, we never saw Critter shot a spike from his back, perhaps these puppets did not have this function, but I was very disappointed without seeing it (in Critter 3 we see a lot of spikes, which was the only good thing I liked in this film).
