*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** It is easy to understand why the script of this film won an Oscar. At least during the first half. My head was spinning from all the fast-moving lines rushing past. Noel Kaward plays the New York publisher (“Why don't you publish books that you like?” - “What? And corrupt the public?”), Which fascinate and manipulate him with numerous helpers. Then he dies in a plane crash, and the story turns into a bizarre take-off of the Flying Dutchman, in which Trus must find the man who really mourns him before his soul calms down in peace. Very nice, until it becomes strange. Reviewed at Cinefest in Syracuse in March 2003.
