Watching “Mortal bed: a bed that eats” is like waking up in a hospital, suicidal for two days, looking disorienting, but strangely stimulating. There are several cinematic equivalents of this disturbing, but often ridiculous lesson of mythology, morality, and surrealistic ideology. <br /> <br /> Cocteau’s “Poet’s Blood” and Maya Derain’s experimental work <br /> <br /> evoke the taste of a strange atmosphere found in DEATH. A close comparison is the dark adult tales of literary genius-author Angela Carter, the short disturbing stories of Unica <br /> <br /> Zurn or E.T.A. Hoffman. <br /> <br /> DEATH BED has many recognizable elements of the past <br /> <br />, but it also displays a completely unique and original storyline. <br /> <br /> Like a story, DEATH BED is surprisingly simple, but at the same time an original <br /> <br /> vision that can only be realized by one of thousands of independent releases. This modest film has its own technical flaws, but overcomes them all with the help of excellent actors, actors and <br /> <br /> and lost creepy locations - a true independent classic of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> DEATH BED also displays a unique, subversive, three-dimensional personality - a deep and uninterrupted overlay of images and ideas of dreams that give it the shape of a “fun house”. Memories and historical time travel told about time, a bed with an ominous black humor, rich, but underestimated symbolism used in its images. The most pleasant is the image of Aubrey Beardsley, a suffering artist, locked up forever in the frame of his own picture, when he comments and caresses the "offerings" of the murdered victim, presented to him as love offerings in the spirit of an insane bed. - A sick refrain and a wonderful element / metaphor for a “trapped artist” - Nothing but the strangest thing in POE or MALLARME can compare with this. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates the spirit of independent cinema and craves multilayered symbolic experience, or craves the surrealistic concept of "convulsive <br /> <br /> beauty" and gothic horrors, low-budget cinema exploration will dig out this completely unique vision. A simple and funny movie with delightfully deep extrasensory currents. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. *****
