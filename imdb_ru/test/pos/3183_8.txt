Having seen the uncut version, I thought that this film was beautifully made. It caught my attention from start to finish; the tension was wonderfully transmitted. Nasaan Ka Man portrays a typical Filipino family with precision in exposing secrets and lies. Even religious culture, the desire of a person to maintain appearance and maintain a clean reputation is manifested with bright vividness in the character of Gloria Diaz. There is no small scene in this film that has no purpose - the cinema is excellent and the script is great. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is great, I personally discovered that the turn at the end, the revelation connected with the character of Jericho, was not as shocking as it should. But then, maybe it's just me, because otherwise, Nasaan Ka Man is a very clever movie. <br /> <br /> Casting was good for a start, but Dieser and Claudineâ€™s actions were icing. Do not miss if you are looking for a Filipino film that will surprise and exceed expectations. Thumbs up to the director.
