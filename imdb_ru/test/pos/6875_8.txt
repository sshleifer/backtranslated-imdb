Matthau is a widowed hospital doctor enjoying his only status, free circulation and accessible nurses in the state, while colleague and friend Richard Benjamin watch with surprise and amazement. Their boss hardly hears from the senior chief of staff Art Karni, who is going to be re-elected to this post. <br /> <br /> Mattau is happy with the game on the field without commitment until she meets a single mother, Glenda Jackson, who insists on being the only woman in his life while she is in his life. At the same time, he is under pressure to respond to the love actions of a potential plaintiff in a suit of abuse of office and support Shambolic and incompetent Karni in his attempt to be re-elected head of staff. <br /> /> This is an excellent old-fashioned romantic comedy, adorned with four Class A actors, and a great cast, working on a first-class dry, caustic and sarcastic script. Carney steals every scene he is in and, in IMDb, makes us roll on the floor, laughing loudly when he appears on the screen. For the rest, we are entertained by the relationship between the two heroes and the minor plots. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of ambition to become a great movie, but it remains one of the best of its kind, watchable and re-watched only for its comedic value. Deserves more attention than it seems, and it is well worth the cost of a DVD or video tape.
