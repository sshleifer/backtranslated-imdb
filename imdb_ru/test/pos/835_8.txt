The original female Scorpion Convict is the masterpiece of all time. The first sequel, Jailhouse 41, was, in my opinion, not quite good, although it is remarkable that he took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style. Director Shun Ito managed to do the same again with this film; Here is a slightly different story, but still he managed to take what made the previous recordings excellent and better than many films of this type, and create something rather original. Again the action is focused on Nami Matsushima (a.k.a. "Scorpion"), and this time she is out of jail and not too interested in the idea of ​​return. Running away from the pursuit of the police, one leads to the other, and Scorpio discovers that he gets it along with the prostitute and her backward brother. As a result, the prostitute receives the fertilization of her retarded brother (...), while Scorpion is kidnapped and caged by someone from whom she made an enemy in prison. But Scorpio does not like to spend time behind bars, and soon she again begins to do what she does best. <br /> <br /> The film begins well when we see Scorpio tearing a hand off of copper. intends to return her to prison. From there, however, the film slows down dramatically, and Beast Stable becomes more dramatic than the previous two films. This does not mean that there is still little action here - Scorpio still spends a lot of time in the "revenge mode", and the film is not entirely short in general terms. Meiko Kaji again repeats his role as an ominous protagonist, and this is another understated, almost wordless performance. However, her presence on the screen is superb, and she manages to be threatening, despite the fact that she is physically small. The plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all turns into a crescendo of revenge. In this film, there are more people who have angered Scorpio than in the previous two, so this section takes up quite a large part of the film. There are several surreal episodes, not as much as in the first film, and far from the second, but the film remains the focus of the rest of the series. In general, I would say that this film is between the first two in quality - not as good as the original, and slightly better than the second.
