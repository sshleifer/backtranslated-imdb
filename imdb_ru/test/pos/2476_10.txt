I watched pp last night. I have to say that I was very impressed with how realistic the film seemed. It was very much like a documentary. I also believe that the film presents realistic possibilities. In the film, the Vietnam War sharpens to such an extent that China intervenes in it. What if this happened? I think the scenarios will be similar to the one depicted in the film. We had camps before in this country ... and still have ... <br /> <br /> Recommended to all ... especially the radicals ... <br /> <br /> I kept saying that if I was in the position that these children were in that I was just lying with my ass. I love America and its great wars (winked)
