Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave Theater in Plainfield, Indiana, I did not expect much. I went to this movie just because I thought, hey, this is a WWE movie, and it will be good for a laugh. Then I sat down, looked, and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the strangest guys on the big screen (in my opinion, much worse than Freddie or Jason), and he has one big advantage over other films that attracts me to a horror movie. This shows Jacob Goodnight as a person. He has a heart, no matter how perverted and creepy it is. He feels pain, something that Jason never does or doesnâ€™t seem to show. He feels sadness and pleasure, although they are both insane that you will notice when you see the movie. In general, experience, in my opinion, differs from many slashers, and this somewhat surprised me, for example, who lived at the end.
