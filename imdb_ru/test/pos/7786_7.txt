RKS after the success of GHAYAL began work on this film, which was a comedy. The film was created over 3 years and, finally, came out in 1994, but for some reason did not work. Before this film, DAMINI (93) was released and succeeded. /> <br /> The film is a crazy comic film, like most Priyadarshan films these days, but it's funny and well crafted. Unlike today's films, the film has the right plot and makes you laugh, most of the characters become famous, be it the Criminal Master of Gogo (Shakti) Kapoor, Paresh Rawal and others <br /> <br /> The film makes you laugh in during the whole time of his performance, although he is too rude and overdone, but this is one of the funniest films. <br /> <br /> Directing RKS very good music is good <br /> <br /> Amir is at war among the actors and shows his most ridiculous performance, this was his first comedy that Salman plays well but looks like an amateur in front of Aamir, but copes well with her chemistry; delightful. Karisma annoys and sounds like a child. Ravina is adequate. Paresh Raval. Shehzad Khan (nicknamed Ajit) is very good, and Viju Hot is also funny, the rest are good too
