I first played it around 98 or 99 minutes when I was with my friends. I thought the game was really great and I liked it. <br /> <br /> The game is simple. In single player mode, you go in a circle. like James Bond and complete missions in different places, such as arctic wasteland or city. My favorite was the one with the tank. In the two-player mode, you and a friend choose any character you wish and fully fight. In the area in which you are located, you will find ammunition and weapons for assistance. From handguns to rifles and lasers, and even your fists work. <br /> <br /> Again, in second player mode, there are plenty of places to go, and some to unlock. I find this game really funny, but also very tense. Because you never know where your opponent is, and it's amazing to see them outside the door, where you go. <br /> <br /> This game gets **** (1/2) stars or ***** Very good!
