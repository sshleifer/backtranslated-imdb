I think the costumes were excellent and the hairdressers also performed well. He has a very authentic feeling of the time. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know if it was computer magic or if it was real. Some of the big scenes have hundreds of extras in the background. I was particularly impressed with the scene of this bridge. <br /> <br /> The main character, which the actress also showed well, showed us a nervous, witty woman who knows how to use herself to seduce men to get what she wants. <br /> <br /> Some scenes were hilarious. Although it was about 2 hours, but it was never boring. very good entertainment movie.
