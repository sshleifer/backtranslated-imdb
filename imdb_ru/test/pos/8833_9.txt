I participated in the filming of "Space Odyssey", playing FIDO in flight management. I just want to say that none of us, the actors, especially those involved in flight control, who had to react to the green screen most of the time, had no idea how amazing it would be. I knew it would be good if only the clear camaraderie and professionalism that the production team at Impossible Pictures provided to all participants. but when we all saw it for the first time at the Curzon Mayfair show, I was very proud. I was so glad that none of us looked as if we were in Star Trek. Joe Ahern, screenwriter and director, the most amazing person for work. He pretty much puts together a good team, and then just unconditionally trusts them freely to do what they do best. I was really lucky that I was part of this show. Who knew something so epic and difficult to understand would be so tempting to watch. and my god, this is a beautiful universe there.
