I loved this movie. You cannot buy it, rent it, or find it ... but it is a keeper. <br /> <br /> Wonderful chemistry between Bracho and Walken ... and Ferrar .... Stunning non-stop actions and reactions .... I liked it. <br /> <br /> I saw my pirated copy, perhaps 6 times in the last decade ... every time showing it to someone who had never heard of it. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and watch it. <br /> <br /> So many films are shown again and again on TV - without any wit or style of this little movie. <br /> <br /> I did not know that it was created for television. ... my copy is 8 tracks, which I pirated many years ago ... I hope it lasts.
