This is definitely one of the best documentaries I have seen, looking at family relationships and marriage. I recently saw the “capture of the Freedman,” and I must admit that it seemed to me that this was better. <br /> <br /> The story is not incredibly shocking, but it is an excellent study of stuck personalities and a cold attitude war. The block deftly leads the viewer through diaries, family shots and factual interviews; his interview style is sensitive and insightful, and his understanding is clear and measured. <br /> <br /> 51 Burch Street is an excellent exploration of personalities and relationships over 40-50 years of social change, social impact, and potential for redemption.
