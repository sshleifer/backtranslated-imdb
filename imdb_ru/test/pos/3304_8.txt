Funny bad movie that should be entertained. One of the last speeches of Joan Crawford as a leading successful editor against all those young beautiful passionate beavers who have just come out of the elite Seven Sister Colleges The magnificent atmosphere of the 50s in New York. Beautiful periodical costumes and hairstyles. Awesome artistic direction. Banal story, but a steep tear. An interesting cameo by Robert Evans as a rich cad.
