I really liked this movie. Gorgeous, realistic-looking fighting shots, on the one hand, and a touching, authentic story. The calm, reserved manner of the protagonist, Franth, makes him very likable. The human relationships in this story seemed very typical and possible from what might have been expected in wartime. The connection between Franta and Karel shows that wartime comrades can be true to each other, and this is often described in books and interviews with veterans. The subtitles do not detract from the history and in fact serve to emphasize the problems that Czech pilots had in the RAF. The post-war storyline is a great reminder that for many the suffering of the Second World War did not end in 1945, especially in the countries occupied by Russia. Cinematography was also very good. I wish I could see it on the big screen.
