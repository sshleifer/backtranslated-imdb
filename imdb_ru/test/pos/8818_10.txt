In general, Big Bad John was a fun and touching movie. If you want romance, tragedy and humor, this film is there. If you're a fan of a song (like me), you pretty much know how it ends. But if you donâ€™t, or if you want and want to watch it, I highly recommend this film. Jack Elam and Jimmy Dean - a cheerful couple with great chemistry. However, I would not recommend this film to strict city people. You have to understand where these people are coming from, and only a few of us are left. But even a few city dwellers can understand this and appreciate what it is: a good home movie that makes you laugh, cry and be inspired.
