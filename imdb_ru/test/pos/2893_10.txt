"Rush in Rio" is without a doubt one of the most exciting DVDs I have bought. Although I am a biased fan of Rush for almost 20 years, I found this performance impeccable. The music is heavy and sharp (sounds great in any surround sound system), the band is energetic, the crowd is constantly smiling ... as if they were able to capture every concert I attended. For any Rush fan, this DVD is a must; in any case, just to watch the documentary “Boys in Brazil” (which tells about the travels of this rather isolated, personal group). For any lover not Rush this DVD is a pleasant concert. Rush fans know the talent of these three Canadians. We quite firmly supported them for years. I showed this DVD (or parts of it, anyway) to those who have never heard of Rush, or those who think that Rush is less than good, because they don’t appeal to pessimistic masses of rock (i.e. sex, drugs and drunk madness). The bottom line is that this DVD is worth every penny and more than worth the time to watch it.
