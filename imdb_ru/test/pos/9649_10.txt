This is really a very long movie. But it is quite beautiful and a good example to show why cinema can be considered art. An easily told story cannot be expected in Les Amants Réguliers, but each scene, each silence here tells a lot more than a hundred dialogues. A touch, excellent, perfect in his paintings and sound track, showing why the intimacy that cinema brought as one of its main functions, was the greatest innovation in any dramatic presentation. Someone who is used to such films, where everything is said, and the action happens all the time, will find it tedious. But it’s worth a look to learn other possibilities to experience history.
