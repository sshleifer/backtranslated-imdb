"The Case" by John Carpenter is the best horror film ever filmed. Not only that, but also one of my favorite films of all time. What makes a movie so great? It is difficult to put a finger on it. It seems that in The Thing everything works, this is one of the rare cases when everything seems to be in its proper place. The film even surpasses the Alien in creating a capricious atmospheric hell. The fact that it is not only about blood (which is fine, by the way), but it can create paranoia that has no analogues in the films. A truly wonderful film that all horror-worshipers worship, and anyone who has good taste in films.
