This film is an almost forgotten pearl of 1979, although, in fact, it is a comedy based on one of the largest bank robberies in the UK. In fact, one of the names for which this film is known includes “marque”, therefore it is in itself an indicator of the type of film. Lots of attractive blush that are not cruel or psychotic types, who with delicate tricks remove the biggest work in their lives. Honestly, I don’t know too much about the real crime and cannot comment on whether it depicted the events that unfolded, or the characters involved in it. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan does a very good job playing the role of PINKY Green. and it is very plausible, like a frivolous juvenile swindler of American origin who seems to be very pleased with himself. I have to add that sometimes American actors fight well with British actors in a British film, chemistry is not always there, but this is not a problem for Jordon, who fits well with his role. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that Jordan himself was probably one of the most underrated actors of the 70s and 80s and never received the recognition he deserved. It seemed he was stuck in supporting roles and in the films "B", and not in an honest presentation of his acting skills. He played a corrupt cop in the movie "Friends of Eddie Coyle", sadistic killers in the MEDIUM SEASON. In The Secret of My Success, he played a kind of comedian character Gordon Geko, and also in the 1980s EQUALIZER TV show he played a good guy. All this demonstrates the versatility of his acting skills, mixing with players such as David Niven, Kurt Russell, Edward Woodward and Robert Mitcham. <br /> <br /> In this film, he effortlessly plays his part as a little deceiver with a look behind the ladies, and you immediately accept his character and support him from the very beginning. You can not dislike Green, ?? ?? You see that he really wanted to go straight, but once he blackmailed it seemed like too much opportunity to refuse, and in the end he enjoyed the thought of all this money. <br /> <br /> David Niven is the boss and Oddly enough, the police inspector brilliantly played Richard Johnson, who usually portrayed a clever but thorough London detective who clearly loves his work. The other cast doesn't speak too much, but, looking at them, they were all very famous British actors, who often played either villains or tinkers (ironically). Elki Sommers, Oliver Tobias are doing what they should, and it's nice to see Gloria Graham in the lead role. <br /> <br /> Some viewers, especially Americans, may find it funny that someone with a Green record can get a maintenance job. on all things in the bank and come and go whenever you want. In addition, the trick that he pulled out at the court of the crown after the verdict was passed was not as far-fetched as it seemed, even in the 1960s and 70s security was not as tough as it is now. <br /> <br /> In the film itself there are a couple of interesting observations. With small temporary scammers, the catch here was too big. There were other films where this happens too, that is, MAT BRINX. This is not just a deliverance or concealment of the booty, but with so many people involved, someone will be careless, about to blab, or just break when they put it on him. In addition, the authorities commit very tough actions on local blush when such a huge robbery is committed. In addition, they say that there is no honor among thieves, but Ivan was adamant that PINKI received his blow. You just looked at his gaze at the dock, if the gazes could kill, look at complete betrayal! How could he take them all away after taking care of him? You have to ask yourself, why can rogues be so stupid? Did Green really think that he could orient himself a second time? Inspector Watford was not at all deceived by his innocent-looking face, as well as the well-built alibi, the entire privateer, which smelled of internal work. In addition, you have to wonder why they leave so much evidence? A notebook with safe numbers written on it, brochures about traveling abroad, still leaving his telescope, as well as unusual behavior on the day of the robbery, which was not in itself. <br /> <br /> With some decent ones, but the common sense police work Insp Watford quickly measured Green, picked him up and soon made him sing like a canary. It simply shows that, even though well-planned planners can unravel very quickly, for every body there is never a pure rest, some will always be caught. Although it is worth noting that most of the money was never returned. <br /> <br /> In general, an interesting film, interesting footage of London and England of the late 70s, with good speed, with a great final. I highly recommend it, especially if you like capers. (Note: I recently bought a DVD with this, but the transfer was obviously taken from a VHS tape and is of poor quality. So don’t pay too much for it!)
