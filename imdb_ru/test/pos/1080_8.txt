I saw this film at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. Since I work in the wine business, I really wanted to watch this documentary, and I was not disappointed. The good news is that from more than 500-hour video clips, Nossiter will release not only a theatrical episode, but also a ten-hour ten-hour movie series on DVD by next Christmas (ThinkFilm distributes it). The bad news is that this is still a little bulky beast. When it was shown in Cannes, it was close to three o'clock. For Toronto, he cut in about half an hour, but he still earned 135 minutes. Now it's ok for me. I love wine, and I love hearing about the controversy raging in my business. But not everyone wants it. <br /> <br /> Nossiter flies around the world, from Brazil to France, from California to Italy and Argentina, talking with winemakers, PR people, consultants and critics about the state of the wine world. The theme that arises is that globalization and the unjustified influence of wine critic Robert Parker impose wine to some extent. Small local producers are either bought up by larger conglomerates (both American and local), or, under the pressure of market forces, adjust their wines to match the taste of Mr. Parker, who dictates taste to most American (and global) markets. <br /> <br /> This is a complex topic, and I can understand why Nossiter wants his topics to be spoken. There is Robert Mondavi, the patriarch of the Napa wine industry, and his sons Tim and Michael, whose efforts to purchase land in the Languedoc faced opposition from local residents and government officials. Aime Gibert, founder and winemaker Dauma Gassaka, iconoclastic opponent of the plans of Mondavi and the Crusader for wines expressing local terror. Robert Parker himself expresses some discomfort with his influence, refusing to stop writing about the wines he likes. There is a “flying wine maker” Michel Rolland, a consultant for dozens of wineries around the world, who advises them on how to make wines convenient for valet parking. There are many more interesting personalities in this documentary. <br /> <br /> If you're a wine lover, you'll want to find a ten-part series, as well as a theatrical version of this movie. But even if you are not into wine, the film presents an interesting look at how the forces of globalization are changing many of the world's oldest and most established traditions. The impact on local cultures and economies cannot be ignored. <br /> <br /> (8/10)
