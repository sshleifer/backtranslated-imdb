36. HOSPITAL (comedy, 1971) An emergency situation engulfed the Manhattan hospital. Patients die left and right due to overcrowding and incompetence of staff. When a permanent doctor is placed on the list of deaths, the chief medical expert, Dr. Bock (George S. Scott), is called in to investigate. Having worked as a doctor for too many years and survived his own mid-life crisis, Dr. Bock thinks it's tough. He decides to commit suicide. But then he meets Barbara (Diana Rigg), the beautiful young hippie. Whose insightful view of life helps the depressed Boca. <br /> <br /> Criticism: in the Black Comedy there is a play “Tour de force” from veteran actor George Scott. He plays well strong, serious characters, strict moral of which is strictly verified. The first half of the film unfolds as a melodrama, which tells about life in the hospital and how they sometimes happen. But then, when everything looks ready for a dramatic climax, it turns into a comedy of farce. If the script of Paddy Chayafsky had retained his dramatic feeling, I would have thought that Scott would not have come out with another best actor Oscar (he had won it in absentia the previous year). His scene of decay (suicide) is one of the most heartbreaking in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Quote: Dr. Bock: "....... life and contemplation of suicide. I said," No, Bok, do not do it. You are a doctor, a healer, you are a necessary person, you “a life that makes sense.” Then ... I find out that one of my doctors was killed by a couple of nurses ... how can I withstand my sense of significance in the face of this? "
