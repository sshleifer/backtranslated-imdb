Lifeforce is definitely one of Tobe Hooper's best films. He has great special effects and a lot of nudity, so itâ€™s like a dream of a typical horror fan. The film is quite creative, and I think it's because of the script of Dan O'Bannon and Don Jacobi. Good cinematography and a good eerie atmosphere make it a continuous film.
