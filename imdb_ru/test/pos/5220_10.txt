Father Hood ... <br /> <br /> I can understand why many people hate this story about how a father kidnapped his two children and transported them across America, but I saw much worse things and when I saw years ago - I did not think it was particularly terrible. Patrick Swayze is a worried father who takes his children to flight with him for personal reasons, and Halle Berry is a police officer stalking them. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a decent way to spend a couple of hours of your life. You could certainly make it worse - ever heard of the movie “People Under”? <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of ***** <br /> <br /> Rated PG-13 for some traumatic scenes, adult content, violence and language.
