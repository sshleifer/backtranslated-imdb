“Shortly before dawn” is one of the best slasher films. It is very realistic and atmospheric. It reminds me of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Liberation by Tob Hooper. Deborah Benson plays the heroine very well, and director Jeff Lieberman created a very Spooky and gloomy film. “Shortly before dawn” is a beautiful photograph, and the soundtrack is very disturbing. I never liked slasher films or blood other than that. Very impressive and compelling film (at least for me)
