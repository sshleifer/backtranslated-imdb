True love, I really enjoyed this film and loved it. It was fun, fun and inspirational. I just saw it on DVD. How I missed this, this is a winner! I mean, Flex was "That guy." I wanted to marry him. This was my first time when I saw him a straight man, and he coped with it. I thought Tangi Miller was the best of all, and I was also the head of Felicity. Fearless woman who fears only her Nana. Thank you for giving the woman a color range in your work, and she looks great! Tasha Smith was a blast! Aloma Wright was priceless as Nana. This cute romantic comedy "Must See". Oh, and newcomer Marcus Patrick is worth amazing ladies ... True love. Karen
