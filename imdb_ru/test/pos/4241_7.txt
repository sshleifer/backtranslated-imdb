Chuckie is back ... and it's time! This time with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a small spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this fee, the camp is back. So far this has been the worst of this series. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. <br /> <br /> This film was certainly the most fun in the series and successfully, albeit unintentionally, bridges the gap from pure horror to horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> I look forward to Seeds Chucky. It will be a scream! <br /> <br /> "Lord, the music scene is a thing of the past since I died!" Chucky <br /> <br /> We needed frivolity because the doll was aging. The added comedic element and the best fighting scenes return this scene to the level of the first, when the idea was new and new. <br /> <br /> 6.8 / 10 by ... <br /> <br /> Fiend:
