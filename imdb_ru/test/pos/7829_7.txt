“Snakes on an airplane” was such a well-promoted film that it was inevitable and a little insane to try to release another film with almost the same name in the same year, not to mention the same week. Reading other comments here I see results. Many people are angry. Mad, because he doesn't have the best special effects. Mad because he doesn't have a star cast. Mad, because they wanted Samuel Jackson to say: “I’ve got tired of these M ^ * & * &% - Er F * ^ (^% - Ing Snakes on this M ^ * & * &% - Er F * ^ (^ % -Ing Train "! <br /> <br /> Well, this is definitely not the version of Samuel Jackson. And maybe this is good. <br /> <br /> Snakes on the plane were lost between the cop movie and the horror, family the action movie and the bloody bloody film about death. The performers of Saturday Night Live laughed while Jackson swore enough that the grandmother would cover his ears, and as for the children, they would be traumatized by violence. however, they knew exactly what It was. It was a cheap horror movie on the train. Of course there were snakes in it, and many of them were scientifically harmless garden snakes with false sound effects. by itself from the first scene. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the incredible fun that the snakes on the plane had to offer, and I admit that "... on the Train version was a bit dry. But in the trade it was a cool and unexpected story. This little horror movie might be a lot more wrong than it was. <br /> <br /> For this, he gets 7 out of 10.
