This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time! The director did a wonderful job by showing contrasts between social classes, a situation that is very relevant in France today. All the characters are cute, especially Juliet and her family. The development of the novel, although not entirely realistic, at least plausibly, does a wonderful job showing how much people will change for the sake of love. I found it to be a heartbreaking story about Cinderella, but in which Cinderella is an influential woman in and of herself. I laughed at the whole movie, and I really liked it. I recommend Romuald et Juliette to anyone who loves unique characters, comedies and unconventional romance.
