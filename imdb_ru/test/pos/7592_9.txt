Although it is a little more than pleasant 11-minute musical entertainment (it is rightly called a “boulevard musical”), EVERY Sunday is one of the most famous and valuable documents in cinema history, as it gives an invaluable look at the growing talents of two of the most talented and Favorite musical performers on screen: Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland. <br /> <br /> Although they are often referred to as a screen test made by MGM to test the attractiveness of adolescent student contract soldiers Durbin and Garland, whose options were reportedly preparing to be updated, this statement is not entirely accurate. By the time of the release of EVERY Sunday in July 1936, Dina Durbin’s contract with MGM had already expired, and she was immediately signed by Universal a month earlier, in June 1936. <br /> <br /> However, the situation in Durbin Contract MGM allowed the studio to use its services for up to sixty days, provided that it has not yet begun work on a painting in its new studio. Since Durbin's debut car, THREE SMART GIRLS, was not yet ready to start shooting, MGM decided to use its own version, and although at that time officially under contract with Universal, Durbin returned to the MGM party, removing this pleasant short theme from Judy Garland, the young singer singing in hope. <br /> <br /> This, along with Garland’s much more extensive professional training experience (including appearances in several earlier short films), may explain why EVERY Sunday often seems favorable to Judy Garland over Deanna Durbin, giving Garland more lines for the performances and the original song (“Americana”) for singing, while Durbin offers the popular classic song “Il Bacio” by Luigi Arditi. Of course, it is quite logical that MGM will want to give preference to one of its contract players over another from a competing studio. <br /> <br /> Ironically, although Garland’s character is the more active of the two girls in this short one, it would be Durbin’s furious and impulsive screen persona “Little Miss Fixit” at Universal, who would have pushed her to an instant superstar all over the world, as the world's first "Teen Idol" with her debut machine, THREE SMART GIRLS, while Garland's more passive image of a "brooding wall-portrait" teenager will see that she usually plays a minor role as a minor partner in the film Mickey Rooney and (in ZIEGFELD GIRL) assertive Lana Ter Ner. Only in the fifteenth MGM film of 1942, “FOR ME AND MY GALL” (which was also her first completely “adult” role), Garland will achieve a solo over the title and “solo attraction” status of a real superstar, which Durbin has achieved. instantly six years earlier. <br /> <br /> It is therefore completely inaccurate to assert that Garland was the only “superstar” of the attraction of two girls, since Durbin reached this status in the press and the public for almost ten years. before her rival MGM. Literally in foreclosure at the time of its signing, the evidence on the screen convincingly shows that Universal realized the full potential of the superstar Deanna much faster than MGM with Judy, and it is worth noting that almost all the significant achievements achieved by Garland in MGM are from billing superstars for the fact that her main roles were cars specially written to demonstrate her talents and attractiveness, as well as that she was invited to land her tracks on the ground in front of Grauman’s Chinese Theater to receive the "Honorable th Oscar, in recognition of her talent, Dinn Durbin received long before her gifted Contemporary MGM. <br /> <br /> In any case, EVERY Sunday is a delightful, completely unpretentious musical short. His storyline (Durbin and Garland use their singing talents to save Durbin's grandfather from forcible resignation by the city council.), spending his Sunday concerts in the park, anticipates the plot lines of Garland's “Let's Have a Show” musicals with Mickey Rooney and “100 AN Men” Durbin D GIRL. Unlike the later BABES Garland films, the short film never takes the serious plot line seriously, and therefore its “eleven-minute duration” flies by. <br /> <br /> Of course, the true magic of EVERY Sunday is to watch the already wonderful performance of talents / screen Durbin and Garland at the very beginning of their legendary career. Both girls, even at this early stage, had a wonderful on-screen presence and were completely natural and invisible in their performances as a singer and actress. Garland pretty explodes off the screen, literally knocking words out of the songs "Americana". When she goes through the room with appropriate gestures, Judy seems to literally chew on the lyrics of the song when she squints her mouth and looks into her intense zeal to show what she is capable of. <br /> <By contrast, Durbin’s "Il Bacio" is much more modest and restrained. Despite the fact that Durbin is fully consistent with his "classical" choice, the delivery of the Arditi waltz is much more of the traditional option of "standing and singing" than the physically emotional turn of Garland. Nevertheless, although Dinna’s “miniature diva” does nothing to attract attention with her frank eyes, dazzling smile and unsophisticated delivery, she easily holds the screen with Judi's “jazz babe” and their delicious duet “Americana” in a short film. the final regrets that the producer Joe Pasternak was never able to realize his dream of combining Durbin and Garland in a musical feature film (because Universal refused to lend Durbin "Active Number One"). <br /> <br /> An invaluable document about the nascent talents of two wonderful and completely unique talents. See this one if you have a chance!
