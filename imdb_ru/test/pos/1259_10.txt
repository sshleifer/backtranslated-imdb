This is an absolutely awesome movie! If you haven't seen it yet, damn it. Of course, the plot develops slowly, the special effects are ridiculous, the actions are ridiculous, and the actions are poorly posed, but, as the wrestler of the DDP would say; This is not bad .... this is good! Everything in this movie is funny, especially if you get a duplicate version in which the actors are even worse. This is countless laughter until you get to the end, yearning for the continuation, where the mummy fights with women. So I give him ten stars. If you are not one of those “picky” and “smart” people with good taste who like only the “highest quality” films of the highest quality, I recommend this completely monkey movie!
