Since 1972 I have watched this film and still remember it as one of my favorite films of all time. I would buy a copy if it were on a DVD, and this is very bad, it is not. You might think that anything with Peter Sellers in the lead role will be returned. Much better than Being there and as good as the Pink Panther series. Ushi Digard had a small role for such a well-to-do performer. She is a bonus in this film. I think the medical field may not appreciate this film, as it really makes fun of the profession, and it also makes it clear that Sellers was never available to treat them, as he sucked poorly, as well as urinalysis.
