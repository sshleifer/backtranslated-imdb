Well, where to start? I stumbled upon this in 1993 and, out of habit, simply pressed the “recording” on the VCR, more than anything else. “Citizen Kane,” of course, no ... but if you had a bad day and you are determined to fail before something that is not too intellectually stimulating, then I assume that this may just be your "thing." <br /> <br /> We have a lot of things here - a great title track, more stereotypes than you could have shaken, an unconscious comedy, the most brutal fight scene of all times and more, more, more! David Hemmings plays a diametrically opposite his role in the classic 60s. “Blow Up” is still a photographer, still hormonally stimulated, but not “very” the same. <br /> <br /> John Phillip Lowe is easy to hit as an actor who makes the log indistinct, but it would be unfair if he received a notification 5 minutes before taking on the role. <br /> <br /> Wexler as "Amanda"? Suffice to say that this was her only movie role! The real star of this film, however, is Ethel Evans, who plays, let's say, the secretary (?), With the morality of the cat-alley and the desire to coincide. The way she manages to reconcile her present life with the life of the future with her future husband, a comedian, is in fact quite a touchingly terrestrial, gritty, future. <br /> I really like this film when I'm in the mood for it ....... and I wouldn’t touch it with a proverb when I am not there. <br /> <br /> Prestige cast to save (relatively) straight face during filming. <br /> <br /> “Classics” at the cinema school of Edward Wood!
