It is always difficult to bring a book of 450 pages to a three-hour film. I have read a book before, and I have found that BBC production deals with this difficulty in the best possible way. The qualities of the book are not lost: a dense and vivid image of the family of patchwork masters in London in the 1860s, cold and obscene cruelty in which Maud is brought up, the characteristics of various social groups in different ways of speaking unexpected and surprising turns of history, the way the film makes the audience look differently on the same scenes, when they are told first from the point of view of Sue, and then from the point of view of Maud. The main actors are doing very well, and especially the growing love between the two women develops convincingly, with the first climax in a very tender love scene between them and, finally, forgiving all the evil they were willing to do and did to each other, because they are still love each other. <br /> <br /> For each of her books, author Sarah Waters has carefully investigated what life was like in the 19th century British. While in Tipping velvet, it was the world of vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements, In Affinity is the terrible reality of women's prisons and the fashionable resurrection of spirits, in Fingers-Smith she depicts a public ceremony of hanging people in London and inhuman treatment of people that are alleged or alleged to be trespassers in shelters are based on reading sources and research. This is very well transferred to the film, so the corresponding scenes show a high degree of historical truth. I highly recommend this film because it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere, vivid emotions and tension.
