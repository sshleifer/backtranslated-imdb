This brings back so many childhood memories. (I'm not old, I'm 19) It's a diamond. Trains, an old house, a fallen runner, a really terrible landslide (well, this is when you are 6), drama, if children can stop the train, or will it collapse? This is a children's film, without a doubt, but it offers excellent blood, guts, weapons, etc., which are harmless to children. And there is Bernard Cribbins, who is cool. 8/10
