It was the greatest film I've ever seen in my life, the action was great and I was so scared, there was a lot of blood, WHICH MADE, I would have watched it a thousand times, and Paris Hilton, D * MN she's fine in this film. But in any case, I would recommend it to everyone, even children (like me). Although, probably, you will have nightmares at night, but besides, IT IS AMAZING, I CAN'T STOP ABOUT THIS. EVERY MAIN AUGUST, WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS, I BRAGED AND BRIEFDING, and at school I gave out Flyer saying that on May 6 the house of wax figures would see it. I put my whole school into it. But in any case, I would definitely say that this is the house of wax figures on May 6, if he were there He would be killed.
