Because of the bias, I knew it would be a terrific movie, tempo, cinematography, the personalities of the indigenous people of Dallas, a variety of characters, not to mention the director Oliver Stone and, of course, Erica Bogasian ... The film begins on Friday (first of all, presumably occultly) and begins with a radio station in Dallas where their talk show number one is held, Barry Champlain’s show (based on Talk’s radio station Alan Berg) ... Barry (Eric) Bogasian) is an abrasive radio talk show host, and his work is such that it is necessary to distribute all the sen radio nuances of the radio listeners who are on his show ... He tries to sympathize with a handful of social deviations that have become lonely, vulnerable Calling indecent telephone conversations that have a masochistic thirst to be publicly condemned, Barry Champlain effectively copes with this unreliable similarity, socially humiliating them, and not merely subjecting them to simple instruction ... New techno Logic serves the stigmatic goal for radio amateurs of Dallas, and the paramount concepts are relegated to the background to perversion, they speak about sbolnyh results, orgasms and human pets !! »<br /> <br /> All of this - a cacophony of drug induced diatribe and a medley from a psychopathic paranoia !! This high quality cannon fodder is what Barry Champlain is thriving on !!! Confused pathos, deranged inclinations of deeriving from inaneities and puveyors of pornography and the common misfortunes of pop cultures serve as volatile ammunition for Pile BATTLES Barry Champlain !! <br /> <br /> The setting for this film is perfect in that there is an ideological fall of two thousand feet. In the center of Dallas, there is a powerful sense of cosmopolitan awareness, in which 20 miles away is the significant head of the Ku Klux Klan !! ... The play is based in Denver. This is where the real story takes place; other little theatrical plays depict the cities of Louisville, Atlanta and Cleveland. Dallas is the city where the movie takes place, I thought it was a great choice !! ... This film shows how people experience the terrible, erroneous and deadly misconception of the Jewish people in America, as a result of which they control the banks, their plans are different from everyone else, and their intellectual literature leads to perversion !! These preconceived notions exacerbate the overall dilemma of Barry Champlain !!! Barry Champlain's personal destruction is that he is quick-tempered and immune to his alcoholism, and his abrasive and politically contradictory nature - his final destruction, that’s what makes the movie so believable !! <br /> <br /> The characters in the film were well depicted, Dan, a tailor, created for the mid-ax hatchet (played by Alec Baldwin), who constantly followed Barry Champlain every move !! .. Laura, his girlfriend, also his producer, will constantly feel that Barry is the one who is always misunderstood !! Ellen, his ex-wife, suffers from Barry’s misery and egoism, but she cannot completely abandon her feelings for Barry, regardless of the path of personal destruction to which he resorts! The Dallas radio audience is a melting pot of socially inappropriate retro bates who are insanely surprised by their own real flaws !!! ... Partially, hanging by everyone, including Barry Champlain, is what Barry Champlain is doing! ! His audience excites debauchery, demands improvement, and ultimately becomes Barry Champlain's favorite project for prescribed sinners !! Socio-cultural conflicts became the collapse of Barry Champlain !! <br /> <br /> This movie is great !! In my opinion, the best picture of Oliver Stone, including "Platoon" and "Natural Born Killers". This statement in itself speaks about how great Talk Radio is ... The story about the actor and co-producer Eric Bogosyan is simply irresistible !! The camera angles, dialogues, images of haunting characters, everything is top notch ... The cinematography of the Dallas skyline at the end of the movie is amazing !! Dallas has a dubious distinction in that it is considered a metropolis ... So now, as in Los Angeles and New York, there are too many child crackers that can be counted, cheap housing in hell and budget cuts, which would mean that there will be a significant number of people who will be dead by this time next year !!!! ... Dallas argues that this is the status of a major metropolitan area in a shaky manner in which the profligacy of people prevails !! There are radio listeners in the city who have made a derogatory contribution to the miracle of a nationwide air wave! This is the culprit in the film! Creepy tabloids tabloid, who want to meet with a big bad wolf, and their decadent curiosity morally erased the "Last Neighborhood in America"
