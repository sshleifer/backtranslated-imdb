I received it as a complete set of 9 episodes on 5 DVDs. I did not know anything about the history of the series. The first season of the series has a pilot episode as episode 1, and then another 3 episodes for a total of 4. Season 2 lists 5 episodes, the last of which is “For good and evil” with an initial airing date of 7 December 1998. The remaining 4 episodes in the second season were broadcast from December 1997 to February 1998. So Beyond Good and Evil looks like episode 1 of season 3, except that there are no more episodes in the third season. <br /> <br /> Spoilers here. The two main characters of the first 8 episodes, Dr. Ian McCallum (John Hanna) and Dr. Angela Moloney (Zara Turner), are absent from this episode, replaced by Dr. Dan Gallagher (Nathaniel Parker) and Dr. Charlie Fielding (Eva Papa). I recognized Nathaniel Parker from Inspector Linley’s Secrets, which began in 2001. So they planned to spend season 3, but only one episode was shown. <br /> <br /> It seems strange to try to continue the series. named after the main character McCallum, when the main character left the series. Thus, they could plan for the return of Dr. Ian McCallum, but when this failed, the series was canceled. I have no inside information on this issue, but I see that both John Hanna and Nathaniel Parker participated in other projects in 1999. Does anyone have any information on this?
