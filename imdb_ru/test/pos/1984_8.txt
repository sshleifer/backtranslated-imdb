ATTENTION: DROP SPLOT <br /> <br /> David Cronenberg's always unusual films have certainly acquired a taste. Fans of his earlier films will probably like eXistenZ, but he is definitely not one of those squeamish. All the usual elements here. A game pod made of leather (hooked on the back), buckets of blood, a pistol of bones, and a manic mechanic are just some of them. The result is good in parts, bad in parts and just odd in others. But the film has undeniable originality. <br /> <br /> Despite excessive use ?? the oddity of this proves that virtual reality games can have dangerous consequences for some people. In the film, the character shoots someone dead, claiming that he is “annoying” (assuming she was still in the game). But the question remains whether it actually happened or happened in this amazingly realistic game. "EXistenZ" leads to a conclusion that can be answered in several ways. <br /> <br /> Despite some extra gadgets and tricks, it was just your classic: "It was a dream." or it was a turnaround. This is an amazing surprise, and he answers a few questions, but a little disappointing is the fact that the whole film was on its way. In just 97 minutes, this could go on and on. In a peculiar way, the film raises moral problems, but solves them in a violent and rather inappropriate way. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Jason Lee appears here in her first big role in a long time. But her character does not have enough qualities to make her jump off the screen or even give her a pretty character. On the other hand, Jude Law (with a curious American accent) is good because your average Joe is drawn into this crazy world. We see the film from his point of view. <br /> <br /> “eXistenZ” is far from flawless, but it certainly was remembered by the film. There are tons of strange characteristics to match the similar styles of David Lynch (what's next? - use the question mark?!?!?!). It is definitely not for all tastes, but it is useful enough to recommend. My IMDb rating is 6.2 / 10.
