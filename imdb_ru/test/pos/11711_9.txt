In the tradition of the "neo" film "Noir", such as "Chinatown", this film focuses on the mystery of crime in the dark world with a little insight into the character. Typical heroes of the noir, including a policeman, proving himself, a girl in need and a bad, bad guy. Sharkey's Machine receives 9 out of 10 points for cinematography, as well as for directing, plot, strong character play and an excellent jazz score. Available on DVD, although the soundtrack itself is not printed (but is available at some auctions). Filmed on the site in the beautiful downtown Atlanta (the birthplace of the novelist Dill) and uncluttered, around 1979, the city view would have forced the old citizen or visitor of Atlanta long before the old days before the highway between 12 lanes crossed the city, a cinematographerâ€™s dream at that time. It was the first US film Rachel Ward.
