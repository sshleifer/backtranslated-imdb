Pierre Jolive plays the character of Don Quixote, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. He trusts his makeshift weapon — a helmet, sleeves, and spears made of hubcaps, seat cushions, and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote rode Rosicant, the “Man” rides his own thing (literally), overcoming lost lives, swallowing the harsh and humiliating modern world - floating above the ground, far from the plight of modern man. Both characters go in search of adventure, trying to correct the mistakes of the world. Both characters are knight-guardians of values ​​unfamiliar to most other characters in the story. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the tale of Cervantes, in this film we identify ourselves with the anachronistic ideals of the main character. We can only compare this alien and forbidden landscape with the magnificent and beautiful world in which we live. Our frame of reference is a fantastic kingdom that a lone knight may remember. Our vision will be that which expects the main character to win, win, change his world (for the better) back to the world of abundance, which no longer exists. <br /> <br /> We look at this film and see a real knight among the people-animals world. Don Quixote considered himself a real knight among animals. <br /> <br /> With the story of Cervantes, we can only see the dreamer, not understanding the scale of his anachronistic displacement. In the story of Besson and Jolivet, we see the new world through the eyes of Don Quixote, because we value the same visions and ideals as the main character of the crusaders.
