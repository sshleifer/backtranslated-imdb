Is this a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Of course, what did you expect from the movie "BEACH BABES FROM BEYOND"? <br /> <br /> This is the film "BABES in BIKINI" and does not pretend to be different. Considering that this is not a "ROOM WITH A VIEW" or "SHINDLER'S LIST". If you wanted a movie like “Room with a View”, you wouldn’t have watched Beach Kids From Beyond. But if you are looking for a good movie “Bikini Babes” without a plot, then it is for you. This click delivers what it promises, and then some. This is pure 100% teenage fun. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of CHILDREN in and out of bikinis. The film was quite funny and nice to watch. These were some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen on a home video. <br /> <br /> Every schoolchild should watch at least one bad film like this. In fact, this is one of the most memorable films I've ever seen. So shame, I say it again ... If you are going to watch only one film "Babes in Bikini", this is it.
