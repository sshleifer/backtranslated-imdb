I caught this film on local television. At about 4:30 in the morning I had no expectations, but after the opening credits, I realized that I had gotten into something good. <br /> <br /> For your interpretation, there are situations to “find out” what really happened, so your attention is the key factor. <br /> <br /> The whole psychological situation in the thriller is largely related to the development of the character and the way the main character performs things. <br /> <br /> Your subordinate consciousness also plays an important role, because with the help of a number of events and dialogues you can make the correct interpretation and form an opinion. <br /> <br /> Technical aspects are very good. Really good indeed. Kelly Overtone is incredibly sexy, and she loves her eyes, although she is dressed in white clothes most of the time. <br /> <br /> The fear factor is practically absent, but there are many mysteries and tensions in it from which to dig. <Br /> <br /> I would recommend it to those who love supernatural and psychological thrillers.
