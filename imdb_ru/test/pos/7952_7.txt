Korean "novel" about the owner of the camera, who was diagnosed with a deadly disease. As he does his daily activities and prepares for the end, he meets a young girl who is a client. Friendship and romance are growing, although neither of them expresses any attachment to the other. A good movie is not like anything that you are likely to see, reworked in America, simply because the studios will insist that the “couple” act on their feelings. He will not say anything, because he does not live so long, and she doesn’t, because it’s not what has been done, and he doesn’t respond as she thinks. Of course, this is much more difficult than I imagine, and, frankly, this is what you have to discover. Is this a great movie? No, but it is a good one that will move you emotionally. The last lines of the film still haunt me: “I always knew that love would disappear like a photo — but you will remain in my heart, as in my last moment. Thanks and goodbye". It may seem strange out of context, but in the context of the film it is very touching.
