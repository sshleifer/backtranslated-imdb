With the rather recent release of "Fados" by Carlos Saura in the United States (only a limited edition art house), it's time to re-release this beautiful documentary on Amalia Rodriguez. This film is a treasure chest of vintage films Amalia on Portuguese and American television, as well as various other clips, including one of the films about her and her mother, which can easily turn most macho into tears. I first saw this wonderful documentary a few years ago when it received an unreasonable release of "art house" (it deserved much better). Fortunately, there are various entries for Amalia’s best records on various “budget line” entries (which are usually available in places like K-Mart or Best Buy), or if you do a little search, you can fine out some of the original issues. either in E-Bay or in one of those distribution services that specialize in expensive European imported compact discs. There are at least two versions of this documentary (the original version of Portugese without English subtitles and the American version in Portuguese with English subtitles, except that the European version cannot be played on most USDVD players due to the PAL color line system). Not rated MPAA, but does not contain anything that might offend you.
