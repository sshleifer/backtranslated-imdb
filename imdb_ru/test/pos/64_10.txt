Dear Lily is a mixture of perfection and magic! Stars; Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson could not have made a better attempt if they tried. He is full of all the magic that a young lady desires, and it seems that all this can really happen to you. The brilliance of the director; Blake Edwards is featured at his best. He really captured the woman he loved on the screen! <br /> <br /> The combination of each song perfectly matched the moment in the film. The film began with the fact that Julie Andrews sang Whistling Away In The Dark, and ended with the same Andrews song. <br /> <br /> For a film of such perfection when it was released, such a failure is a complete shock ... <br /> <br /> As it is: "Inspired ... Pure ... Inspired!" ~ One of Andrews' most memorable lines in this movie!
