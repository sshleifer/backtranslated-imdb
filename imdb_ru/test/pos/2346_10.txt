I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen for Naruto. the action was much better than in the first movie, because there was a lot more of the fight scene in it, and it came to you at a faster pace. it was amazing, the choreographer was superb, like most visual effects. <br /> <br /> The storyline is something new for Naruto. but it is basically the same as the first movie. in the series you see how they fight against other ninjas, but in the films (1 + 2) you see how they fight against the machine of mass destruction. nice to see them fighting something other than a ninja, and that it was great to see some other power besides the chakra. and how other people from another country fight across the ocean. Sakura also finally killed someone stronger than her. (she really became strong), it was much better than the fillers of the series, which I am currently watching. when you watch this movie, the fast action scene will surely make your heart beat faster. With the new jutus and Garra in the film, you know, that's good. and the music was also good, but it seems to me that something is missing. But the final theme of the song was a plus. (Dind Dong Dang) I think it was a really good song. I fully recommend it. <br /> <br /> In general, I give this film 10, because I just love it. if you decide to watch it, enjoy. lol
