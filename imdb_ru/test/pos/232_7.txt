Although the Cover Girl story is very fragile and weary, it serves as an anchor for the musical numbers of Kern and Gershwin quite well. After her signature in Gilda, Hayworth decided to play a major role in this musical, which seems to have been created especially for her. Besides the fact that she looks great, as always, she is impressive with her dance. Gene Kelly, who was borrowed from MGM in Colombia, fits in with her dance, and the sequence where he jumps with his own shadow was well done. Auxiliary characters also acted correctly. Personally, I didn’t like Cover Girl like Hayworth and Fred Astair’s musicals. However, the Cover Girl is still very interesting and easy to recommend. My account: 7/10.
