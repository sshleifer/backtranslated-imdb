The mere presence of Sam Waterston as an Indian is enough to put this film into a must-watch category. He is beautiful and very thin, without any features. He is gentle with his abduction, and yet we can see that he is among the proudest of all young Indian men. Martin Sheen is just a dumbass who decides to challenge Waterston (White Bull) for a gorgeous white horse. Other subplots are really not needed. I don’t understand what role Carolyn Langrish played as the poor girl who was kidnapped by White Bull ... I don’t know how she holds her hands from this beautiful Indian man! It's a lot of fun, though; especially if you're a fan of waterston. Man, he looks GOOD in it! The role of Harvey Keitel is not even worth mentioning, to be honest! But rent it and enjoy! In fact, I believe that if the music were better, it would be a more dramatic film ... the music is so bad, it distracts. Nevertheless - there is Mr. Waterston!
