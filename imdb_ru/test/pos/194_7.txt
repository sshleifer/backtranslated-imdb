After watching this movie, it is easy to understand why the post-dumb Soviet cinema is so little critical. Do not get me wrong. Cranes are flying, at least for the first half, highly entertaining, with a touch of touch, completely unexpected for their country of origin; fresh, bouncy, spacious technique that ultimately annoys just as it initially enchants; two stunning subjective scenery; and the romantic mood that flirts, but never falls on the territory of Lelouch. It’s just that by nature extensive social, national and world events relate to the novel, it is practically no different from the usual Hollywood film. <br /> <br /> Of course, in the Soviet Union, where special attention was paid to the state. Among other things, in the era (Second World War), which suppressed individualism and freedom to defend the murderous symbolism, this priority of two attractive young lovers is a relief. And thematic similarity - all love-absorbing ones are torn apart by the war - with two of the most remarkable of all films (SEVENTH SKY, FOREST PARAPULE SCHERBURG) also adds to its potential appeal. <br /> <br /> The story is simple pretty. Boris, a young manufacturer from a bright medical and artistic family, and Veronica, a student, have a pleasant relationship at night, in their only free time. Boris's cousin, the composer, also looks at Veronica. When the Nazis invade Russia, Boris secretly voluntarily, to the chagrin of his family and lover. He promises to write to Veronica, but never does, thinking that perhaps she did not bother to accompany him, or perhaps the mail is simply unreliable. Veronica's parents die during an air raid, and she moves in with Boris's family, helping in the hospital, where his father cares for wounded soldiers. <br /> <br /> Distressed by Boris’s silence, Veronica is also attacked by the attention of Mark, who was exempted from military service by bribing a local official. In the end, she wears out and marries him, to the disapproval of her adoptive family. Boris, meanwhile, died in battle. Veronica, disgusted with herself and adulterous Marche, refuses to believe this and is waiting for his return, raising the young orphan with his name. <br /> <br /> The name refers to the birds, which the couple sees at the height of their love, perhaps symbolic of its transcendental, epiphanic power. But this is illusory - cranes fly in a V-shaped formation, and this form permeates the entire film through the geometric shapes of buildings, interiors, exteriors, groups of people, compositions, camera angles, the name of the heroine - or by editing, in which west in one story, meet with legs going southeast to another. <br /> <br /> This serves as a fatal trap for lovers who do not control their destinies, and also suggests a Stalinist power that is never specifically mentioned in the film. Although the couple seems to be free in space, literally in a clean environment, or privileged in generous close-ups, they are always ironic, minimized, torn apart by circumstances, families, crowds (see Brilliant, if obvious, sequences where Veronica captured by tanks, or a couple can not meet in a huge crowd), or simply the structure of the film, which constantly paralyzes their proximity. Although at first the lightness and brightness of the style suggest a beautiful romantic idyll, it is constantly disturbed by strange edits or angles of view of distracting music fragments. <br /> <br /> The most remarkable thing is how these blocks of romance are achieved by abstraction, not by underlining historical forces. The whole film, but especially the war itself, strangely unreal and fabulous, we never show its harsh, cruel relevance, only its influence on lovers. In fact, it turns into a majestic sight, devoid of unpleasant Germans. <br /> <br /> Air strikes in the rear create the delightful effects of light and shadow or the ruins of an almost Gothic demise. In a bunker, the threat of the Soviet empire is less important than the indifference perceived by Boris. An empty, one-day Moscow firstly walks lovers than Veronica and her mother, although these are less real places than emotional spaces. <br /> <br /> When Mark tries to impose himself on Veronica, the air raid is a less destructive reality than the symbolic release of sexual and emotional disorders. This is a brilliant sequence, shot with silent expressionist terror, in which the screen seems to explode with hysteria and violence, all the more irresistible to the thoughtful softness of the early scenes. <br /> <br /> This is not much different in or the front, where the struggle for the honor of girls is more relevant than tactics, Nazism or despair. The movement of Boris and his wounded comrade into the final space is a further abstraction from the experience of the war, its situation in the forest, which gives it sexual dynamics; and the last, pre-mortal memory of Boris is an extraordinary mixture of the fulfillment of dreams and heightened anxiety, in which the desired becomes threatening and grotesque. <br /> <br /> From this point on, the film becomes a little less interesting, a little more obvious. Another understanding of the overloading of expressionism — Veronica’s suicide attempt and her infant rescue — is awkwardly handled; and her dark guilt casts a paralyzing shadow on the entire film. The use of deep concentration, initially delightful, soon becomes worn out, devoid of any moral strength or value, which Wells led to the use of in CIVIL KEYNE. After it seems that the sly criticism of totalitarianism in favor of the individual cruelly indulges in the end, when individual suffering, as often happens in Russian art, turns into symbolic (that is, sexless, inhuman) hope. A pity.
