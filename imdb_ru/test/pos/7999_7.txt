The return of Batman should be considered quality when talking about superheroes. His predecessor, Batman, in my opinion, is by far the greatest and most thoughtful comic book genre. For one to say that the Return of Batman was disappointing, he or she did not fully watch the film and viewed Danny DeVito’s actions as a Penguin. Devito and Walken offer some memorable moments. The story of Batman is supposed to be dark, and Tim Burton performed the comic like Batman. The Return of Batman provides comic relief, action, anticipation and fantasy; and this should not be considered “shit”, although we all have the right to our own opinion.
