Critters 4 is considered one of the greatest films of the twentieth century. The word "classic" has never been used as successfully as in describing this amazing epic. I agree that the original Critters are the best of this series, but the faith in the claustrophobia of the space station on which Critters 4 are installed should really be considered. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in seeing one of the main attractions of the cinema of the twentieth century.
