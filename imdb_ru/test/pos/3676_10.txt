I also joined IMDB for the sole purpose of commenting on this film, but I can sing his praises. I have never heard of this film (it’s packed so badly that it’s easy to understand why he can pass by), but a good friend offered it to me, and I’m so glad she did. This is the jewel of the film. The actors are great (in particular, Kathy Bates and Meredith Eaton), and they seem to be having fun. Of course, from time to time it was too much, but I can't remember the last time I laughed so many or many times in two hours. If you like to laugh, then you must see this movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
