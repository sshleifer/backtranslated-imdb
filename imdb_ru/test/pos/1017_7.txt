In this film, there is something to please, despite its modest attributes of a preaching computer story about rape and a criminal who always lives better than a victim. The film caused considerable anxiety in the mysterious setting that sent the recordings. (For example, I was sure that it was a teacher. In fact, this would be a more likely plot, because the idea of ​​a friend’s best friend’s friend came out of nowhere. I think the point is that "rape is omnipresent. You never you don’t know who it will be. ”) Ms. Beller is shining as always (but still see the discussion board in KB for my qualification of this statement) As in all preaching films, the plot lasts 15 minutes after the climax, so you can stop looking at that moment. If you are not very interested to know what is happening with Philip. Blythe Danner, as a mother, plays the role in which she was born: an irritable, overly protective mother. Some good 70s scenes for 70s fans. (The dark bar to which the father comes to drink his pain is all dark beams, barrels, oak and cork). A must for Beller fans and highly recommended for fans of high-school 70's melodrama or 70's kitsch.
