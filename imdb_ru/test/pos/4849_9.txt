MPAA PG-13 rating <br /> <br /> My rating: 10 and above <br /> <br /> My * Rating 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> William H. Macy delivers amazing performance , since the role of Mr. Neumann. He makes you feel sympathetic and afraid for him at the same time. The story begins as a comedy and slowly but steadily becomes almost like a horror film with twists and turns, which Macy easily masters. I could not take my eyes off this film even after it ended, and I could not believe that it ended when it ended. NEED TO SEE. <br /> <br /> THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE CONSIDERED BY A SPOILER BY SOME <br /> <br /> After watching a movie, look at the plot as follows: “Neumann” is the United States as a whole, and a character from “Meat Bread” Aday plays are people in the United States who are anti-Semitic. <br /> <br /> This film was very pleasant and was recommended to everyone I saw on the street.
