This is one of my favorite movies of all time, I think it's great to watch in groups. It's also great for any fan of Alan Rickman, he does such a wonderful job. It's exciting, interesting, very amazing ... you have to watch it twice, at least. I did not watch it with anyone who did not like it or at least found it worthwhile.
