Rachel and Chuck Yoman (Valerie Harper, Gerald McRaeney) decided that the city was too busy and dangerous for their family, so they gathered their reluctant son (Gregory Togel) and daughter (Tammy Loren) and returned to the lake, similar to what Rachel lived in childhood. <br /> <br /> They say that you will not be able to return home anymore, but this is an ideal rural house that at first glance resembles the feeling of a Mayberry. Later, the residence seems to be more like people in Deliverance. Soon bodies begin to appear, and everyone looks suspicious, with the exception of a few friendly faces. This does not prevent the family from enjoying jogging and lounging in the forest. <br /> <br /> We discover that they must be very ignorant to find secrets, and not to tell anyone until they are dismissed as antagonists. <br /> <br /> Can the ignored young Stevie save their parents or their pursuer (s) put their foot in it? <br /> <br /> This film is bigger than most parodies, since it was played with straight faces. They could not choose the best actors, and Daryl Anderson was extremely creepy. An additional advantage is that they tell us what happens before the characters know, instead of pulling the key out of the hat after the fact. Anyway, this made for a television movie is good for a few laughs.
