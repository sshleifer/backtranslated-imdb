When I was going to watch Rendition, I was expecting an exciting film on a controversial topic with famous actors. I did not expect a film that would be so exciting, exciting, poetic and sad that it caught me from the very beginning and did not let go, even after I left the theater. Advice to anyone who has not seen it, do not let your policy interfere (or not enjoy) this film. Take it for being. I saw it with my conservative Jewish family (I'm a black sheep, a pseudoliberal college student), and I thought they would write it off as “liberal propaganda.” Instead, they said it was a great movie with great features (they like to imagine themselves as film critics). <br /> <br /> It is sad that such a film should be sold by actors affiliated with Oscar and leave constantly undervalued Sarsgaard, as well as new talents, such as the truly excellent Metwally. The whole cast gave good performances, with some stand out much more than others; My only problem with this was that a lot was happening, which did not allow each character to devote a lot of time to the screen. In fact, I felt that the “plot” with Fatima and Khalid was as noticeable on the screen as part of the story of Anwar. <br /> <br /> All characters can fall into stereotypes, but the actors do a good enough job to give them depth with little time on the screen. The strip is really amazing, like a heartless senator, and no matter how much I want to see an actress in such a terrible role, it is impossible not to believe her. Gyllenhaal, who will probably be one of the Oscar bows in this film, sometimes seems a bit insecure about his role. X tries to portray his inner conflict, but usually just leaves, as if he either forgot his lines or does not know what he should feel. Sarsgaard performed well; his unforgettable confrontation with Streep is one of the best parts of the film. Metwally, again, was awesome, and I hope to see it in more popular films. It's a shame that Gyllenhaal is likely to be pushed in front of him. Yigal Naor, as shown in IMDb, has already been filmed in some films, but he is new to my eyes. He, along with Mohammed Huas and Zineb Oukach, all gave excellent views. <br /> <br /> The story of Fatima and Khalid has not received any mention in commercials, but it brings sad humanity to this story. The story was interesting, as I was trying to really connect the two stories, until in the end we were told about it. I read here some comments that say that a love story was useless, but I disagree. I think it definitely shows the other side to the controversial issue, as well as humanity as a whole. Khalid was a real terrorist, but he did it to avenge his brother, and although he is responsible for the attack, you see his humane side in the story of Fatima. Not that I thought that we should feel bad for real terrorists, but I think that the topic “we are all people” was definitely relevant. <br /> <br /> Regardless of what you feel about terrorism, politics, etc. This should not be affected. theater. The bottom line is that this is an interesting story with a message that we all need to hear.
