This is one of the best films I have seen this year! I do not agree with the man who said that this is boring. Of course, some people may find this film not at all intimidating, but personally I spent a very good moment. This film very well alternates sex scenes with frightening scenes. There is also a pleasant sense of humor. For example, when a wife tells her husband that in childhood she was abused by her father, and then her husband says “how someone can insult someone like you,” and then he tries to put her on the bed for sex games: D Very funny ! I recommend this movie to everyone, and by the way, sorry for my bad English (I'm from France).
