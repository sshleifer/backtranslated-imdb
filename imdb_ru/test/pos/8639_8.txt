Wow, what a strange movie. This is a David Lynch film, so it's no wonder that it is weird. <br /> <br /> I don’t urge anyone to fully explain everything in this film. I can not do. After some research after my second viewing of this film, I pretty much know most of the story, but at a glance, and without the help of other reviewers or outside help, it’s hard to figure it out. So, if you are in this boat and were confused, do not feel bad; this is normal. Let me just say that the key to the film is the character of Naomi Watts. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I like the movie. I like wonderful visual effects and rich colors, and I find every character in this film really interesting and interesting to watch. Camera work is excellent, and the music is terrible, "Blue Velvet" a la Lynch. There are also some good sound effects that will help in some dramatic scenes. In general, he is very well established. <br /> <br /> Similar to Lynch’s Twin Peaks television series, it was a film in which the end was connected together after Lynch thought that this film would be a long, lengthy one. TV series. When this did not happen, he did it at the last moment. This may explain some confusion at the end and the lack of explanation regarding the characters that we see earlier in the film, but which mysteriously disappear. <br /> <br /> The theme of the story is supposedly a negative comment about Hollywood and what it does to people, especially to those whose dreams of becoming an actor are crumbling. <br /> <br /> Watts and another leading lady, Laura Eleana Harring, are very interesting to watch, especially in their famous lesbian sex scene. It seems that both women were chameleons, sometimes looked average, and at other times just amazing. <br /> <br /> I liked this film more with the second viewing than with the first. This is not just a piece of curiosity; it's a very intriguing movie ... just don't feel stupid if you can't understand some things.
