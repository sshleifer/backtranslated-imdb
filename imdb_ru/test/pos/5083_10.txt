I saw the movie yesterday and was shocked by this, but even more shocked by some of the comments I read here. One person wrote that it was ambiguous whether the victim of torture was guilty or not - therefore ... One person wrote that because he was not an American citizen, therefore ... Some people comment that people in the Middle East therefore hate us want us to die ... So, we say that it is right to torture someone who is guilty of a crime? We say that it is right to torture someone who is not an American citizen? We say that it is right to torture someone who can hate us and wants us to die? We say that, as written in the Geneva Convention, the Declaration of Human Rights and the United States Constitution, that “torture is wrong, but some torture is less wrong than others?” When does it become “right” for torture? That is why this film is powerful - it is ambiguous, but not about torture. Torture is always wrong, and if we want to do this, even in the name of justice and “national security” or “freedom and democracy”, then we are mistaken and are evil; we do exactly what we blame our enemies (and we call them "wrong" in one breath). My favorite phrase in the film was “if you don’t want to compromise, join Amnesty International”. Right to.
