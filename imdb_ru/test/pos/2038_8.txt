I'm a fan of action movie, but until today I have never seen a preview or advertisement of this film in Italy, so I went to watch “The Long Kiss for the Night” on pay-TV, hoping that nothing special. <br /> <br /> But what a surprise! This movie is great! The only problem I discovered was the presence of some gaps in the plot, but the rest is the most entertaining, intriguing, and funny action movie ever created. <br /> <br /> The transformation of Samantha / Charlie from an ordinary wife-teacher to a cold-blooded agent recovering from amnesia seems to be a good idea. Scenes and stunts are the best I've ever seen. Samuel L. Jackson adds some of the best lines I've ever heard, and his chemistry with Gina Davis is good. <br /> <br /> What about Gina? She is wonderful, she plays the best action movie heroine she has ever seen and does strong, compelling acting and fantastic stunts. <br /> <br /> I think that this film had weak roles at the box office and bad critics, because most of the reviewers and some of the public have a hard time playing strong female roles. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
