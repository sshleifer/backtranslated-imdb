This thriller has so many turns that I found myself on the edge of my seat. I saw it on video, some bluff landscapes could be more impressive on the big screen. Cast Sandra Bullock, Ben Chaplin (from The Truth About Cats and Dogs), Michael Pitt (Henry Parker in Dawson Creek) and Ryan Gosling (???).
