This game is one of the best horror / shooter games I've ever played. The plot is a little volatile, but the game can not but cause you a lot of chills and excitement. Many people put the game on the shelf when they discovered that there are no cheat codes for it and very few potions and ammunition. But in fact, after you have completed the game once, you are more familiar with monsters and different rooms, so you can easily get to the second time. The puzzles are great, not too complicated, not too simple. There are many different monsters, so you will never be bored. And there are many playgrounds. You really feel that you are playing a good novel by Stephen King. This is cute and creepy. Choose this game cheap and have fun.
