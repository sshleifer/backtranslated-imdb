Great music, great dancing, a sexy star (Swayze) and real sexual desire expressed by a female character (a very unusual event!). You rarely see female characters motivated primarily by lust, and this is a pleasant change. I also think that the film shows very clearly what it is like to be a teenager who copes with the problems of the class and when ideals suddenly face reality. Of course, at some point this is stupid - after all, this is a musical film, but in general itâ€™s a real pleasure - a funny novel, as well as politically enlightened. This film also has one of my favorite lines of all time: "I carried a watermelon."
