Even an old, cynical DOCTOR fan like me can gasp for an episode of my favorite show. This happened earlier during the Eccleston final, and it happened while watching this episode. Although this does not happen often, but Impossible Planet is an example of both the show and television at its best. This is an amazing television. <br /> <br /> The doctor and his companion are landing in a mysterious place where they see strange inscriptions on the wall, and the audience (many of whom will move behind the sofa) instantly freeze. The door opens and terrible monsters begin to haunt the time travelers. It might take a whole 25-minute episode in the original show, but it all happens in the sequence preceding the title. You can skip the longer format of the original show, but at least this new series is tightly prepared, and if we are interested in a disappointing story, then at least it's usually just one week. <br /> <br /> Nothing to disappoint the viewer here. This is the WHO DOCTOR in its best traditional style. Writer Matt Jones and director James Strong did everything they could to create a story that would be viewed for years. They do this by creating a fateful story. The Doctor and Rose lose the Tardis, and they are stuck with the main characters in the distant future. Interestingly, in many stories there has never been a plot of this type, when the Doctor and his companions no longer have access to the Tardis, which makes the story more intriguing. Without a doubt, the highlight is the scene where Scooty goes in search of Toby to find him standing on the surface of the planet, where he turns and beckons her outside. Everything from acting, make-up and Murray Gold's music makes this scene truly shocking to its audience. <br /> <br /> Immediately after this episode, the BBC switches received a tsunami of complaints about concerned parents telling how their children were injured. we . That it took them a few hours to pull them out because of the family couch, and that they now refuse to sleep without light. For this complain would be the denial of the magic of the doctor who. Yes, it can terrify, and yes, such images will burn in the mind of a child that they will never forget, even if they live to be a hundred. But Iâ€™m willing to bet that these most "injured" children would spend a week asking them not to watch the next episode.
