For a long time I did not know whether I liked this film or not. This is amazing because I usually know, but since the film has not gone away, I was a little embarrassed. <br /> <br /> Two people move to a somewhat communal home environment. Finding out that their spouses are constantly working or going on business trips, their attention, because of loneliness, wanders towards each other. After platonic love, the main character, played by Tony Leung Chiu, tells us that he has a mistress on the side. Su Li-Zen, played by Maggie Cheung, is offended, although their love affair has not been physically completed. Chiu leaves the country to return in a few years when things have changed. <br /> <br /> From a cynic point of view, the film is the right one. Never actively or without actually affecting a part of love, but only approaching it, the film, admittedly, speaks more than many others have on this issue. I think it is also true that nothing good could happen if they continued to have a deal. At least I have that feeling. <br /> <br /> However, if you believe this, Garik Marquez writes that "... love is a state of grace, not a means for anything other than alpha and Omega, an end in itself", then this film is a crash fails like everyone else. Or, if you are prone to completely incomplete minimalism, you hit the mark right. What movies in history have you reached, approached or supported this phrase, at least for a short time? My honest feeling in my memory is that there are about two. When Harry met Sally, this is actually romantic perfection, and the only thing that is needed is to It’s interesting that in “When Harry Met Sally" this is done during courtship, and not in the process of achieving it. Isn’t anyone able to say something good about love after two people reached it? The recent film by Nicholas Spark Notebook is perhaps closer to this than any other film; should we believe that when love is reached, it flies off the radar just to exist perfectly in some other dimension, or maybe more true, becomes a hidden conductor for other purposes? <br /> <br /> “Mood for Love” is an honest film, with great and generous cinematography worthy of the best in every way Almodovar has to offer, but in the end all he can say is that “Life is sometimes like that. "Now this is not at all scary, especially if you say it well, but the problem really comes at the end of the last act, when Kar Wai Wong tries to complete the film, linking, only for the second time, a broader historical theme that plays against the background of This is a worthy effort, and the variation on the musical motive played throughout the entire film is a rather brilliant, but relatively restrained indictment of the theme playing too little to have much more than a superficial effect on the whole astronomy audience, leaving the viewer to share the difference, the error in any film. The director should know where he goes and how to get there. But, frankly, this is only one wrong turn. However, as you know, all that is needed is one noticeable imperfection to spoil the perfect keg of honey. <br /> <br /> However, the efforts are certainly worth it; trying to allow the historical theme to widen and round out the film and raise it beyond the micro sense of the couple, but without any real omen, This is a crucial mistake. In a word, and, unfortunately, too little, too late. It is also, I think, too big a problem for a non-Asian spectator who is not familiar enough with the history of China to fully appreciate this impetuous blow.
