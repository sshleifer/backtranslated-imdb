I rented this obscure relic of an Australian a few years ago to show it on the spot with a friend, and it was an instant success. The classic tale of the wizard of ounces with a decisive Australian turn of the 70s in the form of a cornball. Acting is not exactly Shakespeare's public affairs here, but later, Mad Max's star Bruce Spence is a perfectly understated surfer / scarecrow, and there are some amazing comic twists of Gary Wadell and Robin Ramsey as a delightful character from the fabulous 70's godmother / father. Ex-frontman Daddy Cool Ross Wilsonâ€™s musical contribution to the title track. In the same vein as in later Australian comedies such as Priscilla Queen of the Desert. Good fun.
