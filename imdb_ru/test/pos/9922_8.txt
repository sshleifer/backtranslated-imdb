This is the standard fare from the director, who until now was among my favorites. <br /> <br /> Although he is very flat compared to many of his other works, this is Argento, and this may be biased, but I’m going to give him a good overview anyway. <br /> <br /> He has a lot of good ideas. Thin voyeur element. Needles under the eyes. Bloody and disturbing deaths. And flashback cliché Argento. <br /> <br /> Cons: heavy metal soundtrack, acting and finals. <br /> <br /> The entire film is made for the birds in a theatrical production next to the end. <br /> <br /> A pretty good film from Argento, but he is better. Much better!
