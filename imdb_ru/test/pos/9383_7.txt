I can honestly say that Death Bed: The Bed That Eats was a much better movie than I expected. Let me clarify the story in case the title of the film is too vague - there is a bed that eats. Evil bed. It eats people. Some unsuspecting women stumble upon an ominous “bag” on some kind of “walk” and eventually become victims of his hunger. The process of devouring a bed consists of yellow foam, which absorbs people into the internal ... gastric acid; all complete with chewing sounds. This is a very strange cult film, and the only film by George Barry, who forgot that he shot it, until word of mouth got information about his newly found cult status, and he decided to release it on DVD. A very good movie if you look through the lousy game and enjoy the effects of hockey - the most ridiculous is the guy who has his hands torn off and has only skeletal fingers looking plastic ... with the artist behind the picture and the demonic story of the bed. If you like weird, budgetless, weird movies, then definitely look for “Death Bed”.
