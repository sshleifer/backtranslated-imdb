This funny, sometimes piercing look at the Hollywood genre of detective stars of the 40s and 1950s, Robert Sacci, as an unnamed former police officer who resigns, uses his life savings to pay for plastic surgery to transform his image into his idol Humphrey Bogart, and then sets up the store as a private eye under the name "Sam Marlow." Robert Sacchi, by the way, is one of the few imitators of Bogart who correctly understood the jokes; Moreover, body language and face here. For a while, Sam’s only client is his mistress, who wants him to find her short guy, and the only conversational tape is his secretary, who is simply called “Duchess” (Misty Row), who, in his own words, " looked "like Marilyn Monroe and has as much meaning as Gracie Allen" and has a passion for banana split. Then he meets Elsa (Olivia Hussey), a simple, sweet, virgin daughter of a retired props master who was killed for no apparent reason. sam vsk murder investigation process re confronted: the twin Jean Tirney (Michelle Phillips) from Anastasia, the miserly, obscenely rich Greek shipping magnate (Victor Buono turning into trustworthy Sydney Greenstreet), his miserable, long-suffering second wife (Yvonne de Carlo, who manages to play various haughty emotions, without saying a word), his two clever minions (Herbert Lom, channeling Peter Lorre and Jay Robinson, playing quite accurate Lionel Atville) and Anastasia "The wicked amoral Middle Eastern ruler (Franco Nero) , which comes complete with a glamorous and inexplicably faithful lover (Sybil Dunning), and they are all ready to do anything to purchase Alexander's Eyes, two huge, perfectly matched star sapphires. When Elsa is killed, Marlowe’s interest in solving the case becomes personal, and he goes to the maze of Los Angeles sights, including the Hollywood Bowl, the scatological and esoteric sights of Hollywood Boulevard and the island of Santa Catalina in pursuit of the rocks, is determined to get to them from any of two rich competitors. Add the cameos of Mike Mazurka and others, the traditional blunt but sympathetic ally in the police, and many well-traced turns of characters that give a dimension to almost all players, and, despite the unfortunate title song, you are my mind, an absolutely pleasant movie experience.
