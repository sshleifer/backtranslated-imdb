Lou Gossett, Jr. is great in the role of Chappie Sinclair, the US Air Force super pilot who comes to the aid of a good but undisciplined Dag Masters (Jason Gedrick) son of a captive pilot who is determined to lend a pair of F-16 fighter jets to use in an attempt to save his father from the dictator (David Suchet) of an enemy foreign country. <br /> <br /> This air force aviation film is better than Top Gun, causing excitement and a lot of explosions - you know, all those cool things you would like to get from a modern military adventure film. <br /> <br /> Cool music, including “Dee Snyder” from Twisted Sister, says: “We are not going to take it” and the Excellent “Never Die” king cobra. <br /> <br /> Aim high! Air force!
