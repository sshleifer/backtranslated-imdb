I remember a college professor commenting on how disturbing this film was, reflecting the adolescent apathy (this was before the X generation). <br /> <br /> In a sense, most of us are products of the same consumer culture; these high school students spend their time drinking, rising and thinking what to do with the body left on the river bank. <br /> <br /> What will they do today? Will it be different? Some very important questions. There are some beautiful scenes with Keanu Reeves and the dysfunctional family in which he lives; his 11-year-old brother goes to waste; the mother does not know what to do when she drinks with her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This film was a little earlier than its time, because it addresses the problems of lower-class American society; these children had no way out; What is available to them in this dirty water city? In general, several interesting social comments are presented, and there are no solutions. 9/10.
