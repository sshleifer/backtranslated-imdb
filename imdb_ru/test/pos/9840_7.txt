The Mayor of Hell is reminiscent of the early Dead End Kids film, but with a much tougher edge and very few bright spots that preceded the first appearance of the Dead Enders by four years. James Cagney has a credit for opening the first screen, although technically the “mayor” of the movie title actually depicts Frankie Darro, one of several boys sent to the reforming school during the opening scenes. Darro's character is Jimmy Smith, a young strong friend who made friends with Patsy Gargan (Kagney), and who is elected to the position when Gargan risks being humanized in a state correctional institution. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers made many of these types of films, trying to provide a kind of conscience in an era that knew too well the consequences of crime and poverty. This film is rather rude, without apologies for ethnic stereotypes, as in the submissive pose of a black father in court or how a Jewish child controls a candy store in a school of reform. The rules in a correctional facility are simple enough - work hard and keep your mouth shut; fail, and you will answer personally to Warden Thompson (Dudley Diggs). <br /> <br /> Kagney’s role in this story seems somewhat ambiguous, since, although he makes serious efforts to improve conditions inside the correctional institution, he still nominally controls the criminal racket on the outside. Attempting the film to manipulate this dichotomy does not justify my assessment, the final is trying to wrap things in a neat package, as Gargan is waiting for the outcome of an almost deadly shooting at one of his minions. Not exactly the role modeling that can be found in such a film. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers will clear some elements of this story in a remake of 1938 called The School of Crime, in which Humphrey Bogart acts in the role of Cagney and Billy Helop as Frankie Darro. If you're not indifferent to Dead End Kids, you'll probably like the latest film, as it also offers familiar faces such as Leo Gorsy, Hunts Hall, Bobby Jordan and Gabriel Dell. However, this final is somewhat confused, since the guard Bogart is involved in hiding the prison breakthrough. Both films are of romantic interest for the main characters, in the film “Mayor” Madge Evans is a nurse inclined to reform, who falls in love with Cagney's character. <br /> <br /> It is curious that many of the early films of James Kagney are not commercially available, so you have to keep your eyes in view for viewing on Turner's Classic, or the source of the film from a private collector. Personally, I can't get enough of this kind of stuff, and I find intriguing points of interest in films of all genres from the thirties and forties.
