I think Samuel Goldwyn was trying to do two things in this film. The first film is a tribute to Yasha Heifetz, who is considered the best violin virtuoso of the last century. Second, by displaying the Dead End children with his film of the same name, and seeing how they sign with Warner Brothers, he tried to create a second gang of attractive hedgehogs. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film was good, there were no demands that the guys from this film retrain for another role. <br /> <br /> The gang leader is Gene Reynolds, who once played the violin, but now heads a street gang of dubious hedgehogs. His stepfather, Arthur Holl, breaks the violin that his late father gave to young Reynolds, and threatens to send him to school reform because of the weak protests of his mother, Marjorie Main. <br /> <br /> Young Reynolds stumbled upon a music school led by old music maestro Walter Brennan himself and his daughter Andrea Leeds. They accept it, but they have financial problems with many lenders led by Porter Hall. <br /> <br /> This film can basically be seen today, because it is a chance for classical music lovers to see and hear Yasha Kheifetz, who, when you are ready, will solve all the problems one way or another. Joel McCree is also present in this film, but has a rather colorless role as Andrea Leeds guy. <br /> <br /> In addition to the Haifetz film, the film does affect, albeit carefully, the subject of child abuse and battered spouses. Arthur Hole is a mean man, and Marjorie Mayne is a very battered wife. <br /> <br /> Children in the cast do well, Reynolds, Tommy Kelly, Terry Kilburn and a young girl named Jacqueline Nash who grew up and played the role of Gale Sherwood, Nelson Eddyâ€™s nightclub partner. She had a wonderful soprano even in childhood. <br /> <br /> But this is the Heifetz for which you see the show.
