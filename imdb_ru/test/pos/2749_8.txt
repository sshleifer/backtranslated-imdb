The central airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Bartelmess), who made one unsuccessful flight in more than 4000 hours and was forced to abandon commercial flights. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers), and both begin an act involving flight and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim hurts, his brother (Tom Brown) takes a moment to act and falls in love with his brother's girlfriend. From there, everything becomes exciting and terribly sad. <br /> <br /> This film is a preliminary code for several reasons. First, Jim and Jill achieved perfection in their relationship, not being married and not going to the wedding. Secondly, Eilers was shown in her underwear and in an absolutely limited scene when the Production Code entered into force. <br /> <br /> This film is not stingy with a dramatic love triangle and therefore ends in a bitter-sweet.
