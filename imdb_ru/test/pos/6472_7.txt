Knut Rockn led an extraordinary life, and his story is quite well told in Knut Rockne, all Americans. We follow Rockne's incredible journey from a young Norwegian boy to the legendary legend of American football. The film, shot in 1940, may at times seem outdated and sometimes completely obscene. And directors do sometimes put it a bit thick, because Rockney is portrayed vividly and with love. You can leave, thinking that Rokna needed to be promoted to the position of saint, although in reality he was just a football coach. But it cannot be denied that he had a great influence on the game of football, and also had a huge impact on the lives of many young people whom he coached. This film shows his great influence and gives an idea of ​​why he is so respected to this day. <br /> <br /> Playing Rockne, Pat O'Brien shows impressive results. Undoubtedly, this is the film of O'Brien, which he wears, and he makes the film and character his own. The real Rockne was known as a great inspirational figure, and the performance of O'Brien will make you understand why. The only chatter appears at the beginning of the film, when O'Brien is over forty, he plays Rockney college student at the age of twenty. All the cosmetics in the world was not going to make it believable, and the effect is quite dramatic. But when Rockney's character ages and begins his legendary coaching career, O'Brien is perfect for this role. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, one name jumps out, and this, of course, is Ronald Reagan, who plays the young, charismatic, but ultimately doomed football star George Gipp. In the big film scheme this is not a very big part, with Reagan appearing no more than 10-15 minutes. But the show became legendary thanks to Reagan's famous “Win ​​one for the Gipper” speech. This is a brilliantly played scene, full of emotions. Reagan may not have been on the screen for a very long time in this film, but he certainly had an extremely positive effect on the winning performance. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film provides a balance between football and life in general, and Roxney conducts excellent lessons for his young people in both areas. For football fans (and history buffs) there is a rare pleasure, as the actual archived footage from the Notre Dame games of the Rockne era are interspersed throughout the film. This is a rare opportunity to see how the game has evolved over the past six decades, and the opportunity to see how Rokna's legendary strategic innovations come to life. If you're a fan of Notre Dame, you will probably like the fact that Notre Dame Victory Mars provides a seemingly constant soundtrack to the film. If you're a Notre Dame hater ... well, then you probably don't watch this movie anyway. Knute Rockne All American is an inspirational, inspirational, emotional film. Perhaps a bit overly sentimental, but this is not so bad. This is a very nice movie that is worth watching.
