What exactly do people expect when they watch Al Adamson? Do they expect classic cinema, which will be incredible and incredible and will leave indelible memories for them? You would think so on some reviews. Al Adamson’s films are trashy, sloppy, and trashy, not much more, so if you dive into them, knowing that this already helps, and you don’t have to be taken for good, especially when they have so much unintended entertainment value. First of all, it starts with the clipping of the ultimate music from the Outer Limits, so you know that everything looks promising. This is a story about a cult of fools who lives in the hills, and, trying to raise a corpse, the leader suffers from a heart attack and goes to the hospital. Of course, nurse Sherry seeks to meet his needs and all that, and when surgery is required, she just hangs in the operating room when the guy leaves and his spirit invades it. And nurse Sherry is starting to change. She is no longer a beautiful nurse, she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects. There are a couple of little side stories that happen, like people trying to burn the body of a dead cult leader, and a blinded football star who became the object of love of one of Sherri's employees, who also accidentally indulge in voodoo. It's not bad if you're a fan of cult movies, but it can be bad if you're a Spider-Man fan because you don't like it. At times, this actually tends to “respectability” (for Adamson, in any case), but then “redeems”: in itself, some ridiculous event. If you like Adamson films and similar garbage, you might well like this, for everyone who is looking for a lost treasure, keep digging. 7 out of 10.
