“One True Thing” is a type of film in which viewers are inspired by very inspired performances. I do not necessarily declare that the film is uplifting, because it is not. In fact, the film is depressed. I'm trying to say that the film takes a long time to cause emotional tears in the audience present. <br /> <br /> I cried in One True Thing, enough to conclude that this is one of the most emotional moments. Powerful films of 1998. The characters were well cast. All performances are guaranteed by Oscar nominees, especially Meryl Streep, who very well portrays the dying Kate. One of her acting was enough to make the film outstanding for a recommendation and give you a new point of view on it. I also thought that Renee Zellweger had portrayed a realistic lonely free woman who should take care of her mother. Other actors, including William Hurt and Tom Everett Scott, were also great. The script of this film was really fantastic. It's quite funny how the concept of the film is connected with controversial events in my area. You see, I live not far from Lansing, Michigan, and now the big problem here is that the methods of the assistant to the suicide bomber Jack Kavorkian (sorry, if not), have just been outlawed. The public will vote on this issue in accordance with their beliefs in November. After watching The One True, it really changed my point of view on this topic, although I always believed in it. Without revealing the ending of the film, I’ll just say that suicide is a distant topic in this film, and I think it exactly fits into a great story. In general, this film does have a more emotional impact than Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, or any other tear film released in the last few years. I think this is because the main idea of ​​this film is that these things happened every day, so they are better for the audience. And indeed, that this could happen to you.
