Is torture right? Not. The answer is simple and absolutely without any qualifications. The reason, as the film showed, is the effect of torture on society. The values ​​that have fought hard in Western society for centuries of revolution and struggle are for all men and women to be able to live in a free and open society. One where people are treated equally and with respect to their fundamental rights as people. In order to protect this society, institutions have been created to fight misconduct openly, honestly, and honestly. These institutions have been adapted and honed through generations of hard work. It can be argued that this is the true basis of democracy, since they belong to all of us and allow us to be heard. If we allow undemocratic, inhuman acts to be committed on our behalf, if we divide our society into those who have rights and those who do not, we will destroy the work of our ancestors. Moreover, we are all implicated, all guilty and corrupted. Regardless of whether we are guilty or not, it does not matter. We are defined by our relationships and our reactions.
