When it comes to movies, I don’t easily distinguish between shit, pure shit and masterpieces. I believe that this film is an absolute masterpiece, and it is difficult for me to entertain me for more than 90 minutes. This film showed LESS than Mystic River and Harry Potter 3 combined, and I still managed to stay chained to my place. For me, it was a passion that Eric Boghosyan put into his speech. It is very difficult to carry out such a trick and get some positive effect from it. Bogosyan probably nailed one of the most difficult solo performances in modern cinema. I had no respect for Bogosyan until the end of the film. The whole monologue a few minutes before the implacable climax became a turning point, it was the key that turned me over. This man had reached such a low level that he knew that he could never recover from this. Corporate guys congratulated him on performance. His brilliant prose made even the worst in the cavalcade shake his head in awe. It made me realize that personal integrity and hypocrisy are irrelevant in the talk radio world, even in the corporate world. Stone may have put forward some over-liberal agenda, but this was an actual film and production that caught my attention. Oliver Stone is a petty master of the capricious. In the last third of the film there was probably the best lighting and cinematography that I saw in any movie. The stone skillfully makes the DJ booth feel like a five-seven cell in a nineteenth-century prison. Visually, it seems that Bogosyan’s only friend is black foam, which absorbs his usual vitriol. He speaks and he does not answer back. This is a sad metaphor, considering how he treats the people who gave him success. Stone and Bogosyan made a terrific film about a man who was trapped in both the prison of the walls and the prison of the self. This person is limited at will, and he can never avoid it. The scene that made me realize his riddle was when he did not want to return to his ex-wife. He preferred his own prison instead of peace outside. In every story there is a conflict, and it comes down to the simplest of all conflicts: man versus himself. Talk Radio presents this conflict in a smart, exciting and tricky way. There are no hidden messages in this film, and any astute viewer should expect developments. I just leaned back and let my mind understand this film, and I liked it. This is inexplicable, invisible, and will never receive proper recognition. Let's hope that this will continue, because the gems deserve to be found and then hidden again. It’s a gem because I found it in a DVD discount basket at my local Wal-Mart store. For $ 5.50, it was worth the half hour I spent trying to find it. I did, and I got more than my money's worth. This is one of the best films ever made, and there are ten reasons for it. Ten reasons give ten points. <br /> <br /> That's where my rant ends!
