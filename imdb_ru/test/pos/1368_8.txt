Dude, I can't believe the harsh and negative comments on this film in many ways. Well, this is not the hard work of cinematic art. But it is very funny and fun entertainment. For starters, the titular supernatural pumpkin-headed killer should be one of the most ridiculously stupid and not scary things ever stumble in front of a camera; it is similar to what you would see in the fourth carnival ghost. Secondly, the moderate blood is ridiculously false and inconclusive, with a definite highlight occurring when this annoyingly worried ultraconservative woman receives electric current from the toaster. In addition, there is always the welcome presence of the forever-beautiful Lynnie Quigley, who was remembered for having taken a good, long, completely free shower, which lasts two minutes. Surprisingly, we also have legends about the late Schlok John Carradine as the evil sorcerer and Cameron Mitchell as the lead horror series. In addition, the shouting queens of Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith have fleeting cameos. Leading children's actor Ryan Latshaw projects all the charm and acting ability of a musty old stump. Cute brunette Rachel Carter strips and shows off her cute small tits. Rough special effects are clearly not special. The account is appropriately overworked. Yet this film as a whole has some charmingly attractive appeal, which in turn makes this honey a really delightful crazy cry to watch.
