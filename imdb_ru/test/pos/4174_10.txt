What can I say about this film, which was not mentioned by all the other comments here, they pretty much summarize everything, people who love it, cherish it, people who hate it ... well, they hate it. This is the film equivalent of Marmite. <br /> <br /> I personally dedicated every second to his memory, he is cyclical, claustrophobic, introspective, magical and is considered one of the most unique films ever made. Despite what many have said, I believe that this is truly a cult film, it is a diamond in a diamond that is waiting to be discovered after it reveals its fantastic psychedelic images, and the incredible soundtrack will be unforgettable, which is an achievement in itself. One of my friends who watched him compared him more to a musical, and in many respects with those who do not fully appreciate the context in which this film is made, will probably get more benefit from it in order to see Kheda as such. <Br /> <br /> I always liked monkeys, especially the TV show, when it was repeated in the 80s. My mother recorded Head for me when she was shown on television late at night, because she knew that I liked them, I watched her the day after and she sat down in my memory until I could find a copy on DVD for about two decades later, what I would like now, this special edition, it would be interesting to get a more complete picture of the creation of this masterpiece. We can only hope.
