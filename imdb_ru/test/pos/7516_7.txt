George Scott played all his life in Paddy Chaiefsky's HOSPITAL, a very dark drama about an aging large city hospital and a middle-aged doctor on the verge of suicide. Together with Diana Rigg comes a free spirit who decides to save him from himself. Their dialogue crunches, and it is clear that they were made for each other from the very beginning. But will she save him? Their same-sex scene is both graphic and memorable due to its passion and rage. Meanwhile, the hospital is under siege by a group of agitators who do not want it to turn a convicted building into a cancer center. And the serial killer is in the hospital, specializing in doctors and nurses. The good part of the film, however, is directly focused on Scott. As it should be. What is the difference a few years ago when this film was made. The year 1962 gave us the PRESENTS, a fashionable, old-fashioned reworking of the DR. KILDARE with a scary game and cardboard lettering. Soon came 1971 and HOSPITAL. In less than 10 years. Hollywood did something right for a change. A visit to HOSPITAL today is a reminder of how many medical shows, such as ST. ELSEWHERE and SCRUBS owe this solid classic. And if HOSPITAL reminds you of the network, it should be. The same screenwriter.
