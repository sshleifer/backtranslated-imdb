I watched this movie at least ten times. I do not agree with the previous comments. This is the language in the movie about the cheeks, and some acting games are meant to be nonsense. Men like Paul Cawley are few, and women like Linda, unfortunately, are in the top ten. The sad thing is that although such relationships rarely lead to murder and fraud, this is quite a familiar scenario. The boy worships the girl, the girl does not know that he exists, they grow up, the man sees the woman he dreamed of and saves her. In the end, she never loved him - he came on time, and she used it. Thomas is superb as a know-it-all but adequate Paul. His image is sensitive and touching. Madsen is perfect as a femme fatale. What really touched me was the final scene. Paul says that in the end he cried, but not for Linda, his wife, but for an unknown girl he had watched from a distance so many years ago ... and he was thirsty ... and loved. And I loved the close-up of Thomas at the end.
