Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border (borders) to show how Bogota and Colombia really are! I am an American with a Colombian and French heritage who is tired of seeing Colombia perversely and ignorantly portrayed by Hollywood and others. <br /> <br /> How many of you know that Colombia is the second oldest uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the US), or that it has a live film and television industry (- not to mention Ugly Betty), that this is the capital , Bogota (population 9 million) - is it the “world capital of the book”, or is this the largest city theatrical festival in this beautiful city? I hope that Doug Liman, Simon Kinberg (-Mr. And Mrs. Smith), Robert Zemeckis, Diane Thomas (Romance Stone) will once visit Bogota to see how beautiful it really is, and focus on the cultural vitality and diversity of Bogota, instead short-sighted producers of films such as Mary, Full of Grace, from which Joshua Marston made a big profit (for this stunning film), without even thinking about ontological damage, his film will help perpetuate Colombia’s “unjustly tainted image”. /> <br /> - In any case, at least you will really like the Bluff! -Oh, and thanks IMDb for your invaluable / excellent work !!!
