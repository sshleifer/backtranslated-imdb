As indicated and indicated in many previous comments, this unique series has many excellent elements and ingredients. Indeed, more than 20 years after it was originally transmitted, he is still watched and watched again, and he has a huge number of fans in the world, which should indicate that the creators of this series undoubtedly understood something right. . <br /> <br /> The root of the brilliance and remarkable appeal of the series, however, is that it is based on a wonderfully written dialogue and timeless characters ?? all of which are brought to life by wonderful actors. Characters are wonderful, in particular, because of their complexity. Unlike many other adaptations of Robin Hood and many other films and TV productions in general, the good guys in this series often make mistakes and can see obvious flaws, and the villains, although advancing as evil and ruthless, can often be understood and even sometimes seem rather sympathetic . Does this turn Robin Sherwood into a story about multifaceted, REAL people? not good and bad people ?? something that greatly adds to its uniqueness and remarkable appeal. In addition, although this is a very exciting series with a lot of amazing tricks (which are wonderful in themselves, because it was done long before today's computer animation, green screens, etc. So, behind each of these endless guys falls). The castle walls, the horses and the lights, actually there is a real person who at some point fell from the castle or horse walls, or caught fire), there is always an amazing dialogue between the different characters in each episode. Ultimately, however, is it usually a series of "villains"? Nicholas Grace as Sheriff of Nottingham, Robert Addie as Sir Guy from Gisborne and Philip Jackson as Abbot Hugo de Reynaud ?? who get the best lines and who more than often steal the show with their arguments full of wit and uncertainty. "This is a wedding, not a holiday!" this is just one of their many eternal “pearls of wisdom” that seem to follow it all their lives :-). <br /> <br /> After 20 years, is it really hard to believe that Robin from Sherwood was originally made for television ?? and, apparently, not with a lot of money ?? to provide fleeting entertainment on a Saturday afternoon for small children in the UK. Filmed in beautiful places, with clever, amazing scenarios and featuring great tricks and fantastic actors ?? many of which give an insight into your life in this show ?? it seems more professional in many ways and has more production value than many Hollywood films.
