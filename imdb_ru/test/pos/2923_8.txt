Film historians talked a lot about ancient epics, which interested many directors from the very beginning of cinema. The pioneers of such epics, especially the biblical, were D. U. Griffith with his "mother of all epics" INTOLERANCE (1916) and Cecil B. DeMille with his talent for magnificent spectacles, costumes and luxurious scenes. Who can forget his TEN COMMANDMENTS (1923, 1956) or the SIGN of the Cross (1932)? However, here is another epic shot in the 1950s by director Michael Curtis and based on Micah Waltari's Egyptian novel. Michael Curtiz, already famous for his great classics CASABLANCA (1941), wonderfully manages to adapt his film to the audience of that time, to embody the most important ideas and facts from a fat novel and recreate the lifestyle of the Egyptians, who lived in one of the most amazing periods of the reign of Ahnaton. <br /> <br /> The first and most important fact for me in this film is the psychological development of the main character played by Edmund Purd. Sinuhe, brought up by his adoptive parents in a simple family, becomes a doctor. Throughout his life, he has not ceased to ask the question "why?" And in search of an answer. The alluring love he finds in the courtesan Nefer (Bella Darvi) leads him to financial and spiritual disaster. He has to correct mistakes with hard work in the House of Death and start building his reputation from scratch. First, he thinks that the only remedy is revenge. However, ultimately, he realizes that "an eye for an eye" is not a solution. Finally, in very strange circumstances, he is tempted to be a pharaoh. Nevertheless, there is one moment when he finds the answer to his questions that have affected him throughout his life ... The story of the main character, although based on the book, is so psychologically interesting that every unbiased person should consider this aspect in film. The psychological struggle of the protagonist intensifies from the times in which he lived, when, perhaps for the first time in this sense, the power of the sword collided with the power of thought. <br /> <br /> Curtis film also retains one rule that all films of his era followed: magnificent actors and gorgeous scenery. These are mainly British actors and actresses who give very good performances. How can you not mention the support of the ancient epic of Victor Mature. This time he is not Demetrius, Hannibal or Samson, but Horemheb is a fighter, lover, and finally a pharaoh. Gene Simmons appears in a very delicate role as Merit, a woman who has loved Sinuha all her life, but it was too late when he realized this. Peter Ustinov, probably the most famous for his magnificent performance in the role of Nero in QUO VADIS? three years earlier, did a great job as Capta, a friend of Xinuha. The film also plays two great actors, Gene Tierney and Michael Wilding. Tierney is excellent as cold, craving the power of Buketamon, sister of Pharaoh. Wilding amazingly acts as a "mad" Ahnatona. When I was in the Louvre in Paris and saw how the original face of Ahnaton was carved on the stone, he looked almost the same as the actor in the film. Bella Darvi, an actress born in Poland, is quite memorable as the wicked courtesan Nefer. And there is another actress who appears only in one scene, but which is hard to forget, Judith Evelyn in the role of Tay, the mother of Pharaoh. This voice, these eyes! <br /> <br /> The sets are great. The director recreated the most likely image of the temple of Aaton, the god whom the Egyptians worshiped during the time of Amenhotep IV. I also liked the scene of the first entrance of the pharaoh. What a glorious picture that remains forever in memory! However, there is another aspect to which I would like to draw the attention of all people interested in watching a movie. The Egyptian film is much like other epics, but it also stands out as a unique film. There are very few films that make such wonderful use of various curiosities, as in ancient times. There is a mention of iron used primarily by goethites. It is also the only film about ancient Egypt that speaks openly about the magnificent healing abilities of the Egyptians. This unforgettably shows the contrasts of lifestyles, especially the moment of death of a slave, whom no one cares about, accompanied by the announcement and, therefore, widespread mourning after the death of Pharaoh. Finally, the “Egyptian” reveals one historical fact: there were other nations besides the Jews (before Christ), where the spirit of God shone in some human hearts. But the only difference was that he did not survive as long as the Jews, because he did not have a solid foundation. The scene of the death of Achnaton gives you so much biblical and Christian values ​​that you might think that you are watching a religious film. <br /> <br /> Considering all the circumstances, I highly recommend the film by Michael Curtis. This is an excellent production on several levels: entertainment for epic fans, admiration for amazing performances for movie fans, a celebration of the soul for spiritual people. Finally, it is a beautiful story of unusual things that happened thirteen centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ.
