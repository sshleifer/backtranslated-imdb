Most films from Hollywood seem to follow one of several previously formulated and very predictable scenes. This film is not and is an excellent example of what I follow IFC. <br /> <br /> There is a boyfriend, Michael, and his girlfriend left him without words. He wants to know what happened. She is alright ? Can he say goodbye? It is possible to get some closure. He was unable to contact Grace and, trying to find her, made a film asking for your help. <br /> <br /> Michael believes that we may need a reason to help him, so he tells us his story, reliving his relationship with a friend (Nadia) to play the role of Grace (the girl who left) /> <br /> Rear view 20/20, and for Michael it is no different. Telling his story and getting feedback from his friends, he realizes his mistakes and how much he appreciates what he lost. Unfortunately, this is a lesson that we all had to learn (or need to learn), and it is easy to identify with it. This is what makes you want to hear more of Michaelâ€™s story and find out if he will find Grace.
