If you are one of those people who think that Lucio Fulci is all about blood, guts and zombies, you should watch this (and, by the way, also “Psychic”). Despite the fact that the film includes quite violent scenes of violence and a disturbing theme, this is not the main thing. This is really impressive, plot and character-driven murder mystery, which may well be the director's masterpiece. Here he proves that he is a true master, creating an unforgettable, exciting, but strikingly beautiful masterpiece, filled with creepy Catholic images and interesting social commentary. He also has a great cast, including the great Barbara Boucher, as well as Thomas Millan (from Beatrice Chenchi) and Irene Pappas in a small but important role. However, it was Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan (who also starred in the quaint “Lizard in the skin of a woman” Fulci), who steals the scene in the role of Madjara, giving an excellent presentation of a woman who is crazy about her superstitions, and her evil murder. heartbreaking. The second star of the film is the cinematography of Sergio D'Ophisi, which, along with the melancholic account of Morricone-esquire Riza Ortolani, helps to revive the "secluded Italian village with a dark secret." I have to admit, the thought that the dull head hitting the stones partly pushed me away, but, nevertheless, this certain Italian horror classic is a touching, sad and ultimately thoughtful work of genius. 10/10 for me. If you like this one, I recommend watching Alfred Soul's Alice, Sweet Alice, as they are somewhat similar and both are undervalued.
