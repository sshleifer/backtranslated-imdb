If you want to see Shakespeare's masterpiece in its entirety, I suggest you find this version of the BBC. In fact, it is four and a half hours, but Jacoby’s performance in the role of Hamlet and Patrick Stewart in the role of Claudius is worth the effort. <br /> <br /> It never ceases to amaze me how clear Hamlet is when you see it. in length and in the manner prescribed by the bard. Each version of the film "Hamlet" fumbled with its structure. Olivier focused on Hamlet's indecision, Gibson on his passions. Jacobi is capable of combining all these aspects of Hamlet’s character with the complete script of Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Why does Hamlet not kill Claudius immediately? Hamlet says: “I am very proud, vengeful, ambitious ...” Hamlet is extremely upset not only by the death of his father (and suspected murder) or his mother’s marriage with his uncle, but also mainly because Claudius usurped the throne belonging to Hamlet . He is angry with his mother because of his marriage to Claudia (marriages between royal relatives are not known for political reasons), but her marriage strengthened Claudius’s claim to the throne before he could return from Wittenburg to claim him for himself. So he can't do anything about it. And this is true even after he hears the vengeance of his father's ghost. He cannot just kill the king, otherwise he will lose the throne. He must "reveal" the secret of the king, and here is the tragedy! Currently, Hamlet successfully demonstrates Claudius’s guilt in public, he has the ability to kill him and does not. WHAT FOR? He wants it ALL! He wants revenge, the throne And the curse of the soul of Claudius in hell. Hamlet replays himself in the classic tragic form. His own HUBRIS - his destruction. He kills Polonius, thinking that this is Claudius, and the rest of the play is approaching the final death of Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Ophelia, Laertes, Gertrude, Claudius and Hamlet himself.
