Donkey Number Two is perhaps the funniest film of 2006, which beat Clerks II. This is one of the best sequels lately, in all respects beating "Jackass The Movie". Now this film may be the most fun, but it is also the most offensive, horrible and disgusting. You will feel sick several times throughout the film. I am absolutely serious when I say that you do not eat anything before watching or during this film, because there is a chance that he will literally come back to haunt you. Keep drinking to a minimum as well. You were warned, because, as the slogan says, it will force you to beg for mercy. <br /> <br /> Jackass number two follows the craziest of the popular shows Jackass, Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, Chris “Party Boy” Pontus, Preston Lacey, Eren McGee, Dave England, Brandon DiCamillo and Jason "We Man" Acuna (Chris "Sam Raab", Raab is absent), because they perform the most outrageous life - threatening and disgusting stunts you can imagine. I'm not going to tell what tricks are, but I’ll warn you that any scene with an animal will be disgusting or psychologically frightening, and that one cast (again, not to mention) will flirt with death several times in the film. <br /> <br /> What makes Jackass Number Two so interesting is not the stunts themselves, but how the actors react to them and perform them. Simply put, if they liked to do it and had a blast, you too (this applies to 99% of the tricks). All the tricks are very original, and 90% of them have never seen. You will witness several recycled ones, but they are intensifying. You wouldn’t have thought about directing the factors into such a film, but it is; Directing Jeff Tremayne makes the film much funnier because he provides guidance for the gang in their comedy time, which is just brilliant on his part. He could just sit and sleep during the shooting (in fact, you will see in the film that he slept during the shooting), but he went there and helped these crazy guys do the tricks as funny as he could. I give Mr. Tremayne two thumbs up for that. Another great thing about Jackass is his celebrity on celebrity cameos, and this time they included BMX legend Matt Hoffman, skateboard god Tony Hawk, director / actor Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers & Beerfest), actor Luke Wilson, star Miami Jason Taylor Dolphins and director / actor Mike Judge (Office Square). The scenes with Hoffman, Taylor and Chandrasekhar are some of the funniest in the film, as it’s even funnier to see these people in the role of the film. <br /> <br /> “Scum number two” is one of the most politically incorrect, morally humiliating and simply wrong movies of all time, if not the most. Despite this, it is so original and so fun that you do not care. You will suffocate, laugh so hard that you will cry, and jump from your seat, laughing throughout the film. Due to the obvious and potentially disturbing graphic content of this film, no one under 18 should watch this movie. You have been warned. I hope you enjoy Jackass Number Two as much as I do. <br /> <br /> 10/10 - spy
