I saw this movie when I was a kid, and I have been looking for it ever since. He stands there with “Hut in the Sky”, “Stormy Weather” and “Carmen Jones”, which you definitely need to see in films that demonstrate the amazing talent of African Americans. In the 60s, local TV channels in Los Angeles showed a movie of the week, and some radio stations showed the same movie for 5 days. Porgy and Bess were among them, and my whole family would have been there all 5 nights in front of the TV and only switched to commercials. South Pacific, Oklahoma and The Sound of Music - all this is a musical classic that you can buy at any video store. It would be a shame to allow this collection of some of the best talents America could offer to be forgotten or locked in storage. Please make the movie available to the public.
