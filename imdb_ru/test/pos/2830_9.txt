I would suggest that “Only the Valiant” is one of the most original and intriguing and in some sense strange films that Peck has ever made; bold, amazing and one of his few best westerns (no, of course, not western, but a military chronicle, which is sometimes better). This is a fairly low budget, but, oh, very original and bright. This is one of those pleasures that a true lover sometimes gets; films that no one else has told you that they exist. You say: “It sounds intriguing or interesting,” and it exceeds your expectations. <br /> <br /> In general, the script shows a level of maturity that is unusual for westerns, and he somehow reminded me of Koso, UNDER; it is also a direct, not senseless expectation. <br /> <br /> Peck looked as fresh as a young and tough, somewhat gloomy and steadfast officer; and there are a lot of unexpected touches, such as blonde kissing and flirting with the one she decided not to marry, perhaps her sense of justice and retribution ??. <br /> <br /> Even a genre ?? wise ONLY ?? it is much more than military history - it is also an action movie, a surprise film, a commando / action movie is the weirdest combo fantasy a group of soldiers in a special mission to counteract and stop a possible attack by the indigenous people — a crazy decision not to take all available troops to a place where these local people could be stopped, but only by a handful of people — and this plot never goes shitty like most would have done. Interest in people, people, their causes and actions never weakens. <br /> <br /> A proper word about Peck himself; he performs with brio, and although I usually find his famous films rather boring and boring, in such little walks I find intact the whole grim and even frightening glamor of Peck. He was an unusual star. <br /> <br /> I would love to recommend this unusual film.
