Bridges' drama about a reporter who discovers some flaws in the precautions taken at a nuclear power plant, is well-directed, and a rather interesting film from the late 1970s. This is not surprising, but it is solid, the acting is pretty good, especially Jack Lemmon, but Douglas and Fonda were good too. It was a pretty good script, and the Bridges guide was solid and appropriate. This is definitely not one of the best films of the 70s, but one of the best. Good early film by Michael Douglas and Lemmon in his prime
