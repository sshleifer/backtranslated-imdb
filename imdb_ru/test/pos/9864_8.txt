I'm a big fan of M. Lillard, that's why I watched this movie. Honestly, I doubt that if he had not been in the film, I would have enjoyed it so much or even watched it, but once I watched it and realized that the story was pretty decent. I must say a bad ending, but I foresaw it. This is a low-budget film, and some of the actors were not very good, but overall I appreciated this film 7/10. <br /> <br /> The surprise of what Lillard intended was what kept me really interested in this film. <br /> <br /> Good rental! <br /> <br /> 7/10
