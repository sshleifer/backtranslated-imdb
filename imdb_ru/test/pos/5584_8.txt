I saw this film in childhood and really want to see it again. did he survive? I completely exclude the 1980 version as fluff. I am sure that many do not consider it necessary to save these films. It is so unfortunate to discover the lost gem after he left. Young people today are not aware of the hallucinatory quality and the impact that a film in early youth can have on life in the future. This film "Blue Lagoon" had such an impact on me. How many of us wanted to be in a place remote from the fears and chaos of the modern world. It was an idyllic story about a boy and girl escaping to a tropical island. Of course, there are problems, but in the end they fall in love and give birth to a child. Life should be so simple and beautiful.
