Seriously, people need to lighten up and just admit that itâ€™s ridiculous, and this movie is pretty darn funny. Better than the first, and Knoxville really raised a couple for this film and did much more insane stunts than the first. If Ebert and Roper (not to mention that I'm their big fan) can see through the sheer idiocy of this film enough to give him two thumbs, then I think other people can. I was not sure what to expect from this, but I was amazed, and this is rare when the sequel is better than the original. This new, I believe, is superior to the first big time. so do what I did, just relax, try not to sweat in some moments and not laugh at your ass.
