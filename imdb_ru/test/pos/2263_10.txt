I first saw this film on Alaska Airlines flight, and since then I have seen it twice more. This is just - and simply - one of the best films in recent years. I found myself enjoying it after my first viewing, but a bit cloudy due to what happened. Seeing it again a few weeks later, everything fell into place. It did not bother, just deeply. In fact, the depth of the film can not be estimated for a long time. For example, it occurred to me only after the third viewing, that Sammy Davis Jr. (grandfather's dog) is more than just a pet - perhaps it replaces his dead wife. See how fiercely he protects her. There is an abundance of symbolism, and none of them are crazy or condescending, just real. Adventure in their journey keeps the storyline in constant motion, and even when they arrive, you are not sure if this was really the destination. As the movie continues, the adventure continues, and I felt that the destination was just a waypoint. The sound track is fun, breathtaking landscapes - and both are clearly eastern. I could continue to talk about deeper meanings in the film, but I'm not quite sure that I still found all the nuances. In addition, it is more fun to tease them yourself. Like any other film, “All Illuminated” turned out to be an excellent wine, which is sweetened with time. I highly recommend seeing it - twice.
