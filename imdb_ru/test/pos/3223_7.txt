Every time I watch this show, I just want to turn it off and curse the creators for spending my time, week after week. Dialogues, or rather, monologues, since everyone is simply chasing after nothing, just becoming so tedious. For example, yesterday's episode, which I watched, began with a seemingly endless chatter about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs) always manages to turn Gilmore's family dinner into total war. And it was just a few seconds or so. <br /> <br /> So it seems that every time there are many lines with absolutely zero content. The scripts they use should be huge. <br /> <br /> But sometimes something happens. The chatter ceases, and suddenly these wonderful quiet, emotional moments appear. For example, this week it was a Lorelai breaking with a real estate agent. I just thought it was the best TV I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Almost everything is worth it.
