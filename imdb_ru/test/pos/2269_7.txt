“Everything Is Illuminated” is a simplified interpretation of something more than half the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer. This version is more about changes in Eastern Europe from World War II to the end of the Cold War and how the younger generation treats this story as a family memory. <br /> <br /> Debut production director Liev Schreiber retained some of the novel's humorous and linguistic conflicts, mainly due to the wonderful Eugene Hutz as a frightened Ukrainian guide from the United States. He is so attractive that the film becomes more and more his odyssey to his country and his family when he comes from his comfortable environment in sophisticated Odessa in the heart of a cynical, isolated land that was plundered by conquerors through communists and now capitalists with Jews and non-Jews as detritus . No matter how ridiculous his initial scenes are, when he sets up his defiant bravura, we later feel his fish out of the dipping in his own country, when he tries to ask directions from the local needles. <br /> <br /> Schreiber uses Elijah Wood as an American tourist as a hard gear in visual protection because his character is less verbal than as one of the narrators in the book. He and Hatz are good at playing each other until a more sentimental conclusion appears in this streamlined plot. As soon as the grandfather's story takes over in the last quarter of the film, surprisingly and unpredictably adopted by Boris Leskin, the younger generation does not seem to be subject to any catharsis, as they simply put the closure in order. <br /> <br /> Schreiber does a wonderful job visualizing the human desire to document the story. One of his credit counselors, Professor Jaffa Eliah, and her style of remembering life before the Holocaust through artifacts clearly inspired the eye, and it is very powerful and effective. <br /> <br /> The Czech Republic is in favor of Ukraine and the design production staff were able to find memorable symbols of change in cities, towns and countryside, since now it’s mostly a road film, and the long driving scenes are a little slow. Schreiber retained some of the symbolism from the book, in particular, the moon and the river, but after cutting out parts of the book that explain them, they just look cute or ominous for the atmosphere and no longer represent time and fate. <br /> <br /> As W.C. Fields would have predicted a dog would steal most of his scenes for an easy laugh. In general, Schreiber is really sharper than a book. This is compellingly touching, especially for those who have not yet read the book, but are less morally and emotionally confused. <br /> <br /> The film is extremely inspired by its amazing soundtrack, which varies from the songs and instrumental compositions of the Gypsies Hatz. a group playing traditional melodies for modern tracks under Paul Kantelon's Klezmer fusion score. <br /> <br /> In itself, this is not a film about the Holocaust, but a kind of mirror image of the Train of Life, as memories of a time that is now full of meaning, but resonate more with those who have an emotional connection with this story. .
