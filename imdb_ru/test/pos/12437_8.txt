A clumsy mistake in the Ministry of Education leads to the fact that the Nutbourne Boys School has to share with the St Swithin school for girls. This confuses the respective principals of each school and leads to all sorts of chaotic events, but they are forced to enter into an uneasy alliance in the hope of avoiding serious trouble. <br /> <br /> The happiest days “Your Life” is based on the play of John Dayton in 1948, where Dayton wrote the role of the headmaster of Whitchurch specifically for Margaret Rutherford. Replaces George Howe from the play as the director of the Pond School, Alastair Sim, and here in the crown is the glory of this cinematic adaptation, Sim and Rutherford are absolutely wonderful, bouncing off each other to keep what is essentially a joke movie very interesting. The director of the gifted Frank Lunder and the producer of the equally clever Sidney Gilliat, “Happy Days of Your Life” is a typically British film, clearly preceding the franchise “St. Trinian ", entertains children with his high erratic heart-collision, while I tickle watching adults with his very audacious undercurrent. Fortunately, the chaotic ending holds together everything that was in front of him to leave this particular viewer with a smile as broad as the Nutborn railway station, 8/10 fun.
