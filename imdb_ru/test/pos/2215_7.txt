“Reception” is a wonderful drama, although they have some problems with the final. Lauren Ambrose plays Evie, who is trying to avoid college. To keep her overworked mother from noticing, she writes poems that everyone thinks her mentally retarded sister wrote. All actions are first-class, especially Loren Ambrose and Amy Madigan. They both put on great performances. The climax is also very powerful. There are only two bad parts. First is the character of Stuart Worthy, played by Christopher Lloyd. Its part is underdeveloped. Another weakness is the end. He walks in a circle, which I did not expect with a 84-minute run. In addition, the film is definitely worth watching.
