I decided to watch this film for one reason ... Samuel L. Jackson. I really like him. I didn’t see any previews or trailers for this missed film, so I went to it without any special expectations. <br /> <br /> Jackson did not become disillusioned with the role of Lazarus, the blues guy from Deep Happiness in the Deep South, and perhaps this was his most powerful performance in history, including the performance and performance of many great blues tunes. But the real surprise here was Christina Ricci, at best, a meaningless airy head in real life, which assumed the role of the sexually beaten city tramp Rey and made her a believable, almost even likeable character. Watching the non-sexual relationship between Lazar and Rey develop was amazing. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake, a pop star who has become an actor who needs to become, has to go back to the “wardrobe malfunctions” and play around the pop scene. His mostly forced performance distracted, at best, the real stories here. <br /> <br /> This film is rough, rough, and sometimes quite “in front of you”. Not everyone will like it. Those who do this will quickly move him to the top of the favorites list.
