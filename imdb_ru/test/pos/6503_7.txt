This film is mainly for those who are barely familiar with hip-hop, in particular the player, as was the case with the director before he started this film. It was great that he focused more on the Gulf than expected, because New York always gets all the credit, but because of the Gulf, K-Bert's adoration was a little out of control. This film did not bring anything new to me, but it changed my opinion in the sense that, delving into it, I was distracted from the prospect of making the tables different from a bona fide tool. This film should convince anyone that he is right there with viola and clavichord.
