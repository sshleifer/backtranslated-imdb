I think that just sums up this movie. Look and you will understand why. The game of the main character John Kim is very, very bad, and he has no charisma on the screen. This is very funny because of this thought, as was the end, where Kim beheaded the bad guy, despite the fact that he was unarmed and gave up. Brilliant!
