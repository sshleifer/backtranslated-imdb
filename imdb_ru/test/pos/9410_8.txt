Seeing this, not knowing all the hype around the main character, not even knowing that it is based on real events, I must say that I was impressed. “Murder in Greenwich” is a statement for a television film created for television above average - the acting is equally gorgeous, especially Christopher Meloni gives an outstanding performance, and teenage actors succeed in difficult roles. The idea of ​​a dead girl telling a film is a brilliant move that raises the film from just good to excellent. The screenplay is exemplary for what is essentially the film of the film of the week, and the cinema is beautiful.
