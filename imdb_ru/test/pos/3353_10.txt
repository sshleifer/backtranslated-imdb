This is what porn used to be, this is a real classic. I mean, this is a musical with a rating of x based on this book! This is a real storyline, and how many films with such a rating can boast of this? This refers to an exclusive short list of true pornographic classic films, including Debbie Does Dallas, Deep Throat, and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with “pornographic films” these days is that it's all about “pornographic” and not about “cinema”. Of course, Alice in Wonderland has graphic images of sex, but at the same time she tells a story. Not one of the typical plots “Oh, Mr. Policeman, do not write me a ticket,” it takes another step forward and makes it a musical! Awesome! If you want to see an example of "good" porn, this is one of the best.
