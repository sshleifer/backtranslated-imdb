Critics and viewers pretty much panicked this film, but I really didn’t think it was too bad! Even critics, with whom I usually agree, thought it was crap, and I usually despise PG-13 horror movies. Thus, this means one of two things: either (1) I am too easily satisfied, and my taste in the movie weakened over time, or (2) “When a stranger calls” is not as bad as it seems to be. Now, to be fair, some critics of the film are true - not so much character development, and not much has happened in the story. But people are living people, how much did you expect from a film about the pursuit of a nanny? Spare them! As a former nanny who watched this movie late in the evening with the lights off, I can safely say that the stalker dude was one terrible mofo! Who knows? I think these things just give me the will. <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit that I had fun watching it, and I don’t care how big the minority turns me on.
