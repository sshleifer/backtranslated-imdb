Everyone wants Duval and Jones back, come on! Viewers say that Zan and Urban are not so deep ... Puhlays! Were you so deep when you were young? This is the whole point: they have something to learn. Zahn and Urban remove the petty innocence, to which they were directed, and with an excellent desire to preserve the nuances of the contribution of Duvall and Jones to the characters. Zan is blatantly perfect as the early Gus, and Urban is finely perfect as the early Woodrow. What a courageous step should have been for them to take this position in the entertainment industry. They must have known that they would force everyone to fall upon them for the fact that they were not really favorite originals, but they clearly made every effort. I gave him 7, because editing in places was unstable, the time frame was sketchy, but it was nice to play. Val Kilmer was absolutely gorgeous. One more thing: I expect viewers to be more susceptible to the mysticism implied by the appearance of a jaguar and a blue-golden macaw, if more effort was put into how they look and are so easily accepted by characters.
