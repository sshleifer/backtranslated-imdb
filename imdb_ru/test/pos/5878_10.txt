While watching a mundane modern film (“Runaway Bride”) with my granddaughter (22 years old), she asked me: “Since you have watched movies since 1938, which film is the best in your life?” What a choice! It took me all summer to think and review some films before I made a decision. This is the "BEST YEAR OF OUR LIFE". There are no flaws in this movie. This is one film in which each of the minor characters plays a role in the dialogue. There is not a single part in the film that could be omitted. Binding a young girl with the absence of arms from her brothers, a man returning home to young adult children who grew up without him, and with different ideas, an image of a young man whose only responsibility was to make soda, which became the leader and was awarded medals for his actions. A woman who now has to adapt to her husband, whose life has been away from her for years. Awareness of people who were safe there, safe houses of victims, which ordinary people brought in their favor. Look into the life of love and life with a man without hands. Parents first look and react to new deformities of the son. A person is used to making a decision about life and death in an instant, returning to what needs to be done through the credit structure of a conservative bank. This is not a sympathetic, tearful, heart beat. THIS WAS A REAL LIFE! It could not be depicted otherwise. This, my friends, HOW IT WAS !! This can easily be considered a documentary. On this day of color film, please do not turn off the black and white image, because this is one of the best black and white filming, editing and directing you have ever seen. Casting was perfect. If I could, I would make it mandatory for anyone to take a story, film making, creative writing, sociology, family counseling, or psychology to view and tell about this magnificent example of the art of filmmakers.
