Finally, a film about gangsters, worthy of attention! <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tili should be nominated for the role of a cruel killer, a femme fatale! <br /> <br /> This film flies like a bird, just without stopping. Gangster mess! <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tili in this film is so beautiful and bad. <br /> <br /> I was shocked when I found out that Faye Dunaway is still alive! The actors in this film are so adapted to their roles. <br /> <br /> A true cool soundtrack goes around and you immerse yourself in the Spanish soul of this film. <br /> <br /> The story is original, deep and poetic. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of substance in this film, and it never rests. <br /> <br /> A gang of Spanish fire just ignites everything on the screen. <br /> <br /> Damien Chapa - the joy that you can watch, and the movie Star. <br /> <br /> Sit down and enjoy the ride.
