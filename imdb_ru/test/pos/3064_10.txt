Mel Brooks really surpassed himself with this funny position of the story of Robin Hood. The cast is perfect, and Cary Elvis does an excellent job with her role. In my personal opinion (besides being a fan of Cary Elvis), this film is the best and funniest film I've ever seen! You will laugh every time you see it!
