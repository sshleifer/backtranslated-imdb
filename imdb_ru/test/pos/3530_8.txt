September 29, 1990 was a small but important milestone in my assessment of horror films. It was the date when BBC1 broadcast (the only time I know) the super-creepy 1981 shocker Jeff Lieberman "Before Dawn," and it made a huge impression on me. After nearly twenty years, I am pleased to announce that I finally got my hands on a special edition of the Shriek Show / Media Blasters with two discs, and it is as creepy and alarming as I remember it, if not more. <br /> The plot, as usual for genre movies (and it was Lieberman's first film as a “director for hire”, although he at least removed all religious cult games with snake manipulators from the script)) a little thin - five pretty twenty of something (including Chris Lemmon, Jack's son, in a pair of uncomfortably hard white steps) venture into the thick forests of Oregon to make a place for camping and check out a piece of land that was bequeathed to one of their number. But just before dawn, it stands out from the crowd of imitators, because Lieberman is not wasting time, showing us how irresponsible things are on this particular part of the mountain, with a completely innocent spit and a drunken preacher's truck dropped from a hill and engulfed in flames within minutes of the movie’s beginning. . Young people come to the picture in a sharp Winnebago, Blondie's “Heart of Glass”, knocking on the soundtrack, and before you can say “Texas Chainsaw Massacre!” They beat an innocent deer with a front bumper, and they had the first taste of aggro from a heavy maniac responsible for the first disaster. Forester Roy (George Kennedy) warns them that if they move on, things may go wrong, but they will still continue the trip, refusing to give the preacher a lift, although he is understandably frightened and finally broke camp miles. from anywhere. It goes without saying that things are going down from here. <br /> <br /> Although this film lacks bloody horror and well-developed militants, for me there are moments when Lieberman allows his camera to zoom out, long and slow, from obviously harmless shots of funny kids wandering in the desert, or just allowing him some time to settle in dense imposing, dwarf forests. He makes Oregon's exteriors as ominous and ominous as Kubrick made the spacious interiors of the Overlook hotel at Shining, and Brad Fidel’s account (except for the horribly distorted racket that runs over the names) remains obsessive, emphasizing the slowly growing threat with subtlety and talent. There are many surprises along the way, a nod to “Liberation” with the discovery of the little girl from the wilderness and her bizarre, disturbing family, and a really strange murder technique, applied shortly before the end of the film. I won't spoil it for you. I already said enough. <br /> <br /> It’s quite difficult to understand why this underrated horror stone fell into cracks and became a cult object, not a breakthrough hit, but I hope it will be rediscovered and appreciated over the years. come — it must be so.
