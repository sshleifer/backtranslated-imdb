I had the pleasure of watching these two chairs from the (one of?) Executive Producer at the Atlantic Film Festival, which was interesting because he laughed at different times than the rest of us. <br /> <br /> Filmed in Atlantic Canada, the film tells of three teenage girls who, in one of the last years of their youth, devote much energy to sleeping with a married 30-year-old man, despite many protests. <br /> This is definitely worth seeing, but humor was a completely different demographic than the one I live in (man 18-25), so I rather shook my head from the tricks of the character than laughed. Despite this, the story is strong enough to sustain it, making it interesting, without much laughter.
