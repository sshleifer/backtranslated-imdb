“See other people” is a bold romantic comedy about a couple named Ed and Alice (Jay Mohr and Julianna Nicholson) who are engaged and are planning to get married soon. They live together, but both doubt their relationship. Alice realizes that in the past she had so little sex, that she could just marry Ed because she didn't feel anything else. Therefore, they agree to start fooling around with other people for a while in order to test their own relationships. <br /> <br /> The film balances the predictive question - too much attention is paid to “What if?” aspects of life, can it actually do the opposite and only make you feel more limited? When Ed begins having sex with a college student, he begins to become addicted and almost forget about Alice — when he realizes this, it scares him. <br /> <br /> I haven't heard anything about this movie beforehand, but I enjoyed it. This is not very well done and definitely has such a deliberately low-budget indie feeling - but it is much better than most of the mainstream romantic comedies today. <br /> <br /> Check it out if you get a chance.
