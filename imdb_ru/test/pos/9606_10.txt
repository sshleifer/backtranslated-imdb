I saw it back in '99, and I remember how I liked it. Until now, I remember parts of the film in my head, such as a slant feed. Unfortunately, since 99 - now I never could remember what it was called until I watched a film about the role of my uncle's friend and did not stumble upon it (he played Clive Kennard). Immediately after reading the description, I realized what it was. Having caught up with me, I was shocked to learn that he not only did not release a video or DVD, but also had to repeat it. This is a great shame, I ask you, at least, to repeat this excellent television film. Nick Hancock showed in this film that he can do more than just make a show with his character Mike Tonker. This is a movie that most football fans will love, and even those who are not too keen on sports will be able to enjoy this comedic dignity. Yes, this is a brief overview, but there is little to say, other than this underrated film that deserves a repetition or release on video / DVD, so ITV, I and other fans of this movie beg you. PLEASE READ ONE OF THIS!
