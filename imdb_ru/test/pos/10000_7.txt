The actor, directed by Bill Paxton, continues his promising debut Fragile in the Gothic style with this 1913 US Open family sports drama, where a young American caddy rises from his modest background to play against his British idol in what was called like "The best game ever." I am not a fan of golf, and these patchwork losers sports cost a dime (the latter is done to a grand effect with “Miracle” and “Cinderella Man”), but something like this film was exciting though. /> <br /> The film begins with some creative opening credits (imagine a disinfected version of the animated opening credits of Carnival and Rome), but slowly drags on for the first hour. As soon as the action moves to the US, open things catch on very well. Paxton does an excellent job with his work and demonstrates the ability to efficiently shoot a director's story (I really liked the montage of the film soaked in the rains on the second open day), which advances the story further or adds an unexpected psychological depth to the process. When the British Harry Vardon is pursued by the images of aristocrats in black suits and top hats, which in childhood destroyed his family cottage as a child, in order to make way for playing golf, some irrefutable development of character occurs. He also visually shows what happens in the heads of the players under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, lively animates here. We should also pay tribute to the designers of the scenery and the department of costumes for creating an attractive historical atmosphere of London and Boston in the early twentieth century. <br /> <br /> You know how this ends, not only because it is based on a true story, but also because films in this genre repeat the same template over and over again, but Paxton puts the show better than the average and possibly points to more talents behind the camera than ever before. Despite the formal nature, it is a good and easy film that deserves to find an audience.
