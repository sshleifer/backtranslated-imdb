I chose this film really for my husband, who works on the radio. I thought it would be more of a film that he would enjoy and tell too, although it was from the eighties, so it was a bit dated. This movie really appeals to you. Sometimes you just want to strangle the host, Barry. Sometimes you just want to send some fanatics who are calling to a real concentration camp. Sometimes you really feel sorry for Barry because he really became too big for his jeans, if you know what I mean. It was an encore on Drama channel - so I think this is a true story. If you really love drama, you will like it, even if you do not know all the details of the broadcast business. If you're a Alec Baldwin fan and watch this to see him, you shouldn't. His role is really a bit in this film.
