Despite the obvious structural similarities with the Simpsons - a loud fat dad, a housewife mom, three children, a pet, a typical country house, the family guy is actually functionally and stylistically opposed to the Simpsons. His avid use (and sometimes too much) of business cards in the cut has become his main seat since the first season. While some hit on the head (Ray Perlman and Beat Danny DeVito are very funny in the 5th season), others are less successful, looking far-fetched. And they can be annoying, especially when they are not promoting the storyline. (Jesus’s bits are completely unfriendly and offensive) <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Stewie and Brian Griffin makes it possible to get pure comedic gold so much that Chris and Meg only have time to fulfill the role of compulsory teenagers in your typical dysfunctional family. <br /> <br /> Still, the Stewie Griffin feature film: The Untold Story is terribly awful. Thank God, it went straight to DVD. <br /> <br /> Contrary to tedious comparisons with perennial Simpsons, Seth MacFarlane’s approach to “The Family Guy” is in fact very different - he is much more politically incorrect and, surprisingly, much more impudent. <br /> <br /> Creator Rena and Stimpy, John Cricfalusi, famously criticized the Family Guy for “extremely low” graphic standards in terms of cartoonists. I do not think it looks so bad, the detail and accuracy of some parodies are very successful. <br /> <br /> In general, a great series with a large bowl of chips, smothered in a ranch dressing and anecdotes.
