A touching film about a talented woman who fights society and love, which structurally underestimates her. These problems are finely solved and timeless, since many of the described difficulties between a man and a woman still exist in Dutch society today. This film is a tribute to all modern women, not dwelling on feminism. Not only the story is well told, but also great acting and scenery.
