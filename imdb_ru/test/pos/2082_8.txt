This is a great little movie, full of interesting characters and situations. Although he does not belong to the same class as some of the most famous films of his time, he is still extremely watchable and memorable. The scene when Zachary Scott, sitting on the bus, accidentally steals a pilot's pin from the lapel of his coat, thrown on the seat next to him, is amazing. This perfectly defines his character - a guy who is so low that he steals something invaluable for a war veteran to use as a support in his various charades. He easily lies, as the situation demands, and fascinates women in the house of Fenchurch with his irresistible charm and this murderous smile. <br /> <br /> I could not help wondering whether this film was used for the success of Mildred Pierce. Scott and Bruce Bennett united again, and Faye Emerson looks like Joan Crawford with her facial bone structure and large eyes. In addition, the character of Mona Freeman is not much different from the odious Veda in Mildred Pierce. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous comment that the end of the film was too commendable, with a convenient fall to the cliff for Ronnie Mason, the character of Zachary Scott. In addition, in one of the last scenes we see that Mona Freeman was reunited with her boyfriend, whom she previously despised, in favor of older, smoother Zechariah Scott. I think the script should have called her to punish her behavior and cruelty to her sister, instead of treating her like an ordinary teenage episode itelnye disadvantages in another pleasant and well-made film.
