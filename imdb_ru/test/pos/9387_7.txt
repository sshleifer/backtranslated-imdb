Death bed: a bed that eats. <br /> <br /> Judging by the title, you can guess what this film is about. And yet there are far more (pre-history) stories in this film than one might suspect. <br /> <br /> So, the main plot is about a bed in which there are people and food, but there are also several plots. I will not spoil them for you, but they are pleasant to the touch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the action in this film is very mediocre. The fact that in most of the dialogues the actors do not even speak does not really help to improve the quality of the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Because there is a lot of voice acting. The thoughts of the characters are also revealed to observers. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. <br /> <br /> Effects are in order. Of course, it would be much better if you compared it with today's films. But you really shouldn't; just judge the movie as it is and don't take it too seriously. You have to admit that the BED killer is pretty creative. If you are easily frightened, do not watch this movie. You may not want to sleep anymore ... <br /> <br /> Death Bed: The bed that eats is a strange gem of horror with a small budget, but I still recommend it to horror movie lovers. <Br /> <br /> In conclusion, I give this film 7 out of 10 stars for its creative history and unexpected twists.
