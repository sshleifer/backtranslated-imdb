Valley Girl is an exceptionally well-made film with a great cast. Despite the fact that the dialogue was a bit outdated, now that the film was released, it was very fashionable. To this day, I know many people (including teenagers) who cannot make a sentence without using the word "how." This is without a doubt the legacy that this film will leave. For this, like, the most excellent film was rated 8.
