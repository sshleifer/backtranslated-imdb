Of all the episodes of all TV shows, this one is the closest to the original Roddenberry principle. According to the STAR TRACK MADE book, in the guide of the author Roddenberry’s book to its story authors, he claims that any alien creature, no matter how disgusting, ugly, impossible to believe, softly or maliciously, MUST have some semblance of humanity that looks television. The public can empathize and / or relate to. “The Devil in the Dark” of KHORT, which most closely resembles a large clump of cow dung, is the mother who protects her children, these silicon ball nodules that the miners continue to find in the mine aisles and destroy, because they have no idea what they are! This is one of my favorite episodes for at least this!
