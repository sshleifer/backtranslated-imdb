Rarely do I get the opportunity to watch a film for IMDb, which is so closely connected with my life. However, as a person living with cerebral palsy (although less serious than Michael, one of the film’s main characters), I don’t want to give this film “free access” only because it touches a topic that is rarely addressed; and when it is usually treated with seriousness po-faced. I had some minor problems with the film; and I would like to appeal to them first of all, so that people understand that it is not my situation that has clouded my opinion about this wonderful film! <br /> <br /> * Parts of this, I felt, were shamelessly pleasant to the crowd, due to realism. If I had a pound for every time a friendly member of the public mentioned an electric wheelchair race, I would be much richer; but, personally speaking, this is more consistent with the public perception of how we cope with our shortcomings, rather than the reality of what is actually happening. It’s the same with spending time watching people with disabilities going to a pub — it doesn’t matter to those of us who actually do it as much as it can be wonderful for outsiders looking inward. . Michael; but I still think that he will concentrate more on enjoying this experience, rather than reflecting on what it means that he really was there in the first place. So the amount of time we spend having fun was too much. <br /> <br /> * I felt that the deadly nature of Rory's disease was brought to our attention too late; This means that it was simply used as a cheap sentimental device in order to stand between a pair, and not with something that everyone has known about all this time. <br /> <br /> To balance this criticism, I have to cook from a heap of praise as well. Although I thought that some of the scenes that show how they cope with ordinary life are overdone; the screenplay also took a chance in some tricky places that I would not have expected, and deserved great thanks for that. For example, raising the issue of love and relationships; and showing the daily apparatus, often used to help and support the lives of people with disabilities. In addition, despite the blunt emotional shock tactics of death that are hanging over us, the film as a whole is much less witty than anyone has the right to expect this kind of film. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker could and for many years performed variations on her role on autopilot; but Robertson and Makawa share a special interaction that should be noted. Inside, I work on wheels, which a group of people somewhere finally shot in a film that talks about the thirst for life of many people with disabilities.
