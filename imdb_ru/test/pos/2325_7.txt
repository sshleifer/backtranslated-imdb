This is a VERY underrated film, to say the least. As stated in previous posts, this movie has a rather free and unbelievable screenplay, but you find yourself saying: “Who cares?” Shooting milk (or putting the drink of your choice here) through the nose. This was really due to the rare combination of actors in sync. Although Kelsey Grammar is obviously a talented actor (the link is “Frasier”, this film), secondary actors / actresses play their roles quite well. It seemed to me interesting how they threw the role of how Duane Martin shot a “big game” for the Navy basketball team; if one of you is a basketball fan, you will remember Martin from “White people can't jump” and “Above the rim”, and you will find out that Martin spent a short time in the NBA with the Nix. It's nice how they added believable attributes of character, such as this one. Rob Schneider’s anal restrained nature was the perfect compensator for Grammar’s calm behavior. Lauren Holly played the “fearless sexpot with the brain” well enough that you want her to succeed. This is a movie that will make you laugh, even if you have seen it many times before ... the comic beats in this movie will definitely remain. I'm still laughing 12 years later. <br /> <br /> "Is this one of my chickens?" "Uh-uh ... no. It's a parrot .... from the Caribbean." "Well, don't let him fly away ... it's dinner." "Arrrrr ..... arr."
