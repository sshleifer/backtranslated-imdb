This is a great movie, all 3 were. The latter was not as good as the first 2, but it was made some time later and pulled a straw behind it. But you want to see, because it says the end of the story. Just not how we might think it should end. <br /> <br /> These films made me want to be there in all the difficulties, love, tears and laughter that people from this film threw. This is one of the few films that are good every time you watch it, no matter how many times it happens. <br /> <br /> There are some moments in the film that small children do not understand, and the old ones do not. old enough to watch. but it's a great movie, lasting over 20 years.
