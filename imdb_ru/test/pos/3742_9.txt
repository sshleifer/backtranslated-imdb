Since they first came to Outer Banks and made a film (I have lived here all my life), I have been waiting for the release of this film. I mean, I waited, waited and waited for this film for more than a year and a half, and it was worth it. <br /> <br /> The film is different from the book, but, in my opinion, it is still a beautiful part of the work, like the book. In both I cried, there were moments that tore me apart. I laughed and just smiled. This is a great movie with a great storyline. <br /> <br /> It's about never giving up on finding the one that will change you forever. One that will shape your soul and awaken you to a completely new outlook on life. <br /> <br /> I have to say that you can meet someone and make him change your life forever, which is what Gere's character did to Lane. I met the love of my life and was immediately completely fascinated by the fact that I never forgot it or how I was smitten with him until I met him again a year later. For me, I could relate to this film with all my heart. I think that if you listen and watch the film with all your heart and hope, you will understand what I am talking about. Itâ€™s never too late to find your true love, excellent work, Miss Lane and Mr. Gere!
