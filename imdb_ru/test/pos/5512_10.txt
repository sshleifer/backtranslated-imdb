Dee Snyder was inspired to create a two-part movie in a horror movie. In this film, he wrote / shot / produced and shot in detail the plots of these songs (Horror-terria, from TwistedSister / Stay Hungry). People said that he must have a sick mind to lay out something like that. I have not heard anyone comment on Stephen King, Wes Craven, Dean Kuntz or Alfred Hitchcock. The film tells about the modern psychotic, created by modern trends in society. Personally, I thought it was pretty well done from pure imagination and inspiration, also without the benefit of a large budget and interviews with actual victims / criminals. This movie is perfect if you want something to give you nightmares and make you cringe from the possible and the likely. IT COULD HAPPEN !!
