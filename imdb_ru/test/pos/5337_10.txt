Excellent animated film that really rises to the level of old works, such as "The Lion King". <br /> <br /> I went to see this with one of my best Belgian friends, who also watched the show on TV. I was lucky because I didnâ€™t know that people in Belgium knew about Wallace and Gromit. <br /> <br /> When it started and started this good old theme, I had memories of how I watched it when I was 5 years old. <br /> <br /> The humor itself was very funny. A few pleasant scenes in the style of a comedy series, a play on words or just a joke. The animation is not as impressive if you know the series, but it's still interesting to watch it, if you understand how to do it. <br /> <br /> My conclusion is: not only can it make me happy and entertained, but some humors can easily appeal to older people, so I say: go and see "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" as soon as You can.
