Even if he does not give more than the previous posts here (for example, very good Ruby Liang), I would like to share my own point of view. I hope my English is understandable. <br /> <br /> “A good journey” is a rhythmic, light, but deep presentation of the unorganized fall of the French, as well as courage and charm. All together in the brilliantly restored France of 1940 with many details (from a luxury hotel in Bordeaux, occupied by the government headquarters and attacked by a useless high-class Frenchman, to Parisian coffee near Le Pantheon / rue Mouffetard and automobiles of the 1930s) Gerard Depardieu and Ivan Attal are withdrawn brilliant taste of their leading roles;) Isabelle Adjani and Virgni Ledoyen are very trustworthy in their radically different roles, and Gregory Deranger makes a fascinating performance :) <br /> <br /> Much easier than average (for example, Canadian films from the time of the war, and focused on Bon Voyage civilians shows a lot of things about French issues (even a French guy like me), some of them are pretty deep.
