Crackerjack is a charts shot at the Australian suburban cityside club on the lawns. Mick Molloy plays a crook who has scored free parking at Cityside. When a club is forced to install poker machines in its premises, it needs to raise $ 8,000 to prevent this from happening. The club needs new members to help, and it is here that the character of Mick Mollui appears who is forced to ride to save the club. With many beginning and aging Australian actors, Crackerjack is a hidden gem. Be careful, although most of the jokes are for those who know how to get around lawns, but there are a lot of funny shows that provide comic relief. Sam Johnson and Judith Lucy play a major role. In general, the film should be recommended to people who play lawns or play them, but there are enough other materials for a fun game if you have a little understanding. If you like Australian humor, I suggest you bowling and go to the theater, because this is the best comedy of the year for balls on the lawn (also the only one).
