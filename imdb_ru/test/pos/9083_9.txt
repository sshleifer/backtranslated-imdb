This film is great from start to finish about a group of medical students who get together and literally kill each other, stopping their hearts, and then revive themselves. Then they explore what comes from the experience of "death." When one goes through this experience, they are haunted by their deepest fears, which seem to materialize as reality. It ranges from dead children with hockey sticks to dead fathers, who seem to be at the top. <br /> <br /> The cast is first-class, and Oliver Platt is hilarious in one of the best roles in his career. I'm not a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but even he does an excellent job with his work. This is a movie that I can watch again and again!
