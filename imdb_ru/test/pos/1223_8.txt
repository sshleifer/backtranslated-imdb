Well, unlike most people ... I entered this film, expecting it to not be so good, and it turned out to be amazing. Quite a cool story, I like the idea of ​​it, but what really made this film was the actors. they all did an incredible job and it was very cool to see Fishburn and Dillon working together. This is a movie in which you immediately think that you can predict what will happen, but this is not quite the way you predicted. I do not want to tell anything about this story, so I will not ... but I suggest giving it a chance. If you watched the Money Train movie and enjoyed it, you would love this movie. Maybe all Laurence Fishburne touches is gold?
