[Minor spoilers follow] <br /> <br /> Steve Allen suggested that many believe that actual humor about serious events may be acceptable based on the formula: Tragedy + Time = Comedy. 1939, before the German offensive on Poland was hardly an amusing period, and subsequent events, including a blitzkrieg (followed by a sitzkrieg) that led Germany to the Canal, led to a heroic evacuation to Dunkirk and gave the world a disgusting sight that lay on its back France, his honor before the Nazi conqueror. <br /> <br /> Things of romance, comedy and a big rush of serious drama? Yeah. Director Jean-Paul Rappenau, with a well-chosen and outstanding cast, creates in the Bon Voyage a series of events and scenes from history and imagination that are incredibly interesting. <br /> <br /> Vivian Danvers Isabelle Adjani with beautiful eyes and a graceful actress is the main actress of France when military clouds gather over Europe (which is a misuse of cliches, sorry). A veteran self-honored grasshopper with many affairs in her asset, her intrinsic motivation looks like this: â€œEverything that is good for Vivian is good for ... Vivian). After the premiere of her last film, after which the minister in the incompetent administration of Reynaud Jean-Etienne Beaufort (Gerard Depardieu in an unusual role for him) signals his interest in her, she goes home only to meet a tired former lover who does not understand the word "not". She decisively solves this problem, but then frantically and histrionically recruits another former cavalier, still stupefied Frederick (Gregory Derenger), to help deal with the disorder in her apartment. Once again emphasizing, almost like in the report of the public service, the importance of the work of the wipers puts Frederick in jail on the most serious charges. Fortunately, the separation of the Germans from their static positions forces them to massively transfer prisoners to the south of France, but our boy runs away, making his way there in private, and not under the care of the state. <br /> <br /> Panic and fear in France, when the Germans won, are well depicted, and a new turn comes to history. Who Frederik was supposed to meet with, except for the truly magnificent young researcher, Camilla (Virginie Ledouin), who accompanies the obligatory Jewish refugee scholar, Professor Kopolsky (Jean-Marc Stele). Kopolski has several bottles of "heavy water" that he needs to get to England. Of course, the Germans should not get hung up on this vital component, because you know that (this part - pure fiction - in France there was never heavy water in 1940 - only Perrier). And Camilla is so attractive and loyal. <br /> <br /> What's next? Peter Coyote as alleged French journalist Alex Winkler. Be aware of his name. He is indeed an officer in the Abwehr (German military intelligence: spy). And he, too, slept with Vivian (and wants to repeat their romance). Apparently, that type of Kopolski is the only large male character who does not want to do away with the actress. <br /> <br /> Next comes a series of adventures and setbacks that easily integrate into a very fast paced and enjoyable movie. In part, this is a tribute and a little deceiving "Casablanca." This is an amazingly funny movie (with the exception of heavy Nazi bits). <br /> <br /> Isabelle Adjani deserves praise for the best image that I saw in the years of a delightfully cute total narcissus with a few, if ever, redeeming traits. And Depardieu, the disloyal Raynaud and ready to jump off the ship and join the traitor Peten, is convincing as a man whose passion for Vivian exceeds his diluted sense of duty to the Republic. Being a man in power at a critical moment in French history, Beaufort is routinely disgusting. <br /> <br /> Not shown in many cinemas, Bon Voyage should soon appear for purchase or rent. Take a look! <br /> <br /> 9/10
