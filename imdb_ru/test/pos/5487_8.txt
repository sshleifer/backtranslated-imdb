When I worked at work, I remember how I had to deal with a very unpleasant client who insisted on doing everything on a personal basis. I told him things that my agency could not do, and he firmly believed that I personally was going to make him out of what rightfully belongs to him. I swear, but I thought about this guy as I watched John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood in their battle of minds. <br /> <br /> In The Line of Fire, Clint Eastwood plays a veteran secret service agent who was at work in Dallas when he was young when John F. Kennedy was killed. Since then, he doubted it, they drank, and his life was once a rude. Now he understands the details of the White House again, and when a housewife of a potential assassin submits an application for her tenant to the Secret Service, this is Eastwood and her partner Dylan McDermott, who are involved in this matter. <br /> <br /> But the killer is not an ordinary eccentric. He is a professional in his work, trained and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich received the deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. That year he lost to Tommy Lee Jones for Fugitive, and I'm not sure, but I thought Malkovich was better. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, Malkovich could have been better, but he saw Eastwood as an agent breaking into his apartment while he was working, he insisted that it all become personal. He calls Eastwood throughout the film and scoffs at him. And after a while, what Malkovich says and does makes Clint become really personal. <br /> <br /> The presidential murderers we had in our story were happy lovers, unless you believe in some conspiracy theories about some murders. A guy like Malkovich, a professional with real or imaginary discontent, is the most dangerous type of enemy. <br /> <br /> In the cast, Fred Dalton Thompson, who will be the head of the White House’s office (and be president in real life), René Rousseau as another agent who falls in love with Eastwood’s male charm, John Mahoney, should be noted the heads of the secret service, Gary Cole as the head of the secret services of the White House, Gregory-Alan Williams as another agent, and Jim Curly and Sally Hughes as president and first lady. <br /> <br /> But when Malkovich goes, he owns “In the line of fire”. The climax with him and Eastwood is unforgettable.
