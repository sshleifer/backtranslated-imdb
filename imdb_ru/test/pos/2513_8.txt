This is an unusual film because, although it was filmed by the film “The Twentieth Century”, because it is one of the few couples of Barbara Stanwyk and her future husband, Robert Taylor. Barbara Stenvik made films for many different studios (RKO, Paramount and Selznick) around the time she appeared in the film “This is my business”, but Taylor was a contract player for MGM, so he appeared in this film only because to Fox for rent ... something the studios sometimes did in this era. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting because many people from real life play roles in the film, although otherwise it’s just fiction. You will see actors playing William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt and Admiral Dewey. I can't remember a single movie with McKinley or Dewey as a character, although I remember Roosevelt from The Wind and the Lion and a couple of other films. Three cheers for the fact that in the film we see the "little president" as the main character! <br /> <br /> The film begins with McKinley taking the young lieutenant (Robert Taylor) aside and asking him to become a special agent for him - and not to tell anyone about it - even the secret service. This is because the president fears that someone in the agency instigates a gang that commits a long line of robberies - and all this is based on inside information. So Taylor (who is NOT known for his male roles - especially at this stage in his career) - impersonate a thug and find the gang responsible AND the inner man. <br /> <br /> However, there are two serious complications. First, while he may find gang members, one of the gang member's half-sisters is Stanvik. Taylor thinks he has fallen in love with her, but he must also fulfill his duty and hand them over to the authorities. Secondly, since McKinley is the only person who knows the truth, serious problems arise when McKinley is killed and Taylor is on death row for crimes !!! <br /> <br /> The film did a great job creating a story and putting it in a historical context. Although most people today don’t remember McKinley and don’t remember how he was killed, the film takes place in this interesting period of time. The acting is quite decent, as the stars are supported by Victor McLaglen and Brian Donlevi, although I have to admit that the role of Donlevi was rather boring and ordinary compared to many of his other film roles. In general, it is very interesting, well written and not too ridiculous in the romantic department. Nice walk for all.
