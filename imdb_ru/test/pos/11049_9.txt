And with these words, one of the great advertising campaigns in the movie ended. “Garbo Talks”, and she uttered these words in her first sound film, an adapted play by Eugene O'Neal “Anna Christie”. <br /> <br /> Unlike some other players and other studios, MGM very carefully selected the car for Greta Garbo. Many players who were good at the universal silent film would lose their careers because of the talk. Their heavy local accents interfered, some did not know English. <br /> <br /> It was not by chance that Anna Christie was chosen for Garbo. First, the author of one of the leading American playwrights was exactly the literary property that she liked. Secondly, since the main role was someone who was a Swede, the emphasis could be explained. Finally, many of the breaks from the early conversations were worked out, although Anna Christie still used title cards. <br /> <br /> As in most of O'Neill's works, there is little action in it, but a long and deep characteristic. The story takes place on the New York Embankment, where Garbo and Anna came to live with their father George Marion. Marion fled to the sea many years ago when Anna was a child, and Marion left her wife. Anne had to do everything possible to survive in the adult world, including prostitution. <br /> <br /> Marion, of course, is glad to see her, he even throws out Marie Dressler, the old coastal crown in which he lives. over the years to make room for his flesh and blood. Of course, both Marion and Garbo have problems adapting to each other, which is not easy when they give shelter to the sailor played by Charles Bickford, who is interested in Garbo. <br /> <br /> Marion reprises her role from the original Broadway production. The role of Anna on stage was performed by Pauline Lord. Anna Christie participated in 177 appearances in the 1921-22 season on Broadway. This is one of the most famous works of O'Neill, and it is often revived. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garbo’s performance with excellent diction was welcomed even with a Swedish accent, and her future in sound films was guaranteed. Greta Garbo was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, and the film also received nominations for the best director Clarence Brown and William Daniels for cinematography. Daniels should especially thank for the way he photographed the scenes on the waterfront. And Brown created the mood on the waterfront, where the film was shot. <br /> <br /> Eugene O'Neill's work is not subject to time, so Anna Christie, despite the many attributes of early sound films, does not occur like many films. the era of Garbo also shows that she mastered the subtleties necessary to work in a sound environment. Anna Christie is a classic, all around.
