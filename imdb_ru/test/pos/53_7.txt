This film was very good, not very, but very good. It is based on the play of one man by Ruben Santiago Hudson ... yes, he played most of the roles. On paper, it looks like a stunt cast. Yes, let's gather all the blacks in Hollywood and put them in one movie. Halle Berry even produced it. The only name I didn’t see was Oprah’s name, thank God, because it probably would have looked like the film The Distinguishing Feature. Instead, there was no sentimental confusion. It was touching, but not false, the characters came and went, with the exception of her husband, Pauline and the writer. The film revolved around the universe of nanny, Mrs. Bill Crosby and how she brought up the writer and took people. Being an exhausted New Yorker, when he said that he was taking sick and old people, and then we see them going to a mental hospital to pick up a man, I think it looks like the sister has Medicare fraud. Get hired and take Medicare / Caid checks But she doesn't explain to Lou Gosset that she just wants $ 25 a week and doesn't want money ahead of time. I think that this role was shot in the film only for us, the exhausted New Yorkers, so we know that it does not deceive the poor. (G) It was written by a resident of New York, so he knows the deal. (G) .. It almost seems angelic and looking through the eyes of little boys, I understand why. She is married to someone who is not very good, who is 17 years younger and fools her. Terrence Howard was born to play such roles. He was good, but I would like him to play something else. Markerson, who plays the nanny, is also very good. But for some reason the person who stood out to me was a small role of Jeffrey Wright. Where is this male Oscar? He has already won an Emmy and Tony. He was in the mine, and he stole the film. I didn't even know who he was in this movie. He is a chameleon is never the same. I have never seen him play a bad role. It was a 5-minute role, and he managed to make me laugh and cry. I rewound the scene several times ... once, because I didn't know who he was. His wife, Karman Edge, was excellent. I saw her in roles earlier than mostly thinking things. But she is so good here. I actually know people who behave just like her. So for me it was very real that Macy Gray, who had one of the biggest pieces, was also very good. I was very happy that they did not kill the nanny. I thought she was a little girl at the beginning of the movie. BUT she was able to go home and start her old routine care about people. These women are in our lives. People with whom we might know or even lived. Thank God for them, I don’t know how they do it all the time. I have a girlfriend who lost 2 children and experienced a lot of things, but whenever I feel selfish regret for myself, I call her and she always gives me a good mood. This film is a tribute to all these people. I would like them to tell us what happened to some of the characters, such as one armed man, the guy Pauline, played by one of my favorite actors on the HBO channel "Wire", the character Omar, Rosie Perez and the character Richard Lesbian and Delroy hand man, he was hypnotized in another small role.
