I would like Hollywood to shoot more films such as China Syndrome. Because this score is on every level. <br /> <br /> He has an intelligent, believable scenario. This shows you that not only nuclear energy itself, but also the money that is involved in it, create a danger. And the film also gives you a great backstage look at how television is created. <br /> <br /> This is a thriller: the first time I saw him, he held me right on the edge of the seat. And it's like a movie character: I really cared about the main characters. Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas, Wilford Brimley and, above all, Jack Lemmon are great.
