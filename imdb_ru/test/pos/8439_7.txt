It's a pretty good thriller at a nuclear power plant in southern California, directed by James Bridges and stars Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas Fonda plays a television reporter who wants to be an investigative journalist, but he is allowed to be only a television reporter. Douglas is an independent operator, and Lemmon is the head of the nuclear power plant. The Foundation and Douglas are sent to the routine work at a nuclear power plant, and almost an accident happens, and they get it all on tape. Everyone is trying to hide it, except for the Foundation and Douglas, so Douglas steals the film. Lemmon begins an investigation and discovers that the company cares more about profit than security at the factory. This is a good movie with a pretty good ending.
