The city in Japan is captured by a terribly cruel abstract form: a spiral. It becomes a topic in everything from animals to clouds and people, and distorts them mentally and literally. This film shows that this happens with several groups of people. Some obsession with demons is implied, but nothing is completely certain, except that the best choice is to break out of the ruse. The film progresses very well from normal life to abnormal events (giant snails and crazy people) to really supernatural (walking dead). <br /> <br /> As an exhausted American horror movie fan, it was just what I needed. Maybe it was just a new film from a different culture, but it looks like it had a very original progression, a set of characters, and the premise was definitely new. The Japanese might think that “forms of horror” (Uzumaki means “spiral”, as I was told) were already outdated, but I was pleased because I was used to making films about monsters / aliens / viruses / catastrophes / undead. In an American film, you know who will die (annoying / nasty / lustful / racist characters) and who will live (children / heroine / dogs / cats / likeable guy). This is not true in Japanese horror. It was not predictable how they would fight the evil or how it would end. In addition, he had a really new (but probably typically Japanese) color leached on an overcast day in the Pacific Northwest style, which was a new visual effect for me. The terrible moments were very creepy, relying on a little blood, but mostly just on incredibly exaggerated facial expressions (for example, the Ring) and body manipulations. It must be one of the great people, with such original ideas as the first "Nightmare on Elm Street" or "Night of the Living Dead".
