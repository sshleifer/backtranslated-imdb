When I saw this movie, I expected it to be a fun American movie made cheaply with terrifying actors. I was very surprised to find that I was completely wrong. The film tells about Bartel or B, who was rejected in all his colleges - the actor playing B is very natural and makes his character seem real - and decides to create a feigned school so that his parents stop chasing him. However, many people see his fake website and join. Feeling their sadness, B can not turn them off much to the chagrin of his best friend. College is an ideal place where you learn what you want or do nothing. The school faces opposition from the college itself, which ends up closing it. The film ends at a high level, and I recommend you watch it. He has flaws, but it's a good fun movie with a few unpredictable turns.
