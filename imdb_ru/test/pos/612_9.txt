Sadness and nostalgia permeate “Late Chrysanthemums,” a film by Japanese author Mikio Narus, released in 1954, currently undergoing a retrospective of his long-inaccessible films thanks to James Quandt from the Cinematheque Ontario and the Japanese Foundation. The Late Chrysanthemums, based on the three stories of Fumiko Hayashi, tell the story of four retired geishas, ​​who are now middle-aged, whose lives have become full of disappointments and regrets. The performance is equally outstanding, especially Haruko Sugimura, who starred in the films "Late Spring Ozu", "Floating Weeds" and "History of Tokyo" and others. Sugimura portrays Keen, a former geisha who has no children and lives only with her young maid who cannot speak. <br /> <br /> She became cynical about men and turned her attention to money, especially real estate speculation, and lent money to her friends, Nobu (Sadako Sawamura), Tamai (Tikako Hosokawa), and Tomi (Yuko Mochizuki), all ex geishas. Kin's friends live in poor circumstances and complain that Kin has become greedy, and Tomi spends a lot of time gambling, trying to make ends meet. Both Tom and Tamaye are losing their children. Son Tamae leaves to work in the coal mines in Hokkaido, and Tom's daughter decided to accept the marriage proposal from an elderly man. Both oppose changes in their circumstances, but accept it as inevitable. <br /> <br /> Two male friends visit Keen, Seki, a former lover with whom she once thought about double suicide, and Taba (Ken Uehara), another lover whom she looks forward to seeing again after many years . She is in a good mood, but soon she turns into an insult when she discovers that the two men are only interested in borrowing money. Naruse smoothly crosses the two extended sequences, since Kin opposes Taba, and Tomi and Tamai console each other because of the loss of their children. The dialogue is extremely natural, and the heroes are women of power who, although their future does not seem bright, refuse to see themselves simply as victims. Late chrysanthemums have a simplicity, humor and stoic perception of life, which is noticeable in Ozu films, and are a bitterly sweet reminder of the slow passage of time and comfort that memory and communication can bring.
