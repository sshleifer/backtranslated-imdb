This is the best comedy period. This is so underestimated! Smart witty humor, Great casting! Jerry Stiller is the jewel of the show, he is incredibly funny and unusual, just a comedic genius! Doug and Carrie have great chemistry! I still do not understand what the hype is when it comes to everyone. Everyone likes Raymond, he is REALLY overvalued by lame jokes, mostly forced humor and just not witty shows, I can't remember the laughter in more than 1 episode. "King of Queens" is a rare comedy that has all the necessary ingredients to cause a serious stomach laugh, usually caused by Arthur Spooner. I think the time has come for this comedy to get the hype it deserves, not the lame Raymond & CO.
