I thought it was the most interesting film that JCVD ​​made in a very long time. I liked his character, and all this with the rabbit set a different tone for this film. IMHO, JCDV can really do something further. A bit more lightheadedness, some obvious homage to other films, mixed with some great fights ... I would like to see more of this style of film making from it. One of the other authors thought that the bar scene was a breakdown of despair. I immediately saw the connection with R. Rodriguez, but I thought that she was very clever and made me want to watch the movie again to find more subtle replicas from other films. JCVD is swinging !! <br /> <br /> Other after reading other comments: <br /> <br /> There is no music in the battle with dungeons? At first I didn’t like it either, but then I thought it was interesting, because it knocked me a little off balance, giving us something we didn’t expect. Made so that it seems more real. <br /> <br /> I also always laugh when directors, like two-year-olds, cry that their film is "stolen" from the studio. Directors pay for work. Studio is the boss and they want the product they want. Very few directors have an absolute final version of the film. In this case, JCVD ​​is a talent, and the only reason someone watches this movie. I'm sure he got the movie he was pleased with. I have a relative working at the post office who knew a little about history. Presumably, the director worked on the film and shot it. Everyone who saw it said it was a disaster ... then JCVD ​​and the studio edited the film. It happens all the time. He also saw the final version (which, he claims, he did not see), and his “delicate genius” ego was severely hurt because they hated his delivered fragment. If this director were smart, he would have to take responsibility for this, since that would be his best.
