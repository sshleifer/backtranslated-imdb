In the 1970s, there was a rise and fall in what we began to call “Blacksploitization”. The term is a reference to the kind of wide coverage, not the real genre of the film. In short, any comedy, drama, adventure, western or urban police and robbers shoot at them, which are so designed and played out to appeal to the numerous urban blacks of the mid-20th century. It really could cover the widest type of films, if only they were inclined towards the black population in the city center. <br /> <br /> It seems that the idea of ​​producing these films was of particular interest to black Americans. its origin is connected with the release of 100 rifles at Easter (Marvin Schwartz Prod./20th Century-Fox, 1969). In it, the former Jim Brown, former American football player of Syracuse University and several times fully defender of “Cleveland Brown”, participated in one role. Having already appeared in a number of films, such as, for example, RIO CONCHOS (1964), DIRTY DOZEN (1967), (ICE STTION ZEBRA (1968) *, etc.), He began to give more meaning to studio costumes. “That Jim was a hot property. <br /> <br /> Now these 100 rifles bring a record number of black patrons to the central business districts of big cities on Easter Sunday to see Mr. Brown. Why not start shooting more of these adventure epics and other types of films with lots of black players and stars? Why not. ** So, we saw a series of “Policemen and robbers”, “Indecent private detective films”, “Comedy films” - everything goes along the way. in the end we got a few more family-oriented, more attractive films. Viewers of the film were considered SOUNDER (1972), THE TAKE (1974), CONRACK (1974) and, ultimately, CLAUDINE (1974). <br /> <br /> In Claudine we find neither stigma nor simple classification as “black booty”, since this story is universal and could easily be made as a story about people New York, anywhere, and not only in the 1970s in the USA. <br /> <br /> This story was written about ONE Mother, Claudine (Diane Carroll), who tried her best to save the family after ".... two marriages and two almost marriages." This is far from Harlem style. The problems faced by ordinary citizens of our country, are faced and investigated under the old sociological microscope. <br /> <br /> But we also see Claudine’s psychological and physical needs as a woman. For "A woman needs a man, and a man should have her soul mate," *** and we recognize this moment. (This is the SEX we are talking about, Schultz!) Claudine meets with a very courageous, broad-shouldered, athletic type in The Garbageman, Ruppert B. Marshall (James Earl Jones), and they go on a date. /> <br /> The great welfare state intervenes with the couple, as Miss Teybak (Eliza Loti), who works on the Claudine welfare case, looks after the loose man who suddenly pays so much attention to the Claudine family. <br /> <br /> After the humiliating experience of auditing the Welfare Bureau and “deductions”, which would be the norm for a family, they decided to get married with or without the blessing of Big Brother. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the eldest son Claudine was involved in some sort of loud conversation, but little of a group of black activists involved. But, with the help of Ruppert, he and they all go through this to AOK. <br /> <br /> It all ends with a happy, optimistic and hopeful note. We know that this may not be entirely “... happily ever after!”, But rather, all together! If there is one criticism that we have to state, this is the fact that sometimes in such a film a false impression extends to most of the urban blacks. In other words, the obvious implied myth that all whites are wealthy does not have a single species of its own, ever in need of help, without work or suffering from any disabilities. <br /> <br /> Well guys, it's just that true! NOTE: * At some point, Jim Brown's career was a real blow to a strong action movie. He was even bullied as "... Black John Wayne." NOTE: ** The idea of ​​producing films with completely black casts, shot for consumption completely black, was not new. In the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, we saw the productions of people like Noble Johnson, Spencer Williams, Jr., and Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> NOTE: *** This is “with time”, you know, Schulz, this is from CASABLANCA (Warner Brothers, 1942).
