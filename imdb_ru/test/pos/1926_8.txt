"Ideas are dangerous." The comment of one interlocutor. <br /> <br /> DVD rating: B + / 4 out of 5/8 out of 10 / Worth the time. <br /> <br /> Great story for adult / or young boatmen, but not for children. None of these stupid violent crimes are so often mistaken by Hollywood as “quality work.” And it can be used as an educational film about what is the right preparation for boating or not, before “sailing the seven seas”. The film begins rather slowly to develop the plot, as most documentaries do, but when it draws the viewer into the saga, emotions begin to seep through your head! Emotions include anger, sadness and disbelief. Epoch: Late 1960s. <br /> <br /> Sailing around the world is dangerous, which is not surprising. What is surprising is that all the turns that the audience does not expect. This is not your average group of guys in the race! Each boat was different, as allowed by the rules of the race. Each solo sailor had different levels of ability permitted by the rules of the race. Among them were well-known sailors and a few not very famous ones. One was considered a mysterious man, because no one seemed to know anything about his abilities at all. Each boat was allowed to set off on its own accord as long as everyone was in the process by a certain date. And that was, of course, before the advent of modern electronics, which would allow yachtsmen to communicate with the coast about violent storms, etc. <br /> <br /> Current video and audio recordings alternate with interviews of family members and other parties involved. The mood of the interviewees is always gloomy, despite past years. <br /> <br /> The main character, Don, is in the center of attention and how his journey is connected with those whom he not only wanted to beat, but also due to the circumstances of his own creation, had to win. He had to win. The story told how this circumstance influenced his life, when for many years he alone on the water moved to the southwest across the Atlantic Ocean. <br /> <br /> Don't miss the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the “Features” section of the DVD as soon as the movie is finished. The whole saga is not fully understood without viewing the “bonuses”. <br /> <br /> In the end, when you watch everything on a DVD, you will most likely just shake your head and exclaim, “Wow.” And keep in mind that this is why the story has been alive for the last 40 years. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: DO NOT PROBLEM watch the “Special Functions” section of the DVD when the movie is finished. One sailor, who went back to England after circumnavigating the globe, decided on the fly that, no, he was going to again, and the film was recording his wife’s opinion about this decision. The opposite story unfolds when another sailor wants the race to allow the two on board so that he can take his wife along, and their photographs show a very warm union between them. The interview with the former paratrooper Burley, who actually TALKED on a boat across the Atlantic with his friend before the single-boat race, was incredibly funny because he described that he didn’t even know how to swim and who thought that with him, were "normal." 'Too many people think that swimming on the high seas can be a romantic adventure without incident. Don't be alone!
