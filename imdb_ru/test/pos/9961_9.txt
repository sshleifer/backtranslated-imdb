The Merchant of Venice is a fantastic film. This is very true for the original Shakespeare play. If you saw Jeremy Irons in Casanova and you enjoyed his performance, then this film is for you! If you saw Joseph Fiennes in Shakespeare in Love and you enjoyed his performance, this is the film for you! If you saw Al Pacino in Donnie Brasco and you enjoyed his performance, then this movie is for you! This is a very nice movie, and if you are studying Shakespeare, like me, this is a great movie worth watching !! The only problem with this film is that you cannot let it see, because it has a little nudity in it. But other than that, this is a really good movie!
