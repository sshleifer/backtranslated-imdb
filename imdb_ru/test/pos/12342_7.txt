This is a good horror film of the early 80s, in which a young girl (Meg Tilly) wants to throw off her image of the “good two shoes” and becomes part of a gang of girls named Sisters. Their initiation for her is to spend the night in a mausoleum. It is a pity that the mausoleum is the "last" resting place of some psycho-Russian psychic, and he is not completely dead. It seems that this guy was found in his apartment with a lot of things attached to the walls after his telekinetic practice, plus a bunch of young dead girls found in the closet. All the evidence that hiking can be dangerous, so listen to the girls. The man’s daughter (Reimar) is rather upset because of the death of her father and is confronted with a man who said that he knew Reimar and gave the recording to listen. Her hubby (Adam West, celebrity Batman) is ready to laugh and laugh, and nothing more. But it seems that, perhaps, daughter Reymar also has some abilities that she does not realize. Anyway, having left their unhappy promise in the mausoleum, the other Sisters leave to take things (for example, masks, sheets, etc.) to go back and scare her to shit, but few people suspect what is happening and get more than scared shit out of them. Indeed, even after his death, Reimar seems to be a busy guy, and he reanimates many corpses for entertainment. And it may seem that he has a thing for a prison bait. In general, this is an acceptable horror, nothing special, but not terrible. The Media Blasters DVD also contains a different version of the film, which is a draft, I think, I only watched it a bit, so I don’t know how much it differs from the theatrical release, but from what I saw, I think this is a Presentation " Warts and all. " 7 out of 10.
