This is a very noisy episode. It all starts with Jim returning from a weekend trip with a new girl, recently divorced Karen Mills (Pat Delaney - John Houston's sister-in-law, who knew something about the film noir) and her daughter. When they arrive, Karen enters the house, while Jim picks up her daughter from the back seat and carries her into her room. He then discovers that Karen has disappeared without a trace. Of course, he calls Dennis, and when the police arrive, they see no signs of Karen, but they find her neighbor killed in the bushes. Of course, this makes Jim an immediate suspect. <br /> <br /> This is a big little mystery, and the first half of the story shows Rocky, who asks Jim to repeat the story again. Rocky suggests that Jim, telling him a story, may recall a small detail that he did not consider important at the time, but now may lead to a clue as to what happened. This is a really well-written scene that completes the transition of the character Rocky from the griffer to the interested parent. It also largely shows that Rocky is not just some kind of ignorant old man. As he says: “Come to me, because I am your father. And I'm smarter than you! ”This is one of those times when we see where Jim got his brains. <br /> <br /> In this episode also appeared beauty Lara Parker, who played Angelica in the TV series "Dark Shadows" and continued to play Laura. Banner, Bruce's wife in the Incredible Hulk series a few years later. Here she looks amazing. <br /> <br /> This episode also marks the first mention of the criminal family Minett, a name that will appear in the Rockford files almost every time they need a family of bandits. This time Vincent Minett, whom Rockford helps to delay. <br /> <br /> Lt. Dil (Tom Atkins) first appears in the series, and Dennis is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant who participated in previous episodes of police Sargent. I think they decided that it would be better if Dennis were less influential and added a conflict between Jim and the police. Honestly, they were right, although I prefer Lt. Chapman to Lt. Dil. <br /> <br /> In this episode, not so much of Rockford’s typical humor, but a good mystery with a big heart.
