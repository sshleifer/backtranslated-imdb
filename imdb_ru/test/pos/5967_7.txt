I missed the beginning of the movie. I entered when the partisans were at the farm. I can honestly say that it was terrible. The moral consequences are staggering. <br /> <br /> My fear of pain and torture does not allow me to see myself differently than cowardly. I see a capacity similar to Christ, which was portrayed by a bold patriot, and I can only pray that I have or would have moral courage to follow his example. <br /> <br /> I see that the main theme of the film is to show the weakness / strength of the tortured, but what a grim decision one has to face. And all because the soul of a person can be distorted in such a way that the pain and suffering caused to other people, in some way bring satisfaction. Be it mental or physical. <br /> <br /> I found the movie very defiant.
