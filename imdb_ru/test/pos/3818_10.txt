It makes no sense to compare this with the original series. Although they differ from each other in appearance and content, they are true to the original idea. That is a series of anthologies SF / horror. Because of indifferent planning in Australia, I managed to catch only a small number of episodes scattered throughout the first few seasons. The very first episode really made me wince (nightmares at my age ...!), But many others failed; as a rule, when stories moved to the realms of horror and left SF. I only hope that the DVDs will reach us in the end.
