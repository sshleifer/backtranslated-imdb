But George and Gracie are not among them. The movie is funny, and the scene of the billiard table with WC Fields should be one of the funniest I've ever seen, but Gracie and George are more annoying in their roles than comedic, partly due to the lack of script and partly due to their interpretation. . I gave him 7 out of 10 for the rest of the composition, WC is the treasure of comedy time and energy in it.
