This is one of Stan Laurelâ€™s best solo comedies until 1927 with Oliver Hardy. Laurel is a very good actor in a film, and gives a good comedy. The best scene in the film is when Stan dances with May Laurel (his real wife in common law) at Espanol Cafe. Stan does silly funny dances when you don't hear the music. I recommend this to any Stan Laurel fan.
