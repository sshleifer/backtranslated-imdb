I saw this film in 2005 at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. I suggested that if Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank participate in it, it should be at least worthy. Well, after a kind of slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite pleased with the final product. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that English with Africa and Spit (?) With the accent of some of the actors was quite difficult to understand, but I liked watching “Ned Devin's Awakening”, “Trainspotting” or any other film with actors with a strong accent, which I set up in about 15 minutes. And I tried to understand why Hilary Swank should have been a South African and sounded like she was trying to put an accent, but sounded very American ... as if she was weakly trying put an accent. But later in the film reveals more and more about her character This is how she moved to the United States when she was a teenager, and you begin to understand how she could lose some or most of her accent. So it became clear that only a few words could have Africanistic shade. <br /> <br /> I know that using the film as a teaching tool is a bit weak, but one of the remarkable sides of this film was that it was interesting to see the truth of reconciliation trial. I heard about the T & R process in South Africa after the fall of apartheid, but I really didn’t know how it worked. <br /> <br /> The final verdict is that although some of the scenes seemed a bit Coined, it was a generally very strong film. The final sequence, where the "truth" comes out, was a strong end for which each film hopes. Anyone who is not indifferent to what is happening outside their borders should see a definite thing.
