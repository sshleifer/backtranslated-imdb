Another classic performance by Maniratnam and his team. They can be proud to show this film at all film festivals, because it has everything that is needed to call it "the classic of all times." The war and its aftermath in Sri Lanka in the eyes of a ten-year-old girl is a film about everyone, but the scenes and circumstances will certainly not be the ones you expect. Madhavan is not surprising that he is one of the best actors in the country who can always add beauty and a unique personality to the role he plays, and he needs real courage to become a father for three children when he is considered a dream boy with a glamorous personality in industry. AR Rahman music makes the film special for those who love tunes. Among other things, the story and the way of its story make it the best film of late.
