This is one of the best shorts Stooges. It was the only one of their shorts who was nominated for an Oscar. In this short story, Stoja play doctors who, as usual, bring trouble. This short has non-stop jokes, puns and jokes. The part at the end where the puppets break the car into pieces. It is definitely a classic. I highly recommend this short top three.
