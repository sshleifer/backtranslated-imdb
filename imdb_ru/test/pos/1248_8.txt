hello, looking for a movie for a family to watch on friday night? Can't find what you are looking for? I thought it was an extremely nice movie. Good for the whole family. I found that he had a surprisingly rare combination of the fact that he is attractive for both adults and children. It was great, if not more. The game of Bruce Willis was top notch, there was a lot of humor in it and in general a great movie. In my opinion, this is a movie that is a must see. And I don't think that in many films, believe me, when I say that you need a lot for a film, I think so. It is clear that Bruce Willis did a great job to make this film. Great story, good acting and, in general, a very nice movie.
