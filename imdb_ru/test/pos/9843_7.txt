James Yankee (The Yankee Doodle Dandy Boy) was just starting his career and was able to act as a gangster, as well as a social worker in the Boys Reform School, run by corrupt politicians. Prisoner reforming schools are minors from dysfunctional families from the streets of New York, such as "Children from the East Side" who were poor and did not care during the Great Depression. In the final scenes, students in the reform school are testing with flaming torches and a shed, which is set on fire and made a big jump by a corrupt warden. I noticed that they were the first to let the horses out of the shed. This film is not shown very often, and I really can understand WHY!
