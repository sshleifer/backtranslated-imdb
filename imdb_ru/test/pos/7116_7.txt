The House of Dracula works from the same basic premise as the House of Frankenstein a year earlier; namely, the three most famous monster Universal; Dracula, the Frankenstein monster and the Wolfman appear in the film together. Naturally, the film is rather dirty, but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough so that the film’s sixty-seven minutes will not become boring. Obviously, the idea to make another monstrous wort occurred to the writer even before the real story appeared, because the yarn we are given is not entirely without holes. In the story, Count Dracula comes to the house of Dr. Edelman asking him to cure his vampirism. Then what can only be described as a coincidence sees Lawrence Talbot, known as the Wolfman, asking to be cured of his illness! It turns out that Dracula is searching for Edelman's daughter, but Talbot is really serious. When it turns out that he cannot be stopped by turning into a wolf, the Wolfman rushes into the sea ... where he eventually finds a Frankenstein monster. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is not as good as the previous House of Frankenstein. The film of 1944 collected its plot better than this recording in the series, because the plot here does not give equal time to each universal monster. Dracula’s plot is at first the largest, but it soon disappears to surface at the end. The Wolfman is the star of the show, but his story never develops, and, in fact, this is just another version of the story in which he always finds himself. Frankenstein's monster is given the coldest hand because it appears in the film simply as an afterthought and an obvious excuse for all three monsters to appear in the film. The story of the doctor who links all three together is the most interesting, but it is a bit disappointing, as he is not the reason why people will watch this film. The game is good enough: John Carradine shows his sinister side, and Lon Cheney, Jr., is once again convinced that his hero is filled with tragedy. Glenn Strange has nothing to do, and Onslow Stevens argues that this is the real Dr. Edelman. In general, this film will not do much for those who are not a fan of universal horror; but as the films about stupid monsters go, House of Dracula is worth seeing.
