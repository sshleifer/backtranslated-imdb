Is it really interesting to me at times ?? when I look at comments here, it seems to me that most people have seen a completely different film than me. I just saw it ... and I liked it. Not in the sense that it made me happy, but in the fact that I saw a good movie! <br /> <br /> Movie needs patience, yes. And yes, the main character is REALLY annoying, but Iâ€™m sure it is intentional. <br /> <br /> Maybe it really matters if you watch this movie in the cinema or at home. Most people watch movies at home as if they were listening to elevator music. This movie is definitely not suitable as background noise. <br /> <br /> And no. Good direction doesn't mean five laughs or explosions per second. Good direction means following your theme and keeping the story and the actors together. And while it doesn't work perfectly, at least I think it works quite well. <br /> <br /> I liked the photos and scenery, even if they sometimes seem surreal. The first scene is really special. <br /> <br /> I also liked the game ?? Guillaume Depardieu does not play Pierre. He plays the role of Pierre, who himself plays the role! Pierre is not a romantic hero, as he tries so hard to be, he is an arrogant and self-assured idiot, a frank weakling who gradually harms all the people whom he claims to protect. The fact that even his love of truth is just a posture perfectly demonstrates his constant lies and never ask questions or explain himself. <br /> <br /> People wonder where one person or another and other things came from: there is no character that has been seen in more than two scenes, it remains unexplainable, there is enough information about each person scattered throughout the film. <br /> <br /> And even a strange building begins to make sense as soon as they see target practice: Remember that Isabel fled from the war zone - and, obviously, this is a refuge for fighters in the civil war, most likely in Bosnia ( which was still going on when the movie was made). At least this is hinted at by the story Isabel tells Pierre when she first meets him, and the later scene where Pierre shows Isabel a book with her father on the cover, which is surrounded by books about Bosnia.
