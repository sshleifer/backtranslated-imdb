This Blake Edwards film is not too sure if he wants to be a comedy, drama or musical. Regardless of the presence of Julie Andrews, there is enough reason to see this comedy-dramatic, musical-spyware deception Julia is beautiful and uses her talents throughout the film. Rock Hudson looks tired, but he is more than good as Julie's romantic interest. Authentic cars and airplanes of the First World War are added to the circulation. In general, the film is very interesting. The DVD release is an edited (Blake Edwards) version of the original release. Presumably, this is the only version that Edwards would allow; but, Turner Classic Movies recently showed the full (theatrical version) version. Featured.
