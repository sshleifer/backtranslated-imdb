This film has everything for it: fully developed characters, a realistic image of working Washington, filled with warmth and humor, which is uniquely represented by Albert Brooks. The fading of network news has become an even more serious problem now than it was in 1987. Remember, it was in front of the cable! It is so nice to take care of complex people trying to achieve complex goals - and it all moves at the speed of lightning. Such a true image of friendship in life, which fluctuates in the direction of romance. See if you can see John Cusack as an evil messenger! And do you recognize Peter Hux from real broadcasts? Finally, if you're from the District of Columbia, see if you agree with Holly Hunter's directions to taxi drivers!
