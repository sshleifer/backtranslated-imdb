When I was growing up, “Journey to Space” was my favorite movie. I remember a time when KTLA (Channel 5) showed the film for a week, and my sisters and I watched it every day! I still remember every part of this movie. The ending was so sad when the giant robot exploded with the Guillotine, and then watched Johnny Socco with tears on his face calling for the giant robot. There should have been a continuation of the film in which the giant robot somehow survived the explosion. :) I can't believe that so many other Voyage fans in Space still exist. I really want to buy a movie when it’s released on DVD, but my sister said that the ones that are there are bootlegging and probably low-quality copies of the movie. I don’t know why they haven’t released it yet since more than 40 years have passed. I think that "Journey into Space" was made back in 1968. Only now is my second favorite Japanese monster film of all time (Gargantua War) finally comes out on DVD and comes out on September 9th, and I can't wait! :) Now, if they did the same with Voyage into space. Giant robot, Johnny Socco and Journey into Space will never be forgotten! In my opinion, and probably many others, it will always be a classic childhood for me! :)
