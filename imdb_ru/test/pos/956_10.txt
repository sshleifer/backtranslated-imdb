If you have seen the Telugu version of Gilli's “Okkad”, you will find that it is very similar in storyline, but Gilly has different songs and takes place in Tamil Nadu, not in Andra Pradesh. Although this is a remake of Okkadu, you will see that Vijay and Tricia make this movie unique, Vijay and Tricia are a great pair. There were a few drawbacks when the Vijays character slaps the character Trish for the fact that he is going to buy him a gift, he never apologizes, and she still stays with him at the end. Good performances and songs make this movie great and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> I put it on 10/10, one of the best I've seen.
