I remember reading the original story of Balzac in French in college. <br /> <br /> I remember Ken Nordine from WGN-TV in Chicago reading it as one of his late night shows. <br /> <br /> Always loved the story, but never believe that they could or would make a film out of it. To my surprise, they did and did it VERY well. <br /> <br /> Few of the Balzac stories can be dramatized, which is regrettable, and, like me, I have always hoped that this would be removed without much Hollywood sex. This is as close to perfect treatment as possible. <br /> <br /> The theater of the mind is always better than what the eye can see, but it is as close as I think it can give imagination. read meet reality of vision.
