The stars "The Holy Captivates" George Sanders in the role of Simon the Templar, also known as the "Holy" in this 1940 introduction to the series. These are also the stars of Wendy Barry, Jonathan Hale and Paul Gilfoyle. On board the ship heading to the USA, the Saint meets and tries to spend time with a woman (Wendy Barry) who gives him a rebuff. Simon arrives in New York to help Inspector Farnac, who is now completely discredited because of a fake gangster; 50,000 dollars was found in his house. Gangster Rocky (Roland Drew), of course, was found not guilty at the trial, and he and his fellow gangsters pay the bill for falsification and the representation of a lawyer - a total of $ 90,000. Today it is necessary to protect yourself from parking. It was a killer rap. <br /> <br /> Rocky sends his bodyguard Pearl Gates (Gilfoyle) to a lawyer's house to steal $ 90,000 from the safe. The lawyer catches him red-handed and sends him back to his boss with a message. After a few seconds he is dead. Rocky meets a similar fate. And so on - who kills this group of gangsters? The saint must make one of them speak, so that Fernac can be cleansed - can he get to anyone before they are killed? The woman with whom he met aboard the ship reappears and appears in a prominent place in this matter. <br /> <br /> Few actors have such a feature as George Sanders, and his wit, good appearance, even voice and depth as an actor will suit Simon Templar perfectly. Paul Gilfoyle provides a bit of humor as Perley Gatesâ€™s nervous milk drinker, and Jonathan Hale is great as the sometimes irritated but agitated patient inspector Fernak. Wendy Barry, who appeared in many episodes of the Saint, is very good as a woman who captures Simon's heart. <br /> <br /> Very nice.
