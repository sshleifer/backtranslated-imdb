This film should be released on DVD, because this is the only way I will buy it. I thought it was so funny, because there was no real plot. This was not supposed to be an Oscar-winning film. I appreciate these films. Carey Elvis was very sweet Robin Hood. I can't even remember my favorite part of the movie, because they are all pretty good. In any case, the world. !!!!
