I just love this movie, and I have a TV programmed to record it when it turns back on November 2nd. This is a really good love story with a twist. The song that sounds at the end of the film is the one you don't think will be a big hit, but this is the song that remains in your head, and I'm now trying to find this song so that I can hear and play it. I really have no show style that I see, or songs that I like to hear, and therefore I am rather open to see new things with an open mind. I would like to say that in this film there are some parts that are not intended to be viewed by the whole family. This film shows the skin. This is something like a lifelong film for women, about women. I say, watch the movie, and you might like it as much as I do.
