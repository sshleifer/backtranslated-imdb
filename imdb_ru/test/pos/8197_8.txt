This three-hour Chinese epic, whose action takes place in 220 BC. Intrigue and passion, as well as betrayal and epic events, told by bright strokes. Even for those who are not attracted to such historical spectacles for their own sake, this is an amazing feast for the eyes: the scene depicting the attempted coup of the Marquis is one of the most stunning memories of physical space and greatness in memory, and battle scenes are remembered as by volume and by immediacy. The title sums up the use of the film of irresistible contrasts - the immense prospects of the plain, opposed to intimate horrors; the most noble motives, opposed to the most humiliated; hope turns to dust. If you have never seen a three-hour Chinese epic, it will not be a bad start.
