This film was a surprise. The plot of the story sounds strange, and the stars Clint Eastwood and the great Geraldine Paige. I did not know what to expect. This is the first scene where a wounded soldier says that a 12-year-old man is old enough to kiss, and continues to give the child a protracted and very adult kiss in the mouth. The child will take him to the boarding school for girls where she lives. He uses the situation, trying to seduce the director, played by Paige, her assistant and another student. Jealousy, sexual tension, incest, intrigue and a terrible merger in this surprisingly original story. <br /> <br /> I read other comments here and did not find anything that could disagree. Nevertheless, I would like to clarify the previous remark that there are no sympathetic characters in the film. I believe that there is one. An attractive slave successfully resists the success of a soldier in a scene that works well because it affects the overall history of black slaves used by white men. Despite the fact that her strength and lack of illusions make up the total amount of her experience, I consider her a sympathetic character. She has more than other women and girls in school, there is a legitimate reason for participating in what happens at the end.
