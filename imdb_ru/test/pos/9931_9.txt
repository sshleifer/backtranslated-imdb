Beware of the Scottish game! In his fascinating and heartbreaking Opera, Dario Argento returns to classical form, regaining his composure, which he has lost, removing entangled and delusional psychosocks, such as Tenebre and the Phenomenon. Indeed, based on a simple narrative that is compensated for by luxurious decorations, figuratively violent episodes of murders and exquisite photography, the film resembles Argento, which we once knew. Opera’s only real violation is the absence of Goblin’s score, which provided unusual, iconic and timeless music for many of Argento’s greatest films (however, the choice of opera used here is remarkable). <br /> <br /> Production is filled with several competent actors. Despite the fact that she is not Jessica Harper, Christina Marsillah, who is similar to Annabella Skyorer, was able and seductive enough to understand the role of the tortured heroine. Ian Charleson is interesting as a horror film director who became Marco's opera. And Daria Nicolodi, as always, is fantastic, even in her relatively short role (see how the DVD compilation is shot to find out a funny interview with Nicolodi about her role - obviously daring and offended because she stopped communicating with Argento !) “The Stage of Fear” (another great 1987 release, directed by Michel Soavi, who was the second director of “Opera”), barely recognizes the last girl from this film, Barbara Cupisti, as the scene manager here (I think this is that do this). <br /> <br /> Trivia is often important with me, and Argento’s passion for lonely, nightmarish imagery makes him my ideal director. The opera is full of small details that made me grin. For example, I like that we never see the face of the “Great” Mary Check. I also like the scene in which the killer is scratching the tip of his deadly sharp dagger on a television screen that shows Betty as Lady Macbeth. Finally, I challenge even the most sluggish veteran slashers so that they do not shrink, as the "eyes of the hairpin" are placed above Betty's eyes. <br /> <br /> In short, Opera is a pure, tense and tight thriller. With his solid performance, precise focus and competent cinematography, he asks to be in the same league as Deep Red and The Bird With the Crystal Opmage. Can opera be the last great hyallo?
