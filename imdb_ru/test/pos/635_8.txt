I could not stop watching this movie, although it was far after my dream. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with Hitchcock deserve - this thing really plays with you. He passes a wonderful line between the present, immediate expectation and dark, distant humor. Like many of Hitch's heroes, our dumb witness with a squint innocently stumbled upon something truly awful - and we had quite a ride up, identifying and feeling her fear in turn, watching in turn at an exhilarating tension as she was put at risk . <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have taken great care in designing this. From the very beginning, they involve and challenge you to determine what is real and what is fiction; who can be trusted, and who the monster. The plot is unpredictable. Suspense is created with a combination of carefully selected camera work, images, music - but most simply with the EYES of characters who instill in you a gross fear. <br /> <br /> Warning: there is a frighteningly real blood, as well as nudity. Horror scenes are made in an emotional way that makes them much more frightening and disturbing than on any teen killer photo. <br /> <br /> And in the killer teen picture it's not like that. The characters are whimsical and feel like real people, on the one hand - a couple (including the heroine), which you can even find as cute as I am. There will be no mistake if you are watching an adult movie. I mean that Alec Guinness is in him, in short, and you know that he DOES NOT NEED to work! <br /> <br /> Insert this into a video recorder at night when you cannot fall asleep. I don't want it yet.
