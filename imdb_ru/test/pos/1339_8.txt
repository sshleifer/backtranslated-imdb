This film is difficult to reconsider, since it is necessary to take into account several factors. Let's filter out more judgments .. Well, are you interested in the facts regarding serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer? Can you stand up to an independent, low-budget film? Are you objective enough to NOT like a movie solely because of the absence of stars or a professional look? Well, if you said yes, then you must have an open mind enough to handle it. This film is an almost 100% accurate reenactment of Damer's adult life and the subsequent celebration of the killings, and is designed as an autobiography. This is not a glamorous, unrealistic story, which, unfortunately, was the theatrical film "Dahmer" (2001). The film begins with Dahmer, played very convincingly by Karl Crew, sitting in a police car when they raid his apartment. His thoughts about what led him there are presented to us in the past, narrated style, which accurately explains most of the psychosis and motives of Dahmer, which led him to commit a murder almost 20 times. We recognize the character, both the sophisticated side, and the side that was close enough to normal life. No one is to blame, but Dahmer that 17 people died, but as a student in criminal psychology, I was glad that his bestial side, frankly, is represented in this film. You see that he has a love relationship with his grandmother, and he is also trying to find companionship, but, of course, we see his side, which we all remember. It should be noted that the actual violence on the screen is small, and most of it is thought-provoking, such as splashing blood or striking the body through a blurred curtain. You see two deaths that I remember, one of which was a rather bloodless blow in the throat, and the other a man who was thrown alive in a barrel of acid. While you see nothing graphic, this cruelty and persuasive actions of both the Crew and his victims make this scene alarming. And although the actual injury on the screen remains low, you will see results. There is a supporting arm and a head or two, but it seems that this should have disturbed the viewer and does not look exploitative. In addition, these fake anatomical parts are where budget constraints are visible. Although they are acceptable, they are similar enough to fakes, so as not to be too disturbing. The film actually ends before Dahmer’s death in 1994, because he was released a year or two before. This is the only big difference from the real story, and the information that remains, as I said, is very true to the facts. The quality of the film could be better, the dialogues often sound too quiet, and playing several characters is a little silly, but this is not overboard. In my opinion, this is an erroneous, but ultimately honest and serious look at one of America’s most memorable serial killers. I think it is safe to say that the film is also memorable, and I respect it for overcoming its limitations in order to plausibly state the story with the support of the absolutely excellent Karl Crew as Dahmer.
