For a short moment. The first scene with Traci Lords and techno-bar <br /> <br /> is incredible. I probably would have followed her until his death! The best film about vampires of all time, but with a twist. The fighting scenes are awesome. Wesley Snipes demonstrates athleticism that you donâ€™t see every day. And Stephen Dorff is impressive and very credible as an ambitious recruit, moving up the hierarchy by any means necessary. Great movie 9/10. Where is Blade II?
