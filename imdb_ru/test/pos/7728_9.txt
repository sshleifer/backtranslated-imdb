There are several ways to misunderstand this film, and several of them have been shown in some of the previous comments. This is a film that needs to be analyzed as free entertainment of a famous subject and, therefore, it cannot be compared with opera, book or other films of Carmen that we have seen before. That alone is worth it, and I must say that this Carmen does it very well. Comparison is a mistake, because it is the first step to depriving films of being independent creative works of art. Vicente Aranda - master of the atmosphere and artistic direction, costumes and photography are extremely well built to achieve a pleasant aesthetic experience. Let's take it as it is. <br /> <br /> And this leads us to the next misunderstanding. Someone complains about typical Spanish clichés in the film. Well, historically, the film has been extremely well studied, and you can see the results of this very serious work in every scene. This is not only an accurate portrait of the “black Spain” knife and espadrilles, which so vividly depicted Goya, but also that part of the story that a foreigner sees enchanted by the folklore side of this society. Honestly, anyone who does not want to see a single cliche about Spain should not buy a ticket to see Carmen, but in this case, these cliches are presented before they become one, and the way to see them is to get rid of our own prejudices . <br /> <br /> Another important requirement for a proper understanding of the film is to speak the language. It is unacceptable to criticize the actions of any actor for not understanding his or her lines. If the audience did everything else, the problem most likely lies elsewhere. Paz Vega has impeccable diction with her Andalusian accent, and everything she says is understandable and trustworthy. Her Argentine partner, Leonardo Sbaraglia, also provides a convincing portrait of a Basque officer who has become a “bandelier,” and her accent has been very well studied. <br /> <br /> It is equally important to have a minimally open approach to the material. To say that Paz Vega is “terrible,” says that the author of the phrase entered the theater for the wrong reasons. In Spain, we already had a critic in one of the most prestigious newspapers, in which he recommended to us photographs that he aroused in homosexuals, without mentioning them explicitly. And this was not entirely fair for the rest of us, especially for those who did not find that this man wrote parts of his anatomy that many readers didn’t have to care about. I do not assume at all that the reviewer had the same motivation, but the expectations were different from the expectations of those of us who went to see how a talented and beautiful actress played an almost classical role, because this is what we got. Paz Vega IS Carmen, and excellent, in the film Vicente Aranda.
