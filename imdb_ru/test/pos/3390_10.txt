Shelley. <br /> <br /> Based on the successful novels of John Jake in paperback North and South, Love and War and Heaven and Hell, this mini-series was shown on television from 1985 to 1987. His success is largely due to the success of Korney, a similar era of civil war / slavery soap opera televised about a decade earlier in the 70s. Patrick Swayze, at the beginning of his career and at the time, he starred in many films, such as Dirty Dancing, that would make him famous, including Orrie Mayne, a young man born on a plantation from South Carolina who goes in West Point. Here he meets George Hazard (James Reed), who is supposed to be a hated enemy, Yankee North, but with whom he is closely associated. Soon, Mine from the South and Dangers from the North become friends, despite the turbulent era leading to civil war. The theme of family, friendship and the right actions, even when a nation falls apart, lies at the heart of this soap opera full of action and romance. Clarice and Ashton (Gene Simmons and Teri Garber) portray sisters who become enemies when one of them marries Yanki Billy Hazard (John Stockwell. Stingy, seductive, manipulative, ambitious and evil Ashton Garber is interesting to watch on the screen. Although the TV series is not done. To cover everything in Jakes' novels, we see an abbreviated version, and they changed a few things to make them a kind of historical novel with attached history lessons. The characters end up in all the major scenes of the Civil Wars - Harper's Ferry where the abolitionist and feminist Virginia Hazard (Kirstie Ellie) loses the love of her life, the former slave Grady, Fort Sumter, Vicksburg, Antietam, Gettysburg, Appomatox and we are involved in the White House, where we see Abraham Lincoln (Hal Hearbroek, and we are involved in the White House, where we see Abraham Lincoln (Hal Hee Arthroux, and we are involved in the White House, where we see Abraham Lincoln (Hal Helbrooks, and we are part of the White House, where we see Abraham Lincoln (Hal Helbrooks and we are involved in the White House, where we see Abraham Lincoln (Haltelbrooke, and Appomatox) on his conscience, we meet with all the famous players, including Lee, Grant, Sherman, Jackson and Davis. Several Hollywood veteran actors of the Golden Age - Robert Mitchum, Elizabeth Taylor and Olivia De Ha There are cameos in Villanda, and they are interesting to watch. This is not a historical fact, it is a historical fiction and purely dramatized entertainment. But it has cliffhendings endings and beautiful cinematography, costumes and locations. Itâ€™s like watching an epic movie that lasts longer than Gone with the Wind with war scenes! The script can sometimes be bad, and acting can not be the best, despite the good cast of actors. Swayze Hamit, like Terry Garber, but some performances, such as Kirstie Alley, James Reed (like George Hazard) and Lesley Ann Downes in the role of the beautiful and strong Madeline, are really good performances. They were shot in film sets and in southern places. The music is enchanting, and this is a good film in which we cheer on the good guys, watch the plans of the villains, and ultimately receive their reward. All fans of the Civil War movies and Jake novels should watch this. It is available on DVD and VHS.
