I have seen this film more than once, and it is worth it. For those of you who love martial arts and overcomes internal conflicts, this is a worthy choice. After watching this film, I wanted to become a more productive member of society, because I could relate to the internal turmoil of a girl who is seeking recognition and needs a way to go. Of course, Mr. Miyagi always gives his wise advice. 2 thumbs up!
