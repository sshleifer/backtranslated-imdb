I didn’t like "How good, how it works", but I'm a big fan of the works of William Hurt and Holly Hunter, so I decided to watch this movie. And the most amazing thing for me was the excellent work of Albert Brooks. Here, in Spain, it is not well known, and only as a version of Woody Allen’s 2nd Division on the West Coast. He played a big role, but Hunter and Hurt were also good, especially Hart, in a relatively unusual role for him. Hunter played a role that reminds me a bit of her role in "Once Around" (Lasse Hallstrom, 1991). <br /> <br /> Finally, the rest of the cast is great too. Robert Prosci, one of these familiar faces of American cinema, ex-girlfriend Bond Lois Chiles, in my opinion, played well this role, always the perfect Joan Cusack in her early years; and especially the short appearance of Jack Nicholson. Maybe he doesn’t have a good scene, but this is Jack Nicholson, anyway ... The best James L. Brooks film, a great story (well decided) and a great cast for one of the certainly 80s films
