Peter Boyle has always been a great actor, and he proved it with his role as a fanatic fanatic, making me hate him every time he used the word "N", I looked at him and his big mouth and wanted to knock his light out. (Just think, Peter Boyle was once a Monk) (Now the supporting actor in Everybody Loves Raymond) Susan Sarandon, who debuted for the first time, immediately took a bath and enjoyed sharing it with someone in her dirty water. I noticed that the big Raggerty Ann doll (creator, John Gruel) was the only thing Susan could trust and love, and the doll appeared in several scenes. If you really want to learn about the 70s coming out with drugs, free love and pipe dreams, then enjoy the wonderful guidance of John G. Avildsen ("Rocky and" Baby Karate ")." I always thought that Peter Boyle should have been blown up at the end !! This is definitely a cult classic that is worth seeing and sharing with others.
