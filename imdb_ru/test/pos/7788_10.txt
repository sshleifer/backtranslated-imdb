This is the best movie released in Bollywood to date. Best comedy, best acting and best direction so far! Rajkumar Santoshi wrote and directed, proved that he is one of the best directors in the industry. Aamir Khan was absolutely amazing, Salman Khan looked good, how he behaved. Shakti Kapoor was good, but Jagdip acted as usual! This comedy is still copied by people, and no other writers and directors could do this thing again! Even Rajkumar Santoshi couldnâ€™t make this cult classic again! This film was a failure when it was released, but it was a cult classic because it was released and loved by all kinds of people. <br /> <br /> STAR. <br /> <br /> ACTING 10/10. <br /> DIALOGUES 10/10. <br /> <br /> SCREENPLAY 10/10. <br /> <br /> DIRECTION 10/10. <br /> <br /> MUSIC 9/10. <br /> <br /> LYRICS 9/10. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is highly recommended. If you haven't watched it so far, you missed something big! This is a riot of laughter and the best comedy I've ever seen! Classic films such as Hera Pheri, Golmaal and Jaane Bhi Do Jaaro are not even as funny as this one. <br /> <br /> BIG MOVIE, DISABLED STOKES !!!!
