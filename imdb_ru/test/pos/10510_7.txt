For 15 years of life I have watched a lot of B-class films, and I must say that it was one of the best. I personally enjoyed the real estate and storyline, but she suffered from amateur acting (although Adrianna Barbo did play the role of Lisa Grant). Joseph Bottoms could not hold his role well enough to be considered good. Another performance that really matched the film was Barry Hope (Barney Resnick). It all starts with the fact that a real estate agent leads an Asian couple through the house, but discovers that there is a dead girl in the shower of the show house. It proceeds with a detective guess, and introduces key characters with reasonable grace. I think that for any person who wants to laugh at the incredible drama that realtor-victims offer during horrible bloody scenes, this is really a gem ... XD Who am I kidding? This is not so great, but it is worth seeing if you are really bored.
