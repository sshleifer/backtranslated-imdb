Fantastic movie experience. I really enjoyed watching this really great movie in the theater when it came out. There is nothing to add, besides that terrible shame, that Sir Albert Finney has not yet been adopted by AMPAS (American Academy). After roles in films such as Tom Jones, Murder on the Orient Express, Under the Volcano (if you name just a few — he was nominated for an Oscar for them), Komod is probably his main point, but ... <br /> <I know Oscar is just a pop contest, but if Americans like British actors and actresses (Oscars like Jeremy Irons, Daniel Day-Lewis, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Glenda Jackson, etc.) d. - and they all deserved a reward!), why did they always leave Sir Finney empty-handed? <br /> <br /> On the other hand, they gave it to John Wayne and Marisa Tomei (in Cousin Winnie). I don't know if I should laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> If you have seen two reasons in the “Locker”, you will not forget what the art of acting is. Watch this movie and enjoy! I recommend it to anyone who loves art. <br /> <br /> I give 9/10 for this great movie (1 point is not enough for non-cinematic material, after all, it’s just a theater) <br /> <br /> Note: my criteria are much higher than that of IMDb (10 only for a cinematic masterpiece that should / could last forever).
