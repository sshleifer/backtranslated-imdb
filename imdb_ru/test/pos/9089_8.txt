This film is clearly a strange situation occurring in the school, which is actually very old, but certainly not like a sterile medical school. Very gothic and atmospheric. As for the film itself, well, okay, the premise is a bit contrived, but hey, that's why we're watching movies, aren't we? And it is less contrived than some of the garbage that goes out these days, that's for sure. Medical students are experimenting with a “short-term” death, for example, allowing themselves to die for a short time so that they can experience what the afterlife is. In some cases, this is quite nice, until parts of it come back from traveling and begin to interfere with their earthly lives. I have not seen this film for many years until I received it on DVD, and I must say that I forgot how good it is. And it struck me that Julia Roberts looks really beautiful in this film, not like today's actresses, who are supposedly gorgeous, but dressed and dressed like cheap prostitutes. Ah, good old days. In any case, this is an excellent film, perhaps not for fundamentalist Christians, but many others may like it. 8 out of 10 stars.
