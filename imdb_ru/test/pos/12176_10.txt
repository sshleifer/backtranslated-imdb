I watched films about Germany in the TV Guide, and found the film Rabbits, so I watched it and laughed stupidly! I wanted a DVD, but it's not here (I could order it from Germany, but it has no subtitles). It was reproduced again, so I recorded it on tape and occasionally watch it. <br /> <br /> In any case, I searched for information about this and found out that his real name is Erkan & Stefan, but I know it by the Australian name: The Bunnyguards. <br /> <br /> Some people I know from Germany donâ€™t like Erkan & Stefan because of their accents, but I'm not German, I didn't notice anything. The jokes are good, but some Germans may upset their accents. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is funny, and if the DVD has English subtitles on all additions (having a two-disc edition with only a function with subtitles would be bad) I would have bought it in an instant! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh and a pretty good story.
