I watched this film at the first show available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people did not get the film. Even if you don’t, this is a good movie with an interesting character development. This is a completely human story about some very imperfect people in the southern part of the wilderness and really speaks of the root of the blues. If you do not know what “Black Snake Moan” is, when you leave the theater, you did not understand it. And no .. it's not just a song. Christina Ricci, like Samuel L. Jackson, does an excellent job. I think that this is his best performance since his role in "Pulp Fiction", and probably his best, also due to the diversity of his character in BSM. The rest of the cast is solid, with several brilliant performances here and there, especially with John Cotran Jr. in the role of Rev. R. I am a very selective audience, and this film is honestly considered one of my favorites because of his sincere look at the race, religion and neurosis in a rural southern town, along with his cinematic genius, in my opinion.
