Recently published on DVD (11/11/08), North Perez and Earth Did Not Swallow It (1994) is based on one of the most respected and discussed novels in the literature of Chicano. The book by Thomas Rivera "... no, no tragedy" / ... and the Earth has not swallowed him (1972) is still widely recognized by many critics and serious readers as Chicago's classic novel. Originally written in Spanish, characteristic of South Texas, and also translated into English, Rivera’s novel continues to be an indispensable presence in the literary landscape of Chicano. <br /> <br /> Peres' movie, originally made in the high-rated Playhouse PBS, took some time to release on DVD. One can only wonder at this issue, because its high quality is not a problem. However, the film, and now the DVD, as far as I know, remains the only cinematic adaptation of any novel in Chicano and, undoubtedly, is a tribute to the incredible resilience of the Earth. This cinematic version also strikes an exceptionally deep-rooted nerve, which, I argue, is both specifically ethnic and, in general, universal. Doubts about the Earth may have arisen because it is too “ethnic”, too alien to the mainstream American mainstream, too much “foreign” indie art, too limited in economic resources. However, Perez, in my version of art, in my opinion, very effectively, artistically connects and creates a clearly imprinted image of a collective of migrants from Chicano, which focuses on everyday family life. As for production with relatively limited economic resources, its excellent cinematic work and pursuing music go far beyond affordable financing. A simple movie viewing demonstrates the artistic value of this movie (or DVD). <br /> <br /> In short, ??. And the Earth did not swallow Him, depicts in a neo-naturalistic way the plight of the suffering and despair of the Chicago migrant workers who follow the crops north from South Texas to Minnesota in 1952. Local priests bless the beaten, overloaded vehicles of those workers from Chicano who can no longer find work in the area and must follow the agricultural trail of a migrant worker to the north. This band from Chicano, like the Joad of the Depression era in Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, forms an epic tide driven by economic need, survival instinct, painful despair and, eventually, a flickering faith. Paying tribute to these people of the land, the collective hero, the DVD focuses on the target family, and the young protagonist in the family is especially symbolic; the boy is perhaps twelve years old or so. This work also functions as a buildungsroman. Ultimately, the sense of identification of the viewer is generated through the experience, subjectivity and struggle of the protagonist. Poverty, alienation, child labor, illness (sunstroke and death during pregnancy), discrimination, school absenteeism (the boy’s flight from hooligan discrimination manifests in a beautiful, peaceful cemetery) are naked in reality — as well as symbolically. Worst of all, the problem conflict between the child and his mother goes beyond the framework of socio-economic and political conflicts into deeper areas of psychology and metaphysics. In a desperate but artistically rendered struggle, the young man fights with his mother, an archetypal Mexican-American traditionalist, a representative of the will of God, content with prayer, resignation, consolation and acceptance. The rebellious youth cannot believe in a god who would allow them to do such evil and suffering. How can God be so cruel, he asks, since his younger sister is certainly completely innocent to suffer a serious illness on the fields? At this stage, the boy must overcome obstacles, even more serious than poverty and discrimination. Problems now include death, doubt and despair, and lack of meaning. And he has few resources available to him - strength of character, his own will power, his intellect and powerful survival instinct. In this desperate, but artistically presented struggle, an unnamed young man, the central figure, feels the need for his stamina, for achieving heightened meaning and, as the viewer hopes, for a renewed and enhanced Vitality that can serve as Inspiration for Chicanos and others. <br /> <br /> This fierce battle uses a plot device that was just used by the original work to link episodic work: the missing immigrant workers from Mexico who left no trace after their death, although this DVD deals not with Mexican ones with mexican-american migrant workers. Very existential work: agony and despair; Quest; focus on the project; and foreclosures - all under the auspices of free will, despite deterministic socioeconomic and religious circumstances. <br /> <br /> Perez has a long list of credits mainly as a documentary filmmaker. His many awards are confirmatory. Producer Paul Espinoza is also well known and was also honored for his work. The 1994 film, in fact, won and earned a number of awards: first place, a favorite of the audience at the Santa Barbara Film Festival in 1995; first place at the Cairo Film Festival; and a number of other well-deserved awards. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this film and Perez's “Earth” DVD is the best Chikano film that was made.
