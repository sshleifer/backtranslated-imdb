The problem with the other actors playing Dorian Gray is that they either looked too old for that role (Hurd Hetfield, Helmut Berger, Josh Duhamel, David Gallagher, Ben Barnes), or that they could not aristocratic style of English. without piles. Dorian is an eternal 19-year-old (or so), all milky-leather and honey strands, as described by Wilde, so the challenge is to find an actor who has maturity and range for the role (that is, who can portray naivety , callousness and manipulation), but at the same time looks like someone in his late teens. And Peter Firth does all this in this wonderful British television adaptation. <br /> <br /> Gilgud as Henry Wotton, although much older than Wilde conceived, surprises with his scenes - Wilde's aphorisms never sounded so natural and not forced. Especially George Sanders in the 1945 version was rather weak in comparison (and his suit did not fit). <br /> <br /> Finally, Jeremy Bratt plays Basil as the most masculine and at the same time the most gay of the trio, again a suitable interpretation. In general, the film includes enough gay subtext without turning Dorian himself into gay - he is everything for everyone, and perhaps there is no drug or sexual perversion that he has not tried in the 18 years described in the story, but it does its more narcistic than homosexual. It seems that it is equally detrimental to both sexes here, as it should be in accordance with the novel. <br /> <br /> Of course, the budget of this production was not very large, so everything seems a bit scenic. In particular, Dorian’s meeting with his brother Sybil suffers from an obvious studio look. In addition, the last snapshot of Dorian (I suppose, puppets) in his makeup-like image, like a white toad, more cheerful than convincing, and the scene of Vasily's death is unintentionally amusing. (In addition, as far as I remember, Vasily should have been killed sitting at the table.) <br /> <br /> But in general, this is a very worthy adaptation. I'm sure Wilde would have liked that. It lacks only the sensual side. There are not so many sex scenes, but Wilde’s decadent world of fragrant flowers, luxurious fabrics and gems is not explored here, that is, aesthetics are completely missing. But, like me, Claudius, a great game makes it easy to forget about these shortcomings of production values.
