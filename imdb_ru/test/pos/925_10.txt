Are we allowed to interfere in the daily lives of our fellows? Is it possible to invade their closeness, get inside their thoughts, violating the privacy of their own home, without being accused? The director has some doubts about these seemingly solvable questions, almost sympathetic to the destabilizing decision of Judge Jean Louis to reconcile with his own induced self-isolation through fragments of lives predated by him. <br /> <br /> "Trois couleurs: Rouge" is based on the concept of "UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATION NOTED AS A HUMAN DESIRE OF AN OPEN WINDOW IN THE WORLD." The main character of this story can be considered the phone: after his speech in Dekalog 9, he first gives Calling Kieslovsky’s viewers, and then, step by step, around the world. The director deeply studies the ability of people to communicate, not taking a certain position on the ethical side of individual behavior. These currents and resources of life separated from each other by a significant number of years. Unexplained combinations strangely converge in a series of continuous and frustrating situations. ”“ Some books fall on the pavement. ”One of them accidentally opens on the fatal page, predetermining the fate of a future profession, as in a similar incident in the past. - Glimpses of everyday life are met fleetingly, ideally their love for the fictional musician Van den Budermeyer joins them. - Human destinies are marked by the most hapless coincidence. <br /> <br /> In this work, which deserves to be seen by the eyes of our hearts and not by the eyes of our mind, we can observe a dialectical game between judge Jean Louis ”(Jean-Louis Trintiant and Valentina Dussault (Irene Jacob is possibly the sweetest actress of our time, along with the beautiful Winona Ryder) in the generational conflict between the experience of a weary old man and the shy immaturity of a sweet girl on the edge of the steep path of her ascending path. oh life and young people, unaware of their future, between a soulless misanthrope and a spontaneous girl, full of a good sense of selflessness. <br /> <br /> And the last parade, when the damp smell of tragedy is still in the air, and all the main characters trilogies in full proof, saved by random luck thanks to a skillfully written providential script, give us the extreme congratulations from this master of the film, fully used by his great passion for cinema. All that remains is a feeling of bitter regret and emptiness, to remind us of the existence of emptiness, which is impossible to fill. Goodbye KRZYSZTOF. WE'RE MISSING YOU VERY MUCH!
