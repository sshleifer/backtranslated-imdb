The rare exception to the rule that great literature shoots disappointing films, John Houston's beautiful farewell to life and movies is almost entirely consistent with the story and spirit of James Joyce's story, gentle meditation on love, death and time expressed in the Twelfth Night Party events for the average class around 1910. No matter how the material appeared, the film succeeds due to its willingness to tell a story on its own quiet, obviously non-essential conditions, and not to impose the usual cinematic form of plot points and dramatic incidents on it. Only once was the wrong note sounded when old Miss Julia (a trained singer and music teacher, whose voice was supposed to be chapped by age and not broken) sings so badly that the audience burst out laughing when I saw it in the movie. Fortunately, the mood of the muffled and gentle anguish is restored after a lot of time at the time of the revelation between the married couple Gabriel and Gretta Conroy in the hotelâ€™s bedroom, when the snow begins to fall outside. I guess this is a sad story, but one that makes you feel better, not blue. Especially recommended as a movie about dating - for lovers who are not afraid to face the sweetness and sadness of life.
