Some martial arts purists think comedy was the worst thing that could happen to an old-school kung-fu movie; and it is true that the introduction of the comedy into the genre marked the end of the chop-nanny period in a Hong Kong film. But the fact is that it is possible to hold only a physical exhibition of prowess so long that it will bother everyone. And that is why Chop Nosi died and how the Hong Kong action film “New Wave” was born: producers, actors, directors just got bored with beating people for ninety minutes in a row. <br /> <br /> Given this and the fact that Liu Chia Liang is a professional director with a significant list of films in his resume, this film should be viewed as something other than just another kung-fu comedy. Rather, it is a comic film in the martial arts, and in fact one of the best ever created. <br /> <br /> What Liu did with this film is a really pleasant surprise: he took the martial-art plot and reconstructed it after the Hollywood-style musical! Complete with episodes of singing and dancing! Around the time this movie was made, some directors and movie fans began to realize that the cinematic performance of martial arts (actually based on the acrobatics of Chinese opera) has more to do with dance than with battle. , (I will continue to point out this connection until most Americans understand what they really should look for when watching a film about martial arts — well-planned body movements, using the action movie’s plot as an excuse for their performance.) case, it is quite clear that Liu Jia Liang established this connection and decided that he was exploring her close to her limits. <br /> <br /> The result is an incredibly enchanting entertainment, filled with amazingly human characters, trying to make wonderful kung-fu (and stumbling over their own shoelaces as often as they do). and the film, set at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, gives Liu the opportunity to explore the nature of China's westernization and modernization, which have contributed so much to the creation of China, which we know today. Thus, the film also has great historical significance. <br /> <br /> Fans of the recent film “The Tale of Kung Fu” by Stephen Chow should watch this movie carefully, as Chow clearly learned from it before creating his own film. <br /> A very funny, well-made film. Oh, yes, and Kung Fu in it is really, really good. <br /> <br /> Purists do not recognize this, but this is probably the best film directed by Liu.
