I learned something: you have to shoot this movie as a funny historical comedy if you don’t want to be disappointed. The film is enjoyable because it's a tasty comedy. I think the excessive hype hurt this: Monica Bellucci, too famous, appears in several scenes and is not as good as they wanted you to believe. It sounds unnatural, false: the best actress in this film is Sabrina Impactiore, who speaks with a perfect Tuscan accent and shines with Massimo Ceccherini. Elio Germano is very, very good: in my opinion, the most promising young Italian actor. Daniel Otei looks like Napoleon, but I preferred other actors. Thus, the most popular performances were the worst. <br /> <br /> Costumes and production designs are fine: of course, American films of the period are more accurate in these things, because they have a larger budget, but Italy’s ability rewards lack of money. In short, a good historical comedy with first-class casting (except Bellucci and Otoya).
