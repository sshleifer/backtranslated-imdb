Iâ€™m a big movie enthusiast as well as an active rugby player who thinks rugby is the best game ever. Forever Strong is a mix of coach Carter and casual rugby. This film is full of great acting, well-developed characters and combat shots that will make you dodge and dodge in your place, but with more gear than pi-pee-soccer, and almost every shot is cut off as soon as the player touches the ground. shot almost like football. If you want your children to watch a movie that will create a character from the inside and can inspire a blind person to see it again, I can easily give it 9 out of 10, if you want to watch a great rugby movie that really shows the sport you will have wait for the next one, because Forever Strong is mainly training, jogging and a film with one rack, for which I give him 7.75 out of 10.
