Over the years I have become a fan of director / writer Barry Levinson, and he did not let me down with this very funny look at politics. Popular TV comedian Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) enlightened the nation with his disgusting jokes about the state of the country and elected responsible politicians. Night after night, his fans are rolling over the islands; then the question is proposed that Dobbs should run for president. His manager Jack Mencken (Christopher Walken) says go for it. Dobba's frivolous truths incite a grassroots movement that puts him on the ballot. Comic to the elected president. Meanwhile, a young woman (Laura Linney) discovers a flaw in a computer system that will read bulletins from coast to coast. My favorite sequence is to melt Linnie in a cafe. Williams is absolutely hysterical with his quick hints. Other celebrities in the cast: Jeff Goldblum, Lewis Black and Rick Roberts.
