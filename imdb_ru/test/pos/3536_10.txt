The Messiah was an obsessive scan from beginning to end. The story was focused on the random killings of people in London in various terrible ways. DCI Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) has to find the truth, which, to his surprise, is a little closer to home than he thought. <br /> <br /> An exciting drama, and Ken Stott was great. Hopefully we have not seen the last of DCI Red Metcalfe.
