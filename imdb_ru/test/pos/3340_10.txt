I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before watching this movie. I just saw the MOOG document, which was fine, the only problem was that Mug led a very contented life, and the document was well ... pleased. The story of Khaak is full of all the market tragedies that people buy today, but it has a lot of heart. Although the film is not so tragic, you can feel that Bruce accepted the price of creating music in his own way. There are so many elements that make up its legacy of IE. the invention of Peopleodian, where Bruce could actually play music, touching people. It must have been difficult to document the "chaotic" output of Haack, who pretty much got into every imaginable music category (even in rap music), but the director very consistently put together the play and managed to capture the spirit. And the cast ... what a group of characters Bruce has surrounded herself with, but what do you expect from a telepathic guru, stumbling with children, fighting against the music industry. I recommend this film to anyone interested in the history of music, this is mainstream, but it is important.
