Television films, as a rule, do not receive as much recognition or recognition as great films, and, as a rule, there are good reasons for this, but the HBO 1996 film “Late Shift” is certainly one of the best television films in history. Based on Bill Carter's frank book, The Late Shift talks about how NBC ordered David Letterman and Jay Leno's late night talk shows when it came to filling the vacant spot in the Tonight Show that was once held by Johnny Carson. We see what happens in front of the camera - by Bill Carter, director Betty Thomas and HBO show us what happened when the cameras were turned off. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we can never know exactly what really happened when it was time to replace Johnny Carson with Letterman or Leno, but the Late Change gives us an interesting possible reality. Being just a very well made film, The Late Shift also does an excellent job of depicting all sides equally - although you are surprised that the movie makes Letterman and Leno too cute with the guys; especially Leno, who seems too holy. <br /> <br /> The performances are also very good. In a very worthy performance that won the Golden Globe, Kathy Bates plays the extremely energetic manager Leno Helen Kushnik, who, according to Carter and the book / film, was very problematic for the studio and Leno (the real Kushnik actually arranged for Bill Carter for slander by about this image!). John Michael Higgins gives up his usual speeches, getting small quirky comedic episodes, and performs well in the role of David Letterman, creating an excellent impression of Letterman, but at the same time creating a voluminous and attractive character. Daniel Roebuck plays the role of Leno well, but doesn’t quite match other talents in the film - Roebuck probably did the best that someone could do, he just looks boorish when someone tries to impress or portray Leno, Bob Balaban Warren Littlefield squirrel), Street Williams (a magician who looks like magician Michael Ovitz) and Ed Begley Jr. (pompous Rod Perth) also give unforgettable auxiliary performances. <br /> <br /> “Late Change” is definitely one of the best TV movies I've ever seen. I suppose, if someone had not watched David Letterman or Jay Leno, the Late Shift might not have been for them, but this is an interesting film for those involved in late night politics - something that recently raised its ugly head in 2009 -10 Conan / Leno / NBC rout.
