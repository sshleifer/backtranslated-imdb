When the movie "The Cure" begins, we learn about a young man named Eric (Brad Renfro). Eric is a teenager living with his paranoid mother, and a boy named Dexter (Joseph Mazello) lives next door to him. Once, Eric and Dexter connect and head to the supermarket, where Dexter gets his first taste of Butterfinger. When Eric learns that Dexter has AIDS, he will try leaf and water tea to make it better. But when it is written on the cover of The National Enquirer that a doctor from New Orleans found a cure for AIDS, the two boys will stop at nothing to get to New Orleans for treatment. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, “The Cure” is one of the best friendship films ever made. It shows unconditional love between a boy, his (new) best friend, and his best friend's mom. Everything is so well done, nothing needs to be changed. This is not only a fantastic film about friendship, but also sad, but funny and funny film about AIDS. And the tragic ending with the reduction of AIDS by Dexter is enough to make me shed a tear. Very well done.
