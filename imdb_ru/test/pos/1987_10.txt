The producers of this picture are Hungarians. This is not a crazy artistic impulse that X and Z are capitalized in the names, given that the word "isten" means "god" in Hungarian. - By the way, David, Istan is the word for God in Hungarian ... - Hmm ... Is this true? <br /> <br /> Let's look at this film as a science fiction brother, The History of Violence. Both films have a total explosion strength of the relevant genres; thriller and drama in 2005 and the science fiction of “no falsified hell” in the one we are looking at now. All that he has is important and surrounded by details: bow to Phil Dick (who wrote “In the days of the merry pet”), creating a fast-food restaurant “Perky Pat”. Nod to Stanley Kubrick using the 2001 naming model; Since IBM became HAL (one letter in the alphabet) in the 1968 film, in eXistenZ the “classic lubricant spray” WD-40 becomes XE-60 (one letter up) when Allegra cleans the port of Pikul. To nod at David Cronenberg using the videodrome's ingenious formula (“Death ...” and “Long Live” ...) and choosing a different medium for the central theme of the film (TV at the Video Conference, Video Games and Virtual Reality in eXistenZ In 1999, you enjoyed the game. Welcome to Canada!) Good taste, having received the cinematography of Peter Sushitsky, the music of Howard Shore and Ronald Editing Sanders (the team that wins). For everyone who was born in the early 80s, he has super familiarity, genesis or an arcade stick in his hands, this film rings a bell. Enough with nods. Plot ? “Jennifer Jason Lee plays the role of a game designer (Allegra) who creates a virtual reality game that affects the minds of the players,” as we see on the main page of the film. This is a story in history. For me, this picture is about a young pair of “demonstrators of reality”, introduced into the presentation of “A Brand New Virtual Game”, in order to destroy its programmer. I assume that what we see in the last five minutes is a reality, if there is such a thing as reality. Jennifer Jason Lee always plays the game designer in the game they are in, and the end of the film is a reality with video game jokes, big hairy dogs, realistic plastic textures “Cronenbergy” (helmets, etc.) and 9 mm pistols. What you see is true. They play transcendenz for an hour or so (in this game there is a game (eXistenZ) in which JJL plays the ingenious programmer eXistenZ, and Jude-Picul is Law intern-marketer associated with the game Allegra), they play in eXistenZ, because that Allegra is very concerned about the health of her capsule (the thing you connect to your nervous system to play), she must connect herself and Pikul to win the game (Transcendenz) and return to reality when they kill Yevgeny Nurish, programmer for TranscendenZ. <br /> <br /> The game in eXistenZ and TranscendenZ is a collision with your essence, face to face with your subconscious, creating a virtual reality that you will have to unexpectedly overcome in order to win the game (playing a game, a girl playing in Allegra, a demonstrator of reality turns into Allegra, the “goddess of virtuality”. <br /> <br /> In what game would Heidegger play, to feel his abstract term yes-sein? To be truly involved in the world? <br /> <br /> What about Nietzsche (Yes, Frederick, God is dead, and you know that? Willem Dafo stands for him! - God, Mechanic -) ??? <br /> <br /> Yes, we create a story for ourselves, and, losing this thread, we follow from one day to another, break up into people as individuals; In eXistenZ, the fact is discussed that reality is the whole perception of oneself by everyone who actually does it, and sometimes we could get something elegant, the perception of virtuality in virtuality in reality.
