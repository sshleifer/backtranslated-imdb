Crossfire remains one of the best Hollywood films about messages, because, unlike the excellently planned gentlemen's agreement, which he broke in theaters for several months, he prefers to send his message through the form of an excellent noir-thriller, rather than constantly resenting what the star says “It's because I'm Jewish, isn't it?” It is much easier to understand that hate is like a loaded weapon when dead bodies are more metaphoric than actual. Somewhat embarrassing, but in the short note on the Warners DVD, there is no mention that the novelist Richard Brooks repudiated the film because of the transition from homophobic to anti-Semitic murder, but it is interesting to note that although the victim is killed mainly because he is a Jew, does Sam Leven have any doubt that the character is really gay too ?? not a caricature of a meat grinder, but in his scenes with the entangled soldier George Cooper there is definitely an aspect of two lost souls. There is nothing mysterious about who the killer is: even if the murder is committed in the classic shadows of noir, the killer's body language is instantly recognizable, but then the film’s characters converge to the same conclusion before halfway: the tension arises from proving this and save the falling guy. <br /> <br /> In the gang of soldiers who joined together, there is an element of Ealing Films to pull out his buddy (you could almost see this aspect as a project for Hue and Cry), but the atmosphere is pure RKO noir. Filmed in one long, stuffy night, the film has a magnificent view, filled with deep dark blacks and shadows, born not so much with economy as with style (it reduced the lighting time and gave director Edward Dmitrik more time to work with the actors) and the great cast is the best script: casual but quietly charismatic Robert Mitchum, detective Robert Young, similar to Megrat, tramp Gloria Grame and the eternally creepy Paul Kelly as her obsessive liar fan, a guy who tries on stories of other people example dissolved ties. But the indelible impression is caused by Robert Ryan's great game as a guy who could cope with good care alone, as he does his best to help the accused person mistakenly to the death penalty. The big surprise that happened in 1946 as a reward, Dmitri and producer Adrian Scott were investigated by HUAC, which itself had a noticeable tendency to chase the Jews. So much for the crusade ??
