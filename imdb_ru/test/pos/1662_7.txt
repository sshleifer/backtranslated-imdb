You can remove the spider from the joint, but it seems that it is extremely difficult to remove the joint from the hook. We have already seen this type of character in a similar situation before (and since): in films like BOB LE FLAMBEUR, ELEVATOR THE GALLOWS, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI, TAPES ANDERSON, etc. Too many times to mention. What helps to make this one of the most noticeable is (it is) the robbery itself, which takes place wordlessly in real time, and the behavior of the leader. Bogart will think twice before moving through this guy. The ironic ending is perfect for this story (almost requires). All around, one of the best noir films.
