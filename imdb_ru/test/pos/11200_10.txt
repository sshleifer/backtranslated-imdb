This is the last film of the trilogy of the brilliant Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan, whose last film “Maiis Sikintisi”, which was very Chekhov, was shown at prestigious film festivals. Unlike his previous films, the story of Uzak unfolds in Istanbul, which is one of the most populous cities in the world. However, in the film of Ceylan, we see only minor traces of this huge crowd. Rather, he decides to focus on two characters, one photographer and one of his relatives, who comes from his small village to find work on transatlantic ships. The photographer, who, as we understand, also emigrated to the city, seems to inhabit the customs of urban life, and not only in the material sense. Regarding his relative, we see him first and foremost caring and tolerant, however, when he cannot find a job, our suburban character begins to worry about sharing his personal “space” with someone whose departure date becomes ambiguous. I will not reveal the tactics he develops to pull his relative out of his life, to prevent any harm to your viewing pleasure, but suffice it to say that Ceylan shows us the tactics we acquire in the suburban life routine; “Tactics” that allows us to preserve our personal space, “tactics” that allow us not to communicate with other people, “tactics” that prevent the acquisition of a complex nature in our relations (since we believe that our own experience is rather complicated). br /> <br /> Ceylan's film presents a clear picture of who a person becomes within the boundaries of a modern (or postmodern) city, portraying the two characters in different ways. But he does not blame any of the two characters for this, but rather he uses the power of the cinematic language to emphasize this difference. For example, in search of new opportunities, we always see a character leaving the village in the open spaces. Even in the house, he prefers a balcony as his favorite space. On the other hand, we see the photographer always in closed spaces and generally at home. Although there are more than 10 million people and many adventures, there are many interesting things that need to be opened (or are there?), He prefers to sit at home, watch TV, etc. His house is like his temple, a kind of sacred place. <br /> <br /> Anyone who lives in a big city and knows about the experience he goes through will find something of his own in Uzak. If you like this movie, I'm sure you will like the other two Ceylan films: Mayis Sikintizi (Clouds of May) and Kasaba (City). Go and find them!
