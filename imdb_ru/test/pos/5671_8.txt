I found this film quite brilliant. Initially, I wanted “when the animals attacked,” clicked on the line “fish-frank” or even “rogue”, but I was given a truly terrifying ordeal, not without humanity. Having been in the places where it was done (including on the Crocodile farm at the beginning of the film, even with the same guide!), This added a fear factor. These crocodiles are really everywhere, although I don’t think they had the “attitude” of this beast. Yes, there were some melodramatic moments, but they contributed more to distracting from the whole atmosphere. I genuinely cared for the characters and shuddered, thinking "what would I do?" in their boat. Not knowing where your enemy was hiding or the sounds of night crocodiles, it was really scary. I would say that this film is one of the best horrors that I have seen in recent years (approaching the descent). I give him four bags of alligator leather.
