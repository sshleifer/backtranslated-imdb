This film is an excellent example of the greatness of the entertainment of the 80s. Oh, don't get me wrong, most of the music sucks then. I only liked the metal bands of the 80s. Groups that had a few balls. Forget this whiny muck on the keyboard and all this "terrible life, but I want to die." But the films of the 80s are the best. They were talking nonsense and just having a good time. This film illustrates this! A party! Get undressed! Leave it! WOOOOHOOOOO!
