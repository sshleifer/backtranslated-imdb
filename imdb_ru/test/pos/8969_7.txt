Charlie Wilson's war, based on a true story, tells the story of a Texas congressman and a CIA agent working to provide funding for covert support for the Mujahideen in Afghanistan in the 1980s after the Soviet invasion of the country. This conflict played an important role in the last years of the Cold War between the United States and the USSR. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of filmmaking, Charlie Wilson's war is a definite winner. It is well written, well acted and well filmed. While much of the attention was riveted on Tom Hanks for another great performance, I was even more impressed with how Philip Seymour Hoffman became CIA operative Gast Avrakotos. The scenes of Soviet attacks on under-armed villages and refugee camps are truly in the heart. The film also gives a good behind-the-scenes look at how Congressman Wilson is going to get the funding he wants. <br /> <br /> I have two complaints about the film. Firstly, there is a plot related to the investigation of the scandal, which is not very well developed and, thus, serves only as an insignificant distraction from the plotline. The second complaint is that the film lacks the context of the war. The film makes the Mujahideen look like innocent victims, and although they suffered great civilian casualties, the Mujahideen were actually rebels who tried to overthrow the government of Afghanistan. This government, completely ignored in the film, was not surprisingly struggling to quell the uprising, later calling on the Soviet Union to support their efforts. The film also ignores the fact that the United States helped the Mujahideen before the deployment of Soviet troops in Afghanistan. The film hinted at the unintended consequences of our hidden actions - the consequences that we still feel today - but it seems that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Mike Nichols were willing to sacrifice some historical context to provide a coherent story. (Without reading the book, I don’t know if George Krail made the same compromise.) Despite these complaints, I enjoyed watching Charlie Wilson’s War and recommend it. I would prefer a film that more accurately describes the complexities of the situation, as Stephen Gagan did in Siriana, but the audience was better associated with the consistent narration of Charlie Wilson’s war than with the ambiguities present in Syria.
