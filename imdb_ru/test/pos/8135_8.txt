WHEN in those golden days of “Silent Films” the idea was successful, you could argue that your repeated dollar will be repeated; although “recycling” is a term that is used. Of course, it can be argued that this redesigned business never leaves us, since success in film or television always leads to a trend; with all the competing parties fighting to come up with their own version of the mentioned popular movie or TV show. <br /> <br /> With this last premise, we strongly disagree; because it is copywriting or plagiarism, simple and straightforward. <br /> <br /> THIS, the last Silent Laurel & Hardy Short, surely should have been pretty well received; for ANGORA LOVE (Hal Roach / MGM, 1929) was reworked on Lot Roach, not once, but twice over the next three years. We were treated by LAUGHTER GRAY (Roach / MGM, 1931), in which the goat was replaced with a cute little puppy dog. Also, the weather turns into a dead winter, in the middle of a blizzard. They also made other changes to the lineup, replacing Edgard Kennedy's Landlord with Charlie Hall, Landlord. <br /> <br /> The second remake of the hidden animal room is 3 Reeler, THE CHIMP (Roach / MGM, 1932), which was replaced by a female monkey from a broken up and defunct circus in which Stan and Babe were former employees of Circus paid off his employees with his assets, and the boys got the Chimpanzee as their last payday. <br /> <br /> BACK to our original “victim”, today's topic, ANGORA LOVE. Recomember? A short start is quite simple. The boys meet the Goat in the street, and the nurse follows them back to their room; after Stan feeds her a donut. Subsequent comic moments are generated by the interaction between L & H and the slow-burning exponent, Edgar Kennedy, their Landlord. The impact of the incident is enhanced by the fact that the interaction takes place at night. And, with luck, it will be; their room is located directly above the Landlord’s apartments. <br /> <br /> In addition to the noise, the goat’s bathing, its smell and Landlord Edgar’s suspicions that another person is illegally in Laurel’s and Hardy’s room; Most of all we were amused by the little hype that the censors might not have noticed. Warning the boys about the noise they made, and reminding them of the house rules that strangers should stay there all night, regardless of their gender. <br /> <br /> HIS CAMERA MADE INSIDE The Boy's room, over his shoulder. With Edgar in the hall and facing them, he warns; "Remember, this is a respectable institution!" The moment he says this, a woman dressed in evening clothes walks through and behind the Landlord; accompanied by a sailor in uniform who raises his hat forward when they pass! POOL SHNITZ!
