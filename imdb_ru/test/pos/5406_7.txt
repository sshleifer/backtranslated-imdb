Another piece of darkness and denial hiding beneath the surface of the American suburb, Imaginary Heroes chronicles the life of the Travis family, all recover from the suicide of their eldest son. <br /> <br /> The couple in the center of the film is Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) and Tim (Emile Hirsch), both mother and son, both acting differently after death. While Tim is experimenting with prescription drugs and his own sexuality, Sandy returns to his old self, smoking marijuana and accepting the old infidelity act. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Sandy and Tim is well studied, especially when reference is made to the fact that they are both outcasts from their own family: Sandy because of her novel, and Tim because he was always in the shadow his more successful older brother. Significantly less time is given to her husband Sandy Ben (Jeff Daniels), who in the devastating image of denial orders Sandy to prepare an additional plate of food for his dead son and put it in the old place at the dinner table. Michelle Williams's older sister, Penny, is signed and can be easily removed from the film. <br /> <br /> Despite the long life span, Imaginary characters do not learn stories as much as individual stories deserve, although some of the filmâ€™s Black Comedy does not translate as much as the writer / director Dan Harris may have liked. And the image of the disturbed family dynamics is not depicted as much as in many other films with similar ideas. But despite some problems, the main roles of Weaver and Hirsch are staggering, and they easily bring the film to a successful conclusion. <br /> <br /> Rating: B-
