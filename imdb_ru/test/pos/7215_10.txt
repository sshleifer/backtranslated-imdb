It was the best film ever seen in the Germen's Cine Club (Buenos Aires). This film is a realistic critic of the society of the past and the next century. This made a very good impression on all the partners of the Germen's Cine Club. I recommend this movie to all Troma fans and to all people who love good movies, not commercial films.
