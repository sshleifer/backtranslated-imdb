Polish brothers are unique movie artists, and they really pushed through the envelope here. Fantasy, which has common features with the “Wings of Desire”, “Northfork” tells the story of a small town of the 50s epoch, located in the middle of the desert, which in two days is embarrassed to be flooded and flooded due to the desire of the US government to make a reservoir in the place where the city stands . This curve is a parable about loss and memory, which tells about angels, dreams, forebodings and the most cheerful government officials on land reclamation since the times of “Repo Man”. All performances are outstanding, especially Nolte and Woods. I noticed, reading some comments, that there are people who were hurt simply by the fact that Polish twins use the elliptical storytelling tactics, and I want to say that this is one of the things that makes this film so wonderful: its willingness to accept the mysterious as an aspect Everyday life. The cinematography of David Mullen is awesome. Highly recommended; if you had suffered a significant personal loss, such as the death of a parent, I would even call this movie a necessary viewing. - Ray
