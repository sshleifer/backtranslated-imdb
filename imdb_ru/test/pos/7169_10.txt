“WINDOW TO PARIS” is a funny and sharp criticism of Russian society and culture during the transition from communism, which also shows the West in an unfavorable light. A group of Russians living in St. Petersburg (for example, the “window to the west” of Peter the Great) finds a magic portal that instantly takes them to Paris. Mom's film is really funny, and quite “strange”, constantly forcing even an exhausted viewer to look toned. Songs, sequences of dreams and delightfully disgusting bands of society from both cultures are mixed together to create an unforgettable and meaningful film. Anyone who is trying to understand the shift in Russian cultural attitudes after the collapse of the USSR should start here.
