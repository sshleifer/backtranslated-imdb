The main message Miller probably intended to see after the war crimes trials of Vishy is that hating someone without rational reasons is a waste of life. The character Meat Loaf, Fred, has known Lawrence for many years, and yet, when the time comes, at the direction of his fanatical supporters, he allows them to attack someone who is not part of their “target” group. For me, this is the most important message — it doesn't matter what Lawrence and his wife are doing from now on — they are marked and have a chance to save themselves by using the cause. Animal aggression and anger blinded Union Fred's thugs to reality. <br /> <br /> My friend suggested that I look at “The Wave” to find out how irrational hatred and evil ideology can capture people without even realizing it. I once conducted an experiment in a role-playing game, and was shocked to see how normal and balanced people welcomed the creation of a repressive police state that would endanger them all because it sneaked in stages. <Br /> <br /> Fred is the beginning, his friends from Los Angeles and the preacher's idol are the catalyst that pushes his neighbors over the edge to violence, not stopping to think what they are doing wrong. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Lawrence and Finkelstein is a Jewish shopkeeper - fascinating, because Lawrence almost completely loses its meaning: if the fanatics force out Finkelstein, where should he go? If his family escaped from the Nazis, what irony will again be tormented in the country of "freedom". <br /> <br /> This large poster (this is a fairly well-known propaganda article) that American families enjoy the highest standard. Living in the world is a very important detail. When you see this movie, look at the graffiti on the subway train and all the little posters. The message is also hidden there. <br /> <br /> This film should be included in the curriculum of every school, especially in our time, when so sensible people who are just extremists in thin masks are propagandizing baseless hatred.
