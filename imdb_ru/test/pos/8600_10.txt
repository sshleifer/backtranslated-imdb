In the light of a recent typhoon that hit the country hard (i.e., typhoon Ondoy), I thought about reviewing “Black Rain” (1988, Japan), chasing Shohei Imamura’s black and white masterpiece on the destruction and consequences of the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima in the final period of the Second World War. The destruction and consequences of both catastrophes (war and typhoon) can vary in degree and quality, but trauma and scar (physically and psychologically) still remain. <br /> <br /> A testimony to the strength of the film is that its images remain as powerful and indelible as they were for the first time. The only difference is that now, in my case, that viewing these images has gained a greater sense of sharpness and potency due to the direct experience of almost monumental weather disaster. There is a sense of kinship, so to speak. <br /> <br /> Imamura has always been one of my favorite Japanese directors. His films are always a pleasure to watch because of their anarchy, sensuality and earthiness: “In the Pornographers: An Introduction to Anthropology” (1966), “Eijanaika” (1981), “Warm Water Under the Red Bridge” (2001), his two winners are Palme d 'Or "The Ballad of Narayama" (1983) and "The Eel" (1997) to name a few. Given the mood of his films, who would have thought that he was once the assistant director of Yasujiro Odzu, the most rigorous and minimalist director of Japanese cinema? But then, this is a strict formality and Ozu's home life, against which Imamura rebelled. <br /> <br /> But again, with the “Black Rain” you can unmistakably sense the imprints of Ozu. The father (or father's figure) intends to see his daughter marry before the time runs out for both of them, and the stillness and serenity of scenes showing all family members together (in particular, the scenes of dinner or in the film Ozu). film vocabulary, tatami) - this is what the revered master cinematographer constantly explores in his works ("History of Tokyo", "Late Spring"). In fact, the muffled and deliberate quality of “Black Rain” is a wonderful contrast with the orgy of chaos and instinctive impetus throughout Imamura's filmography. <br /> <br /> However, this does not mean that watching a movie will not be a completely disturbing experience. “Black Rain,” as Leonard Maltin, an American reviewer, aptly described, “is filled with obsessive black and white images.” In the first 15 minutes of the film, Imamura unmistakably demonstrates the direct and graphic horrors of nuclear bombing one after another (burned bodies, hanging flesh, the walking dead, fires and debris everywhere, insanity in everything). The attack on the feelings of the audience, of course, in combination with a dark black and white photograph of Takashi Kawamata (he removed the lens in the crime drama Yoshitar Nomura "Incident") and a terrible account of Thor Takemsu (he made music in such classical genres as Ran by Akira Kurosawa and “Double suicide” by Masahiro Shinoda). <br /> <br /> Even during the supposed “calm” phase of the film (that is, five years after the atomic bombing), the person still never has a sense of contentment and order, although anxiety and pain are still strongly felt by the survivors. , not only in terms of deterioration of physical health, but also in terms of psychological trauma and social stigma. The human race, now indisputably seems, was destined to carry the legacy of the bomb, as long as he lives. <br /> <br /> I already wrote an article about Black Rain several years earlier (published on IMDb.com), but only in comparison with Volker Schlondorf’s magnificent “tin drum”, another film dedicated to monumental human stupidity and global catastrophe. Moreover, I have never written twice about the film, which I already wrote about earlier. It was in the light of the recent weather disaster that devastated our country that I was invited to revisit and write something else about this wonderful film “Imamura,” since many lessons can be drawn from this film and a recent event regarding the imperfection and danger of scientific knowledge. and actions, as well as long-term scars and wounds inflicted by large-scale destruction (either as a result of human or nature). <br /> <br /> films about nuclear catastrophe and destruction (“Testament”, “Threads”, “War Game”, each of which is in their own countries), and “Black Rain” is among them, if not more, for their impregnable and gloomy image of individual and communal disintegration caused by atomic destruction, and the fact that it is based on a historical event. <br /> <br /> In a few weeks, another film about the Hollywood disaster, Roland Emmerich, “2012,” finally hits (not a pun) the big screen. As we all know, this film by the American director Disaster / Apocalypse - Independence Day, Godzilla, Day After Tomorrow - serves no other purpose than to have just entertainment value without real understanding of the nature and wisdom of an apocalyptic catastrophe and human conditions it affects. I wonder how this “gigantic” film would exploit the trauma, disorientation, and fears that our people are still experiencing due to the recent disaster. To say that this click is a warning story would probably be nothing more than an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> But yes, I will still watch "2012".
