pretty good, don't expect anything high culture ....... the acting is bad, the storyline fails, but it's still a pretty good movie to watch. What for? because it is dark, a little silly, how unpredictable and just interesting and interesting to watch. do not expect anything, as I said, just look at it yourself, and you will understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> This is a movie without a plot or an unforgettable game, but there are enough scenes that make you laugh, cry or at least make you feel satisfied until the end ... <br /> <br / > This is all I wanted to say .... 7/10
