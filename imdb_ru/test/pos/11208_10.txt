Hysterically painful; perhaps Chekhov would have made such a film if he had made films. What is really funny is that the two cousins ​​have a lot in common (many of the descriptions of their relationships on this site are absolutely wrong). <br /> <br /> What is really funny and uncomfortable about these characters is that they simply can’t force themselves to talk to each other - or to anyone else! It's horrible. If you have ever been too shy, worried, passionate about yourself or just scared to talk to someone (and who isn’t?), You will definitely see yourself in this film. And it will not be beautiful. <br /> <br /> It holds a mirror in front of an audience and says: “If you don’t like what you see ... change it.”
