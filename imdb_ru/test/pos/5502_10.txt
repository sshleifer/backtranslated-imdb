For some inexplicable reason, Jerry’s films often seemed to be diatribes from certain circles, although they were rarely the disappointment of box office. For me, this is one of the greatest mysteries of life, because his films have always had a “feel good” factor for me. But this film is not only not bad: it is a very good and clever comedy. Those who can tickle “modern” rough or cruel humor, do not watch this film: there is nothing of the kind in it, and you will waste your time. <br /> <br /> I only saw this movie once on TV. Since then, I have been waiting to see it again, and it has been quite a few years. You would think that the idea of ​​an arrogant millionaire businessman going to win the war against the Nazis with their own small private army of subordinate employees would be boring, wouldn’t it? Well, only Jerry Lewis would dare to try such a plot for the comedy "From and to", and this, I must say, works brilliantly. <br /> <br /> I think that, as in “Nutty Professor” and most of his In other films, this film demonstrates his comic genius, both in concept and in performance. I think that Buddy Love could say: “You know, a real comedy can not only cause a six-year tantrum, but also his father.” Maybe a few crazy Nazi generals with monocles and limp won't like this film, to be honest. If you see only one comedy in your life, watch this. Be careful, you may die of laughter. And I'm not joking!
