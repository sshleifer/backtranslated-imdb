Considering the acting roles that he played in the 1940s (Casper Gutman, Signor Ferrari, Mr. Peters, Jerome C. Arbutney, former Superintendent Grodman, Count Fosco, Titus Semple), many of his fans are surprised that Sydney Greenstreet originally did a name for yourself in comedies on the West End and Broadway. Usually he was such a complete villain or serious public actor that his comic talents were ignored. In fact, he actually made four comedy appearances (one deception from his villainous images with his villainous partner Peter Lorre in a cameo role). His best full-blown movie appearance in a comedy was probably from the magazine publisher Alexander Yardley on Christmas Day in Connecticut (although his self-willed, half-crazy soap magnate in Hunters is second place). Despite some problems with the script, this is a good film, usually revived during the Christmas season. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stenvik) writes a column in American Housekeeping magazine in Yadley magazine, where she gives household tips and cooking recipes. She is the version of Martha Steward of 1945, except that Ms. Steward is a cook and a householder, and can vouch for having tried and tested what she is protecting. Stanwick can't. Her culinary recipes belong to her friend Felix (SZ Sakall), the chef and restaurateur. The house, which she describes as her house (model house in Connecticut), belongs to her unofficial guy, architect John Sloan (Reginald Gardiner). Gardiner really does not mind marrying Stanwick, but she is not quite ready to consider a final commitment to him. <br /> <br /> When the movie starts, the American was wrecked by the Nazis. This is Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor. He spent two weeks on a raft before being rescued. Feeling advertising value, Greenstreet decides to satisfy Morgan’s desire to have a real old-fashioned Christmas in Connecticut. He basically tells Stanwick that she will entertain Morgan and himself on her farm for the holidays. She cannot explain that the image of her columns (along with her ability to flip flaps and raise a child she allegedly bore with her husband) is a lie — if she does, she will be dismissed, like her immediate superior, Dudley Beecham (Robert Shane ). At the moment of depression, she accepts Gardiner's marriage proposal, and then Gardiner discovers that his home in Connecticut is becoming the "real" home of Stanvik, himself and "their child." <br /> <br /> Of course, apart from postponing Greenstreet's curiosity, Stanwyk and Morgan find themselves falling in love with each other (much to Gardiner's annoyance, he really expects Stanvik to marry him anyway). Complications occur after complications, when a lie falls on a lie, and when the children of the neighbor follow the children of the neighbor, before Greenstreet begins to wonder if he has not missed something. But this is a comedy, so everything works well. In the end, even Greenstreet amused all this madness - his famous hearty laugh, reflecting on Santa Claus for a change. This is not a classic comedy, of course, not very good, but funny enough for the season to be worth seeing in December.
