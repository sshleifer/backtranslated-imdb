The film did not help ANYTHING, in promotion: if there was an advertisement on television or radio, I did not see it / did not hear it. The only ad in the newspaper that I saw was on his first weekend: a dirty, dirty black and white photo of Andy as Val-Coma behind bars with the headline: "WANTED! The runaway robot! ”(Which was also a poster in front of 3 cinemas in which I saw it - NOT a cute little color poster on this site, with headdresses of all the actors and the Crimebuster cartoon - that was NOT really good - they MUST to use the scene from the film itself - didn’t they have a novice photographer? The poster should HELP the potential audience decide if they want to SEE the film - there were so many people who could not help but choose their sold-out choice, and wanted to know WHAT was Heartbeeps - and This poster did not help! This dirty card Inca and the only other photographs provided for the papers were so indistinguishable in black and white that they cost nothing.) There was NO movie trailer: just a slide in one theater consisting of the heart-shaped “Heartbeeps”, with Cupid's arrow through it, and one that was a completely black picture: only Andy and the Voices of Bernadette, saying, "Val-Com! My pleasure center is malfunctioning!" "So is mine; do you think we should tell our owners?" THIS does not help people who did not know about the film. <br /> <br /> During the shooting, Andy told reporters that he could not eat as soon as his plastic lips were applied, so he “loads” for breakfast and quickly "during the day's shooting. I don’t know what THAT did Bernadette: but at that time I wondered why they didn't just sip protein drinks through a long straw or eat astronaut-style mashed potatoes through test tubes? <br /> <br /> Phil-Ko, the little robot, seemed to be the background of shorty Johnny -Five with the same eyes, a similar face. I tried to find out if they had the same designer, About no help. I have vintage magazine articles about the film, and the design team was very proud of their work and was going to get a special award for their innovative device to create a tasteless “smoke” for Catskill cigars. Shortly thereafter, LucasFilm did NOT use this device, although MUST have it, for the scenes of the Return of a Jedi with Jabba Hut: the man created a “pair” around Jabba, blowing cigar smoke into the tube, joking that all he needed was a glass of brandy and he would be a happy man. I thought that using real LucasFilm tobacco products was insensitive to people who were upset by the smoke. <br /> <br /> John Williams, who recently replaced the late great Arthur Fielder as the maestro of the Boston dads (which was ONLY a rating hit, but he never recovered from Fielder's death, and now is a shadow of his former glory), used the show to promote the films with which he delivered music. There he staged the premiere of "The Empire Strikes Back"; and you think he would help the Heartbeeps by playing a few numbers there? Critics liked this film - Williams rating, but it was impossible to buy it! In 1982, I saw one vinyl album with half Heartbeeps, half another movie, but it disappeared. I just saw the CD listed on THIS site tonight and ordered it. If I can ever get a scanner and time to print articles, I would like to create a site dedicated to Heartbeeps. I liked the movie, and I don’t care what the dissenters say! <br /> <br /> The only problem with the film was that, towards the end, it was logically corrupted: the robots ran away from the factory to have the freedom to decide their own destiny, to make their own choices; nevertheless, when landfill owners tell them that Phil must go to the factory to program the “target”, they do not even question it; they just look at each other meaningfully and leave. Along the way, each adult loses battery power and "dies." They are NOT REALLY dead because they are robots and they only need new batteries, but this is considered “death” when little Phil cries over them and rolls back. So, what was the point of this? Phil never returns to the factory and gets "goal!" And, of course, landfill owners CAN manage them or give them all battery recharges using backup batteries; but the real goal was to have this sharp scene where all the robots are wearing out and Phil is still crying. <br /> <br /> In the end, Val-Com is a golf instructor, and Aqua-Com I’m not sure that. Catskill - ENTERTAINER - who else should he be? I'm not sure they made it clear. The owners of the landfill seem to be calm, lying on the sun loungers, drinking lemonade from Phil, their “bartender”. A new “daughter” of Val and Aqua, Phylesia — I think her name is — maybe Sylvania — it seems not much more than a desk lamp. <br /> <br /> There is no footage, which is sad - from the photographs, I assume that there is a cute scene in the missed material, where Phil has Christmas, and Val gives him the wheel of a car; Aqua supplies the horn; Catskill took the fireman's helmet to give Phil, as we saw; and they have Christmas trees. I do not know if the footage contains better logic, or the authors simply could not come up with a better crisis / resolution. The film was cut to 72-75 minutes to combine it with other unsuccessful films. There is no other reason than this. As for the DVD, I LOVE to be in the making, as I want to see interviews with cast / crew and John Williams, as well as interviews with Merv Griffin. Video production; and rethinking and restoring the footage to make it better.
