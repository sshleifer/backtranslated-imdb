Amazingly effective British drama about two completely different people who find points of contact, and in particular about the "flourishing" of one of them. The embittered young man of the type “Spike” (McEvoy) with Dr. Deuchennes is placed in a house for the disabled and quickly makes friends with the young man (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson never knew anything outside the house, but McAvoy knows, and he is obliged and resolutely to return to the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this funny, heartbreaking and often heartbreaking story of inner strength, overcoming physical disabilities. The two leaders are awesome, especially Robertson, who probably spent some time studying the disabled to cope with this tricky role. He appears in almost every scene and makes an absolute storm. Anyone who does not know might think that he really has CB. Highly recommended.
