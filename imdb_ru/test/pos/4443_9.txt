This early film from the future German master Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre. Being in rural Italy, the serial killer of children is free. Add to the mix an array of characters familiar to giallo cinema fans ?? a crazy newspaper reporter, ineffective police, a sexy siren, a priest, a dumb girl, a mentally retarded loner, etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70s. <br /> <br /> Unusually for giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes the transition from more typical women from the angle of danger. The fact that children are the goal of a maniac only makes things a little more uncomfortable. Here, Fulci pushes the envelope a little further, and he goes even further into the unPC's magnificently outrageous scene, where the young boy is subject to the somewhat inappropriate attention of a sexy naked young woman (Barbara Boucher), who is tasked with delivering the drink. She shows herself openly and actively invites the young man to laugh at her; eventually asking him if he wants to go to bed with her. Although she clearly plays with him, it’s still a rather unusual scene. Admittedly, there are one or two unintentionally funny pieces of dialogue, but he is very beautifully photographed, and Barbara Boucher shows a high level of confident sex appeal. Great scene. Even if you feel a little unwell, watching it! <br /> <br /> Along with Barbara Bush, another outstanding performance is Florinda Balkan, who plays a crazy woman accused of killing children. She is not directly responsible, but the viewer is left to decide whether her black magic could or could not cause subsequent murder. Regardless of the fact that she is haunted by a mob of vigilantes and beaten with a chain, while the car radio blasts rock music. This scene is very strong and unpleasant. His viciousness indicates the path that Fulci’s career will follow. <br /> <br /> Despite the internal impact of the above killings, it may be a little surprising that other killings are either bloodless or off-camera. The only other death scene comparable to the Lynch mob is the killer’s death at the end of the film, although this sequence is rather stupid. The plot is confused and overflowing with red herrings, although I personally found the killer's identity a bit predictable. This weakness is less problematic in subsequent scans. Like most others, “Don't try the duckling” is highly suitable for re-viewing. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani ?? especially recurring unaccompanied female vocals, which sounds as if it comes from a distant hill. Fulci obviously continued to do more violent graphic horror films, but here he shows talent for a little more restrained material. This is still a wild material, although it is highly recommended for Giallo fans.
