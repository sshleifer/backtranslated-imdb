* CAUTION, SPOILERS !! PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT THAT THE FILM IS LIKED !! It. That's why my friend and I planned to see him after school today. Boy, we are glad we did. The film begins in Italy with a planned robbery with a group of guys (Charlie Crocker [Mark Wahlberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, also known as "Napster" [Seth Green, nickname you will receive later)] Handsome Rob [Jason Statham], The left ear (Mos Deaf) and John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) are planning a robbery to steal 32 gold bricks. This leads to the entire discovery, which is a good 10-15 minutes, and includes a boat chase that opens the film straight. Leaving in their van, Steve Frecelli turns on the group, steals the gold and kills John Bridger, who is largely (outgoing) leader of the group. We’ll go quickly in a year, where Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John’s daughter, is one of the best safe breakers everyone can ask for. Charlie Crocker (who was in fact indirectly responsible for the death of her father, because he called him out of retirement for the robbery), says that they found Steve (who hid), and want to take revenge on him for what he did, First she refuses, but later agrees, and the team again gets together with the help of a Wrench mechanic (Frankie J) to perform the perfect robbery while creating one of the biggest traffic jams in Los Angeles history. This film is the perfect combination of action with funny pieces. There is a constant joke about the character of Seth Green, Lyle, the creation of Napster and how Sean Fanning (who shoots a cameo) stole him when he fell asleep, and ultimately Lyle will respond only if he is called “Napster”. There is even a funny line in Seth’s film: “He said in an interview that he called him“ Napster ”because he described his hair as if he were a diaper. He called it that because * I * dozed when he stole them! ”The beginning and ending sequences are pure genius, and everything between them is perfect. The only negative thing I can remember in the film is that Edward Norton's acting was a bit weak. He was not a big, tough bad guy. He behaved as if he were being paid, and he just did the least, which is a fact, because he was forced to star in this film due to contractual obligations. But even though this problem is the only real complaint about the film, the film is still very pleasant, and I definitely recommend watching it. And even if you're not interested in the movie itself, go see how Seth Green shines in a comedic role. He's perfect. Rating: **** of *****
