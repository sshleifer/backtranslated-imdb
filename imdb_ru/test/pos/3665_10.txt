When I grew up, I watched my beautiful films about Bollywood - you know, a typical plot: a boy meets a girl, a girl rejects boys, a dacus (bad guys) removes a girl, a boy saves a girl, killing hundreds of dacus, and they happily marry (of course I missed an hour of numbers in musical style). Well, if you look at Hari Om, I was expecting another typical Bollywood film; however, to my satisfaction, this turned out to be atypical and really quite comical. “Hari Om” Bharatbaly is what can be called one of those “unique” Indian films, like the ever-popular South Asian hits, such as “Monsoon Wedding”, “East is East” or “Bend It Like Beckham” . <br /> <br /> “Being South” A decent Asian and watching various classic Bollywood films, there were a lot of humor and sub-dialogues that could be remembered, which reminded me of the funny and charming side of Indian culture (for example, various Indo-pop numbers that were actually converted by Nitin). Sony or witty Indian slang, which was used). Hari Om may appeal to all South Asians, and also entertains those who are not used to Indian humor, since the characters and the plot serve the entire audience. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, a film about the driver of an auto-rickshaw (aka “four-wheel drive” for those of you who know that you came to India), played by Wii Raaz (from “Monsoon Wedding”), who gets himself involved with a fraudster and ultimately owes him a lot of money. To avoid selling his four-wheeled Madhuri car, he accidentally avoids Madhuri and a very charismatic and sweet French woman Isa (Camilla Natta), who avoids the boredom of her boyfriend Benoit (Jean-Marie Lamur, who was in the pool) . A film about their journey, traveling through the beautiful landscape of Rajasthan ?? land of love stories; through humor, you see two main actors trying to figure out who they really are. <br /> <br /> What made the night most memorable was the presence of a director, executive producer, editor-in-chief, and even Mrs.'s mother. Natta is present at the show. After talking with Bharatbala (who actually has a background in zoology), many interesting moments of the film were discovered, including: the completion of the film just 10 days before the Toronto International Film Festival and only 45 days to shoot, and only five actors in the film . performance (all the others were real actors for the first time). When I came home, I understood two things from the film - that there is always a human connection between us, despite our differences, and, secondly, as the director said: “Everyone has a love story”. <br /> <br /> This is a must see for everyone!
