So begins "One crazy summer", the evil twin "Better than the dead ..". How can any movie be bad if David Lee Roth sings the first lines? <br /> <br /> This film is a blast. Reconnect John Cusack with Curtis Armstrong, but this time adding Bobcat Goldwaith to the mix gives excellent, fun results. Hyperactive Bobcat torments everyone’s nerves, Curtis Ak Ak is the son of an insane army with pacifist leanings, and Demi Moore (with natural breasts ... wow!) As a love interest, again, chronically suppressed kyus. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple. There is laughter, but both Savage Steve Holland films have a certain quality ... they are funny, but also cute. The scene where Curtis finds the blasted doll on the target training beach and begins to reflect on how the little girl cannot sleep was silly, funny and touching. The animation used is rather surreal. The “boat” is hysterical (complete with Watsamatta U. sail and Odie plush doll). In general, a funny movie, although not as good as "Better than the dead ..."
