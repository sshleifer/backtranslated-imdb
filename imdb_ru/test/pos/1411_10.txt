The theme of the song often passes through my head after all these years. I was never a big TV viewer, probably because I was just starting my busy teenage years when my family bought our first set in 1948, and it never became part of my life. But from the first episode of “Loman” I was hooked, and this is the only TV show I've ever planned for a week. <br /> <br /> A clever, believable, well written and well played, and John Russell is still for me the most handsome man I have ever seen. (Peter Brown wasn't a dog either: o) <br /> <br /> I agree that this is one of the most underrated TV shows of all time. I hope I can find some episodes for my grandchildren to watch.
