Eric Bogosyan gives the same great performance you have ever seen in the Oliver Stone film. His character Barry is an assault rifle disguised as a man, and he blows anyone away, on the air or from the air, that offends him. Talking Radio, based on Bogosyan’s stage play, is a vicious and frightening trip that does not let you go until it is too late. By the time you are already familiar with the crowd of racists, rapists, paranoids, scum-killers and just pranksters who listen, speak and hide in the darkness of the night Dallas. <br /> <br /> Stone behaves himself, if at all possible, allowing Bogosyan to dominate every scene, from Barry’s humble beginnings to the moment of creation or breakthrough, when his broadcast can reach national syndication. The rest of the cast is equally superb as lovers and / or colleagues, all of which were used and rejected by Barry. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can change is the repetitive themed music "Bad To The Bone". I would use the “Not Fragile” Bachman-Turner Overdrive. The best song I haven’t heard in the film so far, and a ruthless melody, the ominous riff of which resembles Barry’s true soundtrack to life. <br /> <br /> Listen, if you dare!
