According to this reviewer, the best time for a child was in the 1990s, at a time when cartoons were not subject to harsh censorship, and talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family entertainment to hit the airwaves. The best producers of Saturday morning animation were on Warner Brothers television, who had a great golden age with the dream team of Steven Spielberg, Tom Rugger and Paul Dini. Along with the serious and gloomy TV series, such as Batman, they also revived crazy crazy cartoons, famous for Looney Tunes. Animaniacs was the biggest hitter with his dark adult humor and homage to celluloid from past and present, but Tiny Toon Adventures were equally popular, reinventing Looney tunes for the new generation, while retaining that insane cartoon violence and intellectual comedy, can hold onto any age group, no matter how old. Even when Little Toons were stretched to the full-length film “How I Spent My Vacation,” it wasn’t like the longer episode of a television series, a curse that so often plagued other full-length adaptations of popular animated shows. /> <br /> Tiny Toon Gang are young descendants of classic cartoon characters who made the audience laugh back in the 1940s and 1950s and are currently studying the cartoon comedy to “earn their Cartoons degree”. The summer holidays have begun, and each character has his own idea of ​​what to do. Buster Bunny (Charles Adler) and Babs Bunny (Tress MacNeil) begin a battle with a water pistol, which ultimately leads to the flooding of Acme Acre and their departure on the Mississippi. Plucky Duck (Joe Alaska) joins Hamton Pig (Don Messick) on a cross-country car ride to the world's happiest theme park, but the Hamton family turns out to be more difficult than he thought. Meanwhile, in other stories scattered everywhere, Elmira Duff (Cree Summer) is trying to find a cat to hug and squeeze her, Fifi Le Phume (Kat Sousi) is trying to go out with her favorite skunk star and Shirley Lun (Gail Matius) ) goes to the cinema with a loud "Fowlmut" (Rob Polen). <br /> <br /> Although a subtle premise sounds for a full-length film, many directors and writers make all the stories work together. The best of them is Pluka's unsuccessful trip, which uses the golden comedic opportunity very well: to feel pity for someone, as well as to laugh at their predicament. The irritated reaction of Pluka to everything bad that happens to him is a perfect combination of script and animation, all within the confines of a small machine filled with pork. The story of Elmira definitely ranks second, just to see how a small, almost innocent girl can cause fear in many jungle animals. The aforementioned cartoon violence definitely comes to the fore with the story of Buster and Babs, which makes us smile not only because of the fun results, but also nostalgically, because Rugeger and the company probably won't allow half of what they are doing in this segment. Almost half of this segment plays a parody and a tribute to Deliverance, including an ingenious twist on the duel banjo scene with the unforgettable theme song Tiny Toon Adventures. <br /> <br /> Part of Tiny Toons' universal appeal is that humor turns out to be very smart, because it targets subjects with ferocity, which proves that it does not deserve the title of “children's fare” with which people seems to spank him. The whole segment showing bad etiquette of Faulmut in the cinema makes fun of the yaper in an impeccable way, as well as an additional blow to the THX Lucasfilm logo. This scene is made so perfectly that it should be shown before every show in the cinema. There are also a couple of moments that ridicule the Disney world, the cinematic holes in the plot, and even the legal department of Warner. The fact that modern cartoons are boring and not creative makes these intellectual moments even more valuable, because there probably won't be another cartoon series that will be close. <br /> <br /> After watching the film “How I spent my vacation” for the first time in many years, I can say with confidence that they don’t make cartoons as they did before. With the ongoing censorship that today's family entertainment is receiving, the question arises whether this will ever be done again. This review is not only a recommendation of a truly clever film, but also a call to Spielberg, Rugeger and Dini to come together again and call our magical creation again. The Lord knows that the children of the twenty-first century need something with the mind of Tiny Toon Adventures. This is not just a money grab, it is a wonderful film, full of spirit, mad chaos and fun.
