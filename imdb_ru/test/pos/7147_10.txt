I really liked this love film between two adults in post-war Britain. BBC's high television standards are evident in the production, and the excellent lead actors (Claire Bloom and Joss Ackland) make it an inspiring experience. Bloom and Acland had previously worked together in the theater, and their chemistry and interaction are great. I recommend this version of Shadowlands on top of a 1993 film version.
