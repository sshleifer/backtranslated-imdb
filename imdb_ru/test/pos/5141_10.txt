I took my younger niece for an early show, and she LOVED it (I also liked it). I do not need to explain the plot, because the film remains completely faithful to the award-winning, best-selling book of the famous author Carl Hiasen. The film takes a popular book and shoots it with beautiful cinematography (I want to go to Florida now!), Humor (thanks to a funny person, Luke Wilson and some newcomers) and great music! I need to get a CD with Jimmy Buffet now! I know that the movie is good when at the end I get goosebumps. Overall, it was a great family film, in which I felt comfortable taking my younger niece. I would recommend this to everyone.
