I do not know what it is, but the film happily sits on my shelf, not thinking about ever leaving me ... Fulci created one of the most ridiculous, bizarre, filled with cheese and completely unique films that Iâ€™m ever seen. Not sure what else to say about this, but I love this movie !!! The steak-tartar scene is absolutely noisy, and the whole fascist fiasco with Nazi torture is strangely ridiculous ... I'm not sure what Fulci was trying to do, but somebody heard that, based on this film, Fulci blamed Wes Craven for tearing with a scream? "Cat in the brain" - the need for bad movie lovers everywhere ... Yes, I will definitely say that this is not a "good" film, but I guarantee that some scenes will remain in your memory forever! This exercise is crazy, people ... I think if I were a "serious" critic, I would give him 3, but out of sheer joy (again, I can't explain my feelings), I would give him 7 ... . Really torn movie ...
