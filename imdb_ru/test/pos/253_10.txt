When I watched this movie, he reminded me of all the greatest dreams that I had (mostly robots). <br /> <br /> I can relate to the problems of Eledor, I have similarities with Shirou, and this is a great movie to watch (if you are a goth who is bitter and eccentric like me!) In general, look, until it is out of print!
