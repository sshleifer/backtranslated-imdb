There is more to this movie than it seems at first glance. If you are looking for revolutionary originality or light comedy, you will be disappointed. But for an entertaining 90 minutes, that's just great. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is thorough and accurate. Sex scenes, which one comment declares unreasonable, are not at all the fact that every gesture contributes to the development of characters. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of the main characters are not exactly nice people. But the film makes sincere efforts to show their interaction in an honest light, without being sensational (at least not for the city standards of the beginning of the 21st century). And there are a lot of very funny moments.
