I freely admit that I did not see the original film, but I read the play, so I have a little background with the “original”. If you dismiss the fact that this is a remake of the old classics, this film will be smart, witty, fresh and fun. Yes, casting decisions may seem strange, but they WORK. <br /> <br /> I’m a convinced feminist, and this film did not hurt me at all - despite what other women say. This is NOT a movie for men (so please, ladies, don't drag your guys to watch it with you, it's just cruel); women will get jokes, situations and relationships. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the depth Annette Bening brought to her character ... she did a great job. Debra Messing was charming, and Candace Bergen was fantastic. Meg Ryan made less of an impression on me ... she brought emotions to the table, but her comedic look at her was less strong. The female cast is strong and this is definitely a funny comedy. I really liked this movie, and I'm going to watch it again with my mother. Women will understand.
