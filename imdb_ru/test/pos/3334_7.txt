The above summary was not really intended as a blow to this film, as the series followed in a very similar format. As usual, the Simon Templar ("Holy") meets a woman in need and comes to her rescue. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was accused of taking bribes. Along the way, he meets some interesting support characters (this time Paul Gilfoyle as the “Pearl” Gates), and during the disclosure of this not very convincing riddle (in fact, none of them is), the Templar is extremely erudite and simply classy! George Sanders is once again an unsurpassed sophisticated British virtue, and again he manages to make an excellent B-detective film. Nothing special, but a familiar and fresh product will surely please fans of the genre.
