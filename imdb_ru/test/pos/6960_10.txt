I highly recommend this movie. He blurs the line between children's fantasy and everyday reality so painlessly that you need to believe it. The actors and directors have such an ideal time that in one scene the battle named by name becomes a kind of dance. I loved the storyline, the actors, everything. While I really think there was one or two obviously silly scenes, the whole movie was flawlessly made.
