Given that Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern English-language poetry, I was expecting a film that would be prone to the subject's hagiography. On the contrary, the poet is represented as sexually irresponsible, a drunkard, a poor father, a liar, a hypocrite, and possibly a coward. Of course, it can be argued that all these things are an advantage when someone is an artist and especially a poet, since one of the goals of art is to undermine the standards of generally accepted morality, but I still do not think that a positive role model could cut off from packs of personality traits. Anyway, I found another hero of Captain Killick's story to be a more attractive character. Two female roles were played by actresses Knigtli and Miller and were truly charming, especially the first time she sang songs in fine attire to inspire Londoners during World War II. Another good point is the role that sexual jealousy plays, even in relatively progressive environments that believe that age-old conventions can easily be transcended. The atmosphere of the Blitz was also convincing, as was the idea of ​​individual views among people who survived the war, unlike those who talk about it, theorizing about possible political results. I think we can recommend this movie.
