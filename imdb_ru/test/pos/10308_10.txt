Regardless of the veracity of the facts, the “Gangster Queen” is a true story, and it is true, because the topics with which she deals today contain as much truth as they did back in 1994. This film is violent, powerful and makes you wonder. The main character is a woman of flesh and blood, whose misfortunes revealed the best (or worst) of her. If we leave aside subjectivity, there is no doubt that the character of Phulan from a young girl of 8 years old, who married her father to pay off the debt (pun), for the leader of the gang, who later became the leader of the lowest caste. , turned into a champion in her own right. Her image is so powerful that the viewer is even ready to forgive her for the massacre. <br /> <br /> I can understand that if the Western public cannot appreciate this masterpiece, then the “Gangster Queen” should be “studied” in the Indian context, and not just tested in stereotypes. I may not be able to sell it at universal appeal, but it certainly needs to be watched by the Indian audience, it’s a shame that the film was delayed, clearly censored, in India. <br /> <br /> The Bandit Queen story of a woman who fought against two differences in India, being a woman and too low a caste, her rebellious nature and inability to simply give up, caused her most terrible life experiences, which only then strengthened her into the self-proclaimed goddess. She responded to the violence with violence, and she became the submissive woman that society wanted her to be. Call it divine justice or judicial failure if she killed the only person she was hanged for, she killed 24 people and was revered, respected and glorified. <br /> <br /> PS # Whoever finds her character as a “psychotic” needs him to be raped at 8, gangraped by 10 men on the move and exhibited naked. Then they need to be asked: how do they feel?
