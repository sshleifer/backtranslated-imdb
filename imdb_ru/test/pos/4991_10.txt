I am very impressed with the game of Comanche Moon. Before I started watching this, I didn’t expect it to be as good as the Lonely Pigeon. I could not believe how well the actors were chosen to represent all the characters. It struck me how well they played every role! In my opinion, it was almost as good as the Lonely Pigeon. It’s hard to compare any movie with the Lonely Pigeon. If you do not make this comparison, I would give a thumbs up. It was very interesting! I do not post a lot of comments on this site, but I just felt that I had to express my opinion there. Amazing I don't want to name every actor who was brilliant, because I probably should have listed each of them. My favorite was Steve Zahn. He hit his head with a nail, playing captain Gus. His manners were perfect.
