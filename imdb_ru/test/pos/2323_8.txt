I saw the movie in the cinema when it was released, then watched the VHS tape for many years, and walking along Target, I saw this DVD bundled with “Pushing Tin” for an exorbitant amount of $ 5.50. <br /> <br /> There is something in this comedy that really hooked me - like Kelsey Grammar, “with a tattoo on his thing,” is an unorthodox commander who inherited a rusty diesel submarine and a crew of chatterbox and losers. He opposes the best of the Navy - a submarine of the class "Los Angeles" - and his old captain (W. Macy). <br /> <br /> Bruce Dern plays the bad guy, and Rip Thorn - the admiral doing the exercise - if you don’t put on do not laugh hysterically during the “silence” segment with the chef, well, you have a different kind of humor from me. <br /> <br /> In the end, the driver says “DBF” without any explanation - this is obviously some internal knowledge gained from an old submarine consultant - thanks to Google, I learned that with the advent of nuclear submarines old salts will wear DBF pins - Diesel Boats Forever. <br /> <br /> One of the friends of the fleet said that many technical aspects are wrong, but who cares is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I don’t know I think a clairvoyant needs to know who will win this exercise!
