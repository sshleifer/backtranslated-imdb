In the middle of "Holes" I wrote to my friend by email to summarize. I'm not sure that the film will break into a series of submissive gestures, I felt a little awkward, recommending it, but then I saw the end. It's perfect. I live in Korea for 6 months, and this film can just as well sum up the strange fuss and frustration of any Asian metropolis, as it happens with Tywin here. He uses the myth of Hong Kong musicals just as Godard and Hartley use western musicals, but takes him to the extreme, it’s a harsh world, and sometimes Kafka’s logic makes it even better. I really feel that the closest comparison of The Hole is with Hala Hartley's Surviving Desire, but I have some cold advantage over what we ultimately hope is strangely metaphorical. In any case, this is what I wrote Esther. Hope you like The Hole too. <br /> <br /> Hey, <br /> <br /> watching the move called the hole. Taiwanese, I think, seems a little strange for China if it is not Hong Kong. it is worth seeing so far. it's about a guy and a girl in a residential complex. the ceiling of the guy bends, and the girl begins to get annoyed, and this is a rather strange metaphor for simultaneous pleasure, degradation and pain of quite strong love. there is also a kind of plot about a zombie virus and a lot of strange little scenes where a girl fulfills her desires through rather innocent and funny episodes of the 50s. worth seeing.
