Hari Om is an Indian greeting, and the irresistible title character of the film with the same name (performed by the wedding planner from Monsoon Wedding) welcomes you and sends you on a journey through the heart of South India. There are no backgrounds and stereotypes “Beat like Beckham”, but only light salutes to Bollywood music and dance (but the soundtrack is worth buying), but rather the feeling that you see real India, permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents stage to increase the performance of five professional actors. Fortunately for us, Hari Om's companion is a young and beautiful French woman in search of travel. With the help of the overture about the trip “Y Tu Mama Tambien” to self-knowledge (without sex and deadly disease), this wonderful film calms and returns the philosophical mind. Against the original juxtaposition of the main characters, everyone is identified with the features of both, and cultural inequality disappears when humanity enters. Most briefly, the central theme of the film: “Everyone has a love story, do not let your own pass,” teaches us a lot about love at different levels. Do not let this film pass you by!
