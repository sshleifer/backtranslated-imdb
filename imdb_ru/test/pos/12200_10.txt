The surface was one of the few truly unique shows on television last season. I can honestly say that I changed my schedule so that I could be at home to watch each episode. Tons of action, suspense, science fiction, etc. <br /> <br /> The story of a boy who found an egg that hatched into a sea creature. The same sea creature that killed the brother of the protagonist and the female character (oceanographer). Most people think that this is a deadly machine, but it was very friendly from the egg. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that NBC canceled it, so now we will never know what is going on ... I hope the science fiction or some other channel will raise it.
