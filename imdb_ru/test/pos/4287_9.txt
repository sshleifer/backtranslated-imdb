Here is a movie we shot weekly. Nowadays, it is rare to see a drama that depends on the actors talking to each other. <br /> <br /> There are no explosions, car chases or any harassment, there are alleged sexual situations. This is not true. the film for young people is for those who appreciate people talking to each other, they argue a lot, because we have a married couple who have problems with middle age. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson seem to be a very happy middle-aged loving man and wife. Living in the same small London suburb, handsome Rupert Everett returns home to visit his rich father. <br /> <br /> He certainly meets Emily Watson. Emily will easily hit anyone. I say no more, except that when the credits begin, a fatal accident occurs, the rest of the film is devoted to the consequences of this accident and all the lies that various characters tell. <br /> <br /> The game is a trio and the rest are excellent. <br /> <br /> Julien Fellowes wrote the script based on the novel by Nigel Balchin. He also directed, it was his first directorial attempt, and he did it very well. The whole production is first class. <br /> <br /> The film, which passed several months of theatrical performance at the end of 2005, has less than 80 cinemas. For me it's a shame, stupid comedies open on at least 2000 screens, but very good dramas, since this and many others open only on a few. <br /> <br /> By the way, in some situations there are very funny lines. . <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
