I just saw it by cable. I like it. That interested me, and the dramatic choices were good. The old couple was very good at being a bit creepy. Cinematography is not so good, but a battered video also adds a sense of realism, so this is a trade-off, you know Sometimes the girl hit hard on the New England accent. The emphasis seems to come and go. Anyway, I thought the film as a whole was well made. The storyline was strong and the dramatic tension persisted because you felt they were some kind of subtle mystery, although things seemed mundane. Good job with a low budget. Another good SUNY director's purchase. Way
