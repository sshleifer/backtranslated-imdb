People seem to expect Citizen Kane here! “Planet” is the film “B-monster”, and it is very good entertainment and quite diverse for them to enjoy. The director obviously has something to offer - not sure about some actors. As for the effects? £ 8,000 is not a big budget for effects. I would love to recommend this walk to science fiction or to those who do not take monster films too seriously. If so? Instead, look at 3colours blue. I noticed in one review that it blew off Alien. As if the Alien had not ripped things off. The best thing about the movie? Director The worst thing about the movie? Cast. Maybe the time has come for the Director to move from Glasgow to London and find talent. For now - well done. At least you are trying to do something.
