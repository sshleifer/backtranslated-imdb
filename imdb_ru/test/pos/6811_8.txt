The first in the new style of films for llamas - without a tattoo, motorcycle or karate. I, for one, miss them. But this is a serious film. He plays an FBI profiler who lived with the bad guys in his head for so long that he no longer trusts anyone, including himself. Gary Busey - or a great actor or someone I would not want to see in broad daylight on a crowded street. Cloak pursues the lama as hard as she pursues the serial killer. One surprise after another unfolds, the story unfolds, not the least of which is the final. It seems that it will never come - there is always another layer in history. Shred and Llama begin as good guys, turn into bad guys and somehow end up as heroes. But it is definitely worth the rental price. For maximum enjoyment, throw in a candy bar, a bag of popcorn and soft drink. You go to the cinema!
