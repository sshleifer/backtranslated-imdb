Spoiler begins The film is dedicated to three friends: Samantha (Summer Phoenix), Chris (Nick Stal) and Owen (Aaron Paul). The film begins with Sam and Owen as drug addicts, and Chris, the stars of the track, who cares about them. When Chris gets worse at home, he asks Sam what this drug looks like. At this point, Sam is out of rehab and sober and tells him that everything is getting better. Chris then catches up with Owen, and they start using. Chris needs two times until he becomes a “permanent member.” After some problems with the dealer and recognizing Sam, she enters again. So begins the downward spiral for them. Chris Od when he breaks Sam’s promise (I want part of the movie to be a surprise). He dies, Sam goes to college to become an architect, and Owen is arrested. so ends the story <br /> <br /> the spoiler ends. minor spoilers everywhere. He will have an Oscar once. His image of Chris was heartbreaking. He was the only one who felt real in the film about drug use. Aaron Paul, who played Owen, behaved as if he was on speed, and not on heroin. Summer Phoenix was fine, she is talented, but what can I say, Nick Stahl stole the film. His woozy eyes, his slow movements, everything was beautiful. <br /> <br /> Script writers needed to show pictures in the film. This is the main reason why people do not want to throw. Besides the fact that there are funny scenes (the scene in the mall and the scene of the Backstreet boy, Stahl’s man nailed the reaction right on the head.) park scene.) It was realistic. How C uses again when Chris wants to flush the drug down the toilet, and Chris again uses after going to Ounes, although he was clean for two weeks, the craving was too strong. it's all real. <br /> <br /> Watch a movie with a great cast, great music and a semi-truthful story about drug addiction.
