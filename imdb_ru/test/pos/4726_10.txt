This is one of the most underrated films of the 1990s. If you allow yourself to identify with the character Patricia Arquette, you will find that this is a very touching story about a woman who regains the meaning of her life and finds a new desire to live. <br /> <br /> Arquette's game is bold, because it is purposefully “wooden” - this is a way to determine the spiritual death of your character, her complete lack of desire to be alive. She moves through life like a zombie, because her family was killed, and she does not see the meaning of life. What moves is how in the course of history it awakens — the Burmese landscape, the wonderful quality of its people and landscapes, and the primary choice with which it is forced to confront. <br /> <br /> Burman supports it visually (and Hans Zimmer supports it with one of his most magnificent, haunting scores) with the help of an often static camera and with the ability to shoot through glass, windows, windshields, etc. like Arquette .... until she is deep in the jungle and will not be forced to choose whether to fight for her life. <br /> <br /> I also recommend the PURPLE PARENT 1954 film. This is a similar story in a similar setting, and it makes a fascinating comparison.
