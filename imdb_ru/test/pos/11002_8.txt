In Squire Gotos, Kirk and his team encounter a powerful super-creature that keeps the Captain, Kostya and several crew members in captivity for no apparent reason. I could be wrong, but I think this is the first Star Trek episode I've ever seen, and the program that made me crave for more. This is not one of the best episodes, but the unshakable premise of an alien creature that puts the Enterprise team into a corner is the situation that makes the show so interesting to watch. In a sense, a superhumanoid anticipates one of the most famous characters in Star Trek, the mysterious “Q” of the next generation. This episode is also remembered for the fact that he created a unique situation: this is the first time that Uhura participates in the action, and the story allows the viewer to see what the charming character of Uhuara can be when the story allows her. It is a pity that the show has never fully explored this cult figure.
