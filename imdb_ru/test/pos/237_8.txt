Another great musical from the Hollywood Golden Age! I liked this story about a film about three friends who perform in a small nightclub that is far from Broadway and all its brilliance. Although not so much, they are very satisfied with their lives and the small club in which they perform. Gene Kelly plays the owner of a small club, and is also the guy of one of his dancers, Rita Hayworth, who turned out to attract some attention when she is given the opportunity to be on the cover of a magazine. Gene Kelly is in trouble, as his friend is now talking about the city. Phil Silvers plays one of three friends and does a good job. Of course there is music and dancing. There is one dance performance by Gene Kelly. At night, he walks down the street and sees his reflection in a shop window. His reflection soon begins to dance with him on the streets, great cinematography. Don't miss it, great fun.
