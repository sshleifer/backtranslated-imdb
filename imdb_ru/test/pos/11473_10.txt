This is an amazing film that makes you sit in a chair waiting for the last minute of the movie, leaving a sweet taste on your horse racing: ... I want more! There are very good actors, Portuguese actors who have a lot of experience in the world of theater and cinema. This is not a budget film for a million euros, but we can still see the destruction of the car in a beautiful perspective, which will help you in this film. If you have the opportunity to get this great movie, do not wait a minute: just watch the movie! I think Portuguese films improve quality. Beware of Spanish manufacturers ... Portuguese get high quality standards. I saw the movie, and I'm waiting for more ...
