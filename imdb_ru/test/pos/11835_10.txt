This delightful, well-written film is based on the New York stage play of the same name, where Sir Aubrey (knighted by Sir Charles Aubrey Smith in 1944) created the role he plays in the film. Here, in 1931, we see him at the beginning of his acting revival in a very early era of “talkers” and as a character that he will play until his death in 1948 after the end of his last performance in “Little Women”, which is released in 1949. <br /> <br /> This exciting play tells about an elderly British aristocrat who finds his illegitimate children and meets them, bringing them to his estate in England. <br /> <br /> Marion Davis plays her daughter by mistake, and that is her strength. She is also charming, impatient, superficial, charming, wise and compassionate, creating an indelible and seductive character that is well remembered in memory. <br /> <br /> 26-year-old Ray Milland appears here in a small but prominent role already appeared in seven other films, that is, only in films, for a little over two years. <br /> <br /> The film should be used as a representative of the production of the Hollywood factory in 1931, and, of course, is not. flawless. However, this is a charming pleasure from the first scene to the last.
