“Water” (2005), the final part of the elementary trilogy of Indian director Deepa Mehta in Toronto, is finally completed, almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element “Fire” (1996), followed by a slightly less controversial continuation of “1947 : Earth "(1998). Mehta made her directorial debut with the 24-minute Canadian short film "In 99: Portrait of Louise Tandy Murch" (1975), but it was her Canadian film about the life of Indians living in Canada that brought her fame back to the east. her country by birth, "Sam and I" (1991). Recognition at the international level was made possible by Camille (1994), in which Bridget Fonda played the main role along with the actress, who in 1990 won an Oscar in the nomination “The best female role in the“ Leading Role ”category at the age of 80,” opened the way for middle age actresses. to still hope for her portrayal of the obstinate Jew in the movie "Driving Miss Daisy" (1989), the late Jessica Tandy. <br /> <br /> Camilla dealt with the friendship of two women from the other two ends of human life, the friendship from May to December. "Camilla" was the last picture of Tandy; she died the same year. <br /> <br /> International fame followed Deepa Mehta in 1996, when the scandalous “Fire” was released, which with fury spread among the false patriotic consciousness that exists in Indian extremists. Having already studied the friendship between the two women in “Camille”, in “The Fire”, Mehta took another step to portray more intimate relations between two single abandoned women. Located in modern India, a suburb of the capital of New Delhi, it features two brothers and their wives. The elder brother (Kulbhushan Harbanda), who joined a strange Hindu sect, leads a celibate life, faithful to his guru of a genderless existence. The younger brother (Javed Jaffrey) has an extra-marital relationship with a Chinese woman (Alice Pun). Thus, both wives, Shabana Azmi, who plays the brothers' older wife, and Nandita Das, the younger wife, are in their own way neglected. One is forced to lead a celibate life because of the eccentricity of her husband, and the other, whose only contact with her husband is through sex, and nothing more. Living in the world of relatives and being the only strangers in the family who have no one to trust, two women find themselves in each other’s arms. Thus, the problem of lesbianism arises. If there was a stranger’s shoulder about which one could cry, then most likely they would have a chance to fall into the arms of a man, but when there is no one to trust, their need for supporting each other is quite obvious. It does not necessarily indicate that all neglected women will ultimately engage in lesbianism, it just happens that they exist for two women in this context. In general, the film is excellent, and it is much deeper than two women rolling in bed. The focus is not on lesbianism in the film, but on the plight of modern disparaging Indian wives, even in the capital, two female characters just have sex. <br /> <br /> Two years later, Deepa Mehta’s second release was an element of Mother Earth, released in India under the title “1947: The Earth,” another great film by a great director, this time in Hindi, unlike "Fire", which was made in English. <br /> <br /> Now Dipe Mehta managed to complete the trilogy, despite many problems, having recently released the latest release of Water. Without a doubt, it will be as cool as the other two.
