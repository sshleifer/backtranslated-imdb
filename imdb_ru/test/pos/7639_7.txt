I gave these films 7 out of 10. I think that the general dislike for this film is connected with the fact that people do not quite understand the plot. If you think about the storyline, this film actually makes sense, but it just does not give you a stupid explanation. It's true that the special effects are not normal, and they seem to be semi-budgetary, but I think the originality of the plot keeps you in good shape. People say that the vampire genre has overdone and become clich√©, but with Bled you are not receiving your usual vampire film. This is a dream / alternate reality storyline with a vampire / eternal life spin. I like it. The only thing that kept me from a higher score was the lack of special effects and the fact that I personally do not like films in which most people have accents. But, as I said earlier, if you really get the plot, it's not a bad movie ..
