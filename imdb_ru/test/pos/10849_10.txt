When I made this film, I half expected it to be a low-budget rather than an Indy storyline film, but I decided to try it. I started watching Part 1 and couldn't tear myself away until it ended 3 hours later. It was one of my all time favorite movies of all time. From writing to staging the play, I laughed, wept and sang all the way from the Nana Astley rite from innocence to adulthood. Rachel Sterling in this movie is phenomenal. I have never heard of her before, but now I will remember forever the vulnerability and strength that I felt in her performance. She, Keely Howes and Jodhi Mae are incredible because they guide you through the emotional turmoil that most people feel when dealing with an alternative form of sexuality. The fact that the film was made in the 1890s not only informs the audience about homosexuality at the time, but also makes a statement about our society today. You should watch this movie and maybe, like me, go to the store to add it to your collection.
