"Glory" (1980) brilliant. All these qualities made the films of the late 70s so wonderful. He is proud of his bluntness and is not ashamed of what is overboard. <br /> <br /> A journey is really important here, not a destination. Ignorant idiots with a soap opera mentality will never understand that “Glory” is about the struggles, anxieties and victories of these young people, and not about their career. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, none of the very talented actors “Slava” did it in Hollywood. "Glory" marked the end of an era. The end of artistic freedom and experimentation and the beginning of commercialization and political correctness. This is the last statement of a generation that had its own voice. <br /> <br /> 10/10
