Wonderful little staging. <br /> <br /> The shooting technique is very modest - a very old BBC fashion and gives a comforting and sometimes uncomfortable feeling of realism throughout the play. <br /> <br /> The actors were chosen very well - Michael Shin not only "got all the polaris", but also has all the votes! You can really see smooth editing, guided by references to Williams' diary entries, it’s not only worth seeing, but it’s amazingly written and performed work. Workshop about one of the great comedy masters and his life. <br /> <br /> Realism really comes home with little things: the fantasy of a security guard, who instead of using the traditional techniques of “sleep”, remains solid and then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our feelings, especially with the scenes relating to Orton and Holliwell, and the sets (especially their apartments with Hollywell frescoes decorating each surface) are terribly well made.
