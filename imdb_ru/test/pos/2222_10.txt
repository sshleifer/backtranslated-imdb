One of the funniest movies I've ever seen in a theater in the early 70s, and, unfortunately, he has been on television only a few times since. This film should be released on video. This Sellers in his most slovenly, the worst of the best, as a crooked hospital administrator. Great cast, great movie. If anyone has a good copy of VHS, I would love to buy it.
