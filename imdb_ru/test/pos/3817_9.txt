"Outer Limits" is a brilliant show that for the most part leaves me with very strong emotions. Sure, there are a few stinker episodes, but essentially this is an old comedian turned into a television show, so this can be expected. For the most part, it is perfectly done, well prepared and directed, and often with some outstanding talents who seem to enjoy working hard to translate short fiction into an hour-long television format. <br /> <br /> Outer limits tend to focus on fairly large ethical / philosophical / moral issues and rarely end without voice acting, which leads to serious thinking. <br /> <br /> From time to time, topics get a little overpowered for all but the dumbest viewers. In addition, although a certain level of distrust of the government contributes to an effective democracy, you can, unfortunately, catch several episodes in a row bordering on an absurdity regarding distrust of the army / CIA, etc. One more remark: that any large group with power (Roman Catholic Church, Evangelicals, People's Republic of China, etc.), gets into poor lighting with a frequency from once to often. <br /> <br /> Although the show can beat a dead horse, if you look at it enough, the overall quality is astounding, and Iâ€™m grateful that Sci-Fi decided to continue watching it until it releases a seasonal DVD (and I can imagine allow.
