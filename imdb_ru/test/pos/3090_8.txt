As one of the IMDb reviewers said: “... imagine 2001: A space odyssey in the desert,” and you will not be far from a brief description of what to expect from this movie fragment (I deeply doubt the word “film”). Lecture on the philosophical views on creationism, the myths surrounding the existence of humanity, before and after, what was, what is and what will be. For some, it may be “2001” in the sand, but they affect different philosophical points of view, one about evolution and future, hope and potential for humanity, while Fata Morgana herself is a somewhat more metaphysical way. I only hope that I can convey it quite effectively. <br /> <br /> Herzog's style does not please everyone, and those who do not belong to the perceived hardcore branch of the cinematic viewing can and will most likely find it extremely hardworking, and may not even reach the final in 72 minutes. Fata Morgana combines scenes from the Sahara, including villages, villagers and other places for a somewhat surrealistic finale, music of various genres and almost mythical narration. <br /> <br /> Opening the montage of various taped pictures of planes landing for nearly five minutes, you already in anticipation will learn about the film, which is very confused, and the feeling that it will not be like everything you saw before echo is clear in your mind. Divided into three parts: creation, paradise and the golden age, Fata Morgana tries and succeeds, being able to match the images of the natural beauty of the desert with artificial tools that spoil it. Its three segments are told by different people, each of which has a specific relationship to the specific section they are talking about, and emphasizes long monologues and installations in the desert. <br /> <br /> Fata Morgana is a film about the existence of man on our Earth. He looks at the natural beauty for which the Earth was created, and at the same time looks at the potential beauty that we have in ourselves, especially shows us our negative contribution to the world in which we live. Each frame was specifically designed using what can only be described in the context of this film as the “Holy Trinity of Shooting” in images, words, and music. Each part of these three parts provides something special for each shot, but when they come together they create something more than their whole parts, they create unbridled beauty and deep thought in our minds. I will not be able to make this film for justice, which he deserves, with the help of some words, perhaps, if I had photos and an assessment, and I really know that it will not be appreciated by the masses, but it is deep, and I will not use the term "feature film" because it is just art. It is a moving art that moves the mind and excites the soul. Whether creationism is your wish doesn't matter, because this film is about intellectual design.
