>>> Great news: the release of the BBC DVD is scheduled for July 31, 2006, the UK - the release is also scheduled in the States - I don’t know the date - I can’t wait! ! <<<<< br / <br /> >>>> below is my original comment <<<<<< br / <br /> I agree with all the other reviewers - it just blows away that one of the greatest television dramas never went on DVD <br /> <br /> The storyline captures - the acting is outstanding, and the character development is exciting! <br /> <br /> Here in the UK, the history of the creation of TV shows and movies on DVD through popular campaigns <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to understand why copyright holders are not engaged in the production of DVD? I am going to email one of the leading players in this mass movement and see what happens. Who made the production? was it bbc? Rw
