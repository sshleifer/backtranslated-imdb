At one time I was one of the RNs in the emergency rooms, these skaters landed from time to time. They were mistreated, and some of them were caused by their asocial personalities - but we all knew that they were a talented group of “miracles” even then. I'm afraid they deserved better care than they got. They had a "attitude" in the peaks. <br /> <br /> I am so glad that I shot this documentary film about the IFC tonight - it will be again at 1:00, and I will be watching again! <br /> Little attention was paid to them, until a rich dying child could persuade their parents to drain the pool - and the film really stresses that as a starting point ... it was an amazing time, and it was worth recording. Stacy Peralta deserves all the praise for him, and for a long time these Z-Boys enjoy their memories and contributions to the real sport of skateboarding. As for several “sour grape” reviews contained here, there have always been and always will be “imitators” and henchmen who never do more than they dreamed ... Z-boys lived this, breathed them, were they <. br /> <br /> It’s nice to see old movies and even the lonely girl Peggy, who was talked about like the only woman who won their respect. <br /> <br /> Thanks to IFC, I really get to go on my teenage drug-free trip from time to time and relive my heartbeat.
