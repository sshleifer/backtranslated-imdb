This is a great Valentine's Day gift. Gorgeous guy and pretty girl fall in love, trying to win the competition for baking. Very romantic. I am a real fan of Kostas Mandilora since his time at Picket Fences, and he has not lost his appeal. Lauren Holly is still beautiful and charming, and they still have excellent chemistry together. The cast was also good. Seeing all these wonderful desserts was amazing. I liked that Kostas and Lauren teamed up to win the baking contest and fall in love. This is a kind of film that satisfies all tastes, romantic and others. Hallmark always shows excellence in their programming, and this is no exception. The whole family can watch this movie. It also shows that sometimes love conquers all adversity. I found myself sighing and wanting more for this film, and also longing for these wonderful desserts. I highly recommend this film for all ages. Great fun for everyone.
