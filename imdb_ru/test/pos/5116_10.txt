I love it when Ernest goes to jail. This is one of three of my favorite Ernest films. The rest are Ernest the Frightened Fool and Ernest Go to the Camp. In this film, Ernest (Jim Varney) works as a janitor at a bank, but he wants to become a bank clerk. Soon he is appointed to the jury position, but soon he finds himself in trouble when the evil killer Felix Nash (also Varney) knocks him out and changes places with him! Soon Ernest is in prison and forced to behave like Nash, otherwise Nash will kill Charlotte Ernest's love interest. When they take Ernest to the electric chair, thinking that he is Nash, he is so impressed with the electric current that he breaks out, leaves and saves Charlotte from the evil Nash! Ernest Goes to Jail is a movie that makes you laugh so much, filled with funny scenes and comics. It still does for me! Jim Varney was such a fantastic actor! He did a good job playing both the good and the bad guy! Varney was like his star Toy Story Co Tom Hanks. No matter what role they played, their roles were memorable, and this is one of the things that Varney will remember forever! REST IN PEACE. Jim Varney 1949-2000. Thank you for bringing Ernest and other fantastic characters to life! 10 out of 10!
