The Hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides everything you can expect from Agatha Christie and, of course, Poirot. It is installed on a country house at the weekend. As always, all the guests are suspects, and Poirot must find out the truth. With such films it is always better not to give too much away, so I’ll stop here. What I loved about Emptiness is that it’s a mystery in the old fashioned way. When Poirot arrives, everything around the body, for example. Everyone seems to be the culprit. There is such a suspicious look, and the atmosphere is just perfect for the story. <br /> <br /> You can expect a great time to guess who did it, how and why, and maybe, in the end, even wonder. A cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you have a rather pleasant experience. <br /> <br /> All the actors are very good. As a curiosity, notice Edward Hardwick, who played Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes. Nice to see him in a few years. Suchet is amazing, as always, and, fortunately, most of the time is on the screen. <br /> <br /> I did find out who the murderer was, but still this is not predictable, and it is also very plausible. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, an excellent film and, as always, pleasure. <br /> <br />
