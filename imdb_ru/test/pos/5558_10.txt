Farscape rules completely! In my opinion, this is very close to the Babylon Five, although there are only 7 main characters in the series (including the spacecraft). The humor is excellent, and the writers manage to keep the show interesting, although almost everything happens on the ship. <br /> <br /> What I really love and appreciate in Farscpae is that they do not use CGI for alien characters or, if they do, it is unnoticeable. They use these attractive, cheesy animatronic rubber puppets, very similar to those used in the original Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Farscape is something that you definitely want to see if you donâ€™t have one yet.
