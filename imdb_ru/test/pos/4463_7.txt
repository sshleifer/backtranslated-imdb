I did not know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew that he was followed by a cult, but I also saw many later works by the director, which, although exquisitely bloody, were also largely incoherent. Do not try to duck in fact a linear plot and a mystery that made me guess almost to the very end. And after all that was said and done, it was a really worrying and creepy experience. One important caveat: I would prefer to hear the original soundtrack and read the English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
