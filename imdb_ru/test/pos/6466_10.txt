This is one of the best performances of Cassavetes. The entire cast is outstanding, as is Martin Ritt's sublimely understated leadership. The anger, anxiety, and alienation of urban labor battles are magnificently narrated in such a way that they are neither intrusive nor patronizing. In a sense, it dates from its era, but in many ways it is magnificently timeless.
