Manna from Heaven is a light comedy that uses the exaggeration of human weaknesses to entertain the public. Throughout the film, it is expected that the good will manifest itself in every situation. The result is that the movie viewer finds himself sitting with that silly grin on his face, peace of mind in his heart and high expectations for the human race. Watch this movie was the most enjoyable experience. (I would venture to cheer up, but some would say it sounds corny!)
