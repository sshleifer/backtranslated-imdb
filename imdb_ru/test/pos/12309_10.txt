James Joyce could possibly write some of the best sentences in English, and his story “The Dead”, which completes his collection “Dubliners”, contains in its finale, perhaps the most perfect paragraph in English. tongue. It is fitting that John Houston, who was holding back in an attempt to film this story, ended his career with her. As in the case of the “Red Sign of Courage” and “The Man Who Will Become King”, Houston read a literary source, but made the adaptation cinematic. And with “The Dead” (which was completed after the death of Houston by his son Tony Houston) we get something almost perfect in the marriage of literature and cinema. <br /> <br /> Appreciating everything a movie can do, as one commentator notes, “This is not the African Queen” (and not necessarily), this is a type of film that is uncompromising for the audience. We all made our way through the portrait of the artist at school, and need to mature in order to appreciate how words and images themselves can touch us. As in the case of silent films, Houston is looking for something pure here, and he works with the confidence of his long years and leaves the world a masterpiece equal to the original of Joyce. <br /> <br /> Many veterans of the Irish theater world are recruited into Bring a story about a person filled with his own importance (and mocking self-doubt), which is reinforced by the hosts of the annual party on the eve of the Epiphany. Gabriel Conroy is waiting for the evening of celebration, song, dance, poetry, where he is asked to give an annual toast to two sisters and their niece who are having a party. He is distracted by the task, wanting to take advantage of the opportunity, and this distraction makes him vulnerable to the terrific experience passed on to him by his wife. Although his ego trembles when he hears a story from his wife's past, it is also a gift when everything that seemed to matter throughout the evening is swept away by the realization of impending mortality for all who live. <br /> <br /> And instead of trying to make the last known paragraph of the story “cinematic,” Houston speaks again, and we hear these incredible words, pronounced when we see “snow falling slightly through the universe and falling slightly ". This is the perfect solution to adapt the director. <br /> <br /> Cast - all that we hope for. Since this is basically a testament to the power of the written word and how it unites us based on common experience, each performer seems to be exaggerated by his role. Angelica Houston as Gretta Conroy has plenty of room to play, and her story about a boy who once loved her, not only Gabriel Conroy, but also the audience. <br /> <br /> When I think of Angelica Houston, this is the transformation she does in this film; and when I think of her father, I remember this film first.
