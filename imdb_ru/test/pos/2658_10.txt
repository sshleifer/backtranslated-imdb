I am always surprised, considering that the famous title track of 2001 is called “Also sprach Zarathustra”, that no one (in any case, I read anyone) noticed the parallels between the film and Nietzsche’s famous work “Also sprach Zarathustra”, star child; the childish form of the indescribably more advanced being is a clear part of Zarathustra N. there is a noticeable passage entitled “How a camel becomes a lion and a lion becomes a child”, in which N. describes the first incarnation of the superman as a child, surpassing both ascetic and and the altruistic side of the person (camel). ; always ask to carry more weight) and the predatory, rough, strong-willed side of a person (lion). The fact that a song is playing during a starry child sequence can hardly be a coincidence. And also, Zarathustra said that "man is a rope tied between animals and superman." The structure of the film fits this description: a brief history of a person as an animal until we become a real person, taking possession of a weapon and gaining intelligence, then a long sequence about a person (like a rope), and then a brief overview of the superman The incomprehensibility of how these transformations took place, and the assumption that external force caused them, is also Nietzschean; in Zarathustra, he makes it quite clear that he has no idea how people can make these changes on their own, and suggests that we will have to depend on an outsider (Zarathustra) to show us how to "go under." Bowman's psychedelic sequence at the near end can be seen as Kubrick’s best attempt in the 1960s to depict a mystical “failure.” <br /> <br /> I know that these parallels are rather wide, and almost certainly were noted elsewhere. even though I I didn’t see this, but I just wanted to mention them, if only to try to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was ultimately a grim philosopher. Few people find the end of 2001 grim, and this, in my opinion, is clearly and unmistakably Nietzschean. It can be said with confidence that the year 2001 is, first of all, a dramatization of Zarathustra, renewed for the modern era. Do not hesitate to neglect the frank snobbery of my attachment to everything Nietzsche.
