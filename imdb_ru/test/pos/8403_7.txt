When I saw Gone With the Wind, I thought that there could be no better actors than Vivian Lee and Clark Gable who played Scarlett and Rett, but then I saw the movie Scarlet. I fell in love with this dramatic story. I love Timothy Dalton as Rhett Butler, he is fantastic. This is a film that I could watch a thousand times, and he still would not bore me.
