It is believed that many strangely overlook Shabrol, and it seems to me that the reason why he was cold-blooded is his factor of meanness. Not as overtly sexy, cruel, or bloody, as in many films of this period, it nevertheless begins rather strikingly, and although it becomes more measured, it continues to emit a rather unpleasant smell. Mrs. Odran, it's not an ice maiden here, but a drunken mother, Donald Pleasant, who plays the role of a flounder as a child molester, David Hemmings looks at a minor gender, and the central theme concerns the relationship between brother, sister and niece. No, not very well, and Shabrol treats everything as if it is very normal (as in some small French village!) Instead of New York Ed McBain. If this were perceived in a more sensational way than it would be a more acceptable, but smaller film. Here we really have to choose between the probability of various unpleasant options before the final denouement. Very watchable
