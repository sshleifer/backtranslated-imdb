It must be very difficult to tell a story in which little is happening, but still attract the attention of viewers. I think this short film achieves this with an easy quality. Rutger has an amazing voice that is very soothing, wise and fatherly, (I'm not gay), he recalls the qualities that Robert Redford has in the story. The end is very sad, but beautiful. I wonder how much Harry is gone, will he be lonely and can he say goodbye? It also annoys Mr. Hauer that he does not participate in the work of such a caliber. Hopefully, he continues to work well in Holland and stays away from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing
