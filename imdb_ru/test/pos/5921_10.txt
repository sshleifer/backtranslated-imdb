It's a great story. Despite the fact that Jimmy Stewart’s film has several details for cornball, for the most part it’s a compelling story about an individual with an irresistible desire, vision and sense of adventure — to say the least. The bottom line is that this is one of my favorites, and I’ve probably done it dozens of times - until someone stole it from our bag, which I left on the plane during the flight to California! <br /> <br /> Some have commented on too many memories, but I don’t know a better way to make a long flight interesting. For those of us who really fly, flying can be hours of boredom, interspersed with moments of terror. I would not want the flight to be reduced. The oppressive need for sleep, drone and surrounding solitude is part of the story. <br /> <br /> I especially enjoy many moments, including taking off from Long Island and landing at night in Paris (wow, it really has changed with us and the French since then!). Interesting are the scenes of aircraft construction and the record flight from San Diego, as well as the incident over the ice over the Atlantic (which, as I understand it, is not quite true, but took place during the flight to San Diego). <br /> <br /> It seems that one of the main virtues of Lindberg is his enlightened supporters, as well as his perseverance. <br /> <br /> Some of the lines that sound in my head now, and then include "Pull the chocks!" on the take-off stage and "I hope that I will not have to use it that way" when describing the underwater "periscope" for the lady who lent him a mirror so he can better see his upper tools. <br /> <This film is not for everyone, but, of course, for me. I hope they will do it on DVD soon so that I can replace my stolen version!
