Jack and Kate first meet with doctor Daniel Farady, and then with psychics Miles Straume, and they demonstrate that they did not come to the island with the intention to save the survivors. Locke and his group find anthropologist Charlotte Staples Lewis, and Ben Linus shoots her. Meanwhile, Jack's group finds the pilot, Frank Lapidus, who landed in a helicopter with minor damage that can be repaired. Jack forces Miles to tell the real intention why they came to the island. <br /> <br /> The fourth episode of the Fourth Season returns to the island with four new characters, stops intricate “forward throws” and it seems that this is finally the beginning of the explanations that I (and most fans and viewers) expect them to will be provided in "Lost". Why the interest of the government in Ben Linus and how he is informed from the boat are some of the questions that I expect to see in the next episodes. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): not available
