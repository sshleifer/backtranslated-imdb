The best - and this is very good - in the “Black Castle” is that it is a black and white gothic robber of the forties with a murderous insane graph, which was somehow made in 1952. The star is supposedly the British actor Richard Green, a capable lead man who reminds me of an earlier version of Roger Moore. The villain is a mad earl played by Stephen McNally, who does a credible job, except when called upon to laugh manically. Boris Karloff is hiding in the shadows with a long dress that plays the secondary role of an elderly doctor who may or may not be the salvation of our hero. <br /> <br /> This is the middle of the 18th century in Austria, and Sir Ronald Burton (Green) is determined to find out what happened to two close friends. They disappeared in the vicinity of the castle that belonged to Count Carl von Bruno (McNally), deep in the Black Forest. It seems that Sir Ronald and his friends played an important role in the rout of von Bruno’s brutal plan in Africa three years ago with the participation of slavery and ivory. The count was left not only because of the failure, but with a scar on his face and a black spot, which he now wears to close the ruined eye. von Bruno vowed revenge, and it seems he could be partially successful. So, under a false name, Sir Ronald organizes an invitation to the count to hunt, and we ride in a carriage through the dark journey of the storm and the howling wolves to the count's castle. This is a huge mass of stone towers and corridors, dark staircases, huge fireplaces ... and creepy passages that lead to dark stone dungeons, a torture chamber and a large pit filled with snapping crocodiles. It is also filled with the beautiful, blond, sensitive wife of the Earl, Elga (Paula Corday, sometimes called Rita Corday), and the two close friends of the Count, played by these two actors we know from the fifties who specialized in being slime in costume John Hoyt and Michael Ansara. There is a dangerous leopard hunt, forbidden kisses, servants who sway, wooden signs squeak and sway in the cold wind, and poison in the cup. Last but not least, Dr. Mässen (Karloff) has a special vial filled with medicine that slows down the functions of the body so much that it seems that death has come. The risk is that ... well, when a person wakes up after ten hours, it is better for him to hope that he has not yet been nailed to his coffin. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, for all the clichés, the Black Castle continues to move merrily forward. The film takes itself seriously, but it is made reasonably well enough to maintain our interest, even if we sit with a smile while we watch. It is even encouraging to understand that there are strong echoes of the most dangerous game. When Burton realizes how crazy von Bruno is, he becomes even more determined to get von Bruno to account. And, naturally, he fell in love with Elga. von Bruno, obsessed with revenge, but cunning and capable, - a man who loves the hunt and absorbed in murder. The second creative rule of Hollywood has always been: "If you are going to steal, steal from the best." Of course, this is the first creative rule: "If you are going to steal, steal from the best, and then turn it into a liver beast." Black Castle is a good piece of the Austrian Brunswick.
