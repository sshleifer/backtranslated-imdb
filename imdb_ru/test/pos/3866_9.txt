AristoCats is a terrific Disney classic that I loved so much when I was a kid. However, to this day I can not refrain from watching, it's just such a wonderful and charming film with great animation and great songs. I really miss animation films like AristoCats, they had great voices, not to mention hand-drawn animation, which makes it perfect for the family. AristoCats is also very witty and smart, the story was just wonderful. This film is simply irresistible, I think that the most memorable moment for me was the cats playing the piano, learning the game appecio, lol, it was so cute with playing the piano and painting. <br /> <br /> Soul and her kittens are very spoiled by their huge mansion, mainly because their lady is very rich and treats them like their children. But when the lady feels that the time has come to do her will, she leaves everything to the cats, not to her butler. The butler is angry, takes the kittens on the road and leaves them in the middle of nowhere. Soul and kittens wake up and with the help of a smooth street cat named Thomas O'Malley return home to their lady, but learn the coolness of the cattle. <br /> <br /> AristoCats is just the perfect Disney movie that I think is a bit overrated. I always highly recommend this film for children or families, anyone can like it. Songs and history are unforgettable. I will always participate in the film “Everyone wants to be a cat”, such a wonderful melody. I also love those dogs who guarded the farm where the cats were left, they were so cute. This is a terrific movie, please watch it, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
