I remember coming home from school to see what was going on, and it was the story of a black family that moved from the ghetto to a cool community called Wilson Frank Wilson, a man with his own construction business, his wife Joyce was there were 3 teenagers Kevin Valerie and Marcus. It was a very good show. it was informative without a sermon. the show was well written. This show gave us a look at a successful African American before the Cosby show. A lot of black actor appeared on this show from Esther Role to David Hubberd and 227 Stonny Jackson, to name a few. If you can find this show on DVD, you should get it for the whole family.
