Wow, just caught this movie from a blockbuster, and I love to find such jewels. Despite the fact that he was definitely filmed with a limited budget and doesnâ€™t get into awkward editing a bit (i.e. accident, hospital scenes, scenes from second to last), for the first directorial work I give these 10 stars! I really liked ideas that provoke thoughts, and if you are free to think and are open to non-standard ideas, I highly, highly recommend this film. I think that director and screenwriter Jay Floyd need to pay a little attention and expand opportunities in the film industry. Judging by his loans, he may become another Quentin Tarantino.
