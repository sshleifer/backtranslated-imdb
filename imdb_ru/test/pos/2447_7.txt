This film was well made. It tells about the difficulties that the Vietnam veteran faces in fighting the horrors of war. Unfortunately, the authors decided to focus on the Veterinarian, who was implicated in cruelty. I was in Vietnam and only once heard about such an act from someone who witnessed it. The offender was prosecuted and sentenced to many years in Leavenworth. <br /> <br /> The notion that only veterinarians involved in atrocities had emotional problems is a bad service to all who served. All the soldiers, whom I knew personally or knew by word of mouth, were honest soldiers who respected even the enemy and believed that they were there to stop the spread of communism. The biggest problem was returning home to find out that many Americans were against the war. This is what made many veterans feel that they took part in something less than worthy. Not in the manner in which they served. <br /> <br /> The end portrayed the father, acting more like a warlike bully than a loving, caring father. For this, I gave him 7 out of 10. If the ending allowed me to get a degree of recognition, I would rate it as 9. <br /> <br /> Most decent men will return home from the war with guilt and emotional scars. They need to accept and understand in order to overcome this. I pray that the public will understand our veterans better than during the Vietnam era.
