I just watched it last night, and it was great. I understand why some people have bad feelings for him from the point of view of rugby fans and Maori culture, but other than that I have no idea what is so negative about it. The film is great. He has a lot of heart. Very inspiring and inspiring of all ages. Great family movie! They did a pretty good job, considering that it was a budget film. I love movies based on real stories / events. I've been raised to rugby all my life, this is a great game, but I have never been keen on it, because (please forgive me if I offended you, nothing personal, it's just how I saw it) I thought that training is not as ruthless or hard, players are not as disciplined and do not look as serious as other athletes, and it seems that these are just muscles and blossoms fighting each other, etc. But after I looked "Eternally strong, I was like, wow! I was proud! It did good things for rugby (well, it changed my view of rugby), as well as for the New Zealander Hack. I actually cried. I'm not even a New Zealander, and I was proud of their culture. I did not even know what it meant to sing before this film. The film is NOT about rugby or rugby methods, it is not even about New Zealand's All Blacks or Hack or so on. D ...... Pearl !!!!! Hahaha, SHUKS! <br /> <br /> So, to all of you, beautiful negative people, you are missing the point! I am sure that if they had the means, it would be better to have a hack there, because it was part of the Highland Rugby culture, or what you would like to call. <br /> <br /> So any new members on this site like me, please do not despair of these negative comments. See for yourself! Must watch a movie! You can learn a lot from this movie, ppl of all ages. It definitely makes you want to be a better person and be humble! This film reminded me of many things that I already know, and was raised, but I'm a little lost along the way! Loved it! Happy reading and all the best! <br /> <br /> Muawha!
