Scratch is a documentary about DJs and their art of scratching. From this one-line movie description, you can’t imagine how interesting and informative this little movie is. This is a joyful and vivid celebration of a cool subculture that is little known. It's filled with great underground hip-hop music, and you can see some top DJs (like DJ Q-Bert, DJ Shadow and Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys) show their stuff. Going to the film, I was not sure that “scratching” could really be called art or that the player could be considered as an instrument in itself. Scratch completely changed my opinion on these issues. What these guys do with their turntables is truly amazing - this is definitely some kind of art - and the player, if you know how to use it, can be turned into an instrument on which you can “play” as much as a drum or guitar. . And you even get a lesson on the fundamentals of scratches from DJ Q-Bert (for example, how to use the fader to get different sound effects). All these DJs in their own way were inspired to do the art of scratching after Herbie Hancock sang his song "Rock It" (you remember this song, don't you?) Live in a Grammy. Their attention was not attracted by Hancock himself, but by his DJ and scratches. Scratch is not only about scratches, but also about some “scratches”, thanks to the creative way of creating and editing this documentary. There are moments when clips are quickly “rewound” and then “sent” several times, which reflects (in the film environment) what happens when a DJ quickly moves the recording back and forth on his player when using his fader (this “wick - Vika-Vika "sounds). Whether you are a hip-hop fan or not, you can count on Scratch to give you a very pleasant movie night. Seeing this, I had a desire to go and buy my own player. And I have Mind it as a compliment.
