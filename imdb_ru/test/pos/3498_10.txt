I do not understand what the problem is with SOME people and their NEEDS in intellectual humor. You need to get your head out of a tight ass, if you don’t find this movie funny! If this is not your “cup of tea,” so to speak, then see what it really is — a damn funny movie. Perhaps they are going to make another film about drugs / T & A, but in this case, they really reached the goal. This is especially fun for Ali G fans, because he delivers everything we love and expect from him. Therefore, I say Ali Gi Guy's BIG UPS, and if it's not yours, don't whine - BATTI FIGHT!
