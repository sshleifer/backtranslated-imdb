Of all the parodies of Star Wars that I have seen, this is probably the most ridiculous. Not because of the premise of Star Wars with simple electronics instead of spaceships, but because of how bad it was. This is deliberately overzealous, and this makes it ridiculous, and since everyone knows about its deliberately over-fulfillment, no one complains. The special effects were also deliberately as awful as possible, and include a toaster on a visible string that shoots a toast, and a beater for eggs on a string. This short film is fun for any Star Wars fan (which I am not) or anyone who has 15 minutes to kill. Excellent short !! <br /> <br /> My rating: *** out ****. 13 minutes Unrated.
