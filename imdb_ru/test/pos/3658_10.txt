In a word ... magical. And so incredibly real. Vijay Raaz is so incredibly rude, so incredibly vulnerable that you just want his characters to succeed in everything he does. And he plays Hari Om flawlessly - from his absolutely perfect "Bollywood electronic style" to his awkward, shy manner with the first kiss. He is really a gifted actor, and I see him without hesitation in everything, because he embodies all this and gives a soul. Camilla Natta is absolutely gorgeous. It took me some time to warm up with her — perhaps because she plays the role of an ignorant but charmed tourist so well. Her transition really became hers, and she fit in very well with her role. Even the man you love to hate, her boyfriend Benoit, was wonderful, although you never liked him because of the scum he plays, Jean-Marie Lamour portrays the perfect guy. The script is so real. In the film, I repeatedly turned to my friend to say: “This is exactly what is happening in India! They were kidding! ”Very real, very raw. VERY bitter-sweet, but you certainly leave the feeling of the theater in full. The music of Nitin Sawhney is wonderful and goes well with constantly changing moods. But Vijay Raaz ... I always come back to him, because he is the one who makes this film. He is a hero, the most charming, disarming driver of the rickshaw you have ever encountered - he is magic. Beautiful, real, cute, incredibly talented actor, whom I can not wait to see the brilliance and success in Bollywood, Hollywood or anywhere else!
