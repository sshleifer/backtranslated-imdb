The three names that mean the most to this film are Bert Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg and Julianne Moore. These three give the strongest performances, but the whole cast does a wonderful job. The film, although about the porn industry does not allow himself to get out of hand with his own sexual premises. On the other hand, there were many scenes related to drug use, and although it is important to understand the characters' lifestyle, I think there was some overkill in this section. Paul Thomas Anderson did not do a lot of directing, but he may have been selected for this film based on his 1988 work The Story of Dirk Diggler. One thing that was brilliantly depicted is the family atmosphere between the characters when they work, live and have fun together. Although they are not a typical family, they seem to care about each other. A wonderful soundtrack really helps you feel the period when the disco was in fashion. There are a lot of discos favorites on it and some other great songs as well. <br /> <br /> The story of a talented young man named Eddie Adams (Wahlberg) who gets invited into the porn industry. He changes his name to Dirk Diggler and almost the whole night becomes an adult movie star. Jack Horner (Reynolds) is a director who takes his films very seriously, as he believes that his work is more than just pornography, but they are a real art. However, Dirk becomes overly addicted to drugs and soon goes on a dangerous road where he can lose everything. Although more attention is paid to the character of Dirk, there are stories for other characters and their trials in life. You will find what you want and hope that their situation will improve. In general, a well-made movie.
