I saw this movie when I was much younger, but it captured me. I really enjoyed the relationship between Orry and George. I was so fascinated by the love story of Orri and Madeline. I am a hopeless romantic, so it dawned on me. I especially liked when he first met her. I just wish he had more time with her and their baby. So, you know, in the third book, it hurt me so much that he died. I didnâ€™t really understand this, because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie. I just bought all three books together, and I can't stop watching them. My 12 year old son is stuck on it. He likes fighting in war. I cry every time. I wish I could meet Patrick and Madeline in person! It was a great movie and cast!
