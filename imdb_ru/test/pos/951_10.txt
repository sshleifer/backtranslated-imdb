if you haven't seen Vijay in Gilly, Gilly or Gilly. go watch it. Wow. it's terribly fun. I don't know if Dharani (a brilliant director) was serious or not. There are a bunch of hot guys in this, look for someone who calls Velu Maacha. The one with the shining braids is terribly hot. He has shiny teeth. Vijay rocks. Trisha cries every 5 seconds. It is very deep. Look, you will not regret. There is a wonderful laugh in it. If you don't speak Tamil, learn this. Then you get all the internal jokes. This one is for the whole family, except perhaps the violent bits should be skipped. I saw this movie about eleven times .... and I think. <br /> <br /> Wow!
