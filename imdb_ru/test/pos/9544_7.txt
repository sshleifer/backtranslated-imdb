It covers almost all areas of the creative process and goes through three stages in chronological order, with the main focus being directly on production. There are documentaries that go in more detail and better cover the other two groups. This includes artwork, backstage footage, movie clips and many interviews. Since the playing time is just over two hours, viewers are entitled to a lot of information, considering that this is about the same duration as the movie itself. It can be argued that a lot of time is spent on people, and the craft and the result of their joint efforts go in second place. It is well done, with hard editing. This is included in the technology, and shows how certain effects were achieved. It spends a lot of time on physical training, preparing for battle, and the like. You get good candid shots of people, teams and actors. The Ultimate Matrix 10-disc set also contains nearly three hours of music in a simple system with individual track selection and the Play All feature, about 38 minutes of BTS material in addition to the name itself, in various functions. However, there are some very short additions in the original release, including videos about creating sequels, a preview of the movie "Animatrix" and "Yuen Vo Vo Ping's Blocking Tapes" (full run of a couple of the biggest martial arts episodes with stunts. Performers and almost exact cinematography , with the same frames and angles of these bits in the finished silver screen). The language is quite strong, but rather rare, almost non-existent. I recommend any of these versions to anyone who likes this concept, and / or she wants to know how they connected the first one. 7/10
