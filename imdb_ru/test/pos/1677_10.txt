I see a lot of films in the cinema (at the moment there were 103 of them), and I must say that this is by far the best film I have seen this year, although it was released back in 1954! <br /> <I watched this ingenious work with awe, and I was ashamed that I hadnâ€™t even heard about it until my local cinema decided to show it during the week on what looked like a new print. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole film is a 28-minute break, where there is no speech and music, only the sound of people committing a robbery. Pure quality. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that in some places they are really dark, they are illuminated by dry humor. <br /> <br /> Not many films gain 10 points out of 10, but this is the case, and also gets a gold star for the effort !! <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, do not hesitate, this is a classic. <br /> <br />
