I saw this movie when I was very young. This is my favorite for all time. Until recently, I could not get a copy, and viewing it caused so many pleasant memories. I really liked the image of Porgy Sidney Poitier, he is his character with such strength and courage. Part of the Pearl Bailey, although it was small, was not different from many members of our family. My favorite songs were and remain "Bess You Is My Women", "Porgy, don't let him come to terms with me" and, of course, "Summertime". In accordance with the instructions, if I interpret them correctly, I cannot publish where I could get my copy, Sorry. That is why I signed up to be able to share this information.
