Mr Bean formed the face of a British television comedy. He proved that you do not need evil words or wit, a huge budget, great intelligence, or even any intelligence to do something brilliant. And Mr. Bean is one of those characters that you just can't forget. In some of these episodes, I was at the seams - yes, they are far from realistic and they are all rather stupid, but, frankly, realism is one of the barriers that Bean broke on the way to greatness. Rowan Atkinson & Co. always manages to make interesting new ideas - and funny new jokes - remember when Mr. Bean drove his green Mini while sitting on the sofa on the roof? Mr. Bean is one of those things that never fails - the film was not as good as this one, but Bean brought a completely new sense of humor to the world, and children and adults will be amazed by its great fun. Extras and Little Britain can be cursed - this is a British comedy at its best and more original. These antics never get old! 10/10
