Although he was great at Boogie Nights, I think it was the best performance of Bert Reynolds. He is also a great director and made a tough, brutal film that does not hold back (the death of a prostitute at the 12th dead) and is an excellent detective story with some great actors (Brian Keith, Bernie Casey, etc.) and an outstanding jazz soundtrack. 10 out of 10
