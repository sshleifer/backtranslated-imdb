I am a fan of Zhang Yimou and finally found this DVD of the shelves of a bookstore in Shenzhen after a long search in many places. <br /> <br /> This is a huge departure from Zhang Yimou's previous work, especially in terms of style and locale. The director himself said that this is the first and only time he will try to make a black comedy in modern China. You can even say that this work is experimental in comparison with its other well-known large budget and formal works. <br /> <br /> Shot with a hand-held camera and a wide-angle lens throughout the film, fast tempo editing, high energy efficiency and a naturalistic tone will never let you go as soon as it captures you from the very beginning. It presents a very realistic account of modern Chinese urban features, which in this case is set in Beijing. If you appreciate and love this kind of black humor, you will love this movie completely. Also note the funny cameos of Zhao Benshan (“Happy Times”) and the director Zhang Yimou himself. <br /> <br /> One final note: I find the characters in this film, as in all the other films of Zhang Yimou, showing similar personality traits - stubbornness, always trying to surpass the chances and stakes. Let me know your thoughts on this. <br /> <br /> david lee
