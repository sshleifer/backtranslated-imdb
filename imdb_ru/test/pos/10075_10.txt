Watching this little movie is a real delight from start to finish. The story is always interesting, the tension never weakens. The whole cast is wonderful. The union of Walken and Bracco works to perfection, it is almost like an echo of a classic baseball romance. Bracco is very sexy and really funny as a con man who fights for his independence. For some reason, they gave Waken a very strange makeup and the strangest hairstyle I can imagine? this is a kind of parody of what Bert Lancaster had in Elmer Gentry. For me, this added pleasure. This is the first film in which I saw Miguel Ferrer, possibly one of the most underrated film actors of his generation. He is very good in the small role of pimp Bracco. Even Jamaican gangsters are a spectacle. I highly recommend this movie.
