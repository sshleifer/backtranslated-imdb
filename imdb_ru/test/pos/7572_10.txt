Jack Palance (John Whitting) was usually the bad guy in most of his films, and in this film he showed his great acting talents beyond my expectations. John Whitting unexpectedly returns to his son's farm after many years of separation. Christopher Walken (Jacob) struggles to take on the appearance of his father after spending the night in the family barn. The son and the youngest daughter of Jacob greet their new grandfather and accept him for who he is, a very old man at the end of his ropes. Glenn Close (Sarah Whitting) delves into the character of John Whitting and begins to tell the truth about what happened to him during the years of his absence from the family. This is a very warm and loving mundane film about real events that have been happening in most families for many generations.
