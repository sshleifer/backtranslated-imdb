This movie typifies the beginning of the eighties, and also fun! I remember watching this movie on HBO when I was small, and it was my favorite movie. Since it was some time ago, no one I ever met, did not know what it was. Then, around the time my roommate said that she saw it too, and that she was her favorite, they started typing again! Fortunately, I have a copy now !! If someone ever wants to see the greatest (gentle) garbage hunt, which was probably the beginning of hazing ideas for the brothers, this film is !!! (Observer - must have a serious love for wacky 80s films !!)
