It was a long time ago (1960), but I never forgot this series and often wanted it to appear again. In general, I corresponded with Mr. Rathban, then president of Standard Oil, who sponsored the presentation on PBS. He sent me a photo of a tapestry (actually an image of coal), used for captions. <br /> <br /> On Baiko’s Elizabeth Mask introductory music theme, my family and I gathered around our black and white television. drink the words of Shakespeare, spoken by a group of excellent, but relatively unknown players (at least for the American audience at the time). <br /> <br /> We were introduced to such actors as Sean Connery, Dame Judy Dench, Tom Fleming, Patrick Garland, Julian Glover and Robert Hardy. Since then, I continue to enjoy their achievements. One of the most interesting things was how the actors continued to grow old in their respective roles, since Shakespeare's “King” plays were presented, perhaps for the first time, in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell these actors how much this series means to me. <br /> <br /> If VHS and / or DVD could revive Age of Kings, it would be so nice for those of us who are eager to see it again. and those who missed it the first time. <br /> <br /> GOOD NEWS! PBS has just released The Epoch of Kings DVD! WATCH JULY JULY 2009 CATALOG, PAGE 19, OR CALL THEIR FREE OF CHARGE. I JUST ORDER MY!
