I accidentally stumbled upon this movie on Cinemax while surfing the channel. I have to admit that Christopher Walken attracted me. And the settings were what I would like, so I started watching them. At first I was expecting a serious drama film, and for a while it seemed so ... until I started giggling here and there, and before I found out about it, I was laughing so hard at the whole film. I really like how thin and carefree it is, but it still has a huge impact on the audience. The plot is very simple, and it is far from being so difficult to be funny, like in many Hollywood "comedies", but it almost made me roll on the floor. Need to look at a good evening rest or any time in this case.
