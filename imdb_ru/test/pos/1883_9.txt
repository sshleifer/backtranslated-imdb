I saw it last week during Bruce Campbell’s book tour. I thought it was amazing. Almost everything I expect from Bruce Campbell's science fiction film. It is very polite and very funny. Ted Raimi was also fun and very stupid. The plot is stupid, an American businessman goes to Bulgaria and dies. Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who rescues / brings Bruce Campbell back to life by implanting half the brain of a former taxi driver from the former KGB. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film, trying to avenge his death, and he has a lot of internal disputes between him and the KGB agent. The film has all the wonderful slaps and humor of Bruce Campbell. The film is somewhat predictable, I knew that after killing my wife she would share her brains with her killer. However, I didn’t go to watch this film because I thought it would be an Oscar-winning script, I went to it because it was a science fiction film by Bruce Campbell, and I was not disappointed in anything. I highly recommend you visit him on a book tour or wait and watch it on a science fiction channel next month. Although before the film, he said that the Sci-Fi channel really cut out part of the film to make it TV friendly. If you're a fan of Bruce, I highly recommend him.
