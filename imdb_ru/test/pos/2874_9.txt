See No Evil is the first film from WWE movies. Yes WWE, Word Wrestling Entertainment, about wrestling. Of course, due to the fact that this is a film about WWE, a wrestler should be shot in it, and Glenn Jacobs aka Kane. Which is not very important, since if you didnâ€™t know Kane or what stood for WWE, you would never know that it has something to do with the wild word about the fight, because the film has nothing to do with the fight. See No Evil is a horrible horror movie, there are moments in it when some people can jump, but for the most part it just says: hey, look, what a brutal we can get! Not that something is wrong with that. Jacob Goodnight (played by Kane) - Jason's character, his mother tortured him as a child with strict (understated) Christian beliefs and distorted his mind. Now he is a big scary grinder. 90% of the film takes place in an abandoned hotel, where Jacob is chasing six teenagers (surprised?) And several adults. I could explain why they are in a creepy old hotel, but who cares? Despite the lack of originality, See No Evil is well done, how it should be. Kane plays a terrific assassin and he needs to make up a little to be scary. One flaw in the film is the most annoying possibility of people's survival, I really look forward to when they will be horribly killed, but, alas, this does not happen. I wish that the film was not accompanied by the stigma of struggle, although, as I said, the film has nothing to do with the struggle, people are still closed enough to not want to see it, because, of course, if they fight a hater. On the other hand, the film can also make money, because the wrestling fans will want to see it. In any case, See No Evil has first-class effects and a little CGI, and, as I said, this is pretty cruel, as I say that this is good stuff ... if you like these things.
