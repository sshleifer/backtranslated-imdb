Still funny after all these years. Midnight Madness is good fun for all ages. He presents Michael Fox as the typical 15-year problem maker. Melio and Blilak are the most funny characters, and Leon perfectly plays the role of a game master. A budding romance between Adam and a girl could not be more pleasant. Fagabeefe !!!!
