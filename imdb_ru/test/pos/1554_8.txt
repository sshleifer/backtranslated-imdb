I also saw this film at the film festival, but unlike the previous poster, I found it interesting and original. In a sea of ​​terrible features, shorts are often twice as bad as bad budgets and bad games, but A.W.O.L is a tight little thriller that returns to "Outer Limits." The performances are impeccable, not that one could expect anything else from Morse or McGinley, but the direction is sharp and for money. Personally, I find it difficult to combine the comments of the previous author with the film that I saw. A.W.O.L is quite accurately written by Shane Black, who, as usual, plays with the genre, paying tribute to the feelings of the stories, while winking at the audience and never taking himself too seriously. In general, A.W.O.L is a very well made and fun movie.
