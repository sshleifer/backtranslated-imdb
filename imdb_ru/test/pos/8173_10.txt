I have nothing to say except good words about this tasteful and soulful movie. I think the film director / screenwriter's efforts are bold and inspiring. I liked this film not only for the fantastic story (about which you had to tell), but also for the way the actors told the story. This is not just another shallow "gay film", which depicts stereotypical characters in humorous situations. It was an unforgettable and unforgettable desire to show people that love really knows no boundaries, and love is as beautiful and beautiful as ever. <br /> <br /> Another thing that touched my heart was how well I could relate to the emotions portrayed in this film around the release of one of the main characters. We all have to go through such situations, living in the society in which we live, and feeling this sense of detachment from everything that is “right” and “normal”. I express sincere praise for this incredible and bold story.
