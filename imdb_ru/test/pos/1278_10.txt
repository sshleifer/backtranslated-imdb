Given the series of successful films by Christopher Nolan, I will not be hard pressed to watch his film about his debut film, shot in England in black and white, less than 70 minutes long, with a small budget, but contains all the signs that made him the main director and storyteller . <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film is short, it is no less fascinating by its tortuous plot, which makes you guess, because the premise does not even scratch the surface of this story, which is quite surprising, given the depth of the structure and the characteristics of the narration. As already mentioned, we follow an amateur writer named Bill (Jeremy Theobald), who begins his usual obsession with spying on random people he imagines on the streets as a voyeur, who may first be thought of as a study before he starts making his own rules and break them. <br /> <br /> He meets with the charismatic Cobb (Alex Howe), who turns out to be a robber with special feelings and a modus operandi, and soon discovers that he is tied to him and enter the house and speculate about the livelihood of their victim, as well as the pursuit of the fatal blonde (Lucy Russell), the little things of a gangster who rejects his every promotion. <br /> <br /> This is non-linear This is due to scenes that initially do not quite coincide, so the film prepares for several views while you study how Nolan maintains this tension and intrigues you when the audience is expecting and wanting more that is properly delivered. There are enough turns, because of which the film turns into a dizzying crescendo, where the inconspicuous ends begin to come together, and the brilliance of the stellar history begins to shine through. <br /> <br /> It is also surprising that as the first Low Cost Shot, that something clever and sophisticated can be conceived based on his own robbery experience, when Nolan participates at every stage of production, from writing to filming, producing and Directing, working on the project for a year now shoots can occur only on weekends. I think that here is an example of the modest roots of a successful director, which should serve as an inspiration and encourage new filmmakers. Now I will wait patiently for Inception at the end of this year to be released to Christopher Nolan, whose trailer is already teasing.
