I really like the opening of the film, when Colonel Ted Masters understands on his fighter that four enemy aircraft were approaching from about 10 o'clock. The good news is that at the very beginning of the film it is not mentioned that the colonel, along with the soldier who was a lieutenant, tried to perform the exercise “freedom of navigation” along the eastern Mediterranean, but also passed a little past the restricted airspace zone reserved for the Middle Eastern outcasts nations when they accidentally flew past her. <br /> <br /> I also like all interceptions on the radar readings of the Colonel's fighter and computer displays, when an enemy plane aggressively selects two American fighter pilots engaged in an airspace violation. This first air battle immediately reminds me of the famous movie about the Top Gun fighter pilot. From the rise of enemy thugs to thirty-millimeter shots of an enemy plane that hit Colonel’s jet engines and shot down the plane, forcing him to eject, it all reminds us of one thing ... fighter technology in a fight with dogs can keep you alive ... but one wrong move can cause you to be shot. <br /> <br /> The only problem in the film was the sequence of snakes. It has been a little too long. Yes, the opening of the film was great when you see a conflict ... which was a fight. Only when one boy tells Dag Masters that his father was shot down after the Cessna planes landed in a “serpent” race, does it make us return to the time when the conflict has already begun. I believe that the serpent sequence in the middle should be slightly interrupted by Colonel Masters, who is being dragged in handcuffs in the middle of the Bilyad desert on the way to the detention center ... while the serpent music sequence continues. The film does not do this ... if that were the case, the details of the conflict would have been smoother at this moment. Everything else is good. <br /> <br /> When it became known that the trial of a high treason case (violation of territorial sovereignty) of Colonel Ted Masters was over, and he was sentenced to three days hanged on a gallows, Doug Masters decided to take action. In view of the futile attempts of the Air Force to save this man, Doug decides to pull his friends and Colonel Sinclair (played by Louis Gossett Jr.) for the plan to save the Masters. Risking with high probability to meet with the military tribunal and spend more than a year in the military detachment, he goes against the policy of the Air Force and makes a plan to save the Masters without the consent of the US government. <br /> <br /> Doug and his friends make their way into several secret areas of the base to get a lot of things in the area where the Teachers are being held for the upcoming hanging and in the vicinity of Bilad (which turns out to be a fake Middle Eastern country for the film). One of the plans included the shooting of fireworks outside the dark room of the air force as a diversion in order to obtain secret photographs and materials on the maintenance of the fighter, the fighter base, reconnaissance and all other military things around Bilad. <br /> <br /> When everything was said and done, and Sinclair studied all the intellect, he almost rejected this plan, because Doug was too cocky. Until they got two F-16 planes and tried to run through the ground, I realized what they were going to do abroad. I realized that shooting the fighter Doug and dropping a bomb are no good until he hears rock music. I remember how he dropped one Mach 82 bomb on a horizontal target, and the bomb fell 20 feet ... I realized that Doug is unusual. He loves music when he shoots fighter ammunition. <br /> <br /> The last part of the conflict, the final battle in the Iron Eagle, was better than the culmination of Top Gun hostile hand-to-hand episodes. I liked how the final conflict unfolded, especially when Doug Masters was confronted with a fighter pilot from the Middle East who actually led the process against Ted Masters. Short, but pleasant, when Doug led the enemy fighter after the second attempt using a side-wound rocket. It looks like this Colonel Bilyad looked like Darth Vader in Star Wars ... he could be very angry in the air, because if you saw Star Wars, Darth Vader was actually Anakin Skywalker who was ace pilot in space. Unusual shade for this, but still works!
