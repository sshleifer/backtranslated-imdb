I just wanted to say that I watch National Velvet on TV, now February 2006, and I checked the details of dates, etc. It's amazing that this was done in 1944, and Rooney was 24, 12, She is an experienced English actress. <br /> <br /> To correct the situation of some American authors: there are no Irish villages in England. Ireland is a completely different country, and it has nothing to do with the English countryside. The scenes presented are supposedly filmed on the south coast of England between Brighton and Arundel (Sussex County). Unfortunately, such a scene does not exist now. As in many other places, roads and buildings were built on the hills and beaches. <br /> <br /> Please, everyone, dear Americans, never confuse Ireland with England! we will take a big exception to this. Itâ€™s like confusing Texas with Coney Island.
