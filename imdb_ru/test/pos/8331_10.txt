The magnificent "documentary" about how scientists dinosaurs behaved, taken one of the most impressive computer-generated computer images from the time of the Jurassic Park. Done perfectly seriously, like the prehistoric episode of Nation Geographic. Captures your attention from the first frame and never lets go. My favorite part was when Diplodocus fights with Allosaur. <br /> <br /> 10 stars. This is what science is all about.
