This film was made fairly quickly after Karen died, and perhaps Richard Carpenter and people close to her felt a little guilty about how they could contribute to her health problems. After years (more precisely, almost 25), it became easier to deny any complicity. Richard spent the years after Karen's death, endlessly remixing and recompiling the records he made with her. He married his cousin Mary, and from what I read, it looks like he can plan the next generation of carpenters with his children. It seems he regretted having shot this film, and it may well be why it is not available in any form. It seemed to me a fairly honest assessment of the tragically short life and incredible talent of Karen Carpenter.
