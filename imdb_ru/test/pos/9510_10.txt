This is the best movie I watched this year! Excellent detail and storyline (for a remake). <br /> <br /> He presents you with a “what if” situation when the island of Japan can be completely obliterated. The situation makes you think about life and death, and not to mention life on earth (in particular, in this Japan). It also represents a magnificent and ingenious solution to this large-scale tragedy. <br /> <br /> Horror, action films, suspense, fantasy, documentaries, love stories and everything you can tell about human interests can be found here! But I also warn you that this is a real tear! Actors, actors and all of them are excellent, better than any Hollywood movie! <br /> <br /> The thing is ... that this can really happen to any globe! Now let me ask you about it after you saw it ... "what would you do if you faced this situation of life and death"?
