Great job! It was very exciting and well performed. The show, which really shocked. It was a great job for everyone who worked on it; and especially actions by Bobby Phillips. That would be great on the big screen. I would like to see more of these films of the week or perhaps a weekly series. It was great fun, and I'm glad I looked! By far the best of the three. Keep up the good work with UPN and Bobby Phillips. I will look for the next one.
