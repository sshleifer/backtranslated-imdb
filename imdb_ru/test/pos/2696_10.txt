In times of bad, if not just horrible comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a full oxygen bottle! In my opinion, this is one of the 5 best comedy shows of all time. Nothing was as good as being married to children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller - comedic geniuses! And believe me, you need a lot to make me call someone a comic genius. These guys really understand what's funny. I could watch ten episodes about Seinfeld and would not have heard half of the laughter, seeing KOQ only once. Other fun people on this show are Carrie, Janet Heffernan, Spence and Doug Prusan (Carrie's boss). I am so happy that they managed to get so many seasons from this gem. The show was a fun winner in times of mostly comic losers. Check it out if you haven't !!
