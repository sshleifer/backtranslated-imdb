Most of the comments so far have nailed this one right on the head. Viewers under the age of "a certain age" and with a three-digit IQ should avoid the "Chance of a lifetime" as appointee George W. Bush facing a congressional grill. <br /> <br /> The cast included veterans who know their way around a well-written script. Is the premise wildly original? No, but the film stands out as a beacon at midnight in the current and endless surplus of films / TV targeted at the most desired audience of demographic adolescents and "young people." <br /> <br /> In addition to starring Betty White and Leslie Nielsen, the cast also includes such reliable veterans as Elaine Stritch and William Windom. These professionals easily and efficiently deliver a sharp dialogue. <br /> <br /> “A chance for life” is definitely not a film for Will Ferrell / Adam Sandler / “Saw”, which hosts the American Eye mountain festivals Boring, and ninety percent of the rest of the sediment is paved with Hollywood and television. .
