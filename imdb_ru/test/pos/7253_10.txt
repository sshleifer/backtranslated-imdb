This should be my favorite movie. The script is accurate and played to the limit by the superb Miller and the fantastic Carlisle! A sharp mind, a great story and the lack of Hollywood polishing; absolutely exciting movie in which you shot the bad guys! Stott stands out again as a disgusting chance, while Liv Tyler truly defeats her other, lighter actions as Rebecca eager for excitement! The soundtrack may not be known to you by name, but anyone who has ever seen Top Gear, watched football or saw any television action series probably knows him, especially because of Quest by Craig Armstrong, â€œEscape , Which should allow him to never work again! The soundtrack to the first performance may seem out of place in a costumed drama / action movie / comedy, but one re-observation shows that it is ideal for writing the script of his drama. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about this film is that it is not sufficiently shown on TV! Where is it? Really great, sharp and stylish - you will not regret watching it - again and again! (comes out to turn on the DVD player!)
