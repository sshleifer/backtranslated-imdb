Like a Finn, my problem is that most of the actors in this film are in every Finnish film. I have a feeling that there are only five actors in Finland. I think that if you are not from Finland, you really like this film as a refreshing novelty. <br /> <br /> This film is about a terrible chain of events that affects several people quite a lot. Alcoholism, a cold climate and darkness can be clich√©, but they are still very real in modern Finnish society. Many people in Finland are depressed, especially in the winter. <br /> <br /> The tone of the film is very melancholic. I liked it, and the direction Louhimes was again very solid. I really liked this film, the only negative is that you see the same faces that you have seen again and again.
