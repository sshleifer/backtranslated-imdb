I'm glad that I'm not the only one who found this series very good. This is the best series for young ladies! I have such a strange taste for comedies, and I find it so difficult to please my intellect, and I am so happy that their humor is exactly what I need. I love a gang of actors! If anyone knows a show or just a movie similar to this one, I will say enough, please write because I miss the show. <br /> <br /> And we ask scriptwriters and producers to CONTINUE, even if the actors, I think, are now all adults. Have a nice morning / afternoon / evening / night! (because I do not know the exact time when you will read this post)
