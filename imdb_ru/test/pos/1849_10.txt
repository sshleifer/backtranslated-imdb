I LOVE THIS FILM !!! <br /> <br /> This beautiful, charming love story immediately attracted me with its attractive characters and heartfelt romance. Throughout the film, I was so attached to the characters that I felt as if I knew them personally. The storyline is very charming, and in a few touching moments, she burst into tears. Duchovny and the Driver have a very sweet, chaste relationship in which you cannot but interfere. It is worth seeing more than once and showing all your friends. I'm just curious why this was not a big success? <br /> <br /> I give it 10 out of 10! Spectacular movie! (And this is from a guy who believes that 9 out of 10 films are not even worth watching.)
