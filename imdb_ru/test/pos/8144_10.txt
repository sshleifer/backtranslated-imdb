A truly wonderful film that takes you on a journey through hidden emotions, a deep and instructive story. The story tells about the life and beliefs of gays and religious cultures, as well as the excellent performances of great stars. This will affect the deepest limits of your emotions, for those who believe that love, which runs no risk, is worth nothing. The film begins with the fact that we introduce us to characters who seem to have everything on the surface, and then we discover that under the surface of each character they are looking for ways of self-knowledge. From this story, we learn that we all must choose the life path that we are destined to take, despite all the difficulties that we face, a film that keeps up with the times!
