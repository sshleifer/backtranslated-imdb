THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! The decline of Western civilization ...... what a great title, eh? And, of course, a great movie. This is the best live film I've ever seen. In second place is the film "Talking heads" "Stop the meaning." I first heard about this movie when Waynes World was released in 1992. I looked at the name of the director Penelope Spheris and thought what a cool name, what else did he take? I thought the name was pronounced like an envelope. After a while, after reviewing the film guides, I came across a critically acclaimed "Decline" and realized that Penelope is a woman ... my mother corrected me. I spent 8 years of my life trying to track it down. I finally saw it on VHS in Vancouver, where I live now. It was worth the wait. This reflects the Los Angeles punk movement very well. This is the longing of a teenager in his best people. My favorite band is The Germs, who need subtitles for the lyrics, because Darby Crash sings so crazy that you can't understand it. I laughed when I saw this. The Black Flag group lives in an abandoned church, and the X group is a very smart group. They also laughed at the letter some idiot wrote to Slash Magazine that we don’t need to save whales, there are countless miles of ocean into which we can inject toxins! After that, I became a big fan of Penelope Sferis and saw all her punk movies. The dude was fine and the Suburbia was a cult classic! I own both of them on VHS. She is a true underground director, and I like her stuff. I would love to watch this movie in 1994, when grunge was so popular. I was a big fan of Nirvana then, but, alas, I saw it in 2002, and by that time I had grown from grunge and now I am listening to Crystal Method / Fatboy Slim. I know that you change the pace, but what can you do? But if you want a true idea of ​​punk movement, this is better than anything else. Much better than 1991: The Year Punk Broke. This film is difficult to track, but if you rent it, rent it, even if you don’t like the music, this is a great job. Now days can be easier to find with the popularity of DVD. By the way, Penelope produced a little-known Albert Brooks film called Real Life, which I also own. Very funny stuff in today's reality show shit! Reduced rental rates ...... Strongly recommended! Thank!
