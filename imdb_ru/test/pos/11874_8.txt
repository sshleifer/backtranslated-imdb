One Night at McCool's is a very funny movie, smarter than it should be. His form is more complex than I expected, and his chance was excellent. Thoughts about the film (mysticism, sadism, stupid people) are infantile. Here is what I have to say about this film: he not only hates women, but also hates men. It has no sympathy for any of the men, in fact. It seems so because of the shape, but the end speaks for itself. Nobody cares. <br /> <br /> In the form there are the first 2/3 films that are told in the memoirs by three characters: Dillon, the stupid barman; Reiser, mytogenistic stupid lawyer; and Goodman, the stupid, holy policeman. Therefore, history is always perverted by their own ideas about themselves and changed realities. Raiserâ€™s fancy barbecue is a great touch. In the end, we will never know the truth, and nothing is what it seems. Dillon has never been so innocent, etc. <br /> <br /> Actually, the rest of the movie is fun too. From the randomness of the last 5 seconds of the film to the overt evidence of Tyler's manipulations, the film seems to have its own energy. Everything is just unexpected, and nothing seems to make sense. Do we really care if it does? <br /> <br /> This is also a very dark comedy, but with a minor insight. Think nurse Betty or jaw. Outside very covered with candy, dark chewing inside. If you like your movies random, dark, or just plain mean, watch this movie. This will satisfy your desires for strangeness, which is one night at McCool's. <br /> <br /> 8/10
