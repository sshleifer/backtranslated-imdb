... but this is also Minnie and Pete too! Yes, a grumpy captain might not look like Pete, but he is! Mickey and Minnie are the best characters, both very cute and cuddly. Interestingly, Minnie is more like a lady in this than usual, and Mickey is less attentive than she is now. Pete is the same old villain, but he looks a little different. <br /> <br /> In this famous episode, on board the small steamer, Mickey, Minnie, and some of the side characters have a lot of fun and a lot of trouble. Even in its first appearances, the three main characters are very developed. <br /> <br /> I really like this episode, although overall I prefer Mickey Mouse in the future. I like the animation, the steamer and the musical theme, clever jokes - and, of course, Mickey and Minnie! <br /> <br /> Like in many early cartoons, this is very casual, Walt came up with a very simple plot and just added gags to “prepare” it. There is also a parrot side character, which is very annoying and rather unnecessary. This is what I do not like about it. <br /> <br /> Another interesting feature of this episode is that no color version has been made for it (or, if it is, I have never heard of it)! <br /> <br /> Anyone who likes Mickey Mouse and Disney will get this pleasure.
