Another masterpiece that needs a DVD release, but some libraries have VHS and are worth finding. Just a brilliant play about many things, first of all about euthanasia, “respectability”, religion and fundamental human relations. The script effectively uses intellectual humor not only to cope with such a problem as a child with disabilities, but also to bind the parents in their love for “Joe” and to each other. Being a married couple, Alan Bates and Janet Suzman are ideal for both acting virtuosity and bringing their deep, intelligent characters to life. <br /> <br /> I recently saw the brilliant performance of Bates in “Batley”, which was released as a film a couple of years after “Joe Egg”, he plays the teacher as cynical, intellectual and funny, although Batley is much darker than his character from Bry. If you add such great performances in “Running Between”, “Women in Love”, “Whistling in the Wind”, “Caretaker” and “Girl George”, not to mention the more obvious “King of Hearts” and “Greek Zorba”, and I I would say that Alan Bates had a career comparable to Peter O'Toole, Albert Finney and other great British actors of his era. <br /> <br /> Director Peter Medak also had one of my all-time favorite “Ruling Classes,” released in the same year (1972) as “Joe Egg,” which includes a year of career in someone else’s book. He had a kind of spotted filmography (Kreis was another highlight), but these two stones mark him as a great director.
