I think it was back in 1987, when we had exams, and my friend and I saw in the newspapers that a teenager was playing in one of the theaters. We decided to go for it, not hoping anything good. But we were in for a pleasant surprise. The film was shot in 1965, but even by today's standards the plot was absolutely modern and far ahead of its time. The music was wonderful, and Dev Anand, like a well-bred city, looked and acted with all his might. I still remember this enthusiastic feeling when we left the theater after the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Who would have thought about this story about one person in love with three completely different girls at the same time? No, he is not three times or deceiving them, but he truly loves them all for various reasons. One is home, one is an actress, and the third is a girl from the “high society” who can also help the Virgin in his poet career. The question is which one is for him. What's worse is that all three love him. When everything comes to a dead end, the hypnotist takes him into himself and in his hypnotized state he dreams of his future with each of them and makes the right decision. <br /> <br /> This is his only color dream role in a black and white film - the essence of the film, but, oddly enough, it is edited from most versions available today. If you want to watch this movie, make sure that this part is intact. If you watch this movie without this part and get confused, do not worry, because you have just watched an incomplete movie.
