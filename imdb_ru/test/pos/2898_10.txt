How do these guys keep going? Each is 50 years old, and they behave as if they are only 30. They play 3 hours at each concert and almost do not sweat. This DVD is their first gig in Rio, Brazil. Although people do not speak English, they try to memorize words for the most famous songs of Rush and try to sing in a foreign language concert with their best friends. <br /> <br /> From Tom Sawyer to The Spirit of Radio, this live DVD will keep you in your chair, not wanting to pause or step back from the classics that you listened to when you were young. This is their 30th round of reunification (started in 1974). I went to their Scranton PA gig, and it was just as good, although they didn't play Freewill in PA, so I was upset. <br /> <br /> They have Freewill, they have The Trees, they have YYZ, The Pass, Driven, Dreamline, Red Sector A, Limelight, Roll the Bones, 2112 and more. 10 out of 10 because nothing else compares. If you never go to a Rush concert, then at least buy this DVD.
