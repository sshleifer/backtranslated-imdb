I saw this movie on TV and I really liked it! I am a real fan of the disaster movie, and this one was great. The cast was made from really interesting people. Connie Selleck is always great. And William Devane is in his own league. He can play both comedy and thriller in one movie, as few can. The storyline is great too. The idea of ​​being able to follow the timeline of what happens and use this timeline to prevent a global catastrophe is an interesting idea. And this film demonstrates it in such a way that it is almost entirely believable.
