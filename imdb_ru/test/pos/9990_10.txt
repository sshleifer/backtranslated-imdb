My God, what a story! This film is very good, and it was supposed to be the God who had this happen! You did a great job. The game was really good, you chose the right actors for sure. This film is so good that I’m really glad you did it, because if you hadn’t done it, I would never know about this story, because I’m not a big fan of golf and I think it's pretty boring, so thank. I really enjoyed it, and that's why I gave the movie 10 \ 10. I also liked Shea Labouf, he was perfect for the roll of Francis Quimet. I hope that most of what you wrote there was also true. Oh, and some parts were funny, but others I was just very happy.
