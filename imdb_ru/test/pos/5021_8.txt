Wow, I think the overall average rating of this movie on this site is incredibly low. There really is no reason not to love this film. “Michael” is a simple but rather original and easily pleasant romantic comedy. The plot includes a group of journalists / experts who are going to explore the mysterious appearance of an angel (John Travolta) in the Midwest. The angel turns out to be less holy and more worldly than we might expect, and that makes it interesting. His interest in women and the Beatles is acquiring a new meaning for angels. The romantic side of this film involves Michael Angel trying to get Andy McDowell and William Hurt together. They two may not have the greatest chemistry on the screen, but they certainly are enough to make it work well. Everyone who rated this movie so low (5.4 ??), come on! The film is not so bad. In fact, I found it pretty funny and memorable. Of course, this is not the best thing you will ever see, but still it is good. I believe that this film was significantly undervalued. It is fun, romantic and recommended by me. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
