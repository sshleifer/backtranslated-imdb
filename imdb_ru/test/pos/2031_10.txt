If you like 80's rock, you should definitely see this movie! I only saw him recently and completely fell in love with him! <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very interesting, it gives you a huge amount of rock melodies, and I don’t make it boring to find a second of the film! It was a great idea that some of the real musicians were doing it, doing what they do best. I was glad to see how Zakk, like Blas Elias, all showed solid performances. I tend to agree with many people who say that the first half of the film was much better than the second half, especially from the point of view of the script. It could have been done a little better, but that would not be a serious thing. One thing that really bothered me was the work of Jennifer Aniston. I thought that she was not suitable for this role, I just could not see a rock star girlfriend in her. But with the continuation of the film, you somehow understand that she coped well with this. There is a certain amount of honesty and sincerity that she delivers that she simply does not live cold. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, a good and funny movie that doesn’t delve into the characters, but gives you good entertainment, a sense of nostalgia and, of course, Jeff Scott Soto and Mike’s powerful vocals Matijevic!
