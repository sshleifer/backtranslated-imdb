Governments are elected for a three-year term, as Reg Withers stated in 1973, the Liberals were determined to continue forcing Labor to the polls until they were defeated. If you ask me, this is depicted in the documentation, but anyone who says that Kerr acted properly does not recognize the mercenary and costly strategy of the Australian Liberal Party. As for the series itself, although Max Phipps was bad Whitlam, his voice sounded too ghostly. In addition, more key political players should be used on both sides, although this could be a reflection of budget constraints at the time. However, I recommend this with care.
