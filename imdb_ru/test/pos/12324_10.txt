The whole film, a tricky adaptation of one of Joyce's stories "Dubliners", takes place on the night of January 6 (Epiphany) of 1906. Most of the film takes place at the annual party held by three maidens (two sisters and their niece)), where a group of high-profile Dubliners gather for an evening of music, reading and dinner. Although there are very few plots as such, the interaction and conversations between groups reveal a lot about Dublin at the beginning of the 20th century, when the desire for independence was just beginning. The cast, all talented Irish theater actors, with the exception of Angelica Houston, are universally beautiful, and in fact everyone feels like a guest at a meeting. The spicy final scene between Miss Houston and the amazing Donal McCann reveals a lot about the characters' marriage. There is a sharpness, mixed with humor and insight, and for those who love quiet, thoughtful films, the Dead are strongly recommended. My wife from Dublin, we arrange a ritual of watching this wonderful film every January 6th. After many views it never ceases to touch me, and every time I pick up something that I missed before.
