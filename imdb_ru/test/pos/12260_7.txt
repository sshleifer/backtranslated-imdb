BROADCAST NEWS opens with a series of short vignettes that are a smart way to start a story about TV presenters who have no idea what they are reporting. <br /> <br /> At the speech in front of the group there are reporters who are all bored with her presentation, most of them leave. When the last one comes out, the host of the event quietly says to HOLLY HUNTER: “I don’t think there will be any questions and answers.” The fine line in brilliantly written modest comedy, farce about the aspect of television-based binding to show business. <br /> <br /> WILLIAM HERT is a clumsy news presenter who works with HOLLY HUNTER as a network host. It really hurts to help fix the situation, and Holly refuses the bait - first. He knows that he can only look good, but not a reporter. He learns quickly while his earpiece is working, and he gets all the direct information from executive producer Hunter. <br /> <br /> Holly's other anchor friend (ALBERT BROOKS) helps by conveying the information she conveys to cause pain. Of course, she has contradictions about her feelings for reporter ace ace Brooks and her equally strong affection for the pretty boy director Hurt, who is experiencing her own attitude toward a good employee. <br /> <br /> You have to wait up to twenty minutes before the film ends to find out which man she ends up with. Brooks tells her that Hurt is not the one because he represents everything she is against. In this unpredictable comedy, it is impossible to say how Hunter (the neurotic heroine) will end. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that HOLLY HUNTER, WILLIAM HERT and ALBERT BROOKS were nominated for Oscar (Brooks in the role of support), like the film itself and director / screenwriter James L. Brooks. In general, seven honored nominations for an Oscar <br /> <br /> The script does not choose the traditional happy ending - and in this case it is the only drawback of a brilliant script. I felt deceived and somewhat disappointed by the thoughtful conclusion.
