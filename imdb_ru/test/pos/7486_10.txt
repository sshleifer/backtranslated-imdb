This movie is great. Not because he does something special or new, but because he is always magnificent in all his parts. No part stands out as “innovative” or “star”, but all parts are much higher than the mediocre, and this makes for me a great movie. <br /> <br /> I have several copies of this film and can buy it on DVDs for collectors or Blu-Ray someday (holding back now because of the high prices of Blu-Ray, and, of course, On the face that I do not have a Blu-Ray player ... but this is the essence of this review). <br /> <br /> This is partly mundane, but quickly turns into a drama filled with tension, some actions, vividly depicted characters and a well thought out plot that interests you to the very end. <br /> <br /> Wait, no, it does NOT start as usual. <br /> <br /> It all starts like Kun. Tar. The film WISHES that it can be. With a terrific scene where an attempt to buy coffee and donuts is going ... very, very wrong. <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, there was nothing, as it seemed, several people were dead, and several people were very rich. I will not tell you who ... look and enjoy! Overall rating: 10/10, A **, Excellent!
