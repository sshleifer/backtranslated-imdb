The rarely seen Peter Watkins Punishment Park is an uncompromising political weapon cruelly permeated by an endless desert landscape. The impartial anti-authoritarian holiday of abuse, at first glance, the escapades are so excessively militaristic and disgusting that they may seem like some far-away fantastic alternative anti-utopia story that Harry Tertledov might even love. But as soon as we dive in and really pay attention to the abominable diatribe, spewing those who preside over the tribunal with the upper tent, as well as the shotgun guards who follow the bloody case, our eyes are truly opened. Suddenly, we realize how precedent the creation of the film is by Watkins, since many of them are a kind of neoconservative topics for discussing youth culture and the legitimacy of divergent thoughts that politicians are throwing today. Of course, even then a lot of it poured out, but in fact it shows us how little has changed, and reports on how, in a sense, we are closer to such a world where Punishment Parks will be a real and frightening operation. <br /> <br /> The main players in almost every scene are experienced non-actors, who are mostly chosen for rash political views and a desire to show them to the camera. This gives an unprecedented heap of authenticity to the whole experience, since we do not for a moment question the reality of all the chaos. The filmed documentary style with a 16mm film, this is similar to the rough documentation of some disgusting government test project, which was classified until it was found years later. At least, it seems that now this story is known to him, perhaps not so much when it was (barely) released. But this adds extra weight to all lawsuits and helps draw you into this incredible, not too alternative, torture universe for convicted dissidents.
