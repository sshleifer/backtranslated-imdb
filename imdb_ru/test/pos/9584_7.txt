Ok, so I admit that it often seems that most Sylvester / Tweety couples have the same plot: Sylvester tries to get Tweety, but always fails and always gets hurt in the process, often with the help of a bulldog. I guess it looks like Wile E. Coyote chases the Road Runner (in other words, mammals should never stalk birds). “All Bir-r-r-rd” has the same plot and sets it up in a train. In a sense, the best part of these cartoons is to see what schemes Sylvester comes up with in order to try to go further than Tweety. We know that he will fail miserably, but it’s also fun to watch Tweety turn into a fool (if you saw his really early cartoons, you will see that he is not at all “cute,” but in fact there was a cruel band). This one basically works as a way to pass the time. <br /> <br /> By the way, I thought that I had seen - I mean, I speak tightly - Sylvester handed over a piece of baggage with the name of Vries Freleng on it. ,
