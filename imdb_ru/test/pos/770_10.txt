After watching the Harry Potter films, I was a fan of the actors of the trio of Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson; nevertheless, we waited to see if they would do other projects besides playing characters in the same year or every two years in J.K. Rowling series. Mainly instead of the trio, cameras and magazine articles focus more on Daniel and Emma, ​​as they are the lead man and the only lead woman in the saga, leaving Rupert at an impasse. No matter, every actor has time to shine, and Rupert’s light hits him once in this film. <br /> <br /> Driving Lessons are called Harold and Fashion of this generation, and Rupert Grint plays the role of Ben. Marshall, a young British boy who lives with his domineering mother (Laura Linney) and a weak father (a priest) for whom he wants to work in the summer, but cannot find a job, while at the same time passing the driving test (and without success) and writing poems for a young girl who shows no interest in him. <br /> <br /> Ben is looking for an ad in a church paper whose job is to take care of an elderly woman. He takes a job and realizes that a surprise awaits him, because Evie (Julie Walters, Rupert’s mother in the Harry Potter series) is an unemployed actress who is also a poet who gives Ben a break for her money. They communicate with each other and tell each other secrets, and Evie behaves like a child and falls into a prank when he drags Ben along on his out-of-town trip. From their hands, Ben not only drives all the way from Britain to Scotland, as Evie needs to read in the local library, but at the same time an elderly woman falls in love with a young man, in whom Ben begins to become a man. <br /> <There is a misfortune, and at the same time I enjoy Ben and Evie, and also say that I really liked the movie that was released in theaters, and I was impressed with Rupert Grint’s play, especially if he showed the rest of the movie. In a world in which he brought some of Ron Weasley to Ben Marshall, the actor will not stop at his brilliant performance.
