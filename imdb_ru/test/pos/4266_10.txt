This is a film that everyone who lives in Sweden should watch. The film shows the political turmoil that occurred in Gothenburg in 2001 from a new point of view. It contains interviews with those who have been convicted, where these people get their first chance after the riots to talk about their side of the story and why they think the world can be a much better place to live and participate in it. I react emotionally when I see it, because Iâ€™m just crazy about how people were treated during the riots and after the riots. <br /> <br /> I hope that as many people as possible will see this film, because it really makes your mind think: is it possible? In Sweden, democracy, in 2001?
