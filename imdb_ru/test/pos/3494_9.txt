I love this film !! This may be my generation, but I can really connect with what he says and wants to do. it kept me laughing Duration of the film, the next day and beyond. I think this film is not one to watch, if you mainly care about the plot and character development. this film is pretty much just for a generation that understands this. There are a lot of things that you just know that you grew up in that generation, which would not have happened if you were told 40. I think that Sasha is barren Cohen was Very, and I mean Very good. He is a genius. and the reason why he is such an idiot is that he can make people believe that he is a complete idiot and at the same time make him ridiculous !! <br /> <br /> Very good movie. highly recommend!!!! (not so much if you are over 30)
