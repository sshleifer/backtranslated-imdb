Mon Oncle Antoine watches the rocky face of the community of homegrown people from different sides, slowly, slowly from the very beginning, as one would expect, until we come out of broken (but trivial) hopes and expectations, in the seething ecstasy of dreams and soulful to stop revelation about the terrible riddle of mortality. <br /> <br /> Panoramas without a goal and zoom through a snowy mountain calm the mind and hypnotize the viewer. This hectic camera work is personalized as an extra character who is equally a vagabond: he quits his job at the coal mine and leaves his family to chop lumber, then leaves again and returns to the harsh humanity of his dead boy. <br /> <br /> A charming old woman cheats on her husband, and the young boy dies. Old things become new, and new ones die. Everywhere there is a snowy whiteness, just as surprised by surprise, as is the history of cinema.
