This film is not only about feelings and human emotions, but about everything that can be, but it is not. Poetry in films can be terribly boring and annoying, but this film is delightful to watch. Not to mention the amazing Irene Jacob, a magnificent actress in France - one of the best, in fact. When the movie ends, you can only regret. In the end, when something really cool, we want more (well, for another great K Kieslowsky movie with Irene Jacob, we can always watch La double vie de Veronique)
