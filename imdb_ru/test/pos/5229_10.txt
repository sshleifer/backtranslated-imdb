I first saw this movie as a video. Even on the TV, the prospects were impressive. It can be seen on the big screen in all its glory, he must have blown up people. <br /> <br /> As indicated in one or two other comments, the story of the first pioneers and how they dealt with the terrain problems. etc., the road to Oregon is as authentic as any other film. Thus, it shows that it is completely unnecessary to take responsibility for the truth - something that modern filmmakers should pay attention to - reality is quite enough. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on the struggle of man against the elements and hostility of the natives. Plots are few and simple. But the main plot is enough. In another place, I looked at the opponent Paramount on the “Battle Caravans” large path. Despite the more complex plot and the best actors, there are no breathtaking scenes in “Battle Caravans”. <br /> <br /> A large trail should be required to view.
