Do you like explosions? What about the fight? Well, in this film there is both. You know one more thing without which you cannot have a movie: a motorcycle with an ass, a type that bounces off someone's head and knocks them out at the same time. You bet the Stabilizer has one. There is even a classic scene with cliffs. <br /> <br /> In general, I am very proud to have even seen this movie ... and even more proud that my review was the first ... YES!
