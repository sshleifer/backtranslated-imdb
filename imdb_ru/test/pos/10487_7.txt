THE PRICE OF HONOR, aka THE POWER OF POWER is an ambitious western melodrama covering action that seeks to tell the old western version of Kennedy's murder. In 1881, the president goes to Dallas and he is shot from the window as he drives through the city in his carriage. Corrupt officials committed murder and forced the slave to a humble rape. Our hero, serious but soft, Giuliano Gemma, seeks to unravel the plot. An exciting story, bold in its subject matter, but interesting, despite the scarcity of action. The film is 7 out of 10, despite the bad DVD presentation that is too dark with a bad sound. Look for a good copy.
