Very strange, exciting, but intriguing film. I don't think I ever needed to see what a man could do with his ass, and I doubt that I would ever want to see it again. Nevertheless, there are many reasons for surprise, such as the Divine perception of Jane Mansfield’s classic walk in the film “The Girl Cannot Help” and the placement of pieces of meat between her legs in a grocery store. Sandy feeling is very similar to the Russ Meyer film. As a rule, bad action, with the exception of the Divine.
