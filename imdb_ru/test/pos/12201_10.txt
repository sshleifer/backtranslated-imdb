Now I saw the entire first season and I can say that I did not enjoy the show of this standard for a long time, it was great to see such a show in the process, and I hope that many of them will be on their way to the season finale. the best bar, no one can wait for the second season, as far as I think, everything can only improve, for example, as Mills will continue to change, Rick will return his family and how they will fall from the roof of the church, playing at this level, I easily understand why the show enjoys so much success among people, as long as the people who make such shows, I will continue to watch, I think itâ€™s hard now to come up with an original idea, as many shows cover a wide range of topics in order to see one as original as it is refreshing
