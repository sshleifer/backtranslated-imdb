I wanted to see it for a while: I never thought I would watch it on the wet Trafalgar Square in London with 15,000 other people, and all this on the Pet Shop Boys new account. <br /> <br /> Quickly that experience specifically. The new withdrawal from PSB seems to have suffered from the same problem as miniaturist Hugo Wolf, when he wrote his opera Der Corregidor: the long structure was a chain of short, that is, songs. PSB gave a smoother, integrated account, although it was rather static on its terms. They also could not resist the song: setting the text with subtitles worked in this respect a separate meditation on the action of the massacre in the Odessa steps during the validity of this sequence was, I would even say, counterproductive. In general, it was very exciting, although this is certainly what Eisenstein was trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> This is a very fascinating film with changeable editing, taking the place of tension acceleration or action. In fact, the film, although filmed beautifully and passionately played (there is a silent film melodrama, but not in excess of the Hollywood comic style), breathes with careful editing, arranging in parts certain frames with a sense of speed with which the audience will film them. And there is a huge range of perspectives too; Either he had many cameras or scenes in the harbor, and the steps took a lot of time. <br /> <br /> Superfilm that can be assessed independently of sound, as this would be a finished product conceived. 8/10
