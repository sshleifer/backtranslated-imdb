If you're going to watch this movie because Michael Kane or Michael Gambon are in it, don't worry, this is not their typical role, although I found Gambon fantastic. Watch out for Dylan Moran instead. I am a fan of everything I saw of him, and this is no exception, I didnâ€™t even realize that he could act, but even the characters he has to issue, I think, quite plausibly, are impressive given that the public knows that they are fake. <br /> <br /> The plot is brilliant, and although it is not constant, he laughs all the time, he has many other delights. Great movie for people with a sense of humor.
