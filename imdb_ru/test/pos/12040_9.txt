Darr, though a copy of a Hollywood film, is one of the best films I've ever seen. It is not only beautifully depicted, but also has great songs and beautiful landscapes. Shahruh is his usual me. His expressions and voice match his character. I was pleasantly surprised by the image of Sunny Deol in the film. He is a bit romantic and cute in the film, unlike his other characters in his other films. At times, you feel that justice was not done with his character. Sunny was supposed to be portrayed as a good guy in a movie, but in the end she looked like a villain. Juhi Chawla is beautiful and sparkling. She is her ordinary person. In short, Great love story with passion.
