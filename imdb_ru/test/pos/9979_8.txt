Rainy day without much difficulty. We looked through the movie network channels and found that this channel was just beginning, so we gave it a chance. <br /> <br /> The more we looked, the more we plunged into the story. This is an old story about how the working class is deprived, trying to turn it into a sport, which at that time (I think in 1913) usually played a rich upper class, but this film was as interesting as Sea Biscuit. Story. <br /> <br /> The acting is believable, and the actors are brilliant. AND . We are NOT golfers, so please don't miss it just because itâ€™s about golf. Any particular sport will serve the story, because it's about people. Golf is good for this story because of class differences and snobbery, which seem to appeal to some who play the game. <br /> <br /> The result. This is a good movie. It is well composed, and it is not always fun to see that those who think that they are better than others are going off a peg or two.
