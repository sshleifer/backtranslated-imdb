Despite the New York scenery and the New York characters, Summer in the City is not an American film, it is better than that. What is most unusual is the mixture of styles and genres. Directed by Niami demonstrates agility in combining comedy with tragedy, pathos with drama. <br /> <br /> The secret to Niamiâ€™s success seems to be that he has a great list of wonderful characters - each of them can have his own film and then filling them with beautifully realized performances of one of the most amazingly eclectic performers. that could be found in the same country, not to mention the same film, from Bai Ling to Ornella Muti, from Robert Burke to Peter Stormare, which shows that he has much more in it than stereotypes about the bad guy he plays in Hollywood paintings. Even Sandra Bernhard is funny here! <br /> <br /> John Keil Soundtrack - an added bonus, cream on a solid cake.
