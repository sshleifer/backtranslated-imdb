For those who do not know, the Asterix books are an extremely successful comic series about the village of indomitable galls who resist Caesar’s invasion thanks to the magic potion that makes them invulnerable supermen. There were several animation functions (only one of them, “The Twelve Tasters of Asterix,” really exciting the wit and spirit of the books, despite the fact that they were an original storyline story), before the well-played Christian Clavier and Gerard Depardieu took the main roles in two live acts. adaptations that were enormously successful throughout Europe, but made no impression in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> Unbroken French version is very fun, but unfortunately it is not available in the version with English subtitles outside of the British DVD. Despite the fact that there are still no signs of a theater or DVD release in the USA, this DVD also contains the version of Asterix et Obelix “Mission Cleopatra” Miramax, and you will never guess that ... edited (at least 21 minutes have passed) and voiced in English. Maybe Harvey took it for a Hong Kong film - after all, he had never seen a foreign film that he thought could not be improved by heavy re-editing and deposition for several years. <br /> <br /> Considering that Asterix et Obelix Contre Cesar was lovingly voiced into English from a particularly good translation script by Terry Jones, but otherwise remained unchanged, this kind of thing is not really Miramax . The results are not very good. The film was the best attempt to make the book blend farce, anachronisms and high-ranking classic humorous addictions to the screen, but many classic links disappeared (such as Medusa's great Raft show or Cyrano de Bergerac Depardieu links), along with something that seems too French or could slow the picture down, making the first 20 minutes a real ploy. There are a few highlights in the sequences, part of Depardieu was cut off (part was already quite small due to his serious health problems during the shooting: the American version was partially digitally modified to change the unhealthy pallor of his face in the original!) And usually, with duplication, because literal translations into English are not appropriate, the lines are either transferred so that they are no longer funny, or the dialogue has been completely changed (a couple of these changes are admittedly funny, One character dreams of a world in which he could move his lips in French and hear the words in English. <br /> <br /> Not a complete disaster, but very disappointing, considering how good the full version is. It would be nice to think that Miramax will do Shaolin Soccer and release both versions, but since they have been postponing both films for two years since they paid $ 45 million (another classic case of the infamous chronic buyer Harvey: oh, I wonder why ” Disney "was so offended because of their overspending) and to si Since there are no release plans, it may be too many people to think. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that such an accessible and interesting film will now be available only to non-French speakers in such an awkward version. It seems that the brave Gauls may have been able to defeat the legions of Caesar, but are not suitable for the Miramax boot.
