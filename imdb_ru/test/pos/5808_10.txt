This is an impressive production! I saw the show live twice in Chicago, and my only production problem was that I could only perceive fragments of what was happening. The scene consisted of three giant podiums and a platform, and when the action moves from one part of the scene to another, you lose track of what is happening, no matter where you are. As always, this is a thought-provoking sensory overload, skillfully captured in high resolution with 15 cameras! The frames were masterfully edited, in my opinion, one of the best live DVDs of all time! I just hope and want them to release it on Blu-Ray HD-DVD so that we can relive this extravaganza again and again.
