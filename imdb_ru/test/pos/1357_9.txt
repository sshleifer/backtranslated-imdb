This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series. Kentaro works in an animation studio, which is quite interesting if you donâ€™t know anything about how anime studios work. In addition to the 3rd episode, it was probably the least risky, but it aroused interest among girls, as well as an unexpected reunion with others in previous episodes. My only complaint about this episode was that it seemed to me too short, but at the same time it could only be because it was the only original script of the show that was not based on one of the manga heads. but everything ended well, and we had a pleasant feeling that Kentaro was constantly 25 years old, he was studying. Be sure to watch the entire series to the end, you can buy the entire series for about $ 17, you can watch it in about 2.5 hours or watch your favorite episode if you have 20 minutes of free time (what do I do if I have lunch break at school.) Nice series, check it out.
