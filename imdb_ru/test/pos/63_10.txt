This is a really great movie (after he was able to ignore Blake Edwardsâ€™s references to the Pink Panther, which he seems to be obsessed with and madly ridiculous of) Julie, as usual, is wonderful - sings and plays brilliantly. I remember seeing him at the Odeon cinema in Haymarket, London, after it was released. However, the absence of Julie at the British premiere of STAR! was the most unfortunate and (apparently!) due to filming from the air for Darling Lily over Ireland. A reasonable excuse if she appeared on any of these air shots, but she did not. Two box office failures in a row ruined her film career for several years. But dear Lily, like STAR !, deserves a much greater public assessment.
