I'm not from the USA, I'm from Central Europe, and I think the show is surprisingly good. This can be easily compared with married with children. My name says that this is not a show for a conservative public. I mean, I'm not so liberal, but it may be a slight difference between European conservatism and us minuses. In any case, the show is becoming very popular in our area, and itâ€™s very bad that there are only two seasons in it. The last episode opens many solid and funny moments. In any case, I and many nations would be glad if this continued. The last thing I really care about is some kind of moral education, very beautifully packaged in humorous scenes. I mean, I saw a lot of comedies, in which there were more than two or more minutes of very sad in the tragic scenes that do not fit into the comedy. The war contains nothing of the kind and is made for laughter. It's like the Simpsons and married, who also have no sad or even unfriendly moments. I apologize for my terrible knowledge of English, but I still hope that you will understand what I meant.
