I liked this film, independent filmmaking at its best. Cinematography, rhythm, rhythm and acting were perfectly synchronized. Fred Carpenters is the best job to date! The film is well written with lots of plot twists that will lead you to a beautiful finale. He moves well and keeps you informed. Being a photographer, I was most impressed by cinematography. Lighting creates a mood and beauty that can usually be found in a much larger budget film. This gave the actors a great canvas from which they could create their magic. And this is exactly what they did! Great performances of all the actors, and each of them was well played in their roles. As I said at the beginning, this is a wonderful film and one of the best Fred Carpenter films. You will love it.
