The first scene of the murder is one of the best murders in the history of the movie (almost as good as the scene in the soul in Psycho), and the play of Robert Walker is fantastic. A psychopath associated with a tennis star in exchange killings. This film is very good, but there is one problem: why doesnâ€™t Guy Haynes go first to the policeman?
