I love this film. He focuses on both issues: reality and fantasy. in fact, because, hey, we all wanted a date with this popular Billy guy. and some of us have not kissed yet, right? be honest! <br /> <br /> Another real problem is due to the pain people get from teasing. and wow, school life. Remember this? fantasy finds your true love when you are 25 and still in high school. not quite a fantasy, but close enough! <br /> <br /> Although some of the roles are unbelievable, it was a great movie. There are no other words to describe such an incredible job. and the story was wonderful. Drew Barrymore did an amazingly wonderful job, as did the gay David Arquette. the people who worked in the film are all wonderful. didn't I repeat that? <br /> <br /> Never kissed - this is one of the films that future generations should watch. it shows reality and some non-problems for people like you and me.
