Last night, my friends and I watched a film in Austin at the show for AGLIFF (film festival). This film was one of the best I have seen this year. It was a great comedy - very original and soulful - and funny as hell! All viewers laughed throughout the film. Texas is a large state with many small cities and, of course, a large number of teenagers who grew up as "fat girls." I know that many people will relate to this film on a personal level. Ashley Fink and Robin de Jesus were great - they were so good in these commercials, as if the script was written with their account. And speaking of the script, he was very well written (very likely), and Ash is a great actor (only his expression made me giggle). This is an independent film - but don't let this fool you ... This is a good film! Seeing this caliber of work from someone so young really inspires.
