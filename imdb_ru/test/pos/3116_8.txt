The speeches of leading men make this long, difficult journey to the west interesting in everything. The Sons of the Pioneers soundtrack is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard. The journey itself is somewhat episodic, and Joan Drew is greatly mistaken. In general, this is a very spiritual and spiritual western.
