Johnny Knoxville is crazy. <br /> <br /> In the first “Jackass” he enjoyed jokes more than physical things ?? did his opening gag when renting a car and the later episode with an air horn on a golf course look more like some kind of extreme hidden camera ?? but in Donkey: Number Two, he really got off the rocker. <br /> <br /> Starting from the sequence in which the bull chases him through the living room, or later when he rides a rocket (a trick that almost cost him his life due to an unexpected explosion from the rocket), and especially when he deliberately stands in front of a defense mechanism and brings spray granules into the stomach, Knoxville is crazy. In the first movie, Bam Marghera and Steve-O ?? The notorious party-goers were bold, but you know that this is pretty bad when you see how Knoxville seduces them to do the trick. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is a series of tricks performed by guys who use testosterone while constantly trying each other. Will this eventually end in death for one of the actors ?? in Jackass 2, Steve-O almost loses his leg to the shark, Knoxville (as already mentioned) is almost pierced by a rocket blast, and so on and so forth. Jackass 3 has already been confirmed due to the success of 2, and, frankly, I can not imagine any trick acting as a bull on the starting scene of this movie ?? these are incredible shots. It’s almost unbelievable, and I wondered if it was faked, but obviously it was 100% authentic. (Which is actually somewhat frightening.) And in terms of extremes, is Jackass 2 far superior to its predecessor ?? it also seems more cinematic than the first film, with fewer cheese titles that preceded the stunts that were known on the original MTV television show. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the boys were given too much freedom, and a good amount of gags, are these just sloppy exercises in rudeness ?? I can enjoy the occasional gag in my mouth, but watching a man relax in a miniature toilet, or see Steve-O take a beer in the ass (yes, to be honest), after a while begins to rub. Even fraternal boys on screening I attended ?? Who was enthusiastic when Wee Man picked up a card from behind and got hit in the chair? Some scenes in this film were disgusting. It is not a question to get away with as much as possible ?? it is a question of saying: "Is it even interesting or funny?" Many times, unfortunately, this is really not the case. <br /> <br /> But for every unsuccessful stunt associated with feces and farting on people's faces, there are some brilliant details of a hidden camera. Foolish director Spike Jonze (“Adaptation”) dresses like an old woman and goes out on the street naked, with sagging breasts and without shame. And my favorite parody was associated with Knoxville as an irresponsible old man who dined with his grandson, allowed him to drink alcohol and smoke, swear and insult people. This is a classic comedy, brought to the new extremes with the freedom of R-rating. It's a shame that they had to spoil all the cool stuff ?? including the final segment involving a complex terrorist joke ?? in the course of comic jokes. <br /> <br /> However, in this film there is enough spirit and madness to deserve viewing, and the concept of cinematography in the cinema really rose to a new height.
