The plot "In the mood for love" is quite simple: a married man and a married woman (although not each other) gradually develop a romantic affection for each other. The pace of the film is overwhelmingly slow, and very little really happens between them. However, against the backdrop of Hong Kong in the early 1960s and the keen sense of director Wong Kar-Wai to capturing the beauty of the situation, as well as the main characters, this film is happy to watch. The actors Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are both great, and Wong Kar-Wai did an extraordinary job to catch the feeling and nostalgia of the past (what many films and directors are trying to do, but usually fail). There are so many little details that add to the charm of the film (the directorâ€™s trademark), and colors and cinematography are what send this simple story as a wonderful cinematic achievement. 9/10.
