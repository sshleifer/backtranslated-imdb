Reality before reality show? A copy of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"? Precursor of "Say something", which is more rude? I can't decide, but the soundtrack * is * the 80s - Blondie, Journey, REO Speedwagon, Devo, Lionel Richie and U2 - I can't believe it, they would never throw all these genres together as a teenager Today's movie . <br /> <br /> I remembered this as a teenager - these were mostly sexual aspects, not hints of altruism. What for? I was a nervous teenager in the 80s. Watching it again, I just cannot describe how much I love this Rose, played by Kimberley Richardson, who in the 90s turned out to be the voice of Pepper Ann, and she was almost 30 years old when she was in The Last American Virgin playing with 16 year olds is awesome! Full cheese, reality, fantasy and comedy - with a sincere cherry on top.
