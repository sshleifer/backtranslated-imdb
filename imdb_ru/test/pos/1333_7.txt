I felt deceived, knowing the whole story. While there could be a turn, this turn was so significant that I felt betrayed. I suppose I could use a better writer who could better weave all the elements of the story together. The author could reveal more "turns" throughout the entire film, and not all at the end. In addition, I believe that the actors coped very well with what they had, especially with Matt Damon, who actually had a small character in his character, little quirks that were not selfish or similar to the simple criminal always knows what he is doing. The other main characters were their separate entities, which simply communicated with each other. The cohesion of the group in Ocean of Eleven has disappeared.
