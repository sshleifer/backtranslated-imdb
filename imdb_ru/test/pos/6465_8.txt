Despite the fact that this small film was lost after "On the Embankment", Edge Of The City can certainly withstand this classic star game. This is another story about the docks and the code of silence that controls it. <br /> <br /> Next to a corrupt union in which Lee J. Cobb participated in On the Embankment, Jack Warden is a petty corruption. But he is real enough as a gang boss in one of the docks, which scares other workers, being useful with his fists and saving hook, and he gets the rest to return some of their hard-earned money. And on this job, everything is earned with difficulty. <br /> <br /> One guy the guard can't intimidate is Sidney Poitier, the other gang boss, and when he tries to intimidate rookie John Cassavetes, Poitiers takes him under his wing. These two develop true friendships, and Poitiers and his wife Ruby Dee even associate Cassavetes with Kathleen Maguire. <br /> <br /> The warden is a truly disgusting creature, and it is sad for him that because of the strength of his personality and his physical skill, he is the cow of all the others in submission. In this sense, he is tougher than Lee J. Cobb, who really had to rely on a collection of impressions in order to fulfill his will in On the Embankment. <br /> <br /> "The Edge of the City" marked the debut of director Martin on the big screen. Ritt, who did a great job with good actors from New York players and was good at radar cinema. The low budget of the film really shows, but you are so impressed with the cast that you really don't care. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes, as a loner with the past, hip and strong Poitiers, are both fine, but my personal favorite in this film is Ruby Dee. She should have received an award for her performance, her last scene with Cassavetes is outstanding. <br /> <br /> Catch this scene if possible. I would like it to be on DVD or VHS.
