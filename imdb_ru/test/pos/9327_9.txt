Regardless of how you feel about Michael Jackson himself, you cannot deny that this video is the most unique video of all time. There is no other video that would even be close to Thriller. I first saw him when I was 6 years old, and he scared me. Now I look at it with a smile, because now I can appreciate the miracle it is. I like this video and it will continue as long as there are music videos. I think everyone should sit down and watch it when it ever comes, and look back and see how great it was, especially to be 1983 year.
