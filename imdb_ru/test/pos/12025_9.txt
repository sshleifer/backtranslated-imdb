This special offer from Bravo is one of the most entertaining things I've ever seen on TV. Unlike Me First & The Gimme Gimmes (the world-famous punk supergroup / cover band), Dan really should be appreciated. <br /> <br /> On paper, the group Dan is just a joke the actor sings girlish songs and inserts into the text of poetic profanity. If you listen to their Dan Band Live CD, that's all you get, and it will quickly become obsolete. (I bought it only because there were a few songs in it that were not on television.) But what made Dan Finnerty a hollywood cult hero was his amazing presence on stage. This guy owns his audience every second he is on stage. And backup performers also make up a large part of the visual highlight. As for the group itself - they mostly remain out of sight, but, of course, much more energetic and full of enthusiasm than your typical lounge-style group. Hopefully the DVD version will be released soon - some songs were almost certainly cut out, and although hard censorship adds a little unintended humor, it also removes INTENTIONAL humor. <br /> <br /> If there is any sense of peace in this, the owners of casinos in Vegas will soon be fighting for someone who can quickly build Dan his own showroom. <br /> <br /> “Remember, my name is ... GLORY!”
