Rita Hayworth is exactly where she should be - as the “Cover Girl” in this 1944 Technicolor film, which also starred Gene Kelly, Phil Silvers, Eva Arden, Lee Bowman and Otto Kruger. Rita plays the beautiful dancer Rusty, working in a small club owned by the man she loves, Danny (Kelly). Every Friday they go to the oysters with Genius (Silvers), a club comedian. They all hate oysters, but are looking for a pearl. They believe that when they find one, all three of them will be lucky. <br /> <br /> Rusty plays and wins the role of a cover girl for a magazine — she starts ahead of the other contestants because the owner of the magazine (Kruger) sees a similarity between Rusty and the girl he once loved, and which turns out to be Grandma Rusty. As soon as she becomes a cover girl, a world opens before her, and her dreams of appearing on Broadway come true. Danny wants her to succeed, but at the same time realizes that he lost her. <br /> <br /> The “Cover Girl” has a lot of dance numbers and songs by Jerome Kern, and Rita has been dubbed Martha Mears. Rita at her best plays and grow in the present, and her grandmother in the past. For such a sexy, desirable, gorgeous woman, she was obviously very insecure and was always under the control of powerful men. None of this has ever been shown on the screen, nor is the fact that she did not want to be a movie star. She is one of the true goddesses and brought to life everything she did. Gene Kelly plays a serious role here, but he has many chances to dance and sing. Phil Silvers is very kind and funny as a comic and best friend. <br /> <br /> This is a very good film without boring spots. The only problem I encountered was the thought that Rusty had to choose between a successful career and the man she loved. When supermodel Jinks Falkenberg, who plays herself in a film, talks about getting married, her boss warns that the modeling business needs her too much. We were not told whether to continue to grow their careers or return to work in Danny - but all the signs seemed to point to the Brooklyn club. Why couldn't she have both? However, you can't beat Cover Girl for superb entertainment, beautiful color, great music, great energy, great performances and his most incredible virtue, the glorious Rita Hayworth.
