Jack Frost 2 is probably the most fun movie I've ever seen in my life. The full title of the film is "Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Snowman Mutant Killer." Fans of horror films who like obscene storylines will be delighted with this. This film was right on the video, and for good reason. And that's why: acting was so cruel and terrible that it made you cry. The main character did not have individuality, and a bad acting game worsened everything. The script was, was also brutal. Each character always says a stupid line and adds tender lines to the bad choreography, then you have something bad. Secondly, the storyline is not so impressive, but since this film was right on the video, it is forgiven. The director and writer could turn the idea of ​​a murderous snowman into something cool, but they did not. In this story, many holes in the plot. First, a cup of coffee enters the tank with melted Jack Frost. Scientists are trying to restore his life, but could not. As soon as a cup of coffee fell into the tank, Jack Frost was fully restored. Now it is immune to antifreeze. In the first part of Jack Frost, the main character's DNA was mixed with antifreeze, which was used to kill Jack Frost. Since the main character is allergic to bananas, Jack Frost too. Therefore, here is my point of view. Sam's DNA is said to be combined with Jack Frost's DNA. But one of the scientists had a little saliva on the cup, so when it fell into the tank, the scientists DNA would be combined with Jack Frost. Another thing is that the special effects were also not very good. Here are the good points: Jack Frost 2 has a lot of blood, which looks pretty realistic. Despite the fact that this film is not perfect, it is still interesting. Overall, Jack Frost 2 is a nice horror movie. The first one was better though. 7 out of 10.
