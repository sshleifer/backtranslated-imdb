Despite myself, I really like this movie. Pauley Shore always laughs funny, and there is no exception. He just plays a fabulous heart with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> His performance in this, although nothing unusual for him, is not so good that it seems to raise the performances of other actors. Perhaps this is due to the fact that he is such a guy, from which it is easy to bounce. <br /> <br /> The cliché about country life in this film is ridiculous and, like Shore’s “urban boy,” Crow is so at odds with the lifestyle is also fun, but not only is he a fish out of water; Comedy also stems from the fact that for any "ordinary" person or people, Crawl is a strange nightmare of man. That's why this film works in such a wonderful way: we love Crawling, it is a breath of fresh air, but we can also sympathize with Warners. He's a damn culture shock. <br /> <br /> Although this film is a classic Pauley Shore film, there is no need for a great deal of mental ability to enjoy this film, to enjoy it, and you even “never judge a book by its cover” of morality here somewhere. Not bad, not bad at all.
