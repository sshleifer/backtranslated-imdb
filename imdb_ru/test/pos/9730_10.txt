This is probably one of my favorite games, although I have the first one and I saw Curse, Legacy and vs. Demonic Toys. The only one better than this is PM vs. DT. The Curse is the worst in the series than the first, and then its Legacy. I recommend that people see this against DT. Those who say it stinks are so wrong, the story is well written, and this is a good film. This is a classic film that even younger children can watch and not be afraid of others. Well, this is my review, you can call me Gipdac, (itâ€™s easy to know where it came from: Dalmatian series 101, you can watch it at Toon Disney at 4:00 am) my reviews in due time. If you want to know why I am watching this? I'm 12! Word of advice: eat mental food, arrrrroooooooooo! I also agree with you, motto 1, but why people like others because they care more than horror, and because dolls look worse. In addition, you can call me Gipdac.
