This is definitely a good movie, unlike what other people say. Pelin and I both watched the movie “3 times,” and the end is stupid, but this is part of the package ... experimenting with death is the same thing as trying to challenge this, so the movie is cool. For those who want to see Kevin Bacon’s classic film, watch this, please. Take care of the welcome from Istanbul. we will write 10 lines if you really want 2, but we think it's a waste of time, bye. The rest of this review should not be taken seriously, because we just wrote it to fulfill the requirement of 10 lines (which is insane), but we are good people and therefore we adapt to the rules that are set for us. People watch this film not because we wrote 10 lines, but because it is good. and by the way we wrote 12 lines !!
