In this offer, you only need to look at the current offer of the current Westminster Kennel Club to see the parallels. Outrageously funny and reflects the true nature of the competition. One can only imagine the wits of producers and the amazing abilities of performers. I would also nominate this film for the Globe Award and would feel that it is one of the funniest I've ever seen
