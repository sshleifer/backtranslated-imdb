This film is one of the classics of film history. This was not done to please the modern audience, so some people these days may think that it is creaky or unnatural. I found it absorbs throughout. Cherkassy has a perfectly correct presence to play Alexander Nevsky, just as he did when he played Ivan the Terrible (Ivan the Terrible) a few years later. The music was beautiful. <br /> <br /> My only complaint was a poor soundtrack, which was rather distorted. Although I know a little Russian, it would be nice to be able to choose more words, rather than relying almost 100% on subtitles. Although I watched it on an old video from the library. Perhaps by now there is a DVD version on which the sound has been improved. I would like to know if the actors used archaic Russian or even Old Church Slavonic when they spoke. The subtitles were oddly worded, and it's hard for me to say whether it should reflect an older way of speaking, or the subtitles were simply not done well.
