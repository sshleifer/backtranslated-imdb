Without a doubt, the Blue Planet series is one of the greatest documentaries ever made on the ocean. For five years, the directors worked tirelessly on the series, getting shots that no one has ever seen (i. E. Watching the fisherman for the small pictures shown in the textbooks is a real pleasure, but itâ€™s just a needle in the huge haystack of the sea covered by the Blue Planet. From the open ocean to the tidal pools, from the coral seas to the deepest dark part of the ocean itself, the BBC sends the viewer on an almost magical journey across the ocean. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that one of my very first dreams in life was to become a marine biologist, and after watching this show, the dream was revived. I have studied the oceans of this world for years and have seen countless documentaries about coral reefs and dolphins, whales and crustaceans. But in general, no one was able to capture life under the waves as well as this group of people. <br /> <br /> See the Blue Planet series in its entirety, I promise that you will not regret it.
