This is one of the best films I have seen in recent years. Belmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles, he is like a naive plantation owner, and she is like a mysterious deceiver. let's say that this is a film that explores the dark side of love and the pain, humiliation and ability to self-deception that accompany him, although he is dressed like a noir film. Forget this weak remake with Jolie and Banderas, look instead for a genuine work of art and indulge yourself with some moments of great cinematic beauty.
