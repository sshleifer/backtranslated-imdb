I thought it was a really great movie, especially since for me it was just a filler. I was bored, I got it from the library, and I really enjoyed it! I watched it twice in two days, and the more I watch it, the more I like it. I thought that the plot would be very trite, but in the end it was really possible to say that it would be true. I liked the main characters, and I thought that they were well played, and you can see real friendship in them. I thought they all did an excellent job. The ending was good. And you really hate the bad guys, and you really like the good guys. This is what a movie should look like.
