A lot of action, a gentle love story, unexpected actors and overall great fun. The special effect is acceptable / decent, some fights are pretty neat with some interesting acrobatic movements. The overall story moves forward, and it is so stupid that it makes you wonder when the inevitable happens, although there is a slight turn (only a small one). The general naivety of the film sometimes makes it rather capricious. Enough pretty chicks, what more could you want. Ps. if you are going to watch a movie like this, try viewing it from the point of view of the category the movie will fall into (not necessarily where it should fall). that is, do not blow good cheese films!
