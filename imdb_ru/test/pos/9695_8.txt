Does exactly what you expect, and then some. The first film was a step forward compared to a television show with heavier stunts, broadcast without censorship and a gross factor that increased. Surprisingly, Jackass Number Two is even more perverted. <br /> <br /> Tricks have become even more dangerous and spectacular, and some amazing painful tricks, studded with good funny scenes, make a smile turn into a curl of disgust. <br /> Knoxville, as always, dominates the trial, but this time he has reason to occupy a central place, as he voluntarily stands for the most dangerous and idiotic of all the tricks, and Bam Mager also reveals himself to be so same wild as before. despite the fact that his image was softened in “Viva La Bam”. Surprisingly, the notorious Wild Boys (Steve O and Chris Pontius) seem to be taking part in fewer parodies, even though they were concentrated on previous excursions. <br /> <br /> If you like Jackass or Dirty Sanchez, then you definitely enjoy this movie, and you will laugh for 100 minutes of its duration, if you consider it to be a childish, disgusting or sad picture of modern youth culture, you will find its as offensive as ever. So damn it.
