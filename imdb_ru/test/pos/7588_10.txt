As already noted, the short film "Every Sunday" (1936) can be considered the first music video. It was a fluke due to the need for MGM to create many short films for demonstration using full-length material. They had a couple of talented young vocalists (Judy Garland and Dina Durbin), and they put together a mix of musical styles at a Norman Rockwell concert in the park. <br /> <br /> Who would have dreamed of capturing the best collection of images from the time of the “Eesskansky steps” by Eisenstein. <br /> <br /> Today is Sunday, when a few inattentive guys sit in the park behind a small wooden strap, and a tired ensemble plays Strauss. Events unfold, and next Sunday Judy and Deanna save the day. Opera Dinna sings "Il Bacio" (Kiss), and Garland follows with a contrasting "Waltz with a swing". The climax perfectly combines two styles in the duet "Americana". <br /> <br /> A must see. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
