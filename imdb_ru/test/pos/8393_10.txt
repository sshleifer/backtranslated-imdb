It is almost as good as blown away. I like this movie, I can watch it again and again. Scarlett always gets what he wants, regardless of its value. She tries hard to forget Rhett, but she just can't do it. She loves him so much. This is the story of true love. It began with a breeze and ended in this film. The only real way to end this movie is for true love. It was necessary for Scarlett and Rhett to come together again at the end. the way it all ended with your daughter. What more can you ask for? There is no better end to this great love story than this. What else can I say about this great movie?
