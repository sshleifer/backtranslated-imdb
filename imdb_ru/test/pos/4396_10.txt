My husband received a OBWAT DVD for Christmas, and it was the best gift we received! We watch it every time we need to laugh, and so far we have watched it 12 times! The scenery in this film is beautiful, and the music is wonderful! We also purchased a soundtrack and play it in our cars and at home, whenever we are. I need to pick me up, and this is also daily! If someone needs an offer for a good gift for movie lovers, this film is it! The characters are funny, charming, and their expressions are too funny to describe! I've always been a fan of George Clooney, but now I'm also a fan of Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete) and now I am looking for them in other films! You should see this movie !!!
