I thought this movie was cleverly written and played very well. This is a film that is far superior to other films in terms of originality and pleasure. Rupert Grint played his role surprisingly, and he has a general skill for the acting business. Almost obsessed mother added quite a lot to the plot and was a character who could almost instantly be hated. This somehow reminded me of the Divine Secrets of the Sisterhood of the ego. Not the actual content of the film, but the room and general tone of the film itself. “Driving Lessons” is a history of coming of age, which many may find very easy to relate to because of an irresistible mother, lack of freedom, and discovery of oneself.
