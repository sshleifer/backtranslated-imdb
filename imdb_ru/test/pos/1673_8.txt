This film is a work of pure class from beginning to end, for a moment forget about the famous 28-minute robbery without dialogue, forget that it is set in Paris, and forget that this is Noir. The film itself, the premise and the performance make it a pure golden experience ... it is witty and thought out to the smallest detail, like the robbery itself. He depicts real characters that are not only believable, but also with which you empathize. This is a film that does not read the concept of a robbery, but shows what it is ... theft. This shows that robbery is hard work and ultimately not worth doing. Now, all of the things that have been considered are set on this audacious 28-minute sequence without saying a word, and unfold in magnificent Paris with really great attention to detail and fantastic cinematography and this latest scene ... when you look up and see these trees. .. wonderful use of raw and basic shooting techniques ... in my opinion, this is a masterpiece, and I'm glad I saw it.
