Side effects for those who do not know are usually not successful, because most of the original characters are missing. <br /> <br /> Here they are, and you could not ask for a better ensemble in that there’s essentially a small, silly cartoon that is not meant to do anything other than entertainment. <br /> <br /> J. P. Manu, who replaced David Spade, does a wonderful job of preserving Cuzco's ego and, nevertheless, does not look as annoying as Spade’s character (Spade’s character has been doing this for decades and gets on your nerves). He has a softer voice, but he somehow fits. <br /> <br /> Erta Kitt, repeating her role in the role of Isma, is gorgeous. Since she became Batman many years ago, she has not had much approval, except perhaps for her nasty role in Boomerang. Funny how the character looks like her. <br /> <br /> And Patrick Warburton. There is no way he can't be funny, except when he was completely wasted in Men in Black 2. I have been a fan of him since Seinfeld, but unlike this character, he plays a real nice guy who is being dragged in in what are such nice things. <br /> <br /> Animation is really beautiful, as is usually the case with all Disney, but sometimes the design of the characters is too embellished. Well. Two of the three are not bad.
