It is quite revealing to see this today and assess how far we have come in what we expect from films, and at the same time assess how many fundamental concepts have been established. <br /> <br /> Here we have a full voicing narrative talking film - audio and visual effects are pushed to the limits of their period. Framing is limited to about the waist and up - without a close-up face. <br /> <br /> The compositions are wonderful; there is an early cross-cutting scene to demonstrate the dialogue; treacherous descent into the canyon with dark angles of perspective; the sun-bleached skeleton lies in the dust when the wheels and legs move to the top of the frame; the tension in the battle between the hero and the bad guy is visually captured by shooting over the long axis of a large tree lying between them; and so on, and in the early stages of visual treatment. <br /> <br /> Today it is alarming to see young Wayne carry a film that is not burdened with ego or manners. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Walsh recognized the self-reference: the subject is the journey of a scattered group of pilgrims; those who appear on the screen are a scattered group of actors, Vaudeville comedians, shell players, and, possibly, Carney Barker and the ten in one show veterans. They all travel together to pave the way for film making. <br /> <br /> It is worth at least one viewing to appreciate the source of so many visual ideas borrowed from later films.
