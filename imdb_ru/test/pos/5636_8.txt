For me, the best and most memorable films are those that I don't know anything about when I first watched. American film is a great example of just such a gem. Watching TV late at night, I noticed one and only good overview among dross - fortunately, I decided to really treat. “American Cinema” is a documentary about the unforgettable Mark Borchardt (supposedly pronounced “orchard”), a very eloquent and charismatic guy from Wisconson, when he tries to write, shoot and remove “Midwestern”, a sandy, low-budget horror film on which he worked for many years. In Mark we find a young man filled with contrast. His appearance is reminiscent of the classic stereotype of the trailer-trash - skinny, fluffy mustache, 80s heavy metal style, mullet hairstyle, etc. For the camera, however, Mark demonstrates amazing wit and insight, philosophizing about life, love, movies and American style. As the film unfolds, unfortunately it becomes clear that Mark’s lack of discipline and drunkenness are sabotaging his creative efforts. American Movie - charming hours, filled with fun moments and colorful characters. Chief among them is Mark's buddy, Mike Shank's buddy, the quiet reformed stoner, who, having defeated the predilection for scratch cards, now depends on soda. I loved American cinema very much. It causes real sympathy between the audience and the main characters and provides fun without feeling exploiter. I sincerely recommend it to everyone.
