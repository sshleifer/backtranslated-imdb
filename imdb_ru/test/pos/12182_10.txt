Personally, I loved the Tris movie! My best friend told me about it, so I rented it and looked. This is amazing! Music, acting, storyline builds emotions, all ... well, except for one minor fact. Absolutely no loyalty to books at all. I saw this film before an interview with a vampire and even before I learned that books exist, so I was shocked to find out how many people really hate this film. I quickly realized that the fans of the books were not at all pleased with the infidelity, not wanting to be hypocritical (I hate the Harry Potter films because of the lack of loyalty to the books), I was silent. In the end, I took “Lestat the Vampire” and immediately understood why everyone hated him. It is completely different (the movie “Queen of the Damned” is a combination of “Lestat the Vampire” and “Queen of the Damned”). But I still loved the film from the moment I saw it, before reading any of the books. Therefore, if you have not seen this film or have not read the book, first watch the film, or you will hate it. If you read the book, then you have every right to hate this film.
