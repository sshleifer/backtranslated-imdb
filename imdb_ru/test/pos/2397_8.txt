I was very impressed with what Eddie Monroe was able to achieve with regard to his overall impact on me. I say this because I know that this independent film had a limited budget / resources, but despite this, it looks like a convincing and well-thought piece of work. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning to the end you can enjoy a few relatively unknown actors, in which I can not believe, but in the coming years they will make a lot of noise in the industry, Eddie Monroe never ceased to interest me and dance in an emotional rhythm . This is a well-written story with an astounding ending, despite my efforts not to be caught off guard. <br /> <br /> Many of the actors listed in this film are names that should be noted in the future. Someone told me that Paul Regina passed away recently, and if this is true, then this is a real tragedy, as his stoic performance in Eddie Monroe is remarkable. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Fred Carpenter, who really snatched out the winner with this!
