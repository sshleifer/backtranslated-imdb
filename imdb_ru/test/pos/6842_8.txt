Stumbled upon this film recently after so many rumors about it. This is a great, not pretentious film for people who love literature and films. Not "camp", but with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> BIG ACTOR! From gorgeous Carla Gugino and Emma Thompson to German superstar Tyla Schweiger, this film is a feast for the eyes. Alan Rickman is very funny as a gang antagonist. I would love to see a movie with this character, and Emma Thompson all the time solved cases and disputes between them (such as Tracy, Hepburn, etc.). do not look if this is not a sphere, because the compositions are very rich). <br /> <br /> Sexy, sexy, very fun. <br /> <br /> For the best use of Just Like Heaven by The Cure (optional), see to believe!) <br /> <br /> ********
