I did not expect much from this story about a child whose term paper was stolen and turned into a film script ... which he sends to Hollywood to make it ... but ... hey ... it is still a funny movie. Frankie Muniz from "Malcom in the Middle" became famous as a child, and he is pretty good, and Amanda Bynes as his girlfriend is also very good. Yes, the film works like an advertisement for the Universal Studios theme park, and this is really a stupid kids movie ... but I still liked it. Grade: B-
