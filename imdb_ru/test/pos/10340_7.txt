The plot of this film is stupid, like a bag with hair. Jimmy Smith plays a character who could be upset by the absurdity of this story. He is angry and beats his wife. This character is as far from his role as possible in the police of New York and Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> If you think that he has an appearance and acting role to play the role of a really bad guy, she is your gift. <br /> <br /> but !!!!!!!! Throughout the film, Mary Louis Parker wears black miniskirts and little black mini dresses. <br /> <br /> She always had one of the greatest legs in cinema history. This makes the film quite worthy for this fan. <br /> <br /> I would buy a DVD for this reason only if it were available.
