I was really looking forward to watching this documentary about what I consider to be one of the most interesting films ever made. Growing up in Los Angeles in the 1960s, many of these old black and white films were shown on local stations. I even remember the Friday evening show called “Strange Science Fiction Stories”, in which a new science fiction film was shown every week. However, this documentary has devoted too much time to the opinions of four well-known filmmakers and how they treated classic films of this genre and how they used them as inspiration in their films. <br /> <br /> This is not what I was hoping for this documentary. It really could be a comprehensive study of the decade instead of a brief selection of the most famous films of that era. Anyone who has studied or was interested in these films is well acquainted with such outstanding people as War of the Worlds, Forbidden Planet, Things, Day of the Earth Stopping, etc. I would like to see some excerpts from lesser known films and perhaps some interviews with people involved in making these films. I have to agree that the documentary was too focused on Spielberg’s opinions and was a kind of commercial for his new War of the Worlds issue.
