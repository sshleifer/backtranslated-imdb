Disney's Buena Vista Pictures presents a surprisingly narrated sports drama based on facts, filmed by actor Bill Paxton. The photo is gorgeous, but the story sometimes bustles. This film is about a 20-year old golfer Francis Uymet (Shia LaBeouf) and his competition at the 1913 US Open. What story; A unique opportunity for a young man to play together with the best players of the time, including British champions Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) and Ted Ray (Stephen Marcus). The end of the storybook leaves a knot in the throat. The cast also includes: Peter Firth, Elias Coteas, Marnie MacPhail, Robin Wilcox, and possibly theft of the show - Josh Flitter, who plays Eddie Lowry, Caddy Wymet and best friend
