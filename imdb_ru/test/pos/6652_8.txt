It has been some time since I saw Cold Mountain, but I knew that I really enjoyed it. Although this is happening in the last days of the US civil war, in fact it is not a war film. Itâ€™s rather romance / drama. And it works. Mainly because of the speeches. I usually don't like Nicole Kidman, but I like it here. It seemed to me that she was very convincing in her role. I also liked Renee Zellwegger, whom I usually am not a fan of Jude Law, as usual, good. Accompanying cast. There are some great supporting performances, too many to mention. The film also has some breathtaking landscapes. And there are also a lot of very good pieces of music. the story is sad and tinged with tragedy, but it is beautifully made a well-told story. for me, Cold Mountain is 8/10
