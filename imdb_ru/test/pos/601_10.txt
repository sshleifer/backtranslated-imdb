First of all, I would like to say that this film is the greatest thing that ever happened to humanity. This is the best of all the great Muppet films, and all the other films! so BOO-YA for Jim Henson! <br /> <br /> This film is the first of all Muppets films and the best. (Boo ya) This is a frog (kermit) that is trying to get into Hollywood. Together with the amazing friends he meets along the way, comes a couple of the greatest songs that have ever been written, which will definitely become classics, including “Rainbow Communication”. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would like to say that watching this film was the greatest thing ever! If you have not seen this yet, then leave the computer and fuss in the nearest video store !!! (if they do not have a muppet film, I would sue them for a LONG TIME)
