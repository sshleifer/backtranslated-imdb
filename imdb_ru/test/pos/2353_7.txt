What makes this film better than most "movies" is that it does not look fake. The film tells about the director's hot head and his rise and fall and takeoff, using real recognizable names and events in the era of silent and early sound. Instead of a general “sound will lead us out of business,” they are in fact a SHOW Jolson and a “Jazz Singer”. The acting is really quite good, with credible performances by Don Ameche, Alice Faye and J. Edward Bromberg in particular.
