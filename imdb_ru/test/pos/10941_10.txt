The Twins Effect - Chinese Action / Comedy - (Charlene Choi, Gillian Chung) <br /> <br /> This comedy vampire action movie is one of my favorites for the fact that I was completely entertained throughout the film. First of all, the characters are remembered, bringing a myriad of classic scenes. Charlene and Gillian are naturally cute, charismatic and humorous by nature. This film was my first acquaintance with them, and all I wanted to do was get to the TV screen and give them REALLY GREAT HUNT. The rest of the actors succeeded in their supporting roles, including Jackie Chan, Karen Mok, The Duke, Josie Ho, Edison Chen, Anthony Wong, and the bad guys vampires (one of whom looks painfully familiar to Will Ferrell). Even the disgustingly horrible Ekin Cheung was good at it. Good characters are important, of course, because they avoid the feeling of boredom, keeping interesting things between sequences of actions. <br /> <br /> And if we talk about action, then this film has a lot of it. More importantly, martial choreography emphasizes quality. One aspect that helped in this respect is the showy weapon of the main characters ?? sword with a retractable rope with a spear. This weapon in itself opened up many moves that would otherwise have been impossible. Josie Ho and Jillian Chung, in particular, perform some evil air maneuvers using these devices. <br /> <br /> Also, the sword game is gorgeous and underlined by two great sword battles ?? one happens during the opening of the train station, and the other occurs in the finale of the church. In fact, the blade maneuvers shown in this film brought some of the other highly overrated fan favorites to shame, and I really pity those who would quote the terribly choreographic rubbish seen in Ashes of Time, Storm Riders or Man by name ”Hero with well planned, accurately executed episodes, which can be seen in The Twins Effect. It is not even close. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why this movie gets so much criticism. I am sure that the staunch apologists of the Hong Kong “Golden Age” will hate it, because it does not fit into their limited view of what Hong Kong’s actions should be. We must learn from the downfall of John Woo - a pony with one trick that has never learned to reinvent itself. We do not need another clone. We need something else. The effect of the twins is one of the good examples. <br /> <br /> This film was so good that it actually made me give up on other Chinese films with the same actors and actresses. Especially this concerns Ekin Cheng, whose other films almost always suck? and yes, this includes the indecently overvalued and exploitative crap of Usya, mentioned in the previous paragraph. Even Twins never managed to compare with the cost of this film, when both were leading actresses in the film, although they managed to make some good films when one or the other played the main role (for example, “Outside of Our Ken”, “Good”). Times Bed Times, House of Fury) or when one or both play minor roles (for example, “The Color of Truth”, “New Police Story”, “Only One Look”). The effect of the twins 2 was to be a direct sequel, not a family fantasy. I'm still thirsty to see Charlene and Gillian teaming up and kicking ass in another film, but the fact remains: "The Twins Effect" hits all the cylinders, optimizing their charisma and avoiding a drop in irritation (as in Protégé de la Rose Noire). <br /> <br /> In general, this film has everything you need for entertainment. And can I remind the reader that this is exactly ?? ENTERTAINMENT ?? he judges the greatness of the film, rather than artistic dramatic elements or meaningless rewards from well-known academies of critics who usually have no idea what they are talking about. <br /> <br /> In the end, the effect of the twins - this is a CLASSIC should not be missed. <br /> <br /> Rating = 5/5 stars <br /> <br /> PS ?? Hollywood executives decided to kill this film when it was released in the United States, renaming it “Vampire Effect” and cutting out a 20-minute footage that includes parts of the action scenes. However, the final battle in the US version has a better soundtrack than the original version. So I bought both versions, which allows me to first see the original up to about 1:20, and then swap the discs to see the final battle in the US version.
