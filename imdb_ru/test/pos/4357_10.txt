With documentaries, the question of realism always arises. What part of the film is real and how much does the director manipulate? In the “Little Diet you need to fly,” Herzog is too passionate about the story of a man telling his own story to even solve the question of realism and formalism. From the very beginning, the role of the Duke as a narrator is obvious. Fortunately, he is a master narrator. LITTLE DIETER - the best, most exciting documentary I've ever seen. Dieter’s story is exciting, and Herzog’s efforts to recreate, allowing Dieter to relive his life on the spot while he is shooting, are very effective. The story that Dieter tells is real, but Herzog is always present, taking the absurdist commentary out of realism. This film is a must-see for any student documentary and / or Werner Herzog.
