Like Richard Pryor, Mason never got the material he deserved. Everything you know about him is probably wrong. Break the accent and look at his rack. You will be very surprised - he is one of the best comedians I have ever seen, and I have seen many comedies (from Lenny Bruce to Eddie Murphy, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Roc - Jackie Mason is definitely there). It is known as a comic. Even Howard Stern said that he is among the three funniest comedians in history. <br /> <br /> The accusation that Mason is not Dangerfield is ridiculous. Dangerfield is famous for being a big fan of freemasons. Dangerfield's career did not go anywhere for a long time, until he began to follow Mason's performances. It was then that Mason inspired Dangerfield with his “not respect” routine. Although I think Dangerfield is great, look at how they stand up and you will see that Mason is the best comedian.
