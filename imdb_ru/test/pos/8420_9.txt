I caught this film on DD while turning over the channels ... And thank God that, too, when it just started ... Having studied the film in Pune, this film touched a lot of happy memories of the city ... besides, the question arises why more films like this are not done ... Each character is captured so well - grandfather, child, doctor ... except for a social worker who loses a little, the rest of the film hardly has a drawback ... a worthy entrance to an Oscar, even if he was not nominated ... definitely leaves a lump in his throat ... well Is it porridge to tickle tears? And to think that this film needed Sachin Tendulkar for his propaganda. Despite the fact that I was in Marathi, there was hardly a moment when I could not follow the film ... the subtitles were good ... Be sure to watch any fan of a good movie.
