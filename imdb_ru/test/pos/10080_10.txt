It was a great movie! It was a completely pleasant teenage fantasy. So what makes a movie gorgeous? Technical details? I think that if this were the only criteria, our culture would be poorer for this. So this film for The Godfather is like music for a new wave - for Mozart. The fact is that this is one of the best movies of this type that I have seen. All women are beautiful (as seen only on California beaches when making films). There is a bit of everything, a kind of battle star gallactica meets baywatch meets playboy, reversal video meets Wayne's world. There is a lot of charm and a reasonable (albeit predictable) storyline that keeps you interested until the next bit of eye candy decorates the screen. Joe Estevez may not have his career as brothers, but does a good job of drawing attention to the story of the ever-teenage Uncle Bud. It contains many of the expected absurdities, such as a female rock band playing without connected guitars. (Was it intentional?). If you are attracted to the box, rent a video, you will not regret it. As promised, this is a good non-violent erotic fun!
