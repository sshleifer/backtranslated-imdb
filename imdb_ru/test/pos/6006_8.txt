I first saw this when I was a teenager in my last year of high school. I was chained to this! I liked the special effects, the fantastic places, the trial aspect and the recollection memory method. <br /> <br /> A few years later I read the book, and although it was interesting, I could definitely understand what Swift is. Attempting to say, I think that although it is not as perfect as a book for social commentary, like a story, the film is better. It is much more important that this is one long adventure than Gulliverâ€™s return after each flight and making a profit, selling a tiny Lilliput sheep or something like that. <br /> <br /> It is much more interesting when everyone thinks that he is crazy sheep make a cameo anyway. As a note, when I saw Laputo, I was stunned. This is very similar to The Kingdom of Jealousy from the video game Chrono Trigger (1995), which also made me look more like this mini-series. <br /> <br /> I saw him again about 4 years ago and realized that I still enjoyed it the same way. Really high-quality material and began an excellent series of Sweeps for NBC, which followed him with a solid Merlin and interesting Alice in Wonderland.
