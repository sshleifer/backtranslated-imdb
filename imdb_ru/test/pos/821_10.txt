Van Damme made some great films over the years, and this film was in the top ten of my books. This film was awesome, from the Mexican setting to five-star fighting scenes. The film tells about the border guards protecting the territory, which is the border of Mexico. Former fur seals smuggle drugs from Mexico to the United States of America (USA), Van Damme and Scott Atkins play the role of a policeman and a villain. Although this film was not as good as it was before its death, it still gave the action, action and film five stars. I always look forward to these action movies, and they keep getting better. Let them come, Van Damme. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you liked movies like - To Death, Hard Body and second in command.
