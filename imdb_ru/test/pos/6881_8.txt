An excellent film starring Anthony Wong, which, of course, corresponds to its name. The erotic but ever more brutal courtesy of dreams bought from a crazy occultist who quickly turn into nightmares of a certain magnitude when a sorcerer enters them to manipulate poor Mr. Wong. A well-filmed and very fast moving is a nonstop tale of serious magic, herbal medicines, power and corruption, and also gives time for some great sex scenes and some very bloody violence. From time to time there is only a little light humor to take you by surprise, and it all takes 90 minutes or so. Excellent performances from all sides.
