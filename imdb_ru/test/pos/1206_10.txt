I have seen this film more than 50 times in my life, and every time I watch it, the film is just as exciting as the first time! George Berger (played by Trit Williams) heads a small group of anti-war “hippies” from the 1960s – 1970s era living at liberty in New York. This small group meets a young man, Claude Bukowski (played by John Savage), who was drafted into the US Army to serve in Vietnam. Despite all the efforts to dissuade him, Claude eventually prepares for basic training in the army. Still upset that he left them, the hippie group hijacked the car and drove through the US to visit Claude "... for a couple of hours," as George Berger (member of parliament, at the entrance gate of Claude Army Base, said The result is really touching, so I won’t spoil it for those who haven’t seen this fantastic movie yet. The music is equally fantastic! Don Dacus (from the Chicago rock band) who plays the role of “Woof” - one of the hippies - is not the key character, but the film would not be the same him. Beverly D'Angelo (who plays Sheila Franklin, a girl from the city, which befriended a group of hippies) sensational in his role! MUST SEE film !!
