Goldie Hawn portrays a simple young lady who finds herself in a love triangle with an older man, a dentist, who plays with such pleasure from Walter Mattau that she won the best supporting actress in 1969. The film, however, is another tribute to Ingrid Bergman. Rarely, have we ever seen her in a comedy, and she literally raises her heels here as a dedicated dental nurse who is dragged into a plan for Mattau to tell Hawn that they are married. <br /> <br /> It’s such a joy to watch Mattau and Bergman fall in love with each other. This is a random love story in the making. <br /> <br /> As a friend of Mattaw, Jack Weston is as magnificent as his partner in this scheme. Rick Lenz also has a lot of support as Hoone’s newly found guy.
