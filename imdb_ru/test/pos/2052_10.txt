I thought it was a great action movie. Very good role for Gina Davis. She is a very versatile actress. One of my favorites next to Angelina Jolie. I actually watched “A Long Kiss for the Night” right after watching the new movie “Tomb Raider”. Did it make me think, Charlie or Lara? Who will win the battle ??? In any case, both women are very strong, intelligent characters that are fun to watch. Especially when they kick ass. I just hope to see Gina in another movie soon. Looks like she was in the spotlight for too long. It would be especially nice to see her in another film with Samuel L. Jackson. Now they make a great duet. Watch this movie if you don’t have it. You will not be disappointed.
