I just finished watching it (last weekend) and found it absolutely funny, some scenes I just couldn't stop laughing at! Dennis is sooo amazingly fat, sometimes he just says the most stupid things ... but at the same time he's just great to impress his girlfriend (which is still being arrested!) ...! Not the best movie ever made, but certainly there is something to think about renting on a Saturday night when you donâ€™t have more to do (like me). You may have to hunt - I was lucky, because in my local video store it is.
