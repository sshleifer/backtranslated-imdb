Reading the comments, I am amazed at the obvious influence of this wonderful film on the audience. But how can you watch this film and not reflect that the cunning dialogue was subtle and, oh, so bold reproach to the authorities “under control” of what was then the USSR at that time in history? These were not souls only at the time and place of the revealed action. Superficially asked questions are frankly provocative when they are sent here and now. Who are the real "employees"? I am surprised that the writer remained outside prison. I read somewhere that strong stress can be a catalyst for creating great art. This film is a masterpiece of the wrong direction, clearly pointing in one direction, while at the same time asking the audience to "look over your shoulder at what I am really talking about." What courage.
