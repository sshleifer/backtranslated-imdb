A remake of the silent 1916 film based on the 1909 Maurice Leblanc novel. The detective series will be turned into numerous plays, films and TV shows in the UK, USA and France over the years. In this version of 1932, the crushed brothers Barrymore John (as duke) and Lionel (as detective Gershard) were filmed. They will also be filmed together at the Grand Hotel, Dinner at the Eight and several others over the next few years. Sonya (Karen Morley) appears in the duke’s bed during a party in this code-film before Hayes; first the lights go out in the bedroom, then in the main ballroom the search for the fraudster and the missing jewelry, as well as other missing values ​​goes out ... You can say that the radio was not there for a long time, as they still use cards with captions several times. Also watch out for a new type of safe that does not need a combination. Well thought out plot, without big holes, but there are no big surprises here either. Not bad for an early movie. Clever ending.
