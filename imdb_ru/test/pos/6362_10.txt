To say that I did not expect much from sitting down to see “The Couch Trip” is an understatement. I had no idea what it was about - I thought it would be a trip to the realm of sexuality when I heard Chevy Chase playing a condom man, and the name of the film includes the word "travel on the couch" * wink, wink. * Then I realized that this was somehow related to the psychic institution and the escape of the patient. My expectations fell even lower. <br /> <br /> I was literally waiting for a movie with a grin - like when you once smile and go out, feeling a little cheated. And, in a sense, this is a cheap comedy - there are no evil tricks in it, the plot is ridiculous, but do you know what? I had a big dull smile on my face all the while I was watching him. <br /> <br /> Dan Aykroyd plays John Burns, a patient in a mental hospital, who may or may not be mentally ill. He gives the psychiatrist Lawrence Baird (David Clennon) a lot of grief and suffering, which leads us to believe that he is still a sane person. <br /> <br /> After a bit of confusion in a psychiatric institute in the cafeteria, Burns waits for Baird in his office to shout with his tongue when the telephone rings. Burns picks up the phone, pretends to be Baird and learns that the caller, Harvey Michaels (Richard Romanus), wants the real Dr. Baird to replace George Maitlin radio station (Charles Grodin), who is resting with his wife Vera (Mary Gross). Michaels wants Bird so much that he even booked his plane ticket. <br /> <br /> Burns escapes from the Institute with the help of a receptionist and drives to O'Hara. He gets a Dr. Baird ticket, gets on the plane and eventually is filmed as Dr. Baird. His show is a phenomenal success. "People love him!" one says, and the other replies: "This is because he really cares about them." <br /> <br /> Donald Becker (deceased, great Walter Mattau) is a former patient who recognizes Burns' clothes to be prison pants and shirts. To keep him alone, Burns promises Becker a percentage of his income. The secret is kept secret. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Maitlin and his wife enter into an argument. He flies home to end his short vacation, and realizes that the man on his talk show is not really Dr. Baird, but no one believes him. He gets the real Dr. Baird, but, unfortunately, he lost his ID, so the police take them for psychos and do not listen to their story. <br /> <br /> Let me name just a few holes in the plot. I noticed this while watching this movie: Burns poses as Dr. Baird, but never asks for his ID, even when he asks for a plane ticket (he says that he was robbed, but they still make sure that he is Baird). If Burns is becoming so famous, why did the real Dr. Baird in Chicago never hear people talking about him? Word travels. And finally, why would the police arrest Maitlin and Baird (that is, the real Baird) without following their stories? <br /> <br /> Honestly, I didn’t care. I entered this film with a closed mind, and it surprised me - I really liked it. It entertained me. His ideas are, in fact, ridiculous and not at all realistic, but Dan Aykroyd gives a truly energetic performance, like a half-nakedness, which makes "The Couch Trip" a journey worth making. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
