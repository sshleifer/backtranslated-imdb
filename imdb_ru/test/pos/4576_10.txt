I recommend the Idiocracy to everyone. Luke Wilson is very funny, insightful and made me laugh so hard that tears flowed down my face. Until the end, when I took a breath and realized how close we are to Mr. Judge’s vision of tomorrow. <br /> <br /> Watch the guy's cameo from a Mac ad (Justin Long) as Dr. Lexus. I found his performance worthy of an Oscar, especially considering what the Oscars were awarded for in the recent past ... besides, he is handsome. <br /> <br /> In short, Idiocracy is a deadly funny look to a possible future where people are named after product names (the president’s second name is Mountain Dew), hospital visits cost $ 5 billion, a lot of garbage because no one not smart enough to understand what to do with all this, and nobody cares about everything except money. All because only stupid people breed. Sounds somehow familiar to me. Oh yeah; this is what I think about when I see professional wrestling ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, watch this movie. This is a good laugh, and it makes you think.
