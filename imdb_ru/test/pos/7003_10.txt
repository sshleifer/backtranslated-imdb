As a fan of zombies, I really like these scenes, where people find themselves in strange places surrounded by evil monsters! PB is also a great addition to the Chronicles of Riddick (COR). The brigade must run as fast as possible from the darkness. There are so many metaphors in history! Riddick is a bad guy, but he is also a hero who is trying to save slow people. Muslim Imam relies on the sun to pray five times a day, but he is stuck in a country ruled by darkness. In general, I recommend this movie to science fiction lovers. You will not be disappointed.
