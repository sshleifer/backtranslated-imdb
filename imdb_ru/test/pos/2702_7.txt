Every time I hear Karen Carpenterâ€™s voice, an old, familiar 70s blues feeling arises. What a stunningly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb, in the lead role, does an excellent job, but I thought that Karen Allen would be the best choice. This is a tear film that perfectly shows Karen and Richard's professional career, as well as the personal struggle that Karen faced and her illness. The recording sessions in the studio of Herp Albert are very well made. No matter how Karen Carpenter turned out to be, there was a time when she was special and brought great joy to her fans and music lovers. Even if you were not a fan of Carpenter, this is a good story that shows how great talent can fall victim to the pressures of society.
