Well, how can I categorize Farscape without resorting to a perverted superlative? Ok, here goes! The scenarios are fantastic, each episode offers so much entertainment, drama, humor and explicit observation. Casting is especially perfect, especially in the role of Jaan (blue lady), played by Virginia. Hey, every character has a depth that is simply not in Star Trek. <br /> <br /> I think I have an Australian spin. the show does it for me, Australia has produced quality films for years, and Farscape is no exception. <br /> <br /> I only saw the first four episodes in the British order, and they have a quality that makes every 45 minute show (in the UK) look more like a movie than a weekly television series. <br /> <br /> The episode that really does it for me is “I, an alien,” who turns the alien concept, where my (a living ship, even a spaceship has a great character) is forced to land on a planet that entered into the "first contact" and is remarkably similar to the earth, and Crichton meets the radio telescope operator, and he is the "little green man" to them. Thrilling stuff. <br /> <br /> In short, the effects are excellent, high-quality scenarios, and the main characters (none of them is as important as the others) are interesting, not always “good” and just fine. <br /> <br /> Go for the second season!
