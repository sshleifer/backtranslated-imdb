“Never Been Kissed” is a film that is really good. If you have not seen this yet, rent it out. I'm going to buy it when it comes out, because I liked it. Drew Barrymore is great again, she plays her part well. I felt I could relate to this film because school days were just as bad. I thought the plot was well written, there was comedy and romance, which are the type of films I love. I liked the finale, because even though you know what will happen, it still forces you to sit on the edge of your seat, waiting - waiting !!
