I saw this film at the Telluride Film Festival in 1997, where one of the screenwriters, José Giovanni, was honored. It is highly regarded as a great drama about criminal events, the incredible performances of Belmondo and Lino Ventura. The attention paid to each character and the complex psychological images that detail loyalty, betrayal, love, and hope are enormous. This is a great drama, great thriller and a great movie. There with the best of Melville. (The name in English “Class all risk” in French “Classe tous risques” is a pun on Classe Touriste, which means “Tourist class”).
