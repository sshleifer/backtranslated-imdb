This film was all that you could wish for when it was originally viewed, at the end of the decade of the 1960s. It was very interesting and provided a modern view of the many changes that occurred during that period — and still continued — in terms of the movement of the Black Power, Vietnam, and the unstable movement that followed the quieter, preceding post-war 1950s. br /> <br /> All this and one of the funniest films, then or now. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie for the second time lately, I was surprised to find that it was as captivating as it was in its original form. His humor is just as funny, and his message is strong. <br /> <br /> And now, looking through it, you get it all, while at the same time getting additional pleasure from the fact that it is a “historical work”. and an excellent chronicle of his this historic, turbulent time.
