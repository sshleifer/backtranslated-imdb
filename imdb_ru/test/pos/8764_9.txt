“Traffik”, despite the name, is not really about drugs. In the best traditions of the crusade on the British television drama "Traffic" analyzes and moralizes its imaginary topic, which is not some kind of mythical disaster, but a matrix or process with defined social, economic and historical roots, causes and consequences. There is something almost scientific in that the film uses four sets of characters from completely different world and class traditions: poppy cultivation, driven into the Pakistani underworld due to poverty and cynical government; Englishwoman, former Olympic swimmer, wife of drug lord, who is under investigation for human trafficking; two shy German police officers whose determination to condemn the latter derives from class malice as much as any faith in the law; and junior minister Tori, whose student daughter from Cambridge became a drug addict. <br /> <br /> “Traffic” is unpardonably didactic - starting with Jack Lithgow’s early scenes in Pakistan, exploring the government’s success in eliminating drugs, before imposing sanctions on more British aid, we are bombarded with facts about the problem. But these "facts" come from various sources - the exposure of government representatives; Left-wing advocates with a mercenary (ideological and internal) interest in corruption; poor farmers who need to grow poppies to survive. <br /> <br /> The facts, usually encouraging markers on the map, are not enough - the more facts we get, the less manageable the situation seems. Only when Jack, the moral center of the film, the man who joins all the narrative threads, actually travels to the very heart of narcotic darkness, does not learn to get rid of his hypocrisy (condemning drug use, but refusing to invest any serious money) in solving this problem. and creating conditions through various free-market initiatives where the drug trade thrives. Just as the anti-heroes of Warners' old gangster films were in fact examples of American capitalists, so the merchants of the ideal supported by Thatcher and Reagan) that at least the reality of the problem can be recognized. <br /> <br /> As I said, Traffic is not really about drugs. As Jack finally admits, after his dismissal from the post of Tory Minister, drugs are not really a problem. This is a society ruined by a woman who said that nothing of the kind exists any more (as evidenced by Jack's non-existent family life), systematically depriving the vast majority of people of hope and happiness, and an increasing number of people are turning to drugs. <br /> <br /> What is most terrible in Traffic is not graphic, stunning images of drug abuse (the technical details ironically reflect a more “legitimate”, verbal factual information), but a dystopian vision of Britain devoid of all joy , beauty or society, the joyless wasteland of abandoned houses and the soulless modernity, the society of the defeatists, who are ready to allow these smugglers and barons to engage in their trade. <br /> <br /> This is not just modern British history - it describes the decline of the Empire based on trade, which comes down to drug trafficking. Undoubtedly, it is important that other sites in this program are Germany and Pakistan, the decisive agents in the demise of the Empire. Here, the old imperial immorality becomes home to the perpetrators, the former enslaved victims, their bodies insulted by the power of their owners, returning to the imperial center, London, the seeds of its decline are literally carried in their bodies, embodying the fears of all those who are late Gothic novels of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> Traffic is one of the greatest achievements of British television, which in many respects surpasses the recent Hollywood remake. The political focus is clearly sharper — Jack’s decline is much more effective than Wakefield’s recession, because he, as an agent of government policy, as well as a bad father, is a big part of the problem, while complacency is the only real political flaw in the American. In almost every case, the characteristic is tougher and more believable (compare the old Elena Lindsay Duncan, already bitten by experience and failure, and her negligibly superficial counterpart). <br /> <br /> Unlike the dubious racial trend of “traffic” (which makes Mexico grim and different; the horror of WASP is sex with a black man), the portrait of Pakistan is rich, tragically drawn, with disturbing arguments about drug protection alternating with scenes terrible violence. Everywhere the inextricable link between public and private is expert. Visually, the film is strikingly inventive, never screaming or "cinematic" - especially in the last episode, when buildings and furnishings seem to move when the system closes. If Traffic, like its remake, feels the need for fragments of the shore, then the prevailing sense of waste and loss is much more terrible, Jack’s speech bitterly despaired.
