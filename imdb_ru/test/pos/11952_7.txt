This is a big part of the same creative team from Better Off Dead, but it's not as good as this amazing comedy for teenagers. It is very fun, but everywhere and not so funny. Curtis Armstrong got used to less effect (he was incredibly funny in "Better off Dead", Bobcat Goldthwaite is funny, Cusack is good, Demi Moore is Demi Moore (only with the best hair here). Overall it's fun, and as a person Cape Cod, it very effectively captures the feeling of Cape Cod’s summer of the 1980s. For some reason, this film feels more “mainstream” than “Better off Dead.” There’s not much absurdity here, if you're a John fan Cusack and Savage Steve Holland, this is definitely recommended.
