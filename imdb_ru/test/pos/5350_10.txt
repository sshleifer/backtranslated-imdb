In 1989, Aardman Animations introduced two heroes in “Great Day”. In 1993, they fought an evil penguin in Wrong Trousers. And in 1995 they had to save the sheep from the evil robot dog in Shaving Closer. In 2005, they returned and are going to fight with something that used to be sweet and gentle in The Curse of the Were Rabbit. In this feature film, Wallace and Gromit work for Anit-Pesto, a pest control company. There will be a competition for giant vegetables, but the rabbits continue to eat the neighboring vegetables. Wallace and Gromit solve this problem. But Wallace had an idea. He will brainwash rabbits with his car. After that, something suddenly eats up all the vegetables in the neighborhood, and it becomes big. It's up to Wallace and Gromit to save the day. As a fan of these two characters, I was impressed. It retained what was in the previous 3 chapters, and instead of adding a lot of Hollywood actors for dubbing, they put a nameless cast, and the boy did a fantastic job. Wallace and Gromit have not changed. Wallace is still keen on cheese, as always, and Gromit is a silent dog reading newspapers. In addition, the script was not too shabby, like other family films. There is a twist on who the Were Rabbit really is. The direction from Nick Park (director of 3 previous chapters) copes with the storyline. Instead of adding the Hollywood formula to it, he simply took the style of the previous chapters and added a bit of dark fantasy to it. Well done, Nick. Rabbits are also funny and adorable, but the funniest bunny in the movie is the one who has Wallace. The characters were not bad, and they were not annoying, but they will never surpass Wallace and Gromit. The animation is really fantastic and wonderful. I have never seen a clay animated film that has been so awesome since the Chicken Run. In general, fans of two fans (including teenagers) will love this fantastic film. This is a well-made film, which should get an Oscar next year. Cheers, Wallace and Gromit. 10/10
