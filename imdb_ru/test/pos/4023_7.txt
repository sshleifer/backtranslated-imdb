Somehow this film penetrated the soft spot of my heart. Do not ask me how it happened, but I believe that in the film Ed Mac "I will be a sponsor of anything" McMahon in the role of the racer after the tail had some relation. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I was disappointed with the first release of Slaughter in 1972. Nothing but a quick run to follow Shacht-mania. How does the sequel go away from this? Big Jim Brown seems stronger than Slaughter here than in the first. Perhaps this is due to the fact that after a year he had something to work on, and not on the simple motivation "Be like the shaft." <br /> <br /> The most outstanding part of the film is the soundtrack provided by pimp number one, James Brown. Almost every scene is decorated with a touch of funk by the Godfather. A great historical film, for music, wardrobe, cars, jargon and hair. I should also point out that this film is also a great periodical film representing time in film history when Jim Brown and Ed McMahon could actually grow hair. <br /> <br /> Double the chicks, double the beat, triple the number of bodies and factor in Ed McMahon and James Brown. You are waited by one hell from a film of 70th years, and that which surpasses the predecessor, not less. For my money, the Big Rip-Off Slaughter can play ball with any Blaxploitation film ever made. Even the shaft. Most likely, you will not agree, but Slaughter's Big Rip-Off has its own distinct feeling. Something original was missing.
