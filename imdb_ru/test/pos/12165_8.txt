After 10 views in 20 years, I also think that it was the best work of the “Mad Gang” on the film, with greater cohesion in the plot than their next best “Alf's Button Afloat”. They really were a crazy trio of double action, connected mostly on stage, sometimes in front of the royal family, until Chesney Allen retired in the 40s due to "poor health". He survived them all over the years. Apparently, they were just as crazy outside "work", regularly playing practical jokes with each other. <br /> <br /> The Six Wonder Boys troupe for "I'll get it to tell me" (Alaska) to dig for the gold that was found there. It seemed like a better idea than going to Mansfield ... because they were there. When they get to the Red Gulch, they discover that their information is out of date by only 40 years - they thought that the chips that were in the guilty newspaper that they read were funny in taste. But by then, it doesn’t matter, since they all fell in love with Snow White and want to help her grandfather find his long-lost chest of gold. Buddy Bill "M" McGrew wants himself, however. <br /> <br /> The number of verbal and visual puns is simply amazing, but most of them are likely to make sense (?) Only for British and ex-pet interested in watching British black and white comedies of the 30s. Imho almost all of the gags and routine work, including the Gold If patter between Bud & Chesney and the style of "Whistle While You Work" - even inserts the Mountie "Always Getting Our Man." An amazing little movie, in a rather tired state, but highly recommended.
