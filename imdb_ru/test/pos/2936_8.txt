It's ten times better than “Who wants to be a super model” on Bravo. I think this is more true for business. Taira is strong and sensitive at the same time and is able to get the most from each aspiring model. Photos see depth in each of the models, individuality and beauty, strength and modesty, as well as the ability to withstand and work for the sake of what they want. I like to see Tyra’s personal experience on photo shoots and on the runway. I do not always agree with the decision of the judges or the comments of Tyra, and at least one of the winners, I feel, did not deserve to win. But this is just a show, and every girl is very lucky that there is such a chance.
