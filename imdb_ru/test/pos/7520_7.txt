I never paid much attention to this film until I found out that the writer was Paddy Chaiefsky, the author of the brilliant “Network.” His work there instructed me about his genius, so when “Hospital” appeared on TMC, I was impatient to see him. I was not disappointed. Looking at both this film and the “Network”, it may seem that its main theme is absurdity, recklessness and absolute depravity of large human enterprises (for example, hospitals, networks) against the inviolability of personal experience, the human spirit and all this put up with acute a sense of completely black humor. "Hospital" is the same black comedy as "Network", and a great cast, led by the incomparable Scott, completely copes with his work. This is the keeper; definitely not to miss.
