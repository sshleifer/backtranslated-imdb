Well, it's about as good as they come. There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was just a “master of commercial expectation” or maybe a “compulsive technician” - or he was really “deep”. No one knows exactly what these terms mean, but it is legitimate to ask if he could, at his best, do all three things at once. <br /> <br /> In this, he seems to be at the peak of his development. It is unlikely that something in this is accidental. It is replete with doubt, ambiguity and wit. And the story is exciting, Patricia Highsmith, obviously, has complexes that are similar to her own. Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the plot was described in detail elsewhere, so I will not go into details. I will simply point out five incidents on the screen for which Hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible. <br /> <br /> Bruno Anthony (Walker) followed Miriam (Laura Miller) and her two guys to a carnival at night with the intention of killing her. She noticed his attention and was innocently flattered by her. <br /> <br /> 1. Laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to go through the “Tunnel of Love” and then to the island in the center of the lake. Walker is right behind them, smiling, in his boat - Pluto. "Pluto." This is not a hint of Walt Disney cartoon character. This is a reference to Pluto, also called Hades, the god of the underworld in Greek and Roman mythology. This tiny touch cannot be an accident. And the “underworld” that Walker represents is not just a literal hell, but the underworld of the human mind. I hate to say that he is a Jungian "shadow", but that is what he is. (Carl Jung saw this film? He was alive at the time of its release - but probably not.) 2. This is a deadly serious sequence, right? Walker is a crazy man who is going to kill a woman he doesn't even know. Imagine how this would be described by most directors. Night walk through a populous carnival, theft from shadow to shadow, a killer peeking from behind the walls of the canvas and so on. What does Hitchcock show us? When Walker first passes through the gate, concentrating on his victim, a little boy in a cowboy costume runs up, holds a balloon and shouts, “Bang! Bang! You're dead! ”Walker jerks his head in surprise and looks at the child with indignation. And when the child starts to leave, Walker throws a cigarette at the balloon and sticks it, then continues the pursuit without another look. This is one of the ways in which Hitchcock refers to impending doom. <br /> <br /> 3. Famous sincerity is reflected in the fallen glasses, which imitated countless times. <br /> <br /> 4. Miriam and her friends stop at one of those devices that you pummel with a large hammer, sending a kind of hockey puck into the mine to measure the strength of your blow. One of her boyfriend brushes him off, and the puck doesn't reach the bell upstairs. Under the admired and admiring gaze, Miriam Walker smiles and rubs his hands, then takes a hammer, slaps them, and the puck hits the bell. She is delighted. He lowers the hammer, looks at her with a grin and waves his eyebrows like a ten-year show! 5. After the discovery of the body of Miriam, when the whistles come and people scream, Walker leaves the carnival and meets a blind man waiting at the curb. Walker takes the old man by the hand and leads him across the intersection, seriously raising his hand to stop the movement. A terrible joke. <br /> <br /> All these and other incidents occur within a ten or fifteen minutes carnival visit. (Robert Walker's game is exceptional in everything.) In fact, this is a kind of invitation to be noisy. (See "Riding the Pink Horse"). But the threat of the scene is undermined by Hitchcock's insistence in irony and distance. None of the familiar noir techniques are used. There is nothing really creepy about it. And the murder itself is hardly cruel. I don’t think anyone other than Hitchcock would have handled it the way he did. It would be all the threats and shadows, shelters, failed attempts, frowns instead of grins. <br /> <br /> Not that it was an absolutely flawless movie. Impeccable film is not with us. Part of the middle section is a bit slow, and Farley Granger, although a good guy, is dull, boring and rather stupid. His new girlfriend is just boring. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock should have taken seriously the wrong distribution of guilt in “The Wrong Man.” I'm not sure that Hitchcock ever thought about the difference between legal and moral guilt. The latter was imposed on him at an early age thanks to his Catholic education. “Original Sin” - you are BORN with him - and all that. In the filming of the interview, he always briefly explained his fear of the police and authorities, mostly telling a story about how his father took him to the police station to scare him after some pekadillo. We have the right to ask if this was just what psychoanalysis calls "screen memory." I hope you get a pun. I know, I know. He is tense and inept, but I spent a lot of precious time thinking about it.
