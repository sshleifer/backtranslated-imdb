The Third Man looks like a ghostly black and white photo of STOLEN IDENTITY, a thriller created by Turhan Bey, the former Universal star in the 1940s. This is a masterfully filmed story of jealousy that leads to murder when the famous pianist (FRANCIS LEDERER) becomes overly obsessive with his wife (JOAN CAMDEN) and soon intends to carry out a plan to kill the man with whom she has an affair. <Br /> <br /> A taxi driver (DONALD BEECH), it turns out, brings a woman's lover to the hotel when he leaves the room to chat with an employee who is digging the street. Lederer uses the sound of a drill to drown out the sound of a bullet that he inserts into the passenger's head outside the back of the car. When Buka returns to his cabin, he finds a dead man in the passenger seat. <br /> <br /> On the way to report the murder to the police, he changes his mind and decides to change his identity with a dead man who has an American passport, which means that Buka can realize his ambitions to return to the United States. The kidnapped personal plot is getting thicker when the girl’s girlfriend (Lederer’s wife) appears at the hotel to accuse Buk of imputing himself as a dead man. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of conspiracy that the audience has probably seen many times, but there is good training here, with many tense scenes when Buka and Lederer’s wife are planning how to escape from the authorities before the final confrontation with the murderer and the police . <br /> <br /> This is very fascinating, well done and arouses interest due to the magnificent atmospheric photography of Vienna, which will remind most movie lovers of The Third Man. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
