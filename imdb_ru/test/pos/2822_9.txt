I am surprised by some comments on this site, because I really liked this movie. If you are looking for something else, then this film is a good choice. Definitely not your typical meaningless story, which seems to play a major role everywhere with Ben Idiot Affleck or another Hollywood loser. This is an intelligent film, in fact you need to pay attention to some people have been turned off by this. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you in good shape, then this is a good choice. Warning for parents - it has pretty graphic sex scenes, so watch it as soon as the kids are in bed. People who love the euro will like this one. Adam Sandler's fans should skip this, because it will be over their heads and definitely NOT their style.
