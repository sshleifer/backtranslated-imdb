Amazing, amazing, amazing. What more can be said? Jacobi is the best Hamlet ever to grace the stage and capture every character's centimeter. Every nuance and element of Hamlet is depicted and depicted well. Some people complained about his age, but you honestly can not say when watching a movie. In any case, he looks much younger than 40 years. I would just like to find a more worthy Ophelia. Her game is bearable, but she just does not look part. The only true exceptional performances come from Jacobi and Stuart, who is the great Claudius. The rest of the cast is good, but Jacoby is what really brings up this show.
