I can not say that this film deserves ten, because I would have lied. I loved this movie when I saw it! It carries the unique bond of friendship between a teenager and a dolphin. Although he does not reflect the sweetness that Jesse and Willy had in Free Willy, it is an exciting movie that will appeal to the whole family! If you love sea animals or just love the perfect family movie, this movie will suit YOU! Flipper definitely shows us how delightful dolphins are, they are playful and can easily become pets if everyone had a big enough pool! I love whales and dolphins, so obviously this film works for me. I really think that the producers had to choose another shark instead of a hammerhead in order to strengthen the role of the antagonist in the story. Perhaps a great white? FLIPPER NEEDED! So check it out!
