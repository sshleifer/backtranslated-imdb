Hmmm, ... ANOTHER comedy series in the park !!! It seems that the number one filming location was in the same local park, since so many films by Chaplin and Arbuckle were shot there! And, although this is another one, it is quite different and well-made, and I still like it. <br /> <br /> Fatty is interested in looking younger than usual and playing Mabel Normand. I think she should be a little younger, although in the eyes of her mother she is TOO young to be interested in men. Well, Fat does not share her feelings, and soon she and Mabel fled for the sake of innocent fun. Everything gets complicated when the mother’s watch is stolen. Fat man finds it and gives Mabel as a gift ... and MANY problems arise. <br /> <br /> A decent pace and the fact that this film didn’t rely too much on a cheap farce, but a reasonable plot makes it a cute and pleasant little movie.
