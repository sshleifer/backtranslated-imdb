Due to the fact that in 1976 there was no computer graphics, I felt that the film was quite watchable. Studio productions were very good and very thoughtful. The background effects were very believable and always looked like they were part of the whole set. With the actors, everything is in order, given that the scene of the film will take place in the atmosphere of Jules Verne, where the imagination and possibilities of future research were in most cases incredible. If I watched this film in 1976, I would probably be delighted with the ability of a person to create a machine that can travel to the core of the Earth. I still wonder why we don't all fly in our cars, but I get distracted. McClure and Cushing have their own funny moments, mostly from the expression of their faces towards each other, which of course makes the film somewhat polite, which I loved. The “monsters” left much to be desired, but the story had a good premise, although I feel that some other “thing” could have been more plausible in such circumstances. In general, it is quite watchable for its time and fun now.
