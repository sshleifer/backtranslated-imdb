I was amazed when I saw “The best years of our life”. The acting, screenplay and directorial skills of William Wyler (winner in the nomination “Best Director” in 1946) are “Brilliant”. <br /> <br /> A film about three veterans of the Great Patriotic War who return home by plane together and all happen to live in the same city. They all reunite with their families. <br /> <br /> The first man Al Stephenson (played by Fredrik March as Oscar) adapts to his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy) and Peggy and Rob (played by Theresa Wright and Michael Hall) differ from before leaving for the war. <br /> <br /> The second man, Fred Derry (who is played by Dana Andrews in an excellent role) must find a good job and adapt to his wife. He was married only 20 days before he left for the war. He begins to realize that she is not. <br /> <br /> The third man has a much more complex adaptation. Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his excellent Oscar role) He lost his arms in the war and must deal with the reaction of his family and Wilma's fiance (played by Katie O'Donnell) on the hooks that he has in place of his hands. All these men and their families were reunited in different scenes. All the stories of these people are perfectly intertwined. <br /> <br /> This movie really defines the meaning of "Classic." This unforgettable drama (the winner of the best picture of 1946) is a film that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If I were asked to choose a favorite movie, I would choose this one. <br /> <br /> Out of 10 I would give “The best years of our life” 11. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the next time you rent a movie, you will not regret it.
