I do not think that this film deserves the low rating that most will give him. This is one of the best teen horror movies I've ever seen; and it says a lot. Nothing remains without an explanation, confirming this, the characters and the plot destroy countless stereotypes about horror films, and this has nothing to do with some other horrible parts that we have presented recently. (A vivid example is the brainless "Holy Angel.") The first 30-40 minutes can be completely boring, except for the beginning, although some minor minor mistakes can be easily detected. However, after arriving in the village horror begins - another, perverted kind of horror. <br /> <br /> With a plot and details of nonsense are insignificant; film characters are the strongest side of this film, given that so many cliches are broken in it. For example, the two main male characters, Nick and Wade, are by no means the idiotic types we are used to; Although Dalton might fit better in this stereotype, he is not the only one who paid for this lack of consciousness. Some scenes are really terrible, making up for the tense moments scattered throughout the film. And in the end, and although everything is explained simply, it is easy to understand that the surviving characters will not be so easy. <br /> <br /> The only mistakes that I see and which do not imply Continuity (i.e., Carly does not find his own cut finger in the pockets of the unconscious Bo) are lights that somehow annoy during boring 30 minutes. Although, in terms of plot and effects, everything is sharply and brutally distorted with the arrival of the main characters in Ambrosia, this small village is in the middle of nothing, so I will do it. It was argued that about 70% of the film is illogical; "How can two people build a whole house of wax?", "Where do they get all the wax from?" This would not be an exciting question if people paid more attention to the film. The Sinclair brothers did not build the House of Wax; their mother worked on the creation of real wax figures, and they were exhibited in the museum. And the scenario in which the unhappy character Paris Hilton meets her premature death is the answer to the second question; what about all the personal items (mobile phones, cars, clothes) of dead people? Using his third brother as a link to the exterior, it can be argued that the Sinclair twins should get the money they need to buy wax, as in World War II. <br /> <br /> So, aside, I think the film deserves much more than it receives, and no one should miss the chance to watch it. So go to the house of wax figures. Right now.
