If you want to see the brilliant Mikado game, played to perfection with a skillful choice of time and opportunities, do not watch this version. If you want to see the Hammy version with Eric Idle, hanging around in the private club of English gentlemen of the 1930s, this is something to watch This is a lot of fun and a good introduction to Gilbert and Sullivan, but after that hurry and rent a Canadian version Stratford. You will see the difference between good and great. Nobody makes G & S better than Brian MacDonald and the Stratford group.
