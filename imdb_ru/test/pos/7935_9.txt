Eisenstein describes his collaboration with Prokeviev as an equal partnership, where they worked together to match the image and music, scene by scene. Unfortunately, the sound recording was a disaster, so this time the dedication of authenticity in the response of the Criterion DVD. Fortunately, there is at least one restored version of the film on VHS (BMG Classics) with excellent re-recording of music (from the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir). <br /> <br /> It is interesting to compare this film with modern propaganda films in England, Germany and the USA. Eisenstein’s film was shot in 1938 in response to the fear of the German invasion; and Olivier in 1943, when the German invasion of England was still expected. Both films are scenic, but in different ways. Olivier begins with the production of the play at the Globus Theater by Shakespeare’s own company, and then takes us out of the theater to a more cinematic (though still stylized) setting. Eisenstein's film is cinematographic from the very beginning, but the dialogue and performances are still influenced by the melodramatic acting conventions of the old Russian theater. This is very well suited for the performances of Cherkasov in the role of Alexander, because part of his work as a prince and commander was to play a role in public. <br /> <br /> In Nazi Germany, the first major propaganda film was Leni Riefenstahl’s boring film. The triumph of the will, which recorded a huge political spectacle - crowds of people welcoming Hitler's ranting. The propaganda in her masterpiece, the 1936 film about the Olympic Games in Berlin, is much thinner, with its worship of a sporting male body that carries alarming shades of the myth of Aryan supremacy. But German wartime propaganda films can also be thin. Karl Ritter's Urlaub auf Ehrenwort (Furlough in Word of Honor) is typical. It depicts a young lieutenant who released people in his company for a 24-hour vacation, before returning to the trenches of the First World War (and will almost certainly die). Contrary to the advice of the veterans, he takes their word of honor to return, although he will be convicted and executed if they do not. Naturally, they all return (although some of them scold themselves for it), apparently inspiring viewers to such shows of duty to their country. <br /> <br /> In the United States, one of the best propaganda films of World War II was Howard Hawke’s BBC. In it, we follow an inappropriate team of bombers when they associate each other with battle experience, and overcome obstacles to continue their participation in the war. However, as a rule, for the “Hawks” films their real loyalty relates more to each other than to their country. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein must go far in history to find any Russian military triumphs. Ironically, Alexander (like other Russian princes) comes from Vikings who sailed the Russian rivers to conquer and manage their own patrimonies. Thus, he is a winner who repels another potential winner. Physically, they are no different (although the actors portraying the German princes were obviously chosen for their ugliness and smirk of folly). But the real contrast between ordinary soldiers. Russian peasants are as tall and strong as nobles; whereas the German peasants, who run out of the shield wall to kill the wounded Russians, are a foot below their masters. There is historical truth in this contrast. The Russian serfs in the Middle Ages were much better than their European counterparts, because they could always escape into the desert and clear their land. <br /> <br /> The Eisenstein film also skillfully gives us our first look at Alexander as a fisherman. In a battle with the Germans, he uses his fisherman’s knowledge of the ice, as well as his knowledge of their military tactics, to defeat them. When Gavrilo breaks the wall of the shield, they are forced to regroup and focus on the western side of the lake, where the ice is thinner. <br /> <br /> One of the other pleasures of the Eisenstein film (which most viewers miss) is the historically accurate way in which he portrays the politics of medieval Russia. Cities such as Pskov and Novgorod owed their growing wealth and fame mainly to trade, which brought merchants to power and removed the princes until their military experience and feudal fees were necessary to repel the invaders. In the film, Alexander is shown not only as a warlord, but also as a chief politician who knows how to wait for his time and how to make the most of his popularity after victory.
