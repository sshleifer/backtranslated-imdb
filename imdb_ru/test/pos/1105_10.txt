I saw this film at the 3rd Adelaide International Film Festival in Palace cinemas and was fully turned on for the first five minutes. Thank you, my God, for the film that ignores all the garbage that we often see in Australian films that seem to revolve around a) race b) gender and c) class, in favor of uh ... I dare say ... very good movie. The producer, a shy, slightly eccentric guy named Alex Frein presented his film, made with a group of his comrades near the city in which he spent most of his childhood. Obviously, he spent most of last year traveling the world with a film, mainly in Europe. The world created in the film is brilliant and cunning, not least because of the strange and embarrassing editing style, gothic characters and surrealistic sense of time and place that attracts viewers to his nightmarish kingdom. <br /> <br /> The producer is back on Q + A after-wards. Someone asked him what inspired him - he replied "South Australia". I hear, I hear! Another asked him what “day in Alex’s life” means. He replied that he was driving old Utah, that he was having breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant where he had been very well eaten for the past 8 years! and that he plays the piano that helps him think. He does not drink alcohol and plays cricket once a week. Then the question and answer session ended abruptly due to the next movie being shown - so I think that for the next festival they have to extend after making the film.
