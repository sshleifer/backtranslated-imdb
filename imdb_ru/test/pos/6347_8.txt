Larry McMurty is not a masterpiece, but he stands as a good Western, like any lonely pigeon. who ever takes on the role of Woodrow, makes a great image in his own style. It is also easy to see that they wanted to use this as a springboard for the series (both versions), and that the authors knew how to preserve the taste for life. William Peterson was cool, the guy from CSI is not the character he plays in - this guy can do everything that seems, <br /> <br /> it deserves to enjoy those who love westerns <br /> <br /> 4out5 stars
