When I was a kid, I loved "Tiny Toons". I especially loved Tiny Toons: How I Spent My Summer Holidays. I thought it was funny on the floor laughing. A few years later my friend had a video. And I decided to look at it in the good old days. I was still on the floor laughing. My opinion, the Plucky and Hampton parody is the best. They decide to go to the "Happy World Peace". And they end up in a crazy adventure to get there. All parodies are funny. I'm still looking for a video. So if anyone has any tips. Please contact me. <br /> <br /> This is one of the funniest cartoons I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
