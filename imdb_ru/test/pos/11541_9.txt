I will put it as simply as possible for those of you who do not know about the legacy of Bill Hicks. He was simply the greatest comedian in the world, almost certainly, in my opinion, the greatest ever lived (his idol was the great Richard Pryor, whose addiction battles he conducted in parallel). His death in 1994 was barely noticeable in popular media, just a few weeks after Kurt Cobain committed suicide. His tragic death at such a young age overshadows any sense of injustice, which, of course, was criminally ignored during his lifetime. But the harsh truth is as clear as day: no one came up to claim his mantle. There is no living comic with almost all the skills and inventions. <br /> <br /> The observation was made in a tender tribute "It's just a trip" that comedians often view work as a striving for wealth - inconclusive films and comedy-moral comedies designed to take - but never enrich - the life of an unimaginable audience. That's all Bill Hicks spoke against. His sermon has always been a rallying call for people to think about themselves, carefully study authority, come together as a race. <br /> <br /> His call continues to grow every year after his death. His star will continue to shine long after so few faint lights have flared. As soon as you get acquainted with his brilliant, intelligent, but ultimately compassionate, you will be enriched and rewarded. <br /> <br /> The man himself liked to quote Dylan: “To live outside the law, you must be honest,” he said. Bill Hicks was honest; besides, he was the funniest of all.
