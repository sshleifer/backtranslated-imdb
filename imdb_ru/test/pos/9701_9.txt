I have long been a big fan of video Cky, Jackass and Viva La Bam. They ran great, and I expected my laughter to end, eventually. But this is still not the case. This film kept my mouth open all the time. I'm still laughing, by chance. I went to the theater with low expectations, thinking that he would not be better than the first. Oh, how incredible I was wrong. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of great moments in the film. If you are squeamish, do not like casually placed raw humor, or you didn’t like the first film, you probably won’t like it. But after all that was said, I almost wetted my pants with laughter. There were a lot of different jokes, masochistic humor, toilet humor, vomiting, laughter, some great falls and tremendous damage to all actors. Ryan Dunn even branded the back of Bam with an image that would permanently get stuck there. I'm sure you can only imagine how raw this film is. <br /> <br /> No pain, no gain? Right? This film has already gone well, forcing theaters across America to laugh so hard that they want it to last longer. I know what I did. This film did not seem short at all, especially with photos continuing to shoot. But I still wish it could go on forever. Now let's just wait and see when they release Jackass Number 3! In general, an excellent film, if you can overcome the man's nakedness and several disgusting images. Keep your children away from this movie. They don't need to see it, at least until they get older. Support the team and BUY IT when it comes out on DVD! I know, I will.
