We see how a person moves from the city to the “back-back” and changes dramatically - his family asks questions, but he is going crazy. <br /> <br /> A strange, brilliant film to be shown here in Israel. Excellent locations, great actors, a film that disguises itself as a “thriller,” but which more closely resembles the example of madness in the lead role. <br /> <br /> The film was much higher than other films shown as part of the AICE festival here in Israel. Good luck to the team that came to this film. This is Grand Guignol, a little noir masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My only criticism that interferes with the "10" is that sound and music are sometimes overwhelmed. This tends to interfere with images that speak for themselves.
