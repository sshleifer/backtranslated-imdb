All the right elements seemed to be conspiring here to make this memorable thriller for many years. You have a star cast - Michael Douglas in the uncharacteristic role of “free spirit”, which largely marked the beginning of his film career, Fonda played her typical straightforward woman doing her bit for the woman, and Jack Lemmon, as always confident, shows us a man a crisis of confidence. Give them a hot topic about big business duplicity, and this is encouraging to begin with, but to have a life imitating art is, so soon, a marketer’s dream. <br /> <br /> The script is impressively tight, smart but, fortunately, keeping the jargon to a minimum, and there is a genuine feeling of constant tension brought into play by the director when our three main characters rush to beat the time. If you like dramas with “whistle”, then this is not as good as “Insider”, but all this is more than quite nervous.
