For those who work in cinema for the first time, I think they did an excellent job !! We must support a developing industry, especially from the north. It was very popular when I was in the movies, a good home and very good reactions and lots of laughter. This is a good film, and I felt that way when I left the cinema! He has a northern sense of humor and positive about the community he represents. The film has just opened, I hope that it succeeds - people should support this little film. I think this "Winnie ..." man is very bitter about something! And getting too personal ??? a shame !! I say well done to all who are involved - drink me !! I look forward to the next venture.
