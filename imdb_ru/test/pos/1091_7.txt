Nana Patekar once again proves that he is the best actor working in Bombay, without a doubt. His recent films included shouting out his lines, which does not bode well for the theater. I wonder why he always does not give honors during the season of awards? <br /> <br /> “Shakti-The Power” was one of his films, which caused complete disappointment with Coram (a missed opportunity to create screen magic with the help of Amitabh Bachchan). <br /> <br /> But in this film, Patek radiates cool calm by playing a policeman on a journey of social justice. Getting rid of the streets of Bombay with the underworld in false clashes, the character Patekars takes control of the screen (and the attention of the audience) and never lets go. Editing is very slow, and there are no annoying songs that could distract from the story. <br /> <br /> In the same spirit as in the modern iconic classic “Company”, the film is well-played, directed and should have a long shelf life on DVD. <br /> <br /> The last ten minutes, during which Nana and the main villain speak in their offshore shelter, will definitely become part of the classic cinema Hindi. Will not be disappointed with this flick of the cops and robbers.
