WALLES AND GROMIT: RUB-RABBIT COURSE (2005) **** (Votes: Peter Salis, Ralph Fiennes Helena Bonham Carter) <br /> <br /> Fantastic feats of clay: Wallace and Gromit Save the day! Crackin 'Good Entertainment! <br /> <br /> Nick Park, creator of the animated Wallace & Gromit team, genius. His painstaking art in the form of clay clay Plasitcine is a unique process that includes literally thousands of hours (it takes about 8 hours a day to set aside 3 minutes of action for the film; this step in the story of artwork lasted 5 years!) In creating his attractive team of owners and faithful dogs finally appeared on the big screen in the duo's first full-length film, and it's damn good (come up with a phrase from Wallace’s usual answer to all the good!) <br /> <br /> Park, who was directed by Steve Boxing and wrote with Cartoons with Mark Burton and Bob Baker convey the horror genre in this incredibly funny and fast-paced cam action movie with the disgusting inventive Wallace (voiced by British veterinarian Tessian Salis) and his dumb but loyal (and sharper) fool Gyromaer anchorman to beat the beatle to hear a beat for the beat. ) invented a service for their community: pest control (“Anti-Pesto”, as they are known) for the upcoming Giant Vegetable Festival, which has the whole city in Mo. One of the reasons for the vegetative giant the biggest buzz is troublesome rabbits who eat crunchy products. Wallace's inventive mind created a vacuum container that is fast, efficient and, more importantly, harmless to the cute parasites that plague Lady Campanula’s Tottington estate (voiced by Bonham Carter, making a quick breakthrough to become the first lady of the stop motion). the animation, which, with its earlier turnaround in The Cadaverous Bride, a few weeks ago, which holds the competition and is of love interest for the knowledgeable Wallace. <br /> <br /> The only fly in the ointment is the ambitious, pompous loud mouth and the dork Victor Quartermaine (voiced by Fiennes, his first attempt in animation looked like puffing up boasting of Patrick Stewart with fun results), fooled by macho idiot who is getting ready to chant a brawl Patrick Stewart with fun results), fooled by a macho idiot who is getting ready to be a brawl. Lady Tottington is rich for her, while he is the main competitor to W & G’s humane efforts, resorting to his trusty shotguns and nasty bulldog. <br /> <br /> To add insult to the wound, the duo is faced with a terrible situation in the form of a huge werewolf rabbit (the title monster is a good bow to Universal and Hammer's horror film), which terrorizes the village and devours all vegetarians in sight. These two intended to catch and get rid of the creature, but along the way this is more than striking. <br /> <br /> Relentlessly funny, with such amazing elastic and kinetic energy, his wonderful colleagues from clay, Park and Box created a truly magical and very fascinating film with such amazingly detailed production design for their small world that may require more one show to understand how much effort in their blood, sweat and tears went to create this instant classic for children of all ages. <br /> <br /> Wallace, the inventor of baldness, cheese-loving, can easily become Homer's Simpson's cousin with his round body and the constant ability to do the wrong things while trying to do the right things; his heart is in the right place, but his head is in the clouds. His sweet fascination with Lady Tottington (reminiscent of Carol Burnett's carp operation), which is a head taller than our hero, might remind them of their first unrequited love with a smile of awkward confession. His Rube Goldberg-like gift for making difficult into ease is an inspirational insanity that fans will recall from the earlier short films "The Wrong Trousers", "A Close Shave" and "A Grand Day Out". <br /> <br /> But in my opinion, the wise, silent and long-suffering Gromit, his poached egg with slow burns and disbelief in what is happening, is one of the best animated characters ever created with such an amazing arsenal of irritated, silent expression and subtle nuances that most live action actors would kill to achieve in an attempt to convey anxiety, anxiety, grief, genuine surprise and relief. His last chase? signature of an incredibly popular comic team ?? ingeniously tuned and quickly improvised, especially his literal fight with a dog with the same silent bulldog with persistence, wit and vigor Chuck Jones, which would make Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger green with envy. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit compare the best of those presented by Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello and any other classic comedy team; We hope that their longevity will continue on screen as long as their predecessors. The wait is the most impatient.
