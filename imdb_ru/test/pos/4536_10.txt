This is one of my favorite comedy movies. Chris Farley is very funny, because he is prone to accidents, and David Spade plays the straightforward Farley. <br /> <br /> The dialogue between them is brilliant. The scene where the two of them sit in the car and sing along with the “Superstar” by The Carpenters is a classic. <br /> <br /> Chris Farley was a great comic actor who had amazing potential — he would be sorely missed. /> <br />
