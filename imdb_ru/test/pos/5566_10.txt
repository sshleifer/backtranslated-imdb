This series is significantly undervalued. Like many others, I stumbled upon Farscape after canceling the series. I bought season 1 and was surprised to find a cleverly written drama filled with a balanced mixture of suspense, romance, wit and, of course, science fiction. He immediately got 10 points for being the first show or film to satisfy us, like our hero - and every alien he comes in contact with - speaks English! Well, some others got around the problem, but Farscape did it best. The bottom line is that the scriptwriters are paying close attention to detail to make the show as believable as possible. <br /> <br /> With such poor programming, itâ€™s a pity that balanced entertainment series like Farscape do not get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production. While we are enjoying four seasons and, fortunately, a four-hour mini-series, perhaps we can make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show.
