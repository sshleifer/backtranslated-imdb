I agree with all the above comments. This show was a pleasure to watch. Funny, witty, awesome acting and crazy scenery. It is always nice to find a show that is cleverly written, suggests that viewers have brains, and demonstrates subtle humor. I would spend good, hard-earned money to see it again on DVD. And as long as we request the Smart series, which has never had a chance ... What about the Maximum Bob releases on DVD (another well-written, weird, weird show with a delightful character set?) Century or Frank's place. There must be a way to release these shows from the vaults into the hands of loyal fans and new audiences.
