The Snow Queen, of course, is based on the fairy tale of the same name collected (at least) in Andersen's Fairy Tales - and, unlike many other recent productions based on other fairy tales, it preserves the spirit of the Fairy, an achievement that is not easy and poorly understood by many, especially among Americans. Talking animals, arbitrary bans, the appearance of goblins, dragons and demons should not be questioned in a fairy tale; they are as natural elements of Fairies as, say, gravity in the scientific world, and the reason or explanation for them is completely irrelevant to history. And this story is not connected with modern Hollywood compositional rules: direct, often to such an extent that it is grotesquely linear in small works, and obvious (at least in retrospect). <br /> <br /> With this protection from the general Criticism of those who do not understand fairy tales, “The Snow Queen” is a delightful film with wonderful visual effects, skillful play and great mood. I think the only flaw in the film was not that it was too fantastic, but that some parts of the dialogue were too bright and modern in slang and expression, which undermined its timeless nature.
