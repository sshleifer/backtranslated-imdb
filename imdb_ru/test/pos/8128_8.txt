Inspired by the choice of director for this latest Briton Flick, Rose Troche, who exploded on stage with a runaway story about the New York Dykes, _Go Fish_ brings a jaundiced look into this story about a Londoner choosing a slightly inappropriate environment for a male unifying society to announce his thirst for the candidate male truths. The highlight for me is the scene where society tries to return to being primitive hunter-gatherers, but ultimately orders takeaway food. The film as a whole is remarkably well shot, and Trochet, who will never be accepted by some lesbians she portrayed in her previous film, relishes a larger budget, indulging some surprisingly long shots that contrast with the granular _Go Fish_ hyperkinesis. Really nice movie
