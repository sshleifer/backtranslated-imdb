The scientist Karl Lehman (well played by David McIlvright) is blown up by something terrible as a result of a deliberate chemical explosion. His wicked colleagues led by wicked obsessive scientist Alex White (a completely hated image of Richard Cox) carried his brain into the body of an almost indestructible cyborg metal suit. Lehman starts a total kill. It is up to the disgusting Hunter for mercenaries (the monstrously repulsive turn of the divine Pam Greer) to stop him. Directed by Jean-Claude Lord, who previously directed the visiting hours of the underestimated psycho-fighter-slasher, puts copious action films with considerable enthusiasm and maintains an energetic pace everywhere, thus ensuring that this click will grow into a nice dirty science-fiction / horror action. The lush character Mori Chaykin easily copes with the best acting awards like the disgusting fat bastard Bert, who in the single most tasteless movie sequence has a fierce fistfight with his pregnant wife Lehman Lauren (the winning performance of beautiful Teri Austin). Stan Winston's f / x elegant make-up and Paul Zazaâ€™s spectacular score further increase overall sloppy fun.
