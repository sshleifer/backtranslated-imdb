I tend to fall in love with anime and get out of it, because the more you watch, the more you notice that many shows are just bad copies of a few gems or repetitions of old formulas. But from time to time one of these precious stones appears, and its originality is simply amazing. Haruhi is truly one of those shows. Many anime series are originally made from manga, and sometimes the translation in an animated show is rather poor and does not take advantage of the animation compared to static drawings. Haruhi is actually based on a series of light novels and fires on all cylinders, beautiful animation, great voice acting, great music and a complete and dynamic story. Look, you will not be disappointed, and I would advise to watch it on the air so that it works much better.
