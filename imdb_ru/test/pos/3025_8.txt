“The Cell” is a rather complicated film to categorize. If you read the plot plan “the psychotherapist is traveling inside a comatose serial killer in the hope of saving his last victim”, you might think that this is a science fiction thriller. But it really does not make this film fair. In the subconscious there is a stunning aspect of fantasy, with gorgeous visual effects and incredible scenarios. There is a drama when the aforementioned psychotherapist (who Lopez played before she became an exclusively romantic comedic component) comes into contact with the child inside and testifies to his terrifying upbringing. And definitely there is an aspect of horror because of the heinous actions of the evil person of the serial killer. The film attempts to function at different levels and crosses the boundaries of the genre at will. Although I feel that this is a rather strange experience, I find it quite exciting. <br /> <br /> From the very first words Lopez rides a horse through the desert, stunningly dressed in a white dress. will know that you are waiting for visual pleasure. Every time the audience leaves reality and follows it into the subconscious depths of its “patients”, they are guaranteed the feast of visual and auditory pleasure. Costumes are wonderful creations of corners and colors. The camera leaves the patterns at the door and crosses the world where up and down are the same. Characters become the rulers of their own domains and turn into creatures worthy of such growth. If you don't like Cage anymore, you will surely be impressed by the work done in these scenes. <br /> <br /> The cast is also top notch. Jennifer Lopez is in her element here, using her natural, compassionate and almost maternal feelings, combining her astounding looks with a lush environment, makeup and costumes. She is incredibly sexy, and I personally would like someone to find another role for her outside the world of the Roma in which she was included, which would allow her to experiment further. Vince Vaughn is quite convincing as an FBI agent who will do everything to save the life of a young woman. But this is without a doubt Vincent D'Onofrio, who has the greatest impression here. This is an extremely difficult role, as it should evoke a lot of emotions in the viewer. We are disgusted with his actions, but we sympathize with him because of the trauma he endured during his life. He looks superbly powerful in his kingdom, but insecure and vulnerable in the real world. This is a great presentation from an underrated actor. <br /> <br /> Although the “Cell” does not work as well as at each level, it tries ambitiously (some of the characters’s actions are not believable), and although this is all based on some rather fragile scientific logic, it is sometimes shocking a visually striking head journey that rewards a multitude of views
