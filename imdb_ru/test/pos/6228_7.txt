A group of friends breaks in the middle of nowhere (one had a flat tire, another had a mysterious start of the Jeep). One of them delivers the tire to a broken maintenance station, and this is the last one to see it. When the remaining fours go in search of their friend, they encounter sweet Mr. Slaussen, who offers to help repair the jeep and offers cool drinks and a shelter from the heat in his equally abandoned, hermit-like house, which, as it turned out, is busy with very realistic looking mannequins. He goes with one guy from the group to work on the car, and leaves three girls in the house. Before leaving, he warns them not to leave and not to go up to the house behind his hut; he warns them about Devi, his brother, who is hiding and not everyone is there. Of course, one of them decides to go in search of a working phone and will never see it again. Is it Slaussen? Is that Davy? Mannequins ?? Tourist Trap has the usual requirements for horror (a girl with big boobs, a pretty girl with two shoes, a curiosity that allows you to overcome people and never succeed!), But she differs from the rest of the 70s genre in its turn of the end. I started to feel sorry for Slaussen (Chuck Conners is a terrific, creepy, terrific performance) at some point in the film, and you almost see Molly doing the same thing. It is a gem if you can find it; When I was younger, I recorded it on tape and, after going through a video store, I found a copy of VHS, which was completely overvalued, but worth it. Tanya Roberts fans will not be disappointed either. The best part of the film for me was the scene with the soup (and the crackers !!) <br /> <br /> I gave it 7, because some films were and still are difficult to explain.
