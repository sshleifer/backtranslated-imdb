POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> No one is likely to take the Red Dust DVD, not knowing that this is a Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa. Hilary Swank is cast as a South African exile who returns to his hometown as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chivetel Edgofer), a member of the South African parliament who was tortured by prison guard Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who is looking to escape from prison, testifying in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They could, of course, find an actress who imitates or can imitate the South African accent; Miss Swank is not trying to hide her unmistakably American accent. Nevertheless, she is the only known actor in the film, and probably he would not have been made without her or someone just as famous. She does a decent job. However, Ejiofer and Müller (pronounced in German with an U-lance) are outstanding, as are Jamie Barlett, as the police chief responsible for the murder of comrade Monpono and his prisoner. The torture scenes are shown in short flashes, but they are bright and believable. What is not believable is the process of Truth and Reconciliation - except that it actually happened. “Red dust” should be considered only for this reason, because it was and is incredible that ANC prisoners could actually forgive the torturers, and this is as close as we can probably see the process in action.
