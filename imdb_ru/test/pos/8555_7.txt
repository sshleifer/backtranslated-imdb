I watched this movie on TV in 30 years or more. Several aspects of the film stood out even when viewing it many years after it was shot. <br /> <br /> The story of the little-known S. Virgil Gheorghiu is wonderful, almost reminiscent of the story of Tolstoy about a man who was beaten. according to a cosmic scheme that he cannot understand. Compare this film with better-known contemporary works, such as the Schindler's List of Spelberg, and you will begin to understand that the trauma of World War II should be viewed on a wider canvas of racism beyond the simplistic Nazi view of Aryans and Jews. This film affects the hostility of the Hungarians to the Romanians, the hostility of the Romanians to the Russians, etc. Even referring to the dubious relations of Jews with their Romanian Christian friends, being under stress. <br /> <br /> As I have not read the book, it is difficult to understand how much has changed by the director and the writers. For example, it is interesting to study the view of the Romanian peasant on emigration to the United States in order to earn money only to return to Romania and invest their income there. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the character Johann Moritz was probably one of the best roles played by Anthony Quinn in the ranking along with his work in La Strada, Greek Zorbe and Varavve. <br /> <br /> The finest and most memorable sequence in the film is the final, in which Anthony Quinn and Virna Lizi try to smile. A father carrying a daughter born to the rape of his wife by the Russians is a story in itself, but the director can show reconciliation with a simple gesture - the act of carrying the child without slipping into melodramatic shots. <br /> <br /> Today after the death of Princess Diana, we often notice about insensitive paparazzi. The final sequence is an indictment of the paparazzi and insensitive media (director Verney also makes a similar comment on the court scene when operators prepare to pounce on Moritz). <br /> <br /> The interaction of the Church and the state was so beautifully summarized in the laconic statement of the Orthodox priest: “I pray God that He will guide those who have the power to use them correctly.” <br /> <br /> Some of the short snapshots, for example, the snapshot of the secretary to the minister, who drew while listening to the petition, so much is said in such a small record. The direction was so impressive that editing faded into the background. <br /> <br /> Finally, I was most struck by the exquisite rich texture of flowers provided by the operator Andreas Vinding - from brilliant credit episodes to the end. I remembered that he was the operator of another of my favorite French films called “Bastions of Clay,” directed by Jean-Louis Bertucchelli. I have not seen such a use of flowers for a long time, with the exception of David Lin's epic works. <br /> <br /> There were flaws: I would like the character of Virna Lizi to be more understandable. I could never understand the character of Serge Redjani - the only intellectual in the whole film. The scene of the train station at the end seems to be filmed from Westerns Sergio Leone. Finally, the film was based on a love story, which, unfortunately, fades into the background. <br /> <br /> To summarize, this film impressed me more than in one department. This story is relevant today, as when it was made.
