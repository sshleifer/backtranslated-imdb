I put this second version of The Man Who Knew Too Much in my top 10 Hitchcock films. Together with Madness, this is probably the most talked about film among Hitchcock fans. I think this is much better than, say, “Rebecca”, which received an unjustifiably high rating. <br /> <br /> The film has many brilliant scenes (most of them were mentioned in other reviews), but this is what you should expect from Hitchcock. It will take almost half an hour until everything really starts to happen, but this time is used to prepare the following events, which are full of intriguing expectations. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the clumsy rear overhangs, the only Weakness of this film is the main villain played by Bernard Miles, a rather flat and undeveloped character. Fortunately, there is a creepy assassin in the form of Reggie Nalder. And Hank, a little boy, is not as annoying as most kids in old movies.
