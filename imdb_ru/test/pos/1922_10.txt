Have you ever watched a movie or documentary, and you had to hold back from screaming things like “No! Do not do this!"? Not? Well, it's time. And, undoubtedly, it is DEEP WATER - this is where to begin. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the story of Donald Crowhurst and his entry into the first round-the-world yacht race, which some people were to conduct in 1968. This word “individuals” is important, as the men who set off for this almost self-destructive escapade go alone. <br /> <br /> Most of the men are well known in the marine communities of England (where they start from), but one of them is an “unknown dark horse”, and his name was Donald Crowhurst. Due to financial difficulties, Crowhurst attracts a patron who can take everything away from him if he fails to at least try to get through most of the race. He could take his house, his property, everything. <br /> <br /> Crowhurst is now between a stone and ... well ... deep water: either try to race with an unproven ship and an unproved captain, or lose everything you have (which was important because Krokherst was a wife and several children). You will also notice the term "unproven captain." Not only was he unsubstantiated, he had never been on the high seas! Did I mention suicide? Scrolling through the archived footage before and after the race, as well as the recordings of Crowhurst's friends, family, and acquaintances today, Deep Water is masterfully collected. Initially regarded as a weak juice that made its way through his head, the film gradually shows you the limited choice that Crowhurst had after months and months on the water. His ship is leaking. Equipment breaks down. The psyche is stretched to the limit (and beyond). Crowhurst is lost in the internal struggle without a successful exit. It is also interesting to see the psychological breaks that other riders experience when faced with solitary confinement on board their respective boats. <br /> <br /> The wave-like emotions that you will feel when watching this amazing documentary can spoil your mood a little (almost like trying to get sea legs). And you will probably be disappointed with the choice made; perhaps as disappointed as poor Mr. Crowhurst. <br /> <br /> The end is also amazing because we see a real ship on which Crowhurst sailed, sitting in the desert and rotting on a Caribbean beach ... not unlike other things that seemed deserted and rotting towards the end of this badly thought out race. <br /> <br /> Incredible.
