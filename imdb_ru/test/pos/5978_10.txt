Just seeing this makes it hard for me to believe that this is not so well known. This and a little more famous, but almost as shameful neglect as “Come and See” (Klimov, 1986), must have been two of the greatest war films. They are meaningful, powerful, sharp. ASCENT is also gifted with Schnittke with a rare but brilliantly piercing account.
