If you are like me and bought a new album Tenacious D on the day when it came out, and entered the film, knowing all the lyrics of all the songs .... then you will definitely like this movie. Yes, I am a preconceived fan of Tenacious D, but I really liked this film, which made me laugh a lot. <br /> <br /> This film was almost everything I expected. The comedic genius is backed up by excellent songwriting and several wonderful cameos by Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins. I especially liked the role of Tim Robbins. <br /> <br /> If you are not familiar with the Tenacious D HBO series and the fantastic debut album, then this may not have the same comedic effect on you. I still recommend that you go and see, because it is still worth every cent of the entrance ticket price and will make you smile, even if you are not at all seams.
