This movie was incredible !!!! I didn't know the background, so I had to let her turn in front of me on DVD. There were a lot of turns in it, but the story remained fresh and exciting. Elaine Cassidy's game was in the word Brilliant as well as Sally Hawkins. The storyline is rich in believable events, as well as fresh ideas from the present. <br /> <br /> In the eyes of Miss Cassidy, there is something that leaves a “mark”. This film is a refreshing look at how we look at “Victorian times” and how we look at this society. A very worthwhile watch.
