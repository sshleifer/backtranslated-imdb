My only problem with The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is that the film doesnâ€™t have enough time to correctly present Wallace and Gromit to those who are not familiar with the short films Pak. Oddly enough, Shaving manages to do this with much less free time. Nevertheless, I loved seeing the boys in action again and loved all the new characters, people, and others. I especially liked the voice of Ralph Fiennes as the intrigue of Victor Quartermein. It is also interesting to watch the series on the big screen. Mastery with clay characters really stands out. This is a dial tone and great for the whole family! I buy very few DVDs, but I have everything Wallace and Gromit, and I will gladly add this one.
