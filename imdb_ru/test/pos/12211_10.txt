I would like them to return the surface. I really enjoyed the show with my family. I felt that the development of the plot and the storyline was first class. As the other person said, it seems that everything comes down to the lowest common denominator. Nothing but polite, politically correct junk survives. Just look on the Internet to see how many people are watching the show. It is also not nice to leave us alone, what happened to all the characters of the show. This is the same thing that happened with the time travel show, which I think was called 8 days, but it should have been called backstage. Olympics killed the surface? I know that the authors of the strike killed another one of my favorite shows, which many years ago was called the greatest American hero.
