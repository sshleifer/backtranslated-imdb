Well, I don't understand why people get so annoyed about this movie. So I thought it would be an ordinary Amanda Bynes film, but it’s not. It was GREAT. <br /> <br /> Good, good, so the acting was not the best, but I thought the performances were great anyway. In addition, you can say that the actors had fun while filming this movie. You could say that in other films that unexpectedly won awards, where the actors did not like working on the film. All the actors had chemistry, and this also showed. <br /> <br /> A ton of people use the football skills possessed by the actors. Yes, so they are not perfect ... overcome it! They are actors, not football players. I play football all my life, and believe me, it’s hard to learn, so it’s enough to rip to the level of skills they possess. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie would be stupid, but it was really funny. How Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum can make the situation funny without even saying anything funny. In this film, I often laughed. <br /> <br /> In general ... I LOVE IT!
