Great show. <br /> <br /> Firstly, people who don’t like it .. I don’t like it, then DON'T LOOK THIS ... <br /> <br /> This was (was) an amazing show. Better than the words of Jim (my favorite). This shows a REAL family family (as opposed to 8 simple rules, etc., where everything goes well). <br /> <br /> They are loud, they are dirty .... I can sympathize with them dragging trash into the kitchen. It happens in real life. The variety likes Portal to Hell, and everyone growls like dogs above boxes of fast food. <br /> <br /> This is the show “I was there” .... You know what is going on, but it's interesting to watch, because YOU have been there before. <br /> <br /> A good cast, they work great together, a great show, enough for a DVD release. Mel Gibson's "Safety Videos" was also the highlight of the series. <br /> <br /> Opinion? A good show, a REALLY deserving DVD release (deserving not to be canceled).
