One can not but admire Mike Judge for his practical approach "I have experienced it." With “Office space” almost everyone who works can communicate with characters. “Idiocracy” has exactly the same feeling. You can easily appreciate the 505 years of experience of our heroes, because the director again tried to put things on a very human level. This film is very similar to Woody Allen's Sleeping. Do not miss the deleted scenes, as the Museum of Fart is a classic. An imaginary comedy is a rarity, and Idiocracy is a wildly imaginative, incredibly funny and solid 8.0 film program. - MERK
