“I know that I am a man. And if you were all these things, then you would just attack me right now, so some of you are still people. This thing does not want to show itself, she wants to hide inside an imitation. He will fight if necessary, but he is vulnerable in open space. If he captures us, he has no more enemies, no one can kill him. And then he won. "The Thing" <br /> <br /> by John Carpenter is one of the most spectacular horror films ever made ?? fast, intelligent and purely immersive from start to finish. This is how all movies of this genre should be made. <br /> <br /> In Antarctica, the film was devoted to a group of American scientists in 1982. We don’t get acquainted with their mission, but get involved in their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy Norwegians chasing an escaped dog appears in their base camp. killed, and the dog goes to the colony when they really start to go crazy. <br /> <br /> It soon became clear that the "dog" actually changes shape. The alien organism, which manifests itself in the physical form of its victims, in other words, it begins to devour Americans and imitate them so well that the remaining people cannot distinguish the difference between their friends and enemies. <br /> <br /> A group of scientists led by Makridi (Kurt Russell) begin to fight for their own survival, using wit instead of musculature. If the Thing is really among them, how can they reveal it? How many things are there? How can things be killed? (Or is it even possible to destroy it?) <br /> <br /> The origin of the creature in the film is easily explained: thirty thousand years ago the spacecraft fell to Earth and was frozen in the Antarctic ice. "The Thing" tried to escape, and it was discovered by the Norwegians in the ice, who unknowingly released her from a natural prison. <br /> <br /> “The Thing”, the film itself, looks like the cult “Alien” by Ridley Scott. "(1979). Many comparisons have been made. The main characters are in a desert area, pursued by a rarely seen opponent who manages to kill them one by one. However," The Thing "for all practical purposes came first. <br /> <br /> Based on the famous “Who goes there?” story by John W. Campbell, Jr. (pen-name Don A. Stewart), the film was originally adapted as an art production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The result was “a thing from another world", an undeniable classic. But honestly It was a little like a story, and Carpenter’s remake makes it more just. <br /> <br /> The idea that Things are capable of adapting someone’s body is what makes this film so great, and this is the most important link to the story. In 1951, the special effects were just too bad to wisely depict a shape-changing organism, but thirty-one years brought a lot of success to the SFX. <br /> <br /> Effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning that could have easily turned into a cheesy mountain-festival into an astounding pug conductive (and realistic) blood disorder and fear. Things, although they never take one particular form, are constantly visible in the transformation stage, and the effects are simply excellent. They still strike twenty-two years later. <br /> <br /> Ennio Morricone's rating (at the time, nominated for Razzy) is too electronic and hard, but nonetheless pursues her when used correctly. <Br /> <br /> From the fact that the cast consists entirely of men, to the fact that its ending is one of the most provocative and atypical conclusions of all time, "The Thing" ?? by what standards ?? unconventional hollywood at its best. It is not surprising that at the time of “The Thing” release they performed poorly in cinemas, and “E.T.” ?? released in the same year and with the participation of a much kinder aliener ?? has become more than the cash picture of the two (at the moment). <br /> <br /> Ultimately, “The Thing” surpasses almost every conceivable way. Spielberg's story is outdated and failed during the reissue of the 20th anniversary. "The thing", on the other hand, gradually climbed the stairs of the cult classics ?? This is one of the most famous not famous films ever made. <br /> <br /> Carpenter is notorious for his unequal career ?? from his amazing “Sturm of the 13th precinct” (1976) to the magnificent “Halloween” (1978) to the disappointing and stupid “Escape from LA” (1996) “The Thing” remains his best motion picture. Although his reputation over the years has never been so honorable to be spotted in most of the great movie lists, The Thing is still one of my favorite horror films, and ?? with careful inspection ?? masterfully processed. Is it a cheeky and inventive thrill ride that is both unique and frightening? a real relief for movie lovers who are tired of the same terrible fakes. This one, at least, is really unpredictable.
