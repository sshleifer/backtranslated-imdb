I remember watching this film in 1981, when I was 7 years old. He was just great! I found the DVD just a couple of months ago. I almost jumped for joy !! I bought it and showed it to my children. They liked it too. They asked what words the seahorse sings (although I didn’t say to them, because I don’t think that saying the words “gay” and “ecstasy” to 6-year-old children is a very good education). The songs are great. I still remember them all. I will still remember them when I am 60 years old! There or so. Tommy Pender is (was) such a brilliant actor. It is a pity that he threw it. <br /> <br /> If you find a movie, BUY IT! You will love it!
