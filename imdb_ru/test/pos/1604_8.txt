Contains spoilers <br /> <br /> Adaptation to the novel by Luchino Visconti of Thomas Mann's short story is visually, if not philosophically, true to its source (Britten's opera offers a more accurate reading of the Apollo / Dionysius struggle, which absorbs an aging author). This is by far one of the greatest movies ever made. <br /> <br /> In the Visconti version, the focus is more on the physical aspects of the story. Venice has never looked more beautiful and seductive, more decadent and refined. If you read a short story, it looks like the revitalization of descriptions on its pages. Dirk Bogard plays the role of Gustav von Ashenbach. Although he communicates very little, he conveys bitterness, agitated passion and, finally, Ashenbach’s pitiful desire only through facial expressions. Bjorn Andresen, a young actor who plays Tadzio, the beautiful object of Ashenbach’s desire, was excellently played. He also plays a role with facial expressions and gestures. Tadzio's character is key to the story, so any actor in this role should be worthy of inspiring passion and desire. Visconti, with his incredible look at beauty, knew exactly what he was doing. And turning Ashenbach from a writer into a composer based on Gustav Mahler, and then using Mahler’s music, especially Adagetto from the 5th symphony, was another brilliant beat. Although I read the story of Mann before the film, the music of Mahler and Death in Venice will always be inextricably linked. Like the haunting images that appear throughout the film, especially the recent Ashenbach, dying on the beach, when Tadzio slowly walks into the sea. <br /> <br /> One day this movie will be released in a widescreen DVD format, and its visual splendor is fully restored for us.
