I like the shepherd! Of course, the acting was not good, but the fight scenes were good. Van Damme throws a few nice shots, like Adkins. The story was average. A texas cop fights smugglers. This film did everything that a Van Dam movie should do; it is martial arts and action. Van Damme was never a good actor. I think this film is better than Van Dammms in the past. If you are looking for an Oscar-awarded spectacle, you will not get it here, but if you are looking for action movies and martial arts, then this film is for you. Scott Adkins is an amazing martial arts master, and unfortunately the audience is tired of martial arts superstars, but his films in this film are great. Van Damme delivers heavy blows, and it's nice to see him performing martial arts again, since he's not in the last 4 or 5 films. This movie is definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of the van.
