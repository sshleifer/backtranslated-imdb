Duck_of_Death should watch this movie again, as its main criticism is completely unfounded. The film has never forgotten the time delay, and it was clearly mentioned in several places. The crew never showed conversations with flight controls that did not follow the time-delay rules. <br /> <br /> One thing that I really thought was a bit far-fetched was the magnitude of the risk - would the team land on a planet on which suits would last only two hours? I doubt. Will a manned spacecraft enter the star's crown? I doubt. Will people land on the moon, which is hit by a huge amount of radiation? I doubt. In addition, the ship seemed too strong. Will a ship designed in this way risk atmospheric flight to slow it down? I doubt. Will he survive the cometary trash? I doubt. I think that in both cases the load on the structure will be too large. But overall, the incredible scenarios were compensated by some well-done special effects, good editing and production, and some good play, especially by the actors portraying the ship's commander and the Russian cosmonaut.
