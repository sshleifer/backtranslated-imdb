The punishment park is a brilliant movie. Filmed in the southern California desert <br /> <br /> using his patented artificial documentary style, Watkins <br /> <br /> creates an unparalleled film. He follows two groups of prisoners (one <br /> <br /> previously convicted and the other after the verdict) throughout the whole picture. After a military tribunal judges <br /> <br />, they have a choice: either <br /> <br /> to serve a prison sentence, or they can participate in punishment <br /> <br /> Park (a grueling three-day walk through the desert without clothes, with the exception of <br /> <br /> on their backs), while local law prosecutes local employees. <br /> <br /> live action training (earth <br /> <br />). I can't say enough about this movie. Sometimes it seems that <br /> <br /> you are watching a real documentary. This is one of the most accessible films by Peter Watkins. I advise you to follow this. You will not regret it! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended <br /> <br /> A + <br /> <br />
