Tom Clancy uses "Alexander Nevsky" in his book The Rise of the Red Storm. In the book, Nevsky was shown in cinemas throughout Russia as a prelude to the Soviet invasion of West Germany. I felt I had to check it out. It was excellent! The cinematography was great and the plot is incredible. I do not regret that I watched this film and added it to my collection.
