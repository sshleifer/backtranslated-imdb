This is probably the dumbest movie I've ever seen, and therefore it deserves a special award. So, everything starts quite well, logically, humorously, and then quickly changes to complete and utter uh-uh, @ ss, föck stupidity, which makes complete sense. The strange thing is that I almost did not laugh at it, although I think it should be funny, with a very serious message. After a moment of thinking why I didn’t laugh, the answer was pretty clear ... this film is much more realistic than I would like. So it is very stupid, but very reasonable, if the goal was to reach people who are not “endowed” with a number of neurons, synapses and electrolytes (yes, electrolytes?). In fact, this film can be understood by a wide audience! <br /> <br /> Though they probably just laugh. <br /> <br /> Well, a good attempt ... <br /> <br /> I am editing (add) my comment now, because I have read some other comments. At first I noticed that some people see racism in this film. Well, it didn’t occur to me at all when watching. However, I can imagine if you look from this point of view, you will see some. Of course, we could discuss the relationship between intelligence and race, but I think this is not the place for this. I wonder if we would appreciate the Huxtable family here, would you complain that they are all black? I don’t think so, but I think you could ... (besides this, of the two wisest people in the world, half, a woman, does not seem to me completely Caucasian, so “what's the problem?”) <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film gets very mixed ratings; from 1 to 10 and everything between, but great polarization, which means that the film does an excellent job with its work! It excites people, makes them talk about it and judge it. That means it's a good movie, whether you like it or not. After 5 minutes, it becomes very predictable and even boring, but you keep watching this complete shit. I suppose you continue to hope that this is not the case. Or maybe this is our sick way of looking at horrible events. Well that's for sure.
