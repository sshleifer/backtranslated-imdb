Surprisingly good movie, given the circumstances of its production. Shows performances from nameless actors who compete with the best talents on the planet (unfortunately, no one could make a career). <br /> <br /> There is also Christopher Nolanâ€™s godlike ability to write the perfect dialogue. Dialogue - this is what carries this story in itself, about a person who likes to follow people for the material for their books. Well filmed, VERY well edited, even better written and surprisingly well played. <br /> <br /> This film has everything a great film needs, except for the people who saw it. 9/10
