I grew up in New York, and this show started when I was four years old. I had a kindergarten for half a day, and it was on WPIX channel 11 in the afternoon. I just liked the music and stories, and I remember humming around the house while I was playing. <br /> <br /> I just saw part of the episode on YouTube, and for a moment I remembered what it was like to watch these shows, like a little kid. Of course, I stopped watching when I entered 1st grade, because it was before the school left (there were no VCRs or DVRs then). I grew up not realizing that the show went on until I was in the 11th grade! <br /> <br /> I also had no idea that there was a DVD, and I would like my nieces and nephews to be young enough to enjoy this show, but now they all went through the demographic, or I would buy all of their DVD sets It was much better than many children's shows today.
