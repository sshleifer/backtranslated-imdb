Seven Ups compared with the Bullitt for the chase scene, but not comparable to the Bullitt. Bullitt has a beginning that builds, builds, builds. When McQueen leaves a run-down hotel, sits in his Mustang, which is parked under the Embarcadero motorway (now demolished), and notices the nearby Charger, you know you're going to see something exciting. From this moment on, when McQueen starts this car, the best car chase in history begins. Adding to this is the terrific Lalo Schriffin, if I remember the sound track correctly. This goes on for a long time before you hear the first squeals of tires. That Mustang McQueen shot, suddenly appearing in Bill Hickman’s rearview mirror, is unrivaled in visual impact. Hickman’s look on surprisingly and double double really adds effect. Then, of course, San Francisco is unparalleled for installing cars racing up and down hills and around corners. In addition, the Bullitt was filmed in the 60s, when the cars were still “hot” (Mustang GT and Dodge Charger), and created a better set of wheels than the two boring, smog-loaded Pontiacs devices in the Seven Ups of the 1970s. Bill Hickman was the driver of the bad guy car in both films. I saw him sitting on a preview of an insider movie on the Univeral lot when I was reviewing films for a newspaper. They tried well in Seven Ups, albeit with a chase scene. Seven ups made several “jumps” over small hills (Yawn), but, of course, they were not San Francisco hills. The “Seven Ups” chase, in which they actually go fast, is longer than the sequence of fast moves in Bullitt. But the scene of a single shotgun blast that completely rips the hood off Roy Shiders Pontiac is the height of the absurd. Strictly Hollywood, I would say, except this was filmed in New York.
