When I saw it on TV, I was nervous ... what if they messed up? Millions of families, like mine, who live with a brain damaged person, in my case my dad, would be disappointed. I watched it with my mom, and we both ended up crying, it was as accurate and sealed as the family feels just like a person who suffered a brain injury. All the actors were great and I had no complaints, my mothers told me that she could not stop thinking about it. I hope that this program has made many people understand what it is like to live with brain damage and how it is for families. I need to create more of these programs, I was surprised how good it was, and it really shocked me.
