A really scary movie. James Kunstler, who came through bad language, led me to newly formed web magazines, such as Life After Oil Crash (LATOC), Energy Bulletin and The Oil Drum, as well as the data underlying Hubbert's Peak Theory. Like this film, LATOC and Kunstler paint a dark picture of dying off or dying off. I hope they are premature, but in mid-2005, rising gasoline prices, rising oil prices, the Chevron “You join us” campaign, BP, which became Beyond Petroleum, and even T Boone Pickens believe that we have reached the peak or close to it. oil production. <br /> <br /> After extensive research on limited data, oil investment banker Matt Simmons suggested that the Saudis would no longer be able to increase production in their vast, but aging fields. Under the conditions of increased demand (mainly from the United States and China), the Saudis did not respond by increasing production, despite previous assurances. The declared world production from 2000 to 2004 indicates that light sweet oil has indeed reached its peak. this means that cleaning will become more expensive. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be aimed at baby boomers, but young people, our children, also need to understand the consequences of a future-drained future.
