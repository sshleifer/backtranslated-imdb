What can you say about one of the greatest games for the N64? What action is quick enough to keep literally even an experienced FPS veteran with bullets? That the graphics are great, even the explosions everyone loves to see? That nothing is as funny as playing in multiplayer mode and shooting your friends and siblings in the back with a submachine gun? <br /> <br /> Goldeneye 007 beats very little. The only thing that was missing was the voice acting more intelligence from the enemy soldiers. If you have an N64, and you love shooting people and spying, get a copy of it.
