Flash Gordon is undoubtedly the best of all American TV shows. On a date back in 1936, Universal was able to make such an entertaining story, and twenty years later, when I first saw her as a child, she involved me in a great adventure and emotions. Buster Crabbe was a hero that we always wanted to be in childhood, and Jean Rogers was a beautiful girl we always wanted to fall in love with. Dragons, octopuses, monsters, gorillas were also a landmark. Charles Middleton was a great presence like Ming Ruthless. The real predecessor of the star wars of George Lucas.
