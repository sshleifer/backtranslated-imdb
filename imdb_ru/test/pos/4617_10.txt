I have to admit that I fell into a cynical trap, believing that Australians cannot do drama if it doesn’t mean a lot of crying, but I’m Australian. Sad is not it? While this film includes crying, it is not a dramatic cry, its honest emotions shine through. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film - bastard. I knew what the end result would be when I started watching this, so I tried to guess who would do it. I missed a mile. <br /> <br /> I was stunned when I found out that director Murali Tulluri was only about 21 years old when he was making this film. I would like to shake his hand. He knows how to make a movie. I hope he has yet to come. <br /> <br /> All the characters we meet before the title of the main title (about 12 minutes) are anti-heroes. They are all concerned in their own way, and they are all as selfish as the next. Even when they sympathize. <br /> <br /> The saddest scene in the film, and there are those who are difficult to watch) is the final scene, where we are formally introduced to the real main character, and we talked about our nephew. This scene made me cry. <br /> <br /> My faith in Australian drama has been restored. We are comedy masters, but I was bored of comedy. <br /> <br /> Murali, if you accidentally checked it, you touched my soul, and for that I can only thank you.
