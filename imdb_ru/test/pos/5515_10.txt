Many people give this movie a lot of shit, and all this is really unfair. People have difficulty with this film, either because itâ€™s a very painful subject, or they focus on some technical aspect of the film that no one else sees when they watch it. If, just looking at the cover, you think that this film will make you feel uncomfortable ... DO NOT LOOK! However, you would have missed one of the best cinematic events of the late 1990s, despite what others are saying. <br /> <br /> Dee Snyder is great here, like Captain Howdy, to the depths of insanity with which he plunges. This character must be out of words to play, and much further than any of us should want to go. The game is great here. The film itself is beautifully shot. This subject may be too complicated for many, but it is still worth your time. If you have not seen this movie, check it out.
