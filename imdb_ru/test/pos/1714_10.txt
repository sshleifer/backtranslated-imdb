For those who have access to the BBC or CBC, this has been impressive. Like Battlestar Gallactica, this show is rebuilt from scratch. But in the case of Dr. Who, they saved the best parts. I can't believe I'm saying this, but ... this is the best doctor Who. It has nothing of cheap production value and sometimes the slowness of the old show. The acting is pretty good, and there is a real sense of continuity and history. The new Doctor can easily compare with the great Tom Baker, and the writer (the former QAF host) seems to have revived even the minor characters. <br /> <br /> I know ... I pour out. .but it should be in every list of science fiction. I just don’t know why it didn’t come to that .. Whatever you do ... if you have ever loved Doctor Who or scientifically ... look at it !!!
