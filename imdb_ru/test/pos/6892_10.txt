I really liked this show, and I was very sad to watch it go. Yes, it is based on Christianity, as well as traditionally. It covers some difficult issues, as noted by another reviewer, but I believe that it depends on your point of view on these questions, and when I was a teenager, and now, like my mom, I was so happy to see a series that was pure and, well, frankly, great! I, unlike another reviewer, was inspired to see how they dealt with the condom deal. Instead of hearing the typical condom weakness, they showed that the son really tries to be chaste and apply it to his later relationships, which were pure and pious because of it, and much safer because of it (100%!) . <br /> After watching this entire series, you become extremely attached to all the characters in the family and beyond (as soon as they calm down), and the moral values ​​they teach in each episode are invaluable. I found that Touched by Angel (created by the same producer) was trashy here and there (although I liked it in general), but this series, in my opinion, was much better done, better acted and more interesting. It was good for the whole family and it was interesting for the whole family, which was a huge plus. The family was not outstanding, they had their flaws, but in the end they did what was right and you saw how they grew, changed and fought, like any real family. It was my favorite show at the time, and it will always be at the beginning of my list, I hope it will be released on DVD!
