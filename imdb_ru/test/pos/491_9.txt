Hi, <br /> <br /> Blade is a sensational action movie. the hero (Wesley Snipes) and the villain correctly assessed their roles. <br /> <br /> The sequence of actions in the film is better than that of the Matrix! <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes is one of the best action movies ever. <br /> <br /> If you like action movies / vampire movies, this is ONE. <br /> <br /> The theme is pretty good considering the fact that many vampire films were shot before But this is the best of them. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the ride.
