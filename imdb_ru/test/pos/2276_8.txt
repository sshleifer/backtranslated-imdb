I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Inspired by Jonathan Safran Foer's novel “Everything Is Illuminated” is the directorial debut of actor Lie Schreiber. Schreiber also wrote the script. In the film, Jonathan (Elijah Wood) obsessively collects items from his family, from toothbrushes to counters, pieces of paper, which he then seals in ziploc bags and pins against the wall in his house to record his family history. But the place for his grandfather is noticeably bare. All Jonathan actually has is an ornament and an old photograph of him with a woman who hid him from the Nazis during World War II. Jonathan decides to take a quest to Ukraine to find a woman, thank her and learn more about his grandfather. <br /> <br /> His search is assisted by a couple of characters who run a travel company for Jews, including a young man who is obsessed with Western culture (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather (Boris Leskin), who thinks he is blind and who there may be own memories and demons from the war, and his grandfather's temperamental cannon. <br /> <br /> The script effectively combines both humor and drama when three characters travel around the countryside in search of Jonathan’s grandfather city, plunging deeper and deeper into memories of the past. The best performance probably comes from Eugene Hatz, who plays Alex Jr., who starts the movie in the style of a tracksuit, a slacker for break dance, just to have fun, but develops into something more, not just Jonathan, but all the characters get their own lighting <br /> <br /> Liev Schreiber, Elijah Wood and Eugene Hatz were present at the show and made very humorous questions and answers after the film: <br /> <br /> - Schreiber was very close with his grandfather, who was a Ukrainian immigrant who died in 1993. This made him start writing to write his memories on paper. In the meantime, he was asked to read Foer's story, A Very Tough Search, which was a passage from a still unpublished novel. Schreiber was shocked at the quality of writing, saying that Foer did 15 pages of what Schreiber tried to do in 107. Schreiber approached Foer, and they talked about their grandfathers, culture, films and the nature of short-term memory in America; In the end, Foer agreed to let Schreiber adapt the book. <br /> <br /> - Schreiber's own project was supposed to be a road film, but the book has a parallel narration, which is the imagined chronological history of Trohenbrod, spanning 500 years; given his budget and limitations as a director, he said that he would leave it to Milos Forman and go on a trip instead. It was this imaginary chronology that pushed him to create the film. The idea that "the past with love seemed as valuable as the past, just remembered." <br /> <br /> - Schreiber said the film was a series of happy accidents. After an unsuccessful search in Ukraine for an actor, he was walking along the Lower East Side in New York when he saw a poster with a female centaur, stripped to the waist, with a mad Cossack sitting astride her. Under the poster was written the name Gogol Bordello Ukrainian punk-gypsy group. <br /> <br /> Eugene Hutz then took over the story. He was never keen on acting because music was his first passion. Once, a friend gave him a book, and he thought that it was written the way he wrote music; screw sentences / syntax, my language. <br /> <br /> Later they were called by a producer who was looking for Eastern European music, which was medieval but modern. Hutz met with Schreiber and soon discovered that the film was based on the book he had just read. Soon after, Schreiber asked Hatz what he thought about Alex and whether he could play the character by chance. <br /> <br /> - Fore and Schreiber talked about the film in the fall of 2001, shortly after the September 11th event. Both were in Europe at the time, and they talked about derogatory comments that they had heard about Americans, which made Schreiber try to find a clear-cut American who would challenge Americans' stereotype about Europeans. Someone who was clumsy, vulnerable, flawed, innocent and was looking for a story outside their own country. Schreiber started thinking about who it was, and Elijah came up with it. <br /> <br /> One of the inspirers of Schreiber as a director is Emir Kusturica (I think that is what he said, who also shot an episode in another festival film “Everything”). invisible children) who said: “you are not looking for actors, you are looking for people.” Schreiber said that there is something about who Elijah is, that he possesses generosity of spirit and sincere kindness as a human being that met in the film. Schreiber said that eyes are important when trying to formulate a character who is an observer, and that if “eyes are the doors of the soul, then Elijah is a garage door”. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood inquired about the similarity of his character Kevin in Sin City and Jonathan in this film, since both of them are a kind of blank sheet on which emotions are projected. Wood replied that Jonathan may seem immobile and seemingly unemotional, but the whole thing is in his observations, in his experience with other characters and in the environment in which he was located. <br /> <br /> - About the differences between directing and writing: Schreiber said that he liked to write a lot more, and jokingly described the direction as “hell”. After his grandfather died, Schreiber began to think about how to preserve some sense of history and himself; Is he satisfied or not, or simply interprets the work of other people well? He said that he likes the exercise of finding out what is emotional for you, it is important for you.
