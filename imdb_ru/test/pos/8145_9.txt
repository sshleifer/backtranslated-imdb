I like this movie !!! It was so easy to become part of the characters' lives and truly feel the emotions they experienced. <br /> <br /> A film filled with laughter, sarcasm, upheaval and frustration, just a fantastic romantic drama! /> <br /> The only part I didnâ€™t like was in special functions. Backstage comment was a bit out of place. Since I watched the movie before the extras, I prefer to think of the actors as characters (stupid, I know), but the personality of the actors are very different from the characters they play. But, nevertheless, it is absolutely fantastic, entertaining, brilliant film. I recommend to everyone who watched this movie and thought, hmmmmm, should I buy it? The answer must be certain, yes!
