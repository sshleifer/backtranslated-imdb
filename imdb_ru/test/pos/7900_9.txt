Vanya is a superlative film. He has an exceptionally well thought out cast, in which Mamatha is a gem, a magnificent production and perhaps a preliminary production with Rajnesh at the helm, a fantastic journey through the countryside of South India through the eyes of a 15-year-old child , beautifully combined, and a beautiful background of lush colors of flora and fauna that make up a magnificent experience. What a great achievement for a director debut !! Casting was absolutely dead. I would like India to release more such films. This film will remain one of my favorites for life. 9/10.
