I had a great time watching Femina Raiden a couple of days ago, a few hangover. For most of the film, this is pretty much two-faced, featuring the games and strange relationships of the mad doctor Philip Leroy and the terrific Dagmar Lassander. I have seen her before in several Fulci films dying horrible deaths, but here she is young, beautiful and fashionable. The film is quite predictable and, of course, soft on the front of exploitation, but interesting everywhere because of its amazingly colorful kitsch feeling. Scenography, music, lighting and cinema - all this is a classic Italian style of the late sixties, a surreal event for eyes and ears, and although the common thread of the plot is not so difficult to foresee, more than quite unusual events and memorable bizarre sights and sounds, so that everything is interesting . Both leads are pretty good, and itâ€™s worth repeating that Dagmar Lassander is really very good. The music of Stelvo Cipriani is also very suitable for images. Directed by Piero SivaZappa came up with a real cracker, but he is not perfect. Although it is very tempting, there is little substance, and the elements of exploitation are as soft as possible. I guess it gives him charm and innocence, but I can't help but think that the subject could be associated with a lot of meanness, a greater threat and the like, especially because it is quite simple to understand what will happen. I suspect that this is a bit pointless for stronger fans of exploitation and, of course, not for people who want sex or great nudity. It is rather an easy, fun game in the style of pop art, attractive, but insignificant, like bath foam. Recommended mainly to those who love the 60s, Dagmar Lassander or sweet decorations.
