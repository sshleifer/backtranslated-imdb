"Landscape after the battle" begins with the escape of prisoners on a snow-covered snowy field, in rather amusing movements, accompanied by Vivaldis the Seasons. A touching discovery. But we will soon learn to recognize these prisoners as a gang, and when they (also related to humor) bury a person alive, the main character stops for a moment, but soon he is more busy searching for books from the folded camp than taking care of his neighbor. . <br /> <br /> The rest of the film takes place in the American camp, from where prisoners are not released, in some kind of semi-free, half-camp. The ideal set for the study of war crime, the American camps, Polish nationalism, Catholicism, grief and human suffering in general. <br /> <br /> The film makes an important turn. A woman comes, and with them the film changes light, color and temperament. At the same time, it turns out that these prisoners were slaves of the Holocaust. I think that the main political theme of the film should be the relationship of humanity to the Jews during the world war and after it, and not only the destruction by the Nazis, but also how humanity allows this to happen - and even displaces them from Europe after the war. On an emotional level, the film tells of grief and the problem with which it comes, how the environment makes grief difficult, and how difficult it is to share grief for people with different experiences. <br /> <br /> But the film is a carpet of hidden contradictions, humor, irony and sudden beauty. A couple of times during the movie, the gypsy prisoner plays the harp, the emotional melody is cruelly rejected (cinematically) by the main character. This example reflects the important essence of the style and theme of the film. When it comes to humor, it’s very funny how the main character constantly loses and finds his glasses, in a crowd, in haystacks, etc. <br /> <br /> It’s easy to understand Spileberg’s respect for Weide when you watch this movie . Great attitude to the light can be compared with Spielberg at its best. Grunwald Intermezzo speaks for itself. Narrative it only takes the film out of the camp, but cinematically it brings the film to the dream and eternity with deep beauty. In any case, there is another scene that I cannot leave without comment. This is a Christian supper. Undoubtedly, ironically, but at the same time deeply religious, we see a moment of re-justification, when everyone falls to his knees, and the main character is saved from isolation by the priest to serve as a humorous boy. His bells mock the scene, but also give her emotions and love. When Nina gets her bread, the sunlight falls on her, and the bells become spherical, this is the most important moment of the film. <br /> <br /> The main actors are superb in their roles. Olbrichski as the perfect protagonist of Waida is a doubting reflective mind, unable to bring all aspects of his mind and emotions to life. The beautiful Selinska with a magnificent physique makes her debut in character, unable to express all her inner in her proud movements. <br /> <br /> Those who try to describe everything often cannot take anything into account. This is what Waida rules. His films are either very touching, deep or beautifully made, but they draw attention to the peculiarities of life and society. A moment of joy for one, a moment of irony for a second, a moment of sorrow for a third, a moment of nothing for a fourth. <br /> <br /> There are at least two reasons that Waidas films of this period should pay attention to. First, it is a wonderful free expression of deep political influence. This country was the first to overthrow communism twenty years later. Secondly, the development of cinematic and narrative language, which Kusturica raised to greatness.
