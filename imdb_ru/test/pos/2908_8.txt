This performance “Fox” became a hit when it came out in 1954. Created superbly, with great music and sets, an intriguing cast, he moves slowly but interestingly. Edmund Purd is strikingly handsome as an Egyptian who becomes a famous doctor juggling three stunning women: the maidservant Gene Simmons, who passively adores him, the seducer Bella Darvi, who escapes him, and Pharaoh's sister Gene Tini, who wants him to be her spotlight Popularity the film has not diminished since it was re-shown in AMC (preferably in widescreen mode). Purdom is especially great, his character is clearly striking to the women, and in the end he was never married and a “thinker.” Darvi is amazing and teasing in her role as a femme fatale. Victor Mature, Michael Wilding, film colleague Peter Ustinov. Check this.
