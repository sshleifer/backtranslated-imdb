Caught this movie on TCM at the beginning of A.M. It was awesome. <br /> <br /> Starting slowly, but ominously .... Scott is a shadow character who preys on women. In this case, two women who were inherited in Southern California. <br /> <br /> The beach and surroundings of the 1940s are original and intriguing. The name could have been more creative, but the topic and vile shadows of human nature are intriguing, almost in the Hitchcock version. <br /> <br /> Scott reminded me of Uncle Charlie’s character in Shadows of Doubt, one of Hitch’s famous favorite films. The audience learns that we really do not know what is hidden in the dark side of the human mind. This film is a displaced pearl and worth the purchase. 10/10
