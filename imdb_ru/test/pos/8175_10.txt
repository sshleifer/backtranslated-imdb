A very good movie. <br /> <br /> Great love story. Lots of swords fighting. Huge battle scenes. Heroes and villains. Real story. <br /> <br /> Few people in the West know the history of China. Chin Zhundi founded China. The country is actually named after him. Some are familiar with the recently found terracotta army. This is a historical epic about how he ended the period of competing states and united China. He founded a dynasty that lasted only 14 years, but it was immediately replaced by the Han dynasty, which has since forever defined Chinese civilization. <br /> <br /> Chin (or King Zheng, as he was known before the founding of the empire, was about a contemporary of Scipio, Hannibal and Fabius in the West. Parallel Roman world domination (the Western and Eastern worlds) was achieved without a single towering personality, such like Chin. It would not have been for another century until the West produced Caesar - the closest comparable Western character. <br /> <br /> Chin is very sympathetically shown here at the beginning, but he develops during the film into a ruthless despot. History only fixes ruthless h As a despot, but a sympathetic beginning leaves room for real character development during this long film. The famous story of meeting the killer is as true as any other two thousand year joke. Gong Lee is beautiful. It is the emotional core of the story. great movie.
