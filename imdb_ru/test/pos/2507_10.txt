I am a large heterosexual scarred man, a former bouncer, a former rugby player and a former boxer, and I like this movie. <br /> <br /> This is not the "Mystical River." This is a piece of fluff. But in life there is a place for fluff, and when this fluff shoots with excitement, plays good, attractive people, cleverly thinks and is full of good dialogue, I have even more opportunities. <br /> <br /> I’m not the biggest fan of Tom Selleck. But he is good at it. Just like Julianne Nicholson (she likes her bald head and freckles), Ellen Degenères, Kate Capshaw and even Tom Everett Scott (“That's what you do!”). <br /> <br /> The scenery is good, the mood is elated, there is heartache, thoughtfulness, farce and even a small redemption. <br /> <br /> Any reviewer (male) who makes this film, let's say, is not quite sure of his manliness. In the meantime, I will continue to catch him in pieces without an apology whenever he appears on the cable.
