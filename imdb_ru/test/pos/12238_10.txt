Basically a charming and crazy $ 1.50 version of a sophisticated underground creature from the early 80s, a favorite of the favorite "The Boogens", this entertaining-crazy cheap monk, in the center of which is a disgusting, tortuous, wriggling monster who cooks instant food from any unfortunate souls so reckless that they can jostle around the deliberately closed mines of the Gold Spike Mine. Your standard edition of a motley assortment of fearless bones is my cruel boss, sweet but tasteless blonde beauty, angry lady geologist, drunk, inexplicably seasoned (!) Old seasoned hand, serene stupid, wild, funny guy and, perhaps, the most annoying character from groups of annoying, all-knowing beginner-twos writers who tend to speak in floral, melodramatic sayings - go to a dark, uninvited cave in search of gold. Naturally, these extremely intolerable assholes discover that the allegedly abandoned mine is the home of a deadly, ugly, multi-legged beast, which over time glorifies the gray-haired bi-flick and continues to terribly interfere with the group one at a time. Director, co-author, co-producer and co-edited with stunning ill will of Melanie Ann Clerk, who played the title of anonymous, with terrifying flatness, further darkened by a languid career, a dramatic, sinuous narration, a dark, undefinable, boring cinematography, a jitter, and a redundant outfit, a dark, unimpaired, boring cinematography, jitter, and too much redundancy. rough, insolently twitching animation of a stop of movement, a stupid thing that is very quickly catch a glimpse at the very end of the film, this extremely clumsy, amateur and, an investigator but, a very adorable horrible potential scarefest makes all the necessary mistakes in a bad film to qualify as a real four star stinkeroonie.
