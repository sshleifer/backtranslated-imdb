I have not seen such a film in which the creators have invested so much blood in their work and for a very long time paid attention to the smallest details. <br /> <br /> Everything was well thought out and perfectly implemented. Camera work, editing and compositing worked so well together, it was just awesome. The headlines were so fun and beautifully set. <br /> <br /> This movie just hit me. <br /> <br /> Although “Disassembly” could be reduced by 10 or 15 minutes. <br /> This is almost perfect respect for the noir Films early silent plot, acting, scenery and costumes were perfect and believable so that they can be seen from the time of silent filmmaking.
