There is a punch in this movie. Some of them from time to time make me think deeply and disturb me a lot. I could see myself in the same predicament - to passively allow things to happen around me, not to defend the right and decent, just try to avoid trouble. How often do we avoid waves or neck bulging? How often our inaction justifies the evil actions of others. We would never join them, we tell ourselves, we recognize that what they are doing is bad, but are we doing something about it? <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman (William H. Macy) is a modest, boring office worker who extinguished his home in Brooklyn, New York, in the last days of World War II. He rarely gets involved in what is happening around, never married, rarely talks, just goes to work and takes care of his disabled mother. Then a series of events in his very “white” small neighborhood takes him from a smug shell to a whirlpool of events. This begins when he sees from the window of his bedroom the rape of a Puerto Rican girl by the son of his neighbor. Soon after, he gets glasses due to poor vision. As he now sees better, he becomes less able to cope with the circumstances of his life. The only bright spot is the new love in his life, and he is getting married, hoping to continue his normal life. Then violent anti-Semitism in this street overtakes him, despite his authority as a Presbyterian WASP. As things get out of control, he discovers that he has to make an important decision - whether he gets up or just leaves. <br /> <br /> I cannot imagine how anyone can watch this film without experiencing any influence on it to think a lot about themselves and what they really are worth. Post-war anti-Semitism operates here, but always and everywhere there is injustice. A person must decide where he or she is standing.
