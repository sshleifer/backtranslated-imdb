A few years ago, with Ray of Light, Madonna reached a truly amazing level of musical mastery, and since then she has sometimes exceeded even her own standards. This concert performance, with its hypnotic editing, amazing dancing, hallucinatory lighting effects and trance arrangements, destroys all previous efforts. Madonna’s apparent ambitions — alone to achieve world peace through music and dance — may seem absurd or absurd to someone. But damn, someone has to do it! Thanks to her remarkable talent of all who participated in this performance, "Confessions Tour Live from London" is again among the top ten artists working anywhere in the world in any environment.
