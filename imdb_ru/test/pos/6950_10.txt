This is an incredibly convincing story, told with great simplicity and grace. The plot itself is the object of the film, although the scenery is beautiful. The acting is understated, even superb, because the characters themselves go through all their eccentric simplicity. <br /> <br /> Those who watch films “by chance” will not appreciate this work without due attention. It takes work to get involved in the story, but as soon as you get involved, the captivity is complete!
