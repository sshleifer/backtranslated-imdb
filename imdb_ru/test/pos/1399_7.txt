This film surprised me. The box is misleading, the tagline is misleading, and the costumes and the tone of the film are misleading. The film is quite bloody, well-played and beautifully shot. The special effects are first-class and seem to be ahead of their time until you realize that this film was released in 1979, and not in 1963, as its tone suggests. This is a unique look at the story of Dr. Moreau, shot in one of the best options. The first fifteen minutes are the brightest and most shocking, but the film never falls apart. Definitely worth a look, if you are a fan of dramatic costume / classic horror and bloody festivals.
