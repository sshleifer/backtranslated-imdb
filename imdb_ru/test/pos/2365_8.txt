The magnificent comedy of the 1980s in the south-west of England. This is a story about sex, drugs, creams and murders by the sea. Adrian Edmondson, French and Saunders, Nigel Glider (cheerful in drag) and Robbie Coltrane play a role. Dennis (Edmondson) is trying to make an impression on the girl, bragging that he is involved in a multi-million drug deal. This leads to complications with fun results. I'm trying to figure out the original image ratio for this film, but it is not displayed in the “Technical Aspects” section of the IMDb site. I found a DVD in the store, and it seems to be in 1.33: 1 format (full screen). Was the movie shot at this ratio, or was it a widescreen movie with pan and DVD scanning? It would be helpful to know how I hate panning and scanning movies. So go IMDb. Could you find out for us?
