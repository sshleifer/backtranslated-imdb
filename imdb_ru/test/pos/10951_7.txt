The vampire prince falls in love with a human girl, unaware that her brother is a famous vampire hunter. This is the main theme of this hype in martial arts, which borrows ideas from the Underworld and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but also maintains its own style. I was stunned by the British and Hong Kong name "The Effect of the Twins", as there are no twins in this story. It turns out that the two main female characters play Hong Kong pop stars who play Gemini. Do not let this alienate you. These girls can act (at least well enough for this type of film) and add a lot of charm to the process. Jackie Chan appears on a couple of episodic episodic episodes, adding to his turn a touch of his own brand of chaos from farce. In general, it is very fun for those who like their vampires, who are treated with mocking humor.
