Although I hoped that I would like some more, this film was still impressive. All the presenters had excellent presentations, and the story, although not one that I would call frightening, was nevertheless effective, and it interested me. For me, the best part of this film was the look of the picture, because it always looked cold and damp, and it really seemed to fit the film. I also thought that a low-budget film was suitable for this film, because I donâ€™t think that a clear picture and clear sound would work just as badly in a dark film. All things considered, it was a bit beyond my expectations, but I'm still very glad that I finally sat down to watch this movie.
