For example, I really wanted to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Although I knew that it would be a different type of film in the style of "Revenge of the Nerds", I was still impressed. <br /> There is a lot of truth in this type of training, and we firmly believe that it should be resolved in the "new style of learning". <br /> <br /> Traditional teaching methods do not always teach students what they need to know or what they need to know or want to know. <br /> <br /> This approach to learning should be further developed in real academic courses. <br /> <br /> Although there are still too many at parties, obviously, they needed to be added there - for the sake of a Hollywood college comedy ... although we all know that life is really not at all like that. <br /> <br /> An incredible touch, still funny and with a killer ending. <br /> <br /> Amazing ending. Extremely important to the whole story and very amazing. <br /> <br /> Without the final scene, the movie would be half as good. <br /> <br /> I liked this film, and he shouldn’t have too many curses, nudity or rough jokes for it to be good. <br /> <br /> The excellent team and the actors, the plot and even the general typography of the obligatory “members of the Hampton Brotherhood” was well done. <br /> <br /> “American Pie 1, 2 3” and “American Wedding” or any other clones they make do not match the current 1/3. <br /> <br /> Much better than most first year college comedies without humiliating stupid jokes forcing someone to toss. <br /> <br /> I liked it, although it was just ... it was interesting and even soulful ... My only regret for watching this film is that it does not last longer
