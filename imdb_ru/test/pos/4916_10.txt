L'Homme Blesse is not for an impatient, adventurous audience. There are no explosions here, and the drama is not simple. Like the Lynn Ramsey films, the director works more deeply with the mood than with storytelling in a way that is effective and incredibly touching. Because it does not rely on unwarranted nudity or superficial pop cult. storylines, frankly, this is one of the best foreign gay films I've seen (see also Francois Ozon, Pedro Almodovar). “Don't Watch Now” Nicholas Roag gets a lot of bad press because it is being sold as a horror movie. This film, like L'Homme, is more than a box can believe. If you are in the mood to sit back and be absorbed by subtle, transformed movie forces, you will love this movie.
