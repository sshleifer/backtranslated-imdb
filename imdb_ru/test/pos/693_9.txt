Any film about the Second World War, made by a British production company during the Second World War, in my opinion, has no analogues in recent times. The merging of many things close and dear to my heart is in "At Dawn, When We Dive": as a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and a student on all aspects of World War II and especially sea war, I prefer images of submarines and actions in the North Atlantic especially those that include the German side of things. For those who are not familiar with target priorities, an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event a submarine can face, and this rare opportunity will suddenly arise, just as we see here. The tempo is deliberate and typical for works that leave the Ealing, Rank and British-Gaumont studios of that time. To be honest, I prefer a quieter, more cerebral approach to his humanity and realism, which attracts much better than any overproduced Hollywood film ever could. It reminds me of the 49th parallel of Powell and Pressburger thanks to the powerfully convincing Eric Portman, my favorite. John Mills gets a second billing and a smaller font in the titles, so this is clearly Mr. Portmanâ€™s movie, but the whole cast shines. Regarding the sequence of names, am I the only one who is completely fascinated by the beautiful girl from Gainsborough Production to CGI in Gainsborough?
