I had the pleasure of watching this short film at the Miami Film Festival last Saturday and let me say that I was amazed. It was the only film from the whole program that I loved. It is beautifully shot, compiled, edited, acted and written. After the show, I saw the director at the party and asked him what he was doing next. He said he is working on finding funding for the short version. He described some scenes for me. It sounded like the first film that launches great people into the industry. If you can ever see this short one, I highly recommend taking it. Hats off to the star crossed.
