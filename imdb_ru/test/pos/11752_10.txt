I first saw this film in the mid-60s, when I was a teenager, and he touched me, in fact, the end scene, where Han Suyin hears about Mark’s death, and then rushes to the hill in perplexity, where you then hear Mark’s voice saying “Give me your hand”, and then his image disappears, a butterfly with a superstitious sense, music, broken emotions of Han Suyin's Love simply left me to sob. I cried bitterly, my mother and sister looked up and were shocked by my reaction. I just left the room to be alone. Fortunately, I do not react like that anymore, BUT I always cry at the end. I love everything about the film, mainly the music, the costumes of Han Suyin and the locality. The beauty of Jennifer Jones and the handsome William Holden, they were both at their best. I have a VHS and DVD of this wonderful movie. I also have two versions of the music and lyrics of Arthur Newman and Sammy Fine. I also have a book of Han Suyin's “A Lot of Splendor”. I recommend this movie 100%
