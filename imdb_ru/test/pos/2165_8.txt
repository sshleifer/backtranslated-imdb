Although itâ€™s a nice, nice cartoon, it later turned out much better, like Carrotblanca. This is almost like the first Star Trek feature that would be welcomed with open arms and joy, in spite of everything, only for existing ones. This is really a patchwork of old bits with some nice touches, but nothing special. Reminds me a little of the hunting trilogy in the field, and the ending is priceless. Available and definitely worth a look only at the novelty and good moments. Featured.
