This movie captures you from the first scenes and never lets go. You condescendingly look at how Janos Sabi is looking at the excitement about going to America. He is a nice guy. You cannot help loving him, even when his zeal gives way to bitterness, when his state changes. You know that in his circumstances you will be forced to make the same choice as he is to survive. This film tells how society worships beauty and all that is superficial, and this is even more true in the culture of the 21st century. Janos himself becomes a victim of this philosophy when he says to his blind girlfriend: “You are young and beautiful; if you saw, you would have peace. ” And, like many modern gangster films, when her security is threatened, he gets a powerful revenge. However, his innocence is not completely lost, since he demands a no less high price for himself, knowing that he deserves his fate. <br /> <br /> Peter Lorre is in great shape in this leading role. Only a few actors could convincingly transform this character from an innocent into an embittered criminal in sixty-nine minutes. Lorra is well supported by all the actors who make this real ensemble image, and not just a car for one star. This film with a 10 percent preaching dialogue would be 10. Highly recommended.
