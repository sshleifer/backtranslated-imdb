Watching this on Comcast On-Demand. <br /> <br /> Every time I see this musical, I marvel at the songs ... one show stopper after another. <br /> <br /> This interpretation, for me, is magical. The songs sparkle ... the vocals, orchestrations and choreography are amazing for the film "Made for Television" ... better than many of the stage versions I've seen. <br /> <br /> The dispute about Bette just does not make sense. She is a mother. Her voice is magnificent and at the same time full of the pathos of a stage mother experiencing her daughters. I still have tears at the end, when she finally had a moment of glory, no matter how faded it was. <br /> <br /> The Tulsa / Louise duet / dance is already included. Fabulous. <br /> <br /> Stephen Sondheim is the king of musical theater. His lyrics just roll off the language like silk ... Stein's music is probably the best movie ever written for a stage / screen. <br /> <br /> Thank God, this masterpiece of the American Musical Theater is recorded on DVD.
