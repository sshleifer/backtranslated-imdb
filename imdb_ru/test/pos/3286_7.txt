Wesley Ure - young inventor Brian Foster, who invented a new security device in the form of a robot dog, the title "C.H.O.M.P.S." (This means the Dog House Protection System). C.H.O.M.P.S., which was modeled after the real dog Brian Haskal, can do almost anything; he has increased speed, strength, x-ray vision and the like. It's just the thing to save his boss Ralph Norton's (Conrad Bane) security company. Naturally, the slimy competitor Gibbs (Jim Backus) wants to get an advantage, so he tries to reveal the secret. <br /> <br /> This is such a thing that is simply hard to resist. He has a lot of farce (Chuck McCann and the Red Button play a great couple of clumsy idiots), an upbeat mood, an attractive cast and a good enough laugh to entertain one. Energetic disco music repeats, but undoubtedly catches; The story is simple, and the dogs themselves are absolutely adorable. In one completely strange, but split touch, in the film there is another dog (named "Monster"), whose thoughts we really hear; and his dialogue, and the performer, making the voice, are priceless. In fact, he even uses a light profanity, and his last words end the film on the last intriguing note. <br /> <br /> Eure and sweet Valerie Bertinelli are very cute young performers, and their veteran supports the cast. stuff with all the pleasure they can collect. Larry Bishop, Hermione Baddeley, Robert K. Lewis and Regis Toumi also play a major role. <br /> <br /> A rare theatrical adventure in the genre of live action for the team of creators of the cartoons Hanna and Barber (“Flintstones”, “Scooby-Doo”, “The Smurfs”, etc.) . I know it left me with a smile on my face. <br /> <br /> 7/10
