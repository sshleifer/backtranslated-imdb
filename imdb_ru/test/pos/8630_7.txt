I wanted to watch this movie because I am a very big fan of Abbott and Costello, and when I saw it, I liked it. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, not hysterical, but funny. I mean, I laughed at a lot of fun details, and I just liked it. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the best of Perfect Straight Man and Perfect Buffoon, you should see this if you really love Abbott and Costello. <br /> <br /> Of all the films I have seen about Abbott and Costello, I cannot say that I have seen a film that I hated. This is decent, funny and interesting. Abbott and Costello have, at least, made some pretty decent films in recent years. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked this film, it is not one of the best, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
