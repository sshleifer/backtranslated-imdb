When it was shown at Seattle Int'l Film Fest, I was the only one standing, clapping and cheering. The rest of the crowd was whistling or silent. This is a well-played small film, deeply penetrating into the reality of humanity of a young gay man. It is about a real person; and does not play in the tasteless hyper-polished muscular "gay paositive", which takes place in the genre, not porn gay movies (and that is why so many modern gay genres movies are so boring). This is the film "Intensive Passion" and "The Great Tragedy." Acting, directing and cinematography are fantastic; All this keeps the film clastrophobic, intense and passionate. Don't miss it if you can find it.
