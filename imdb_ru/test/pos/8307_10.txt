This film was the second film that I saw in the cinema as a child. It scared me to death. So much so that I asked my father if we could go halfway. <br /> <br /> At present, only those who have good taste in movies remain halfway there. <br /> <br /> I, however, have fond memories of this vicious masterpiece of horror. Doug McClure and Peter Cushing in one movie! Big! Monsters from polypropylene substitute. Scary things. A rubber monster, if you think about it, is even worse than a real monster. <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing how good this bill is. Truly exciting things. <br /> <br /> There are also many prehistoric tits on the show. Nice.
