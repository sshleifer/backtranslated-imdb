This show was not only a great human drama, but also portrayed racism in this country in a coarse, too true way of life. When one show can be so witty and interesting, but at the same time so sharp and educational at the same time, this is television in its highest form. The game was phenomenal. The letter was exceptional. Not only did the show show race races in a straightforward form that seems unsurpassed for any other television series, but its ability to portray this subject as it existed in the 1960s along with how it exists at the beginning of the twenty-first century, strongly demonstrates the ways in which we have changed, and, unfortunately, many more ways in which we have not changed.
