This film really used its locations well with some amazing shots, a dark and disturbing film moves very slowly, but keeps you constantly watching. This year, "Modern Love" has proven itself in the program "Gold Coast Film Fantastic", offering viewers to look at the Australian cinema, which is usually neglected. Most importantly, it's nice to see that Australian cinema does not accept the Australian clich√©s and storylines that we have seen to death for many years. This film will complement any festival and open up the debate after its showing. The performances and characters are well developed, and the cinematography is fantastic. An interesting study of family relationships and the environment.
