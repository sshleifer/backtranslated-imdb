My sisters and my cousin (woman) made me watch this movie about tiptoe. This is not the film that I would prefer to see, but in fact it was not so bad. I would not like to see this film, but after watching it, I could not say that it was bad, just not my film. It was very accurate to act out what the woman was talking about and what she was doing in certain situations. As a guy, I was not too surprised at the jokes, but the man, who must have been women. They were related to the film, and yes, it was fun to see yourself on the big screen. "Oh, uh, gi, I do it for haha." I have never seen the original, and I would not want to do that. If you are a girl, this is a must see, but perhaps the girls will say that this film sucks, probably. I do not see how a 13-year-old boy said: "Wow, I remember, threw it when I was 30 years old." <br /> <br /> No one would have this in this collection, but I can not say that it was terrible Fur.
