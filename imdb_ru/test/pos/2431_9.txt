Anastasia: Anna's Mystery was a two-part historical film shot by a star, based on Peter Kurt’s book Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna Anderson This largely retains its historical value, the names change, and so on. But the real story holds pretty well. Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom succeed in the same way as Russian tsars, Tsar Nicholas and Tsarina Alexander. What I remember was too short an image of Rex Harrison and Olivia De Havilland. Overall, it was a pretty awesome production with some great play. I was very shocked by production values ​​when he first went on the air on NBC at the end of 1986. Also starring was the wonderful German actor Jan Niklas, who previously starred in another Russian epic of NBC “Peter the Great”. <br /> <br /> I felt that in the second part some important details of Anna Anderson’s trip to America were missed. It is also important to know that in 1986 less was known about the story of Anna Anderson. At that time it was not yet known whether her statement about Grand Duchess Anastasia was genuine. By the end of the 1990s, more became known, and now Anna Anderson is considered a fraud. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that networks no longer make good television films like this one.
