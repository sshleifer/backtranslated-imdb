Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) wrongfully accused of sabotage hangers, producing aircraft for war. He runs, meets Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) along the way, and she joins him to find and bring the real criminals to justice. <br /> <br /> In this film a lot of things are wrong. Robert Cummings was a good actor, but he was not at all in this role; Priscilla Lane is beautiful, but never a good actress; the story does not make much sense (and thunders longer than necessary); he wears a little of his patriotism (but it WAS done during World War II), and there is no end to it. This should not work, but it works. <br /> <br /> It’s full of quirky lines and symbols that surely interest you. <br /> <br /> For example: Lane says to Cummings (while they fall in love), “I would like to meet you a hundred years ago” (???? !!!!); Lane pays the villain for lunch, and Cummings and Lane briefly join the circus troupe while on the run. In addition, Hitchcock's direction was (as always) simply awesome — he adds some really amazing shots and episodes — especially the culmination of the Statue of Liberty. <br /> <br /> This is not one of Hitchcock's classic films, but it is still very good and deserves attention.
