In this episode, I liked to watch Squire Trelan jerk around the team, although after a while it all seems too long. Of course, for a while, the story was pretty funny, and the finale was a pretty good way to wrap it all together. I think the problem was that I liked to see Trelan when he was full of bravado and fun, the fun seemed to disappear when Trelan became vindictive and nasty. Talk about the killer mood - from the disgusting, but affable host to the guy who sentenced Kirk to death! But despite this, the episode was enjoyable and worth my time. For unshakable Trekkies, this is a must-see, for others - just a sweet test.
