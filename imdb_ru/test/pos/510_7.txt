I admit that I refer more to the traditional story of vampires, but this one is a real winner. A lot of output graphics and a good story with them are made in 2 hours. There was a lot of blood when violent bloodsuckers attacked mortals and even each other for control of the world. Good for all of us, vampire lovers.
