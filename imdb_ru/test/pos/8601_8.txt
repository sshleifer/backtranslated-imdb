Until then, until the final reviews that this film was shot in 1989, it was obvious that all elements of its production were made so that they looked in the 1960s: acting, characteristics, scenery and scenery had the aesthetics of an earlier time. /> <br /> The film tells about the moments that preceded the fall of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and how this tragic incident affects one family: the young woman Yasuko, who lives with her aunt and uncle. Even in black and white and with the use of special effects, which are rather primitive by modern standards, but, nevertheless, emotional and effective, the images of the direct effects of the explosion are very terrible. Family members become unrecognizable to each other, others resemble zombies when they roam the streets in exhaustion and shock. <br /> <br /> The name refers to rainfall that fell shortly after a bomb mixed with radioactive ash, and which Yasuko was caught. Rumors that Yasuko was in Hiroshima during the bombing affect her marriage prospects, and it later became clear that black rain did cause illness. The film is dedicated not only to the physical impact of the bomb on the Japanese, but also to the social and psychological damage caused. <br /> <br /> I found the film a compassionate and fascinating journey into a unique culture. While the film is primarily concerned with the pain that one family is experiencing, the soft political message of the film is relevant today and probably forever - wars have terrible consequences and should not be introduced unless absolutely necessary. They say that history repeats itself, and the current leaders of the Coalition of the Wishing have not learned anything. While atomic war has not surfaced since 1945, other deadly consequences have. This film is irresistible to watch.
