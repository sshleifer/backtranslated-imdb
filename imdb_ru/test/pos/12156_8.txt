More is perhaps best remembered for the excellent Pink Floyd soundtrack - in 1969, they were not yet superstars. In fact, they made an album with film music, no fan can miss it! <br /> <br /> But this is also the first film of the German-French director Barbet Schroeder: this is a cult film. When it was released, censorship everywhere reduced several scenes of sex and drugs. It is also one of the first films that explicitly addresses the topic of drug slavery. <br /> <br /> A German boy goes to Paris and meets an American girl: they fall in love. Together they seek the sun and the exotic. But this is too expensive love: she dedicates it to drugs. <br /> <br /> In the 1960s, the anti-drug campaign was not the same as today, there was little information. On the contrary, for many people, drug use was a kind of spiritual experience ... It is therefore quite surprising to see a film from that period, which tells about a nightmarish experience with heroin. <br /> <br /> The film is simple, and not generally vulgar and filmed in the style of "cinematic". The actors Mimsey Farmer and Klaus Grünberg are very convincing. The “sea” is a document from the end of the sixties, as well as a document on the ending of the hippie illusions.
