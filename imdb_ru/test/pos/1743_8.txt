I was very disappointed when this show was canceled. Although I can not vote. I live on the island of Aruba. I sat down to watch the show on Tuesday. And he was very surprised that it was not broadcast. The next day I read on the Internet that it was canceled. <br /> <br /> True, not everyone was as talented as the others. But very talented people sang there. <br /> <br /> I am very sad. <br /> <br /> They worked so hard, and dreams fell apart. <br /> <br /> pity <br /> <br /> Arietta Kroes
