We all know what Chan-wook Park can do. If you have not seen Oldboy (or the empathy trilogy in this regard), you are missing out on some of the best films made in this century. But I am not here to talk about them. I'm here to talk about thirst. <br /> <br /> This movie is not what you expect. Yes, this is a film about vampires, but at the same time it is a very distorted romance story between a priest and a young girl. I will not go into the short review (you can read this above), but instead I will tell you what this film has to offer. Chan-wook Park is a master of cinematography, and this film is no exception. With some very surreal scenes backed up by intense lighting, he ideally sets the mood in almost every scene. The film starts a little slow, but I felt that it was necessary to build relationships with the characters. As soon as things start moving, he almost never leaves until the credits begin. “Thirst” is predominantly a love story, but not in the sense in which you think. the relationship between the leading characters is very intense, but at the same time almost disturbing. Chang-wook Park is no stranger to controversy, as we know, and this film touches the taboo almost as much as the old man. The final scene is by far the strongest in the film, and perhaps one of the best conclusions of the film that I have seen. <br /> <br /> In general, this is an exceptional film, which, I think, all film lovers should watch. This is an exciting (and, admittedly, different) view of the world of vampires, and romance is far from juicy or boring. This film is sandy, selfless and beautiful in all respects. Obviously, this is not for everyone, but it is likely that, if you are reading this review, you are already interested. See it. Do not be shy
