Since Salinger's “A Beautiful Day for a Banana Fish” ends with the prodigy's suicide, this film begins with the death of Matt's high school star swimmer, who shoots himself in the head with a revolver after in the debut scene. But Matt Travis’s death serves as the key to open the door of another prodigy, his brother Tim, who never seriously considered the question: “What am I going to do?” <br /> <br /> When he finds his brother dead, his head is broken like a fallen watermelon; the Travis family begins to spew their secrets one by one. The film is about Tim. He is a victim of bullying, domestic violence, family alienation, grief, problems of sexuality and friendship. <br /> <br /> Tim reveals his wounds from physical injuries, but these are not the only injuries to his personality, as we gradually realize, as the script painfully reveals the origin and consequences of Tim’s scars. Everyone who loves him hurts him. Hirsch plays the character pretty well, revealing the frame by frame in the visual expression of his body, a lot of conflicting emotions in the soul of a child whom no one seems to listen to or know very well without knowing or realizing his depth. soul and tremendous talent. <br /> <br /> Timur asks Penny: “What will I do with the rest of my life?” Tim Penny is asked. The scene is framed in a familiar, repetitive image of the film: a comfortable playground, where Tim obviously feels at home, taken from a bird's eye view, because with every character Tim feels comfortable to share a part of himself, and we see these intimate moments he shares on a red, spinning baby plate, complete with childish graffiti, carved with a pencil on top. After he advised him to go shortly through the joint, Penny said to him: “Tim, well, the secret of life’s success is to find what you love. And you have to do it for the rest of your life? ”And you better hope to hell that you’re good at it, because if you don’t, you’ll probably fail. This simple line of tips from Penny is the main theme of the film, responsibility for talent and the possibility of failure. Why does one person have a talent that he cannot bear, like Matt, who hated the attention that his swimming glory brought, but no one notices Tim's talent ?? no one. No one ?? because no one bothers to ask him? Even we. The film makes us realize that we ourselves do not know Tim as well as we thought when we first learned this beautiful, sad guy; in our deep understanding of Tim as he develops, we are reminded that not all are as they seem. Is this the other side of the film, the failure of those who must ?? parents, friends, teachers ?? whoever ?? notice and see the gifts of the people they claim to love. Even his mother Sandy, played by Sigourney Weaver, does not see Tim's gift, despite her love for her son. Weaver deftly copes with a middle-aged woman who fights with her inner demons, as she haphazardly tries to play the role of housekeeping and support. When the school finds out that Tim is being bullied, she storms the boy’s trailer, threatening his life: “You can tease, torture, beat, drunk at the wheel, I can forgive you. Hell, I can understand this, I am a good Christian, you know, I can forgive and forget, but you associate with my child, and may God himself come down from heaven to protect you, because while I am alive and I will survive you everyone, I wake up and go to Sleep at night, just dreaming about how to turn your petty, miserable life into hell on earth. comments on the “good trailer" and leaves as quickly as she does. Weaver assesses her ability to combine performance an inner wit, who is acid and witty. And Tim's father, played by Jeff Daniels, is blind to who his son is, treating him like a stranger, not telling his family that he took a day off from the office, spending days on a city park, a sluggish, rugged soul and slept in Matt's bed, tucked into his school jacket. Jeff Daniels does an excellent job of making us believe that he can be a bastard and attractive because we grow up to see that even an incompetent father can show your love to your y son. In the emotional scene, Tim confronts his father. Just when you think that his dad is going to hit him, he grabs him to hug him. Without releasing him, he says to Tim: “I am your father, and you are my son, and I am fine, but you have to talk to me. I do not know how to do it myself. " It is here, at this moment in the film, that the father tells his son, you must tell me what is happening inside you, you must tell me who you are; I want to know who you are. It is in this scene that the film reaches a cathartic moment, a visual movement from Tim, angry and lonely, to his father, embracing him when he breaks down and cries, revealing the emotions hidden under his shell. Tim is experiencing this moment of cleansing his father as a catharsis, especially given the cruel treatment, manipulation, disregard, violence and betrayal that he faced during the long year covered by the film. I recommend this movie.
