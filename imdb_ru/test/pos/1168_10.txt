We usually think of the British as experts in creating great adventures from the imperial era, such as The Four Feathers (1939) and the Zulu, simply because the imperial era was, for the most part, British. Here, in the Wind and the Lion, we see an amazing image of the imperial century of America. <br /> <br /> The American projection of power under Teddy Roosevelt is the backdrop for this traditional story of the abducted maiden, who, despite her nobility, is struck by the rude, courageous nobility of her captor, who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and contempt. (Politically correct addictions, eager to see some minor "native" peoples or cultures, can be sure that the way Arabs and Muslims are depicted here is much more complimentary than how their modern colleagues portray themselves on the modern world stage.) This story has stunning production values ​​- flawless photography, composition and editing - a stunning cast - undervalued Brian Keith, playing hooligan Teddy - and a vibrant story. <br /> <br /> Although Wind and Lion basically tells through the eyes of a son, each family member can identify with one of the characters, be it the noble robber Sean Connery, the furious heroine Candice Bergen, the cunning John Hay John or the fragile, ruthless , ruthless Lt. Steve Kanali "Roosevelt's Big Stick". In the end there is a transcendental scene, when a little boy symbolically sweeps away a dashing Moor on his white horse. This is a high adventure at its best.
