“Who do you dream about? Hoot Gibson ... Hi, Doody? I'm talking about * theater *! "[Harry Crystal] <br /> <br /> Nothing compares to a magnificent stage show ... nothing! And Harry Crystal lives on this conviction. A stage actor, still waiting for his big break, Harry brings the magic of a live theater to a small town and Artie Shoemaker (TOM HULCE) ... a young man who has big dreams (but he just didn’t know about it until he met) Harry). <br /> <br /> Co scenes and songs from many classic musicals of America ... These Lips, These Eyes convey the ups and downs of people who, for 2 hours, They put us in a fabulous country, but who managed to keep this magic in their hearts all day long! <br /> <br /> Like Artie ... as soon as you saw Those Lips, Those Eyes ... "You hooked, baby ! "[Harry Crystal]
