Adam Sandler films are my favorite comedies. The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite horror movie. The Matrix is ​​my favorite science fiction film. “Anywhere but here” is my favorite drama. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most valuable thing in this film is an acting game. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon is awesome. By the end of this film, I felt that I knew her character better than I did. She did a terrific job. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman also did a great job. I recently shot her first film, Leon (1994), in which she played a 12-year-old girl. I believe that it is a contradiction in terms; she was a good child actress. Well, after 5 years, she is still a good actress. In fact, she is much better. <br /> <br /> Sarandon and Portman not only portrayed their characters well, but also worked very well together. I mean, even now I can hardly believe that they are not really a mother and daughter in real life, but also in this film. <br /> <br /> This film tells about a 14-year-old girl (Portman) and her restless girl. mother (Sarandon), who leaves her hometown in Wisconsin for Beverly Hills. <br /> <br /> At first, Portman hates her mother for taking her away from her cousin and friends, and they start a very hectic relationship that grows over a couple of years (usually I would add). <br /> <br /> Although this explanation is a bit vague, the plot can only be summarized vaguely. But when you see this movie, you will see that the plot is actually not so vague or weak, because in fact it is very deep. I say that the plot is outlined weakly, but then they focus on it to make it strong. <br /> <br /> And he is very strong, but the sequence of the plot is gorgeous. And there are some brilliant scenes that I hope will someday be considered "classic." <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. I was laughing. I cried. And although, admittedly, there are a few loopholes, this is still a stellar film, and it does come together at the end.
