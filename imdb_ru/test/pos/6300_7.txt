The film is really well shot, great, looks and passionately directed. You can say that every shot is thought out and executed to perfection. For movie lovers, this is a particularly good watch, and they should be able to appreciate their beauty and passion for the movie that goes into it. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to put this film under one label. Actually, this is not a drama, this is not a thriller or a comedy. Instead, it’s more like a film with its own style, which does everything in its own way. He does not necessarily follow the rules of cinema and combines many different elements from different genres. <br /> <br /> But, like his main character, the film becomes slow and boring. The artistic style of directing tries to hide that the story is actually quite simple, and it’s more like the film relied solely on its style and the overall atmosphere created by the film. This does not make the film terrible or something like that, but simply prevents it from being truly absolute, obligatory for viewing. Part of the film also feels that he is trying to be too poetic and is trying to let the images speak too much for himself. It just seems a bit exaggerated in some parts, although it still works great for most of the film. <br /> <br /> It has excellent cinematography and a unique narration, which makes it an original and excellent movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
