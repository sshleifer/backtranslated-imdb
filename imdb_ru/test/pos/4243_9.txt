Chucky's bride begins late at night when officer Bob Bailey (Vince Corazza) sneaks into the room for testimony at his police station, and among all the horror films in jokes, he steals the remains of Chucky's doll, which serial killer Charles Lee Ray owned in the distant past in the original children's the game (1988). He takes the remains to an isolated area where former friend Ray Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) cuts Bailey's throat and takes the rest back to her trailer. There, Tiffany stitches together and fastens Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) together again, and using Voodoo for Dummies returns him to a life of death. Everything goes wrong, as Tiffany hoped, and Chucky, in the end, is not the man of her dreams, so she locks him in the game pen, on which Chucky is not completely happy. While Tiffany takes a bath, Chuckie runs away, kills her with an electric shock, and this book brings her back to life in the form of a female doll dressed as a bride. None of them want to be stuck in plastic bodies and must work together to get to the cemetery in New Jersey, where Ray’s natural body was buried with the amulet necessary to bring their spirits back to human bodies. The bodies of neighbor Tiffany Jessie (Nick Stebyle) and his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl), who are both on the run from the corrupt Uncle Jade, police chief Warren Kinkade (John Ritter), will do an excellent job ... <br /> <br /> Director Ronnie Y. I love Bride Chucky. The screenplay of Don Mancini is very funny, very fast moving, very interesting and with great love mentions many other horror films. From the introductory part, where we see Jason Voorhees' hockey mask from the fifteenth film, Freddy Krueger's razor blade glove from the Nightmare on Elm Street series and the Michael Myers mask from the Halloween franchise. For the clips used in The Bride of Frankenstein (1935), when he practically recreates the same scene. Bride of Chucky never takes herself seriously, which is also good, there are a lot of similar liners, self-referential jokes that Scream (1996) made fashionable several years earlier, and she is not afraid to make fun of herself and the horror genre. generally. I like the scene when Jesse and Jade get into a ridiculous romantic conversation that Chuckie hears, and he makes funny derogatory comments and gestures everywhere. This does not mean that there is not a damn good film, because it certainly is. Director Yu manages to create a good atmosphere and a real sense of fun, both human and plastic character sets are cute and radiant, as each couple experiences their own family problems, which will obviously cause traces of the corpses they left. From a technical point of view, Bride of Chucky is for the most part gorgeous, and she has a big budget, and I hope it will be about $ 25,000,000. The only thing I’ll say is that some of Kevin Yager’s puppet effects are a bit hard and unconvincing, I can’t recall any BGI of Chucky CGI scenes. Fortunately, the film does not neglect blood and blood with a slit throat, nails hit someone in the face, presumably because of the respect of HellRaiser (1987), people were pierced by shards of glass, someone was bloody destroyed by a huge truck , cut off the lip piercing and various knife wounds and shots. The acting is pretty good, and Dourif, like Chucky, is very funny when he spews one airliner. I also like the scenes with Tiffany at the beginning and I find her very sexy, when she wears all these fetish things, I can't be the only one, of course? I personally think that Bride of Chucky is a fantastic film, full of entertainment from beginning to end, great humor and horror in equal measure, and in just 85 minutes it never gets boring or boring. My personal favorite, look as soon as you can!
