This is the ultimate, and I mean ULTIMATE, ADVENTURE CLASSIC! The plot is between good and evil. There have always been a lot of films that depict gray areas, and not enough about the basic good against evil to explain the real cases of good versus evil in the real world. Only recently, the filmmakers tried to even the odds. In real life, more than half of the situations are black and white, but only some of the films demonstrate this. This film is the best example of looking back and white. This is best seen in black and white. The hero is in the worst position. He is in the territory of a man who wants to kill him, and among various enemies. The film gives the feeling that he is hopelessly in the minority and can not count on help. His enemy (graph) has numerous resources. The wife of the count was forced to marry him, and from his past history she knows that sooner or later he will kill her, like all of his wives. She and the hero become allies and fall in love with each other, which can win anyone who looks (unless this person wants to be the opposite guy). Anyone who helps them is killed. They have no way out. The situation is hopeless. So will they survive the end? You will not guess if you have not read spoilers. The film also has a lot of great atmosphere, adventure and intrigue, along with Lon Cheney as the bad guy and Boris Karloff in his best role in history, as a decent guy. Usually the role of the bad guy Karloff was at his best when he was offered more complex roles like this one. Cheney was rarely given complex roles, although he showed his stuff in several films, such as Mice and Men. This is a little more than a cameo for him. However, the tension never stops. Everywhere danger and danger. Perfectly written, perfectly matched and well directed. This is what the film should be - pure escape, pure adventure.
