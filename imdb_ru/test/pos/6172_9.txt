I have been a faithful visitor to IMDB for several years. This is the film that finally made me write a review. <br /> <br /> I caught this film by accident (when I turned on the TV one morning, I read the opening credits). I really liked the film for many reasons, all of which were well covered by other reviewers - capriciousness, forgotten history of Czech pilots, subtle charm of supporting characters, fatalism of the main characters and the first type of person during the battle scenes. <br /> <br /> But the dark element of the “Dark Blue World” was the lack of dramatic effects, especially during a fight (which is good!). While the pilots flew in battle, they were not accompanied by any musical accompaniment, no manipulative shots of agitated spouses / girlfriends were intertwined, each small air maneuver did not cause banal patriotic greetings, and the audience was not asked to swallow James Bond-esque’s incredible heroic game . Instead, viewers are allowed to feel the longing, fear and isolation of these single fighter pilots while they try to stay in the air during the battle. When the comrades were shot, we avoided tears and a typical (but pleasant audience) heroics based on revenge. Instead, the other pilots with sadness and silence are watching the fate of their fellow pilot — in fact, they still need to focus on their own safety and goals at this very moment. We only briefly feel the breath of the pilot and the background roar of the engines, when we, the spectators, see a friend quietly spiraling down to his death. And then immediately "we" need to return to combat mode and focus on survival. <br /> <br /> Too often in Hollywood we are fed with a spoonful of emotions that we should feel, and there is no place for us. viewer's imagination. The Dark Blue World is a rarity that captivates and engages the viewer, which allows us to invest in the film and fill in the gaps and spaces using our own thoughts and feelings. <br /> <br /> Great movie worth watching
