I was delighted that Dick Tracy, the terrible movie with terrible makeup, received the best award from the Academy of Make-Up. Nightbreed (based on the lead title “Cabal”) looks amazing, the acting is gorgeous, and David Hroneburg turns into a really creepy and terrific antagonist. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on Aaron Bune, who constantly repeats nightmares about a society of monsters living under a graveyard. Does he invent it or are they real and call him? His Psychologist (Hronburg) convinces him that he is a murderer, a killer of families. <br /> <br /> Anxious and suicidal, Boone seeks refuge in Midian, but the monsters do not want him at first. He is also tracked by his girlfriend Laurie, who refuses to give him up even after he dies and returns cold and monstrous. <br /> <br /> But Decker is not going to allow Boone to continue. He raises the locals to a general attack on Midian, like a holy war in the name of the gods led by the devil. <br /> <br /> The themes of misunderstood monsters may be caused by his homosexual man experience, but they are always strong and honest. Nightbreed turns the genre upside down. Monsters are just trying to survive and want to be left alone, but man hunts for them. <br /> <br /> Barker cut more than 20 minutes more, but the studio turned it into this split masterpiece. Barker is working hard, trying to find the missing shots for the director's release. Until then, this version will have to do.
