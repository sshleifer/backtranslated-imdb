After injuring a backward boy of fifteen-year-old restless and pessimistic, Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is sent to a juvenile prison. His teacher and aspiring writer Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle) approaches and tries to understand him, first with the intention of writing a book and then becoming his friend. Leland slowly reveals his sad vision of the world, showing that he is a sociopath. <br /> <br /> “United States of Leland” is a depressive and interesting character study. The low tempo of the exciting scenario reveals fragments of the story like a puzzle; there are great lines and dialogs; the performances are excellent, although 23-year-old Ryan Gosling does not convince as a 15-year-old; but it seems that there is not enough part to complete the riddle and make United States of Leland an unforgettable film. The disappointing explanation of the “why” of Leland’s violent actions against Ryan Pollard is neither convincing nor touching, it really shows that this character is a completely insane sociopath with a strange and sick vision of the world. Besides, the way Allen Harris gets the Pearl knife is ridiculous. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “About Mundo de Leland” (“The World of Leland”)
