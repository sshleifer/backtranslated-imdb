I really liked this movie. I'm a big fan of Amanda Bynes' recently-ended show. I admire her (besides her body) for her acting skills. She is a good actress. <br /> <br /> The movie was great. We are talking about a girl named Viola, who wants to play football, but when her school leaves the women's football team, she gets upset. Her brother is going to go to a prestigious school, and he decides to go to England. Therefore, Viola wants to make an impression by playing in a football team at a boarding school. She goes to school and tries the football team. She enters. Meanwhile, she meets the Duke, who is a sensitive guy who plays in a football team. He really likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey), who loves Sebastian, who is really viola. Sebastian meets with Monica and suspects that Sebastian is not himself. <br /> <br /> This, of course, is NOT a parody, and I really liked it. It is so funny and cute. I don't think I saw how AManda works better.
