I finally got a DVD of this 1997 HBO movie, I can watch it. By the time I finished, the old thought “those who cannot learn from the past are doomed to survive it,” echoed already. First shown four years after the first bombing of the twin towers (and four years before the events of September 11), the Path to Heaven reveals a series of close encounters, blunders and official decisions that led to the first bombardment of twin towers and the lessons we should have learned from them. <br /> <br /> “The Way to Paradise” includes great actors. Peter Gallagher and Marcia Gay Harden lead the cast as FBI agents John Antitsev and Nancy Floyd, who face not only threats of terrorism, but also lack of official interest from their superiors, along with their colleague from the New York police Lou Napoli (Paul Gilfoil). Art Malik, Andreas Katsulas, Sean Toub and Tony Gillan are among those who plan and launch the attack, and they all play their roles not as potential clichés, but as real living people and make the film better for it. Particular mention should be made of Ned Eisenberg in the role of Emad Salem, a man who, if not skeptical FBI officials, could potentially report on the plot. <br /> <br /> The film is also well shot. Despite the fact that this film was made for cable, it is not at all like a low-budget film with its production values, especially in its film sets and places in New York. Exciting film cinematography gives the film an almost documentary style from time to time. When all these elements are combined with the script, all this helps to give the film a sense of reality, which makes the events even more alarming. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing thing in the film is the script. The events of the film are true (with the exception of some dramatic license that is always necessary), and in retrospect they become even more shocking than they should have been when the film was first shown twelve years ago. The film tells how a group of people managed to transport a bomb to the World Trade Center. They did this because of the lack of Arab translators, government agencies unable to transfer information to each other, the FBI ignoring the source’s instructions and the police departments are unable to find evidence. Worse, the inability of investigators to connect the dots is due to the fact that many of these things not only allowed attacks of 9.11, but in some cases (for example, the lack of translators) - problems that continue even today. Even more frightening is the ending, which really happened and looks too prophetic today. <br /> <br /> “The Way to Paradise” is a film worth seeing today. The film is not only well shot and shot, but also teaches us a lesson that we should have learned before. Movie lesson That those who cannot learn from the past are doomed to experience it. If you can find this movie, watch it and learn from it.
