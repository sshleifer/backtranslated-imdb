I think this is a brilliant show with cool talking heads and very cool action. 2 guys who pretend to be masters of female seduction demonstrate their skills in different night clubs, and 4 experts (pick-up artists themselves) comment on them, choosing the winner. Their jokes are fun, and some participants are really fun to watch. Moreover, this show does teach men how to connect with women, many expert comments are helpful, while you can see how this works on the ground. In fact, I think this is one of the best TV shows, and I fully recommend it to all men who love women. <br /> <br /> ps / sorry for my broken english.
