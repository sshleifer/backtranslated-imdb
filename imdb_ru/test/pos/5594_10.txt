Clap! and we all thought that Joan Crawford was a terrible mom, dear ... well, Laura Hope Cruise as a mom in this burning four-character film delivers (and cops) goods to this cracker of the married man Mang ..... SILVER CORD a truly sensational drama in the pre-code format from RKO, made in 1932, released in 1933 from a 1929 performance. So amazingly, frankly and honestly, each striking verbal exchange between the wife of one son (IreneDunne) and the other's fiancé as these two younger girls go to war together - joyfully angrily unwinding the mother’s obviously incestuous attraction to her wild eldest son, played by viruel Joel McCrea and her youngest son, who was paid by the gentle and beautiful 25-year-old actor Eric Linden. I think that this film was shown to many roaring grateful spectators in huge theaters in 1933 and offers the audience even in 2005 a very fruity melodrama, animated by a crackling dialogue, which is not afraid to call Mother exactly what it is. This film would have been impossible to do after the censorship code appeared after 1934. Other comments from the audience about IMDb support my reaction, and you will find almost everyone who is lucky enough to see (and tape) a SILVER CORD, who agrees that this is an unforgettable and sharp script in a beautifully made film. He would have played like a 1932 VIRGIN WOLF. Laura Hope Cruise must have kissed the sound scene in RKO for this role for the rest of her life ... even more than her fluffy move in GWTW. Irene Dunn is as gorgeous, laid-back and believable, as before, again fighting for her husband, and it’s worth seeing how Divorcée, made in 1929, is an addition to SILVER CORD. Joel MacRae is definitely in the same league with Cary Grant and Randolph Scott in beautiful and attractive shares. I had never before seen Eric Linden in a real acting role (he played an amputee on a horror scene at a hospital in GWTW), and here he is stunning and young, with an excellent role of Robert, the younger and more sensitive son. Some verbal notches imposed on him again, will not go through the office of the Code, if it is done later. This is a really good film, and if the viewer forgives some of the creakiness of his time and arranges a sparring match with an unrivaled sharpness for a 1932 film, you will be well rewarded. At first I thought that Mother’s melodrama, which squeezed my throat, was dated until I realized that it was a set of excellent script to make the viewer laugh at her, as if she was a weak little old woman ...... NO. .... but two other women from this influential home do not play movies, hence the fantastic dialogue in return. The ocean liner, which can be seen in the first video, is LEVIATAN, a monstrous ship that the US won from the Germans in World War I, which was so huge and cumbersome that the crews were nervous wrecks trying to fight on the Atlantic. He is notorious for the fact that in a storm he plowed his head with a colossal wave and shot at the ridge at such an angle that the spine cracked along the bottom and the ship split vertically between the craters. He limped into the port with rattling steel panels and glimmering holes for rivets ... and a mentally broken crew and passengers. He was flooded in 1935 after the curse and pursued terrible mechanical problems all his existence. Not such a military prize after all. <br /> <br /> In any case, a dialogue in a SILVER CORD is enough for one night’s excitement: for example: “Mom! The doctor said that you are okay, in fact, he said that it would take dynamite to kill you. "Whammo!
