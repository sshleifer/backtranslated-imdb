I love the television competition. I hate to see this end. There are so many talented participants. It's a shame that only 2 will be selected. I also love to watch the judges. Sometimes they are just as interesting as the participants. I faithfully watch the show every Sunday morning. Would not miss it for the world. This is the best reality show that has ever been on television. Good luck to all the contestants, although I have already chosen two who I would like to see in the role of Danny and Sandy on Broadway. I want to see if my decisions are correct. I donâ€™t know how long the contest will last until Danny and Sandy are chosen, but I will continue to look through.
