I have to admit that thanks to this film Iâ€™m now afraid of mannequins. hahaha <br /> <br /> but yes, first of all, the acting in this film, at least by my standards, is pretty cool. most of the actors are pretty decent in their roles. The script also seems to be pretty good, of course, there are some crappy things, but there are also some decently written characters and some damn scary scenes. I'm still trembling, thinking about this one scene with the dude and the mannequins. Brrr. <br /> <br /> Yes, I will say that you should watch this film, it is very good and very interesting. good watch 8/10
