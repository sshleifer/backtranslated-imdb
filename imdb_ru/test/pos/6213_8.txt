Let's get it out of the way, so those checking this page looking for information about everything related to the word “breasts” (and you know who you are, Googlers) can navigate through: this is in no way pornographic. On the contrary, if it has some value as material for masturbation, then, frankly, the director did not do a good job, since the goal is to keep it on the subject and on the experience of women and their bodies, as well as on ideas yourself and society and health and so on. Indeed, I would be a little cautious with someone who came across this on DVD or, if he ever will play again, late at night on HBO or Cinemax and used it as a means for pleasure. With the same success you can go to the supermarket, take a couple of ripe melons, take them home and squeeze, and, well, you understand. <br /> <br /> No, this is a semi-serious movie. The creation is intended to be viewed late at night, but this should not be only for night types. It is intimate in tuning, but not in tone. All women, in all their various forms and sizes, races and even with one man inserted with a fake breast, have something of value from life experience in the simplest way. If I say half serious, it’s because of a few small segments that, according to the director, she needs to add, with archival footage of old practical videos about puberty and sex, breast and super-rare cartoons with flying hammers. about. This is not a problem, but an asset: we need several small visual paths to walk between these interviews. <br /> <br /> Nothing is held back, and we see it as feminism in a liberating form: they don’t need to hide behind, and even if they decide not to take off their tops, shirts and bras, they are still open, as this can be natural part of their body, which is the object of sex, surprise, comfort, discomfort, curiosity, motherhood and, unfortunately, cancer. In this last part, another bold step has been taken when we see a woman who has experienced cancer with only one breast. You know that you became an adult and an adult when you can see this woman who somehow lived a half-normal life with one breast (the most bitter-sweet moment is when she says that if a good fairy said that she had there may be one desire to have two full breasts, she would have to think about it), and you do not giggle and do not say "fu, gross." This is a test guys. <br /> <br /> It was not shot under the best of circumstances, but again for television it was edited at a hard pace. For a moment, it is never boring, and we never feel that someone is holding back, especially when a man can hear the harsh truth that the chest is not really erogenous, or that the flat chest is very attractive to some men. Chest: A documentary about the destruction of myths with real faces and breasts, as well as open minds and hearts. If it’s worthy of the “I Was Alone” session, then, I suppose, there is more strength for you, although this is not the intention.
