A big fat liar is what you get when you combine a terrific composition, a great production and an emphasis on smart ideas compared to a teenager. Two stars work beautifully together, and - what can I say? Amanda Bynes shines. The Irkel room and Lee Major in the film were brilliant touches. Watch this movie with your kids. If you are not laughing at all this, you must not have paid attention.
