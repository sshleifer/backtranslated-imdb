HOUSE CALLS is a funny 1978 comedy about a widowed doctor (Walter Mattau), who now wants to play on the field, but cannot but be attached to his patient (Glenda Jackson), who refuses to be just another mark on the bedpost. Mattau likes a woman, but he really does not want to make a commitment on which she insists, so he agrees to meet with her only for two weeks and then decide whether he wants to commit; however, other complications make it difficult for Mattau to make a decision after two weeks, although he is clearly in love with a woman. Mattau and Jackson have amazingly effective chemistry as a screen pair and get powerful support from Richard Benjamin, Candace Azzara, Dick O'Neal, and especially from Art Kearney as the inept and senior chief of staff at Mattau's hospital. Mattau even has a brief scene with his real son, Charlie, who appears as the son of Jackson. This fascinating comedy still keeps well after all these years. If you have never seen it, it is worth renting.
