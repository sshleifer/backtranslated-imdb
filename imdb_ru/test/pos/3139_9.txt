Wagon Master is a very unique film among the works of John Ford. Mainly because it is the only thing that is based on a story written by John Ford himself, a story that was developed by Frank Nugent and the director's son ?? Patrick Ford and turned into a script, and because of the personal opinion of the director, Wagon Master is a film that John Ford called the one that “came closest to what I wanted to achieve,” so to say, not to say a little. But, Once Ford confessed to Lindsay Anderson, his favorite, though, was “My Dear Clementine,” and not any other. <br /> <br /> The Master of Wagons has all the ingredients that could be found in the movie of John Ford. Wonderful cast, showing his best, you do not show the main stars, except fordiana itself of all the actors ?? Ben Johnson Very unusual little characters that provide an obligatory comic relief, and the Wagon Master has quite a few characters like Sister Ledyard (Jane Darwell) who blows a horn, but is very inspiring. And last but not least, Monument Valley with John Ford’s fifth passage after Stagecoach, My Dear Clementine, Fort Apache and She wore a Yellow Ribbon. <br /> <br /> The film begins with two cowboy friends Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and Sandy Owens (Harry Cary Jr.) hired as Lords of Carriages or guides for a caravan of Mormon settlers heading to Silver Valley, a place for them as promised land. On the way, they are joined by a very peculiar Dr. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) with two beautiful women who are supposedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors. They are moving in the same direction simply because they were recently expelled from the nearest town, and they have nowhere else to go. Nothing particularly unpleasant will happen until they face Cleggs, a dangerous family gang consisting of a father and his three sons, who are on the run from the city marshal, where they recently murdered and robbed a bank. <br /> <br /> In general, the Wagon Master is nothing more than another precious pearl in the necklace of the wonderful westerns of John Ford. Must see. 9/10 <br /> <br />
