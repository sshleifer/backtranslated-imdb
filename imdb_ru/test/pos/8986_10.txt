I caught it several times on TV in the late 1970s. He played only late at night (after midnight). <br /> <br /> Peter Lorre plays a kind, happy man whose face is disfigured by fire. He was rejected by his girlfriend, and he was left alone and full of despair. It turns into a criminal life and as a result becomes very successful. He makes a mask to hide his disfigured features, and falls in love with a beautiful girl (Evelyn Case) ... which is blind! He is trying to go straight to her ... but he cannot escape his criminal life or his hatred of his own wounded person. <br /> <br /> A film without a budget B. Very short (running a little over an hour), but well-made and superbly acting Lorre. It has much more depth than you expect from a quick picture. B. Ankers especially takes the ungrateful role of a “girl” and makes her character fresh and attractive. Unfortunately, this disappeared from television and was never recorded on video or DVD (as far as I know). TCM did show it recently, and it was great to see that the film still holds. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
