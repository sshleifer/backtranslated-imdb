This is not a bad TV movie. “Penal Battalion” is short for Penal Battalion, which means “penal battalion”. Such battalions were formed due to the growing demand for soldiers, since the Soviet Union suffered heavy losses throughout the war. These battalions consisted of convicted and dishonest soldiers who were given the opportunity to clear their names by proving themselves in battle. They were looked down upon as filth, and it was easy to spend them during the battle without much regret or great honor on the part of the military. They were often sent to suicide missions and suffered huge losses. Those who refused to fight were executed on the spot. Needless to say, their life sucks. <br /> <br /> There were some very good performances by actors, especially Yuri Stepanov, who played Antip, Alexander Bashirov, who played Stier, and Roman Madjanov, who played major Kharchenko. However, the series is not so delaying, partly because it is too long, it could be much shorter and more efficient. <br /> <br /> Although this is a war, the Fine Battalion has very slight violence and almost no gore. It depends only on the actors to make it work, and in the end, this is a television series, so the producers did not want to scare the audience and sponsors. <br /> <br /> Shtrafbat explores the cruelty of the Soviet regime and explains why so many people decided to fight the Nazis rather than join them. Personally, I would prefer to be a fascist than a communist, given the circumstances presented in the film. One character explains that the Soviets dismantled his farm and his family died of starvation. Because of anger, he burned him, and he was arrested for destroying the property of a collective farm, and he ended up in the criminal battalion as a criminal. Antipas recalled how his mother killed her youngest son to feed the whole family. Both men explained that they were fighting for their homeland, and not for the Soviets. <br /> <br /> In one of the battalions there was one marine (marines) who raped a girl, killing his comrade in the process, threatened him with another. A comrade kept his mouth shut about all the ordeals, and then pretended to be injured when it came to battle. In addition to all this, the girl committed suicide because of shame. I believe that if a sufficient number of marines saw this film, they would raise banners on the streets and revolt calling for a boycott or an official apology of the producers. <br /> <br /> At least, I would recommend it to anyone who is at least a little interested in the former Soviet Union or the Second World War. I don't think I wasted 500+ minutes of my life.
