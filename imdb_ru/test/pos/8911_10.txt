First, the alien rescues a little black boy, as well as a Mexican, despite the fact that he offers a brief summary of the IMDb plot. This film is the epitome of the purest male fantasies, interracial rape. The main character in this film is the drug of George Michaleska, who does not understand primitive human motives, such as drug abuse and murder. In fact, every time he uses violence to solve a problem, he has an internal conflict that physically hinders him. What a square. In any case, my favorite scene is when he writes a letter to gang members, saying if they want the 500 bucks they receive at the Reading Center for the protection they need to meet with him. At the meeting, he is surrounded by countless Chikans' gangsters, but he is cool. In slow motion, he clicks on a wooden post a stop sign that breaks upon contact. Then, still in slow motion, points to the gang leader and says: “Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!” The gang members obey. Cool, right? The beauty of this film is revealed in these simple solutions to social problems such as prostitution and gang violence.
