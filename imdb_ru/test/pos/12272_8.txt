This film is good, but not the best Shaffner. My favorite films are Papillon and Patton, but this is a sad and very good film. Chris Kristoffersen is good at this film and really does matter. I will miss Shaffner, and this is his last film. <br /> <br /> A great film by a wonderful director! 7.5 / 10
