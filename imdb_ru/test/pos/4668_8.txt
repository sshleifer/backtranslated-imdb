Especially after watching THE MATRIX RELOADED !! * SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> After watching the Matrix with all its ridiculous fantastic imaginary robotic characters with their superpowers, it was very nice to see an action movie with real people in situations involving real risk! I took care of these people, and although some of the stunts seemed a bit strong, I still had the feeling of “maybe” poems “what a stupid video game” (for example, “The Matrix”) <br /> <br /> This film is not an operation on brain, it is very straightforward. Some things are predictable, for example, knowing that someone will become a back-knife, and someone will die early. Pretty obvious, but SO WHAT? The first 15 minutes determine our cause, our motive, our main goal. I like the fact that Theron and Walberg did not have scenes with disassembly. I'm glad they didn't go there. They kept it about a funny dialogue ESPECIALLY SETH GREEN. This guy is funny! <br /> <br /> This is a movie that I would buy when it is released on DVD. It is fun, fast and interesting. The only thing (and I think this is very important) is that we really cheer on the bad guys. This group of protagonists is already on the wrong side of the law. The bad message for kids is parents, please explain this to them. <br /> <br />
