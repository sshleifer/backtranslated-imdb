"The Great Dictator" - an unsurpassed film. Charlie Chaplin succeeds in being very funny and witty, and at the same time makes a strong statement against fascism in his satire. Chaplinâ€™s anti-Nazi speech at the end, with its values, is one of the great moments of cinema. Throughout this film, I felt that there was some higher form of intelligence at work, besides truly intelligent filmmaking.
