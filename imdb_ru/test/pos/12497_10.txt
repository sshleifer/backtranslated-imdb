Watching this show makes me respect MTV, although I imagine that MTV views this random, sharp material as its main selling point and cares less about the relevant truths that it expresses. <br /> <br /> I write and play music for life, and this show makes me very emotional. For me, Wondsershowzen performs a completely different function from most televisions. Instead of dulling or distracting feelings (which is sometimes very nice), it awakens my spirit of good and evil. It makes me very uncomfortable, but in a very comforting way. <br /> <br /> I do not think that many viewers perceive most of the content of this show, but if they do, then thank the viewers everywhere.
