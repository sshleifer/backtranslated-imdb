"The Girl from the Valley" marked the beginning of the career of Nicolas Cage and became the version of "Romeo and Juliet" of the 80s. This is a specific example of a classic 80s teenager. Nicholas Cage, Deborah Foreman and Elizabeth Daley all have brilliant images in this film, but he will never surpass “Fast Times on Ridgemont High” as the final film about the teens of the 80s, because if not for “Fast Times”, then The generation of the 80s from the teen cinema will be just a big blow to the head. That's for sure.
