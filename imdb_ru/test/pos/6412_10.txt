This film, one of the best I've ever seen, talks about uncommunicity. This plunges us into a wild Taipei, painted in cold tones, where it constantly rains; DAMP world. This shows us the story of two people living in this world, a man and a woman. coincidence, or fate, links their existence, but they are not able to open one to the other through words. Characters are a mirror of the difficulties of our society in relation to interpersonal relationships. Inexpressibility, which is brought to the extreme. all the characters exchange only a few words during the film, the dialogues are almost absent, and when some words are spoken, they are often weak and empty, far from describing people's real feelings. Thus, the development of the story, the disclosure of the character's feelings develops (a brilliant idea!) Musical retreats, only seemingly meaningless, that speckle the film. The continuation of the sentimental event and the drama of the womanâ€™s protagonist lead us to a magnificent finale, largely symbolic. The film is completely different from the usual, smart implementation of a talented director. Ps. Forgive me for my bad grammar !!
