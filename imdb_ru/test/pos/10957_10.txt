It should be noted that this film was not "improvised" (as you probably think about it), despite the fact that the title suggests at the end. The film was carefully crafted and rehearsed - Cassavetes did not have enough money to cover the inevitably high production costs of an "improvisational" film, even if he wanted to create such a thing. "Improvisation" of the film is contained in the actor's performances and emotions, which they draw from the lines. <br /> <br /> However, let me say that this is a terrific job, which Iâ€™m sure will be back again and again. The depth of emotion that Cassavetes is able to extract from the smallest gestures and interactions is incredible. I have no idea how he could direct such amazing performances from the actors, especially in the conditions in which he worked. This is a really great film attraction that I would recommend to anyone interested in exploring outside of Hollywood.
