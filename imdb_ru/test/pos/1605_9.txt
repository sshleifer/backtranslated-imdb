From the first to the last scene of the film, director Visconti succeeds in his art in the sense that the film is guaranteed to remain a cultural treasure, because only God knows how long. This perfection is like a film, that is, but this story has some minor flaws. <br /> <br /> The novel by Thomas Mann is also an ideal work of art, therefore, of course, it cannot be transferred to other media. Visconti pretty much follows this story, and only when he allows himself to deviate a little, this transition is interrupted. And no matter how beautiful the landscapes are, the tension in the air between the characters, hundreds of subtle signals and allegories, the almost unbearably heightened flow of Mahler's music - yet, minor anomalies in the plot bother me. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just a victim of a personâ€™s aspiration for perfection. Nevertheless, I will give one example, which I consider extremely important. <br /> <br /> WARNING: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In the history of Mann, Ashenbach eats strawberries, which probably contain a disease that will kill him. after giving up on his disappointed chase for the boy Tadzio in Venice. Unable to catch one pleasure, he agrees to another - which poisons him. This is very subtle in the book, but it is. Forbidden fruit, a kind, but rather a sign that he refuses life itself. <br /> <br /> In the Visconti film, he also eats strawberries, but in a rather minor scene on the beach. The pursuit of Venice ends in a much more melodramatic way. He also works, but he lacks some subtlety, as well as multi-layered symbolism, which gives food for thought. <br /> <br /> But this is all forgiven when the film allows us to enjoy beautiful landscapes, faces and constellations, and, of course, as many other characters as we can digest - Tadzio's last gesture, standing in water, is as sublime and the mysterious finale.
