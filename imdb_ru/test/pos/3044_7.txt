Pat Conroy's autobiographical book “Water is Wide” turned out to be something like a southern “up-and-down ladder”, but despite the “teacher goes against the odds” formula, “Konrak” really moves the audience with each small breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated black children on an island near South Carolina) are really shown training, and their collective innocence with wide eyes is surprisingly sweet. The only real actress in the group (Tina Andrews, a terrific performer) plays “hard nut”, which should break open Konrak, and as soon as she gets under his spell, everything seems to be a breeze. But the story is not ready for a happy ending, and I was not prepared for the quiet simplicity of the finale. It is beautifully made. From time to time, the script deviates from the course, but director Martin Ritt is very smart to always return to the solid presence of John Voight. Scenes such as the one where he drives around in his van, expressing his disappointment about the loudspeaker, mean little, but the whole movie is filled with episodes that evoke emotions, and the actual ending is their winning. ** 1/2 of ****
