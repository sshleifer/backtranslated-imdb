Rich businessman Bill Compton (played by Dennis Patrick) accidentally kills his hippie daughter's boyfriend after an argument. In a panic, he retreats to the bar and meets Joe Curran (played by Peter Boyle): loud, angry, fanatical, who bitterly looks at how his beloved country has become. Bill inadvertently lets Joe know that he just killed a hippie. And this is just the beginning. "Joe" is a classic movie of an unlikely friendship. Communication between the two men, one against the background of white-collar workers, the other against the background of blue-collar workers. Bill and Joe have one thing in common: they are disgraced by how insane the world has become. Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle gave very realistic images of their characters. Director John G. Avidsen with this “preliminary Rocky” work directs this low-budget gem with the same sophistication as the film with a budget of $ 100 million. The script is loaded with excellent character development and a very fast, realistic dialogue. Despite its strengths, this film has its drawbacks. The script falls asleep about 3/4 of the way, but it wakes up just in time when the sharp climax comes. This film also features a very early and boring performance by 24-year-old Susan Sarandon as Bill Melissa’s daughter, along with her hippie boyfriend Frank, whom Patrick Mac Dermott has very nicely portrayed. One can only be thankful that he was killed at the beginning of the film. Despite some flaws, this is one of those forgotten 70s films that should not be. Although “Joe” is very outdated by today's standards, the chemistry between Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle is completely relevant today, and this is the glue that holds the entire film together.
