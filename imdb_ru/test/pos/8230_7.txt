I'm a fan of Randolph Scott Westerns. Although some of them are surprisingly cliche (like most of the westerns of this era), its easy delivery and style really elevate films to a classic and almost classic status. While this film shows another example of how Western heroes in real life are exploited after their death in Hollywood (in this case, Bat Masterson), the film works well thanks to him, as well as to the great characters supporting him. One of them is always a strong game of Robert Ryan - a great actor who, unfortunately, is almost forgotten today. The other is the ubiquitous Gabby Hayes, who plays one of his best roles as a sharp and very colorful deputy. Here he is more agreeable than in his many supporting roles for Roy Rogers and John Wayne, mainly because his role is better written and he has more to do. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty much a half plot. westerns ever did. There are some villains who hire a bunch of thugs to run after the locals, and a good man (Scott) to restore peace and kill the villains. However, the way the plot is made is much better than the average, and because of this the film is still watchable entertainment. Just do not expect a lot of innovation or uniqueness - unless you want to see what could be the best result of Gabby Hayes.
