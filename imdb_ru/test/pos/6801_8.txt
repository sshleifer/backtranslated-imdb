National Velvet tells the story of Velvet Brown, a young English girl who dreams of presenting her favorite horse at competitions in the prestigious Grand Prix races. The film tells about her when she trains her horse with the help of a former jockey and with the support of her parents. <br /> <br /> Although National Velvet is a family film, this fact should not scare anyone who usually watches it. such films with a sneer. This is really a film that will appeal to the whole family, not just young people. She even managed to get five Oscar nominations, which is hardly a sign of weakening for a wide audience. <br /> <br /> Ann Revere, in the role of Velvet's mother, actually won an Oscar for her performance. She was really excellent in this role, but this is 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor, who steals the show. She has a charming presence and shows talent beyond her age. Also on board are Oscar-winning Donald Crisp in the role of Velvet's father, Mickey Rooney in the role of former jockey Mi Taylor and Angela Lansbury (in one of her earliest roles in the film) in the role of older sister Velvet. <br /> <br /> Technicolor's brilliant film for eye-catching viewing, while editing provided the second of two film Oscars. In addition, the film was nominated for directing (Clarence Brown), cinematography and artistic direction. It is worth mentioning the score of a tenfold Oscar nominee for Herbert Stotaart, although he was left without a nomination. <br /> <br /> In general, National Velvet is a wonderful family film that deserves a higher mark. I understand that the prospect of watching a movie about a girl and her horse does not quite impress some people, but this one is worth the risk.
