This is a heavy film that can be found in the US, but if you can find it - and you are interested in the life and music of Percy Aldridge Granger, you will enjoy it. It is quite historically accurate. Richard Roxborough's Granger looks amazing like Granger during this time period. Karen Holten from Emily Woof is a bit prettier than the real Karen, but it was an inaccuracy that I happily discovered (!). I think it really struck me how well Roxborough captured Granger’s outrageous personality. Barbara Hershey's rose was also a treasure. If she looks much younger than Rose in that period, it more than makes up for how well she captured Rose Percy’s obsession. This film is easy to recommend. (I have to say that when she saw Passion, my wife did not have a special attachment to Granger and his music, but she was completely fascinated by the film.
