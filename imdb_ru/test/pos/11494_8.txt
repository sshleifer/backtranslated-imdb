I loved this movie! He has a beautiful heart and excellent bones. I stumbled upon it by chance, and I had no memories, not even the slightest hint of this movie from promo, reviews or word of mouth. I remember reading a journalist many years ago who commented on the value of watching movies without defiling them with prejudice of reviews or false advertising of commercials. And this seems to be the most common source of critical criticism of the film: it did not live up to the expectations that it would be a comedy, a part of life, or a character. I had no expectations about the film, and therefore it was comedic - but I only laughed once or twice - not being a comedy; it was about a man, but so eccentric that it was not a piece of life; it was about character, but the character was so reasonably optimistic and trusted his life instinct that it was not a sentimental melodrama, driven by fear, so typical of an American "serious" film - when I wrote that I understood that author / director Lisa Kruger succeeded make fun of this American chuy sentimentality of her husband! And very clever! And Kreuger was able to hide the sentimental ending from the screen when the wayward, not prodigal husband returned with a squeezed tail between his legs. Bravo, Miss Kruger, bravo! (Now I’ll watch this movie again as it gets better and better when I think about it.) <br /> <br /> Graham’s role as Joel is brilliant. I liked how thin, but completely she managed to portray and convey a reasonable awareness of her responsible commitment to reading her words and actions - she knew that, keeping her word in the group, friends or her husband, she was going to make fun of herself and / or disappoint a world that could not fulfill its obligations, as she could do. But even with this power, she was completely connected with humanity and accepted their weakness and failures with a dedicated heart. Jolene's character was surprisingly well-played, and I left the film, surprised that I had no memories of award nominations. Well, this is not surprising, since American awards are usually awarded to women in "serious" roles filled with fear and the proper amount of nudity that were not in this film. What she had was much better, which was the heart of this woman revealing herself with the help of new friends and a self-deprecating shaman. <br /> <br /> I admit that I was a little soft touch to eccentric characters who control their own characteristics, while remaining honest and true to themselves, moving along the minefield of what includes the "right" social behavior and " acceptable "interpersonal discourse. So if people have to comply with the norms in your world, then this film will not please you. And this seems to be one of the common themes in critical articles. <br /> <br /> And I am always inclined towards a good play on words when it raises questions of human behavior and ethical / philosophical values. Prior to this film, I did not make an emotional connection between being committed (to reason or honesty or something) and being transferred (to insane asylum). At what point does a commitment to a personal sense of truth and action in life become a one-way ticket to insanity? It sounds like a simple question or a question that is easily dismissed as rhetorical. But is it? And yet, few critics - I think maybe two - have commented on this aspect of the film, directly or indirectly. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie. 8/10. <br /> <br />
