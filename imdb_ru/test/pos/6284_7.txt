I think that this is the best that Paulie Shore did, he played his part well. I really liked this movie, Patrick Renna is very funny, like Zach is an annoying little brother. “Son-in-law” is a good comedy that is worth your time, but the only thing I wish for Tiffany Thiessen is the farm, not the one they had.
