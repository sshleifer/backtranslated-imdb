The brilliant play of David Tennant and Sarah Parish began to cry as many scenes were familiar to me. My husband suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage in 1977, and he needed a serious operation that included lifting the brain and repairing the leak. Like Trisha, I was naive enough to expect him to return to his former state. After more than 25 years of love and care for him, he left me without warning, so that I would go and live with a woman he hardly knew. He then petitioned, and I am now experiencing a divorce. I hope that the program has helped people understand how it is to cope with a brain injury.
