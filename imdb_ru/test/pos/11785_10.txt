So funny, this is the perfect way to describe this 12-minute deception of the original Star Wars. The hardware wars are incredibly fun. Presented as a trailer for the space epic Hardware Wars. The joke is this: imagine that in Star Wars there are bad actors and incredibly bad special effects. Characters include the intergalactic miracle Fluke Starbucker, the mercenary and the intergalactic sage Ham Salat, Darf Nader, the villain and many other fantastic characters. It is impossible not to laugh when you watch this 12-minute treasure. It's silly, but fun. You will laugh from beginning to end, and you will feel the need to watch it again, and again, and again, and again ... And you will laugh every time you see it !!! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. The funniest ones in 12 minutes. You will believe that it lasted a minute!
