Assy McGee is a show in which you really need to be a certain age to appreciate. Otherwise, most likely, you will miss links to movies about the 80s and just thought that this is a joke about walking the rectum. Do you think this brainless infantile humor? Go watch Stallone's film “Cobra” and you will understand what I mean. This show actually has a very subtle humor, which says a lot, both for the show, which was broadcast on adult swimming, and for the show about the walking ass. <br /> <br /> All the standard clichés of the genre are made for films like Dirt Harry and Cobra, so cool and ready for parody. Sanchez is Assi’s partner, who - in accordance with the genre - is balanced and constantly apologizes for the murderous behavior of his partner. The police chief is, of course, a fire-breathing hard case that lives to shout: "I want your badge on my desk to be the first thing tomorrow morning!" Good for this topic. For example, when breaking up a bus robbery, one of the criminals stops to ask Assy: "Hey, where are you going, asshole!?" <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended for anyone who loves 80s action movies and really watched them enough to understand humor.
