I assume that those who have been in one-sided relationship of some kind before will be able to identify themselves with the leading character Minako (Yuko Tanaka), a 50-year-old woman who is still in good pink health, as her daily newspaper shows. routine, how to wake up very early in the morning to get ready for milk delivery work, where she has to haul bottles with Megmilk in a bag along the route around her city, like clockwork, exchange empty bottles for full ones and collect payment and issue a receipt. And there must always be one delivery stop, which is directly at the top, and she needs to scale a long flight of stairs in order to achieve customer satisfaction. <br /> <br /> And, strangely enough, this stop turned out to be a delivery stop for a man with whom she had been in love with almost all her youth and adulthood, and did not appreciate the product, but poured it into the sink. By attending the same school, we see that they do not talk to each other, and in everyday life they always seem so close physically, but still so far away. There is no eye contact, with the exception of random glances by chance and little confirmation of the existence of each other. We learn that they share the past, which probably destroyed all the notions that they were together, and the earlier generation was hindered by a clear attraction between them. <br /> <br /> Although I thought that Minako was an interesting woman in himself To the one who held his feelings for so long, one can only wonder what harm it would do. If I read that the original Japanese title means "Some days when you read books," and that’s for sure, I felt that the film had a wonderful ending with this picture of her well-stocked bookcase, probably referring to the fact that she is not alone after all, and probably returned to a kind of support to cope with the pain of loneliness, and returned to a way of life, to which she had already got used for 50 years. Besides the fact that she plunges into two works, she has books that serve as a form of escape and occasionally write little sweets on a show of dedication to songs on the radio. <br /> <br /> Yuko Tanaka performed a commendable job as an emotionally strong woman resigned to her fate and her decision to love anyone else, her object of attachment Takanashi (Ittoka Kishibe) was a more interesting character who has more facets. Remaining loyal to the marriage vows, he spends a lot of time on the screen, looking after his sickly bedridden wife (played by Akiko Nishina), while at the same time doing social work in the children's affairs department of the city hall. I felt that, being a childless couple, this work gave him the opportunity to take care not of his own, but of the children of other people, of the problematic, who are neglected and who are left to fend for themselves. At a rare moment of anger, we see how he angrily reproaches such wayward parents who do not value or waste their children's lives. <br /> <br /> The story of Kenji Aoki gives small quirks to make his characters appeal and successfully tried to give them much more glimpses and measurements, for example, about how Takanashi is a hopeless haiku poet, despite the fact that he is a member of the haiku club, and supports characters like the elderly Minagawa couple, where Masao (Koichi Ueda) borrowed some funny, albeit sad moments when he slowly became senile, while Toshiko's wife (Misako Watanabe) tells and tells us the story love lonely nschiny 50 years. Even Akiko Nishin’s speech as a bedridden wife was nothing more than an arrest, with her character an enlightened state of knowing her husband’s past and making unselfish and painful decisions in her morbid state. <br /> <br /> This is what you can expect from a typical Japanese romantic film, without young, Nubilian heroes as a star cross, lovers of gray hair, but with all the other elements in place, such as romantic scenery, love songs and most restrained, but affectionate behavior. I thought that the story risks going down the beaten track when unrequited love ends, but director Akira Ogata managed to avoid the usual melodramatic moments in such stories, although the story did require some obvious plot development in the final act that you can predict, especially if you are already far away the romantic movie 101 went through. <br /> <br /> Without being your usual love story, I thought Thrush told a strong story with unrequited love as a central theme. and, frankly, the recommended romantic film (albeit at a discreet pace), if you have the mood for some bitter-sweet love, memories, and the desire to live without regrets.
