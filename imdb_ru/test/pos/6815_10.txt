I really liked this film ... So much emotion in such a small amount of time. I really liked the beginning and how it takes you completely by surprise. I like the story and the attraction of deer. I know that when I think of deer, I think of innocence and prosperity. In addition, in Psalm 42: 2, the Bible says, "Like deer dress in streams of water, So dress my soul for You, God." What can even connect the last moment when a woman says that everything will be fine. As if she knows what goes with God. Perhaps I think about it. But sometimes it is interesting to see what happens in people's minds. Thank you for sharing this masterpiece with audiences everywhere. I live in Texas, and I had a game on cable ... I immediately got on the computer to find out more about this film and about this amazing director! I really liked the music that was used in the background. Music can sometimes make or break a movie. It definitely set the mood perfectly. Very good choice! <br /> <br /> Thanks again. <br /> <br /> Leticia
