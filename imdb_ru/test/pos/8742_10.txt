In the phrase is moral ambiguity. In the remake of Soderberga there are good and bad guys. The character Benicio del Toro is clearly a good guy, morally clean and uncorrupted. His colleague in the original BBC, Fazal, a farmer who became a dealer, has serious flaws and contradicts his fate. Two merciless policemen are equally different. In American, they win our hearts. In the original BBC, they are overly zealous, almost intrusive. <br /> <br /> The best moment for me in Soderberg was when a college student rhetorically asked the king about drugs: â€œWhat would you do if you were poor and black and rich white people came to your area in search of drugs? This moment was permeated throughout the BBC show and embodied in the final speech of Jack Lithgow. Both are excellent, but the BBC towers over the remake. My conclusion after viewing both exhibitions is that dealers are innocent pawns that only provide demand, and it is demand that causes so much suffering.
