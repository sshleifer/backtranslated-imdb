Ghilli is the best Vijay movie and one of the most popular hits in his career .... Because I have not seen Telegu, so I could enjoy this movie even more. The story of a girl who wants to escape from the clutches of a local jerk who wants to forcibly marry her. Since he is a villain, then no one is willing to help the heroine. Vijay, who came to play the Cababdi match there, sees this and decides to help her. The rest of the film talks about how Vijay helps her and how the girl eventually avoids the clutches of the fool and the political friends of his father. The film has many moments thriller moments edges of the place and will keep the viewer involved until the end. Vijay, as always, is very good as a kabaddi player. Trisha, Ashish Vidyarti, a group of friends, widgets, all did their job correctly. Particular mention should be made of the villain from the film "Prakashrai". The character of the villain was correctly engraved, and Prakashrai depicted him very well. Surprisingly, for the first time I felt sympathy for the villain in the end. The “Hello, Chellam” dialogue has indeed gained popularity among the masses. Vidyasagar’s music is brilliant, and the song “apadi podu” is rage all over the world. Dharani should pay tribute to such a good masala film, which will appeal not only to the fans of the dying Vijay, but also to the wide audience of Tamil films around the world.
