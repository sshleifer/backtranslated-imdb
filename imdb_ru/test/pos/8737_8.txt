Walter Mattau is great as a “falsifying” dentist Dr. Julian Winston, whose frequent inventions to a friend of Goldie provide educational proof of the danger of lying. Touched by Goldie Hawn's rogue, Tony Simmons certainly deserves to win her Oscar. Ingrid Bergman, who works as a starch-like nurse, Stephanie, also looks touchingly as she slowly and nervously comes out of her shell. This is a great movie to watch in the spring or at any other time. This is very underestimated; I never heard of it until I found it in the video store, and what a find!
