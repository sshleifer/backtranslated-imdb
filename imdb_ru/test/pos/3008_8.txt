I give this film 8/10 in general. Visually, much of this is nothing short of stunning: a mixture of artistic director Jerome Bosch, Salvador Dali, Frieda Kahlo and Georgia O'Keefe’s dream - and a sure testimony to the power of the film as a serious art form. Excellent use of color, shape, images, the environment - and fabulous decoration in combination with modern computer graphics. So 10/10 for that! Wow <br /> <br /> Storyline is more predictable. You know that they will save the girl and, eventually, kill the murderer, but the story is still interesting and intricate enough to attract you and keep you there. 6/10 for that. <br /> <br /> Squirm factor ... I will not give this rating, but the film definitely made me squirm, and I watched it on video on the TV screen. This, of course, will have a much greater impact on the big screen. The graphic violence of a twisted, erotic nature in a surrealistic landscape — even if it’s beautiful — is highly unpredictable. The world inside the murderer's head is not - thank God! - my world. As I watched this movie on video, I was able to play several episodes and found a lot of admiration the second time when I wasn’t very worried about where the stage could go, and I suspect that the whole movie would be worth the second time, just for "visual art". <br /> <br /> General suggestion: do not invite children or conservative grandparents to this, but if you are fond of visual films, like surreal art, do not mind a bit of a strange smell of blood and just want to make a little “trip to consciousness "This is a winner. Yes, and if you are fond of children, Jennifer Lopez is quite hot. <br /> <br />
