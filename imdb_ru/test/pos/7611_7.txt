Josie, a newspaper reporter, set the task of returning to high school, since she will again be 17 years old. . <br /> <br /> As she is there, she recalls some really terrible things that happened to her the first time she was in high school, as we see in the scenes of memories. <br /> <br /> In the memoirs, they show that (little spoiler) in high school, Josie was a kind of nerd, and she was often chosen, and once a tough guy told her that he was taking her to the prom, only on prom when she leaves the house, she gets exhausted by the ass and his bitch. what a terrible thing (some will find it hard to look at her, because she is so nasty, and that makes Josie warmer). <br /> <br /> It didn't seem to me that this movie is funny, but some really funny things in office scenes are much funnier than everything that happened at school. <br /> <br /> This film had a perfect happy ending, as it caused tears in the eyes of my mom and sister. The acting in this film was not outstanding, it was good for most of the film, there are some bad qualities in some parts of the film. <br /> <br /> I am going to give this film 7 out of 10.
