“Best of Everything” is a soap opera with a large glossy screen, which tells about the career of four career women: Hope Lange, Susie Parker, Diane Baker and Martha Heyer in a New York publishing company. What is best for some women is not necessarily the best for everyone. <br /> <br /> Leading this group of young fillies is the wise old mare Joan Crawford, who was on the track several times on the screen and in real life. At the moment, she looks like home, like the boss, and she should have. <br /> <br /> Around the time she did The Best of Everything, Joan Crawford became a widow when her fourth husband, Alfred Steele, died. It was a particularly traumatic event for her: one morning she woke up and found him dead in bed next to her. She inherited all of his stocks in Pepsi Cola, where he was chairman of the board of directors, and in the same period when Best of All was created, she started a queen bee in Pepsi Cola. Life sometimes imitates art. So authority, when it dictates dictation and orders a coffee to Hope Lange, sounds true. <br /> <br /> In fact, all women here, with the exception of Lange, are waiting for a rough sleigh. This is also rude for Lange, but she literally tries her best. <br /> <br /> What a collection of abominable men in this film. The best of them, Stephen Boyd, drinks heavily. The rest of Louis Jourdan, Robert Evans and Brett Halsey are the same mucous collection of rodents that they have ever collected for one movie. <br /> <br /> I can’t forget Brian Ahern, who is a fan of the company. Today, half of this office will have costumes for sexual harassment. <br /> <br /> A few good shots of New York in the 1950s make the movie a real treat. Catch it by all means.
