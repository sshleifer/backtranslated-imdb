I have read the comment above and can not believe it! Of course, this is a children's film, this is an adaptation of a children's book! This movie is easy to get, try play.com or amazon, and it's very easy to get a copy! Jokes are fun for both children and adults, and the adventure is pure without violence! Its completely suitable for children of all ages! The songs are awesome, and yes, a little repetitive, but this is what children need, and while watching my children heard the whole night singing “hello, hello” They liked it, the story of innocence and friendship! Very cute and worth a look for kids and adults of all ages!
