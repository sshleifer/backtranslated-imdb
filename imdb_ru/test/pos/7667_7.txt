Viva Variety was a unique hybrid program that was both a parody and a tribute to the programs she presented. <br /> <br /> This was the most straightforward mock classic of the 1970s favorite Sonny and Cher Show, in which Thomas Lennon and Kerry Kenny played a divorced couple from show business who were somehow forced to run this program. together. a woman in a pair, towering over a man, and a constant stream of “offensive humor” that the couple throws at each other, plus sketches of comedy bits and performances from what is most kindly called “special” acts! <br /> <br /> “Hybrid” is a mixture of fact and fantasy. Of course, there was no “Mr. and Former Mrs. Laupin”, and the program announcer, Johnny Bluegins, was also equally fictional. But all the actions that were performed were, of course, real, and some were even entertaining! But there were some actions that were clearly better suited for the old Chuck Barris Gong Show. <br /> <br /> The show itself was more like an extended sketch from “SCTV” (after all, it was taken from the MTV series “The State”), and some would assume that it would be better as a five-minute bit in Mix program, like this, and not a separate series. But “Viva Variety” should certainly get high marks for the original concepts, and although it was often more strange than funny, it was certainly worth it, especially when they traveled to Las Vegas and activated even more brilliant actions. . It is unlikely that we will ever see something like that on TV again.
