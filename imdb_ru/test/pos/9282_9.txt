This is the first film I've ever seen from Singapore, and it's great. If you know little about Asia, its languages ​​and culture, this film can be a little confusing to uninformed people. As an Asian American who specializes in two Asian languages ​​(one of which is Mandarin) and attended some Asian-American classes, it was easier for me to understand this film, but even without such knowledge, I believe that this film is still available for foreign students. audience if you remember that this is an adult movie. The film is definitely worth a look, so that you have the opportunity to see what problems young adolescents of Singapore are struggling with and having to face. This is an amazing film about coming of age, but filmed and shown more artistically and in an original way. Actors outstanding.
