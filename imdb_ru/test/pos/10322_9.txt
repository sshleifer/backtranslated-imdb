The Stooges are back and funnier than ever. The Groom Without a Bride, in my opinion, was probably the best film of Schempe. <br /> <br /> Shemp has the opportunity to inherit 500,000 dollars (which, compared with today, more than a million dollars) from his dead uncle. BUT! There is a catch. He must marry someone by 6 o'clock that day. Shemp is a bachelor who has not too many fans, with the exception of one aggressive, annoying singing student. But he does not want her, he wants someone a little more about the type of model Victoria's Secret women. But, obviously, he has no choice, since he himself is not Colleen Ferrell. But when it was printed in the newspapers that he should inherit all this money if he got married, his former girlfriends attacked “I want my man back!” <br /> <br /> What a great movie about puppets! It is there with the winners of all puppets of the puppet! <br /> <br /> 9/10
