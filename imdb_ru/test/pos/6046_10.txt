Hi Army Sergeant. Sorry, man, but the fact that you are the general secretary in the army and are in the national guard of the army does not give you the right to comment on a film about the marines. You are not a marine, and the fact that you wear a uniform does not mean that you can be a marine. We are simply the best, we have the hardest training, yes, we have big heads, but, hey, when you're the best, you like to flaunt your stuff. I was in the invasion of Iraq and Fallujah. I fought alongside the soldiers. You are not “qualified” to say anything about my marine corps. I hate to be someone who starts everything "which branch is better," but you have no right to say that you have the right to judge the film about the Marine. Oh, yes ... we are drill instructors ....... and not drill instructors. This is the biggest hint you are talking about. Yes, we no longer "curse" recruits. Tell me, how does he swear at someone to make him the best marine? How do I hit someone to make the marine better marine? Yes, this is a good training camp that I went through. But we are dealing with different times and people. We train people who are smarter than all the recruits of our generations. We want recruits to be smarter, not meaner. And anyone who subscribes to be a marine in the first place, has the desire to be the best that his country can offer. We should not strengthen this in Bootcamp. Marines come to Bootcamp, wanting to be killers. We do not need to teach them this, demoralizing them, cursing and beating them. At least that's how I feel. And yes, I am “qualified” to say that. I have been on the battlefield many times and trained marines and recruits who eventually ended up on the battlefield. But again, that I know. I was there, did it, got a t-shirt. SGT from the army ....... get the key!
