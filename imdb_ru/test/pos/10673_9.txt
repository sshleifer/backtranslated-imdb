I still have fond memories of watching this visually blinding film in childhood in the late 70s - early 80s on WOR-TV (now upn-9) in New York. Despite the fact that this film was a work of the 60s, he almost could not stand it. The effects are just as wonderful as in 2001, and in some ways excellent (the work of the model is flawless). JTTFSOTS - the winner! With an attractive cast, great color photography and set design, and a memorable result.
