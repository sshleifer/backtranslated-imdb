One of the most spectacular of all silent comedies is Pudovkin’s short film “Chess Fever”, a crazy story about how a strictly intellectual board game can destroy even the most carefully planned countries with a central economy. Such an unpromising comedic plot, like chess, found a way out in this delightful short film. Two young people sincerely play the game on an artificial background, painted set. This contrasts with earlier Lumiere shorts, such as L'Arrosseur Arrosse or Repas du bebe, in which human activity was deliberately created by a natural setting. The difference in activity (natural = feeding the child, watering the garden; artificial = chess) is probably significant. <br /> <br /> The main contrast in this film is a motionless background and a calm, serene game of chess and the last passions cause fierce passions, as accusations of fraud lead to extremely unworthy hand-to-hand combat. The intellectual game turns into a coarse physical crumb, just as the claims of artistic filmmakers are forever discouraged by the "coarse" demands of the audience. <br /> <br /> The most funny thing about the film is not necessarily going down to farce, but how it was shot is extended long after the initial joke; the way the camera refuses to honor the fight with a bit of attention, instead focusing on the set while we notice hurling legs and displaced clothes. The refusal to edit the film is daring, so humor seems to arise from something other than a fight that reflects our need for physical contact, rather than mental stimulation, our reluctance to let go. <br /> <br /> What is especially important is the ingenious denouement, since these fools of the highest class are caught by the valet, who picks them up as two lost students, as if he is going to plug their ears. If the masters cannot be expected to retain their place with propriety, then someone will have to do it for them.
