I really liked this movie. I watched it last night in the public broadcasting system. I liked the fact that they dealt with the problems of today, and not the future or the past. They basically forced some terrorists to take a van or two and rent them out as car bombs. I think the film could show people in different countries at the same time. It really showed the fact that England or any other country was not ready for an attack on the amount they showed. I have never heard of any actors or actresses in a film, so I cannot say whether they are usually their roles. After the film, they had this group of experts, telling whether something like this could happen here in the USA.
