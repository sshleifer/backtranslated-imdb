I don't understand why critics beat this film. This is really a serious teen movie, which is rare. I admit that there are moments that are very juicy, but come on, it's about young love, it must be ridiculous to be valid. My biggest complaint is Chris Klein. Although he was funny in American Pie, he seems not to be ready for the transition to more dramatic food, but he is very uncomfortable looking at some of his “material things”. Hartnett and Sobieski, on the other hand, demonstrate amazing depth and believability, just like parents. Despite the fact that the script is heavily circumcised by lovers, pouring out poetry, the actor makes him work. Directing demonstrates powerful images on the screen. Wonderful cinematography, good music, great young actors, I was impressed, and I’m an exhausted critic when it comes to films for teens.
