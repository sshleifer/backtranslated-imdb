Many have condemned "Never Say Never" because it is not an official Bond movie. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the manufacturers adhered to the fruitful formula of Bond. Although there is no pre-lending sequence in the film, it is clear that the training exercise at the beginning of the film is intended for the introductory scene. For EON, it would be impossible to prevent producers from including a sequence of pre-credits and titles, albeit without the introduction of the barrel of the weapon. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is in great shape as an immortal secret agent, and this film is certainly better than “Doctor No”, “Thunderball”, “You only live twice”, and “Diamonds are forever ". Although NSNA is a Thunderball remake, this is a significant improvement. 007 spends more time on Terra Firma and more diverse exotic locations are included in the film. <br /> <br /> There are some great actors in this movie. Barbara Carrera is flawless as the quaint Fatima Rouge. One of the best scenes in the film is a coup between Bond and Fatima in Nice, which is preceded by a dynamic motorcycle chase through the city. Klaus Maria Brandauer plays the psychotic Largo, and Max Von Sydow is free from the melodrama that other actors who play Blofeld indulge in. <br /> <br /> NSNA, as a rule, concentrates on Connery, and not on the character of Bond. In the beginning it is stated that Bond is aging and not acting. This seems to refer to the 12-year break in the image of Connery Bond. Bond promises “never again” to work in the secret service; hint at the image of Connery Bond. It seems that manufacturers were trying to hurt the official bond franchise. <br /> <br /> Still, this movie is definitely worth seeing. This is the last time that Sean Connery played James Bond, but his performance convinced me that maybe he should never have said "never again."
