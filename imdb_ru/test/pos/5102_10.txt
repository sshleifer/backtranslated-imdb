I saw this film when it just came out, and did not know what to expect. What followed the Overture was one of the most enjoyable events I have ever seen. The lush score of songs and music by the British Leslie Brikuss (about Dr. Doolittle and Willy Wonke and the fame of the Chocolate Factory, and how he left his mark on the Broadway music scene) and voiced by incomparable John Williams There is no bad song in the whole film Plus some of the finest cinematic, designer costumes and filming locations I've ever seen in one movie. Not to mention the performance, nominated for the Oscar award by Peter O'Toole, and the equally powerful, in my opinion, performance by the wonderful Petula Clark. Now, considering that Peter is not the same singer as Petula, he still knows how to sell his songs to the audience, and this is, after all, what it is. This is a true adaptation of the excellent book of James Hilton, and it deserves to be appreciated by future generations. I recommend this movie for family viewing, although most men will consider this movie "chicken." But if you like a really great musical, then this movie is for you. But keep in mind that for your viewing convenience, the Kleenex backup box is just as important as popcorn.
