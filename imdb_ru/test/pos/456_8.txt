Yul Brynner - Major Surov, singing, dancing, vodka-drinking Russian officer stationed at the Austrian-Hungarian border during the Hungarian uprising of 1956 in Anatol Litvakâ€™s The Journey movie Although the film has not yet been released on video or DVD, it remains one of the most compelling performances of Brynner. Due to political unrest, a group of travelers cannot fly from Budapest, but they are put on a bus to Vienna. However, before they can reach the border, their passports are taken away, and the Russians, led by Major Surov, are detaining them for questioning. <br /> <br /> A major has reason to suspect that among freedom fighters there is a Hungarian fighter. the group is smuggled out of the country. Indeed, Lady Ashmore hides the mysterious passenger Paul Fleming (Jason Robards Jr.), who pretends to be American, but does not deceive anyone. She helps Fleming basically pay off the debt she owes because of the problems that her past associations have caused him. Other passengers include a British journalist played by Robert Morley, an American family played by E.G. Marshall, his wife Ann Jackson and their two children, one of whom is the debut of little Ron Howard on the screen. <br /> <br /> Major Surov takes a romantic interest in Lady Diane Ashmore (Deborah Kerr) and romance species develop between them. However, she offers him only contempt and a tough upper lip, although we suspect that under her heart is still beating. The intrigue of the Cold War and the powerful acting game carry a story, but the novel is never convincing enough. However, he remains one of my favorite Yul Brynner films and deserves to be seen at least for his passionate performance.
