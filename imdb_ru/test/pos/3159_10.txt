Thank God there are movies that don’t follow the same old Hollywood shit formula. I think the digital revolution and the DVD revolution actually make more interesting work possible, even if you have to dig more difficult to find it. I like it when the movie takes time to draw you deeper and deeper into its inner emotional frame. It really was like a trip to America’s soul, and this soul is agitated and confused. What struck me was the way they used Martin Luther King’s speeches about Vietnam and links to killing him in such a way that they hit me hard. I felt depressed every time I heard his voice. Of course, I heard him speak before, but the way they made their speeches made me feel that I understood his message as I never thought. <br /> <br /> What can you say about him? a film that has heavy statistics about war, oppression and a call for compassion at the end, where credit slippage will usually be? In fact, there are no credits in the film. You must access them by selecting them in the functions. For some reason it made me think a lot. In general, I can not say enough about this DVD. Brilliant.
