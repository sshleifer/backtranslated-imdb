Tom Hanks returns as Symbolist Dan Brown to Robert Langdon in his first adventure, Angels and Demons, which Hollywood decided to do after The Da Vinci Code, given that the more controversial subject of the latter hits the rude nerve of faith itself. The Catholic Church was excited about the first film, but seemingly casually about it. And it is not difficult to understand why, given that Ron Howard decided to make a fascinating action, which will serve as an excellent tourist video about Rome and the Vatican, and probably will increase the number of visitors, given the many beautiful scenes on the spot, except for St. Peter’s Square and the Basilica. used on a large scale. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I think, given the fact that the bulk of the budget goes to the set, the cast must have been reduced accordingly. Aelet Zurer attempted to step into the female emptiness left by Audrey Thoth, but given the character of Toto, which then had a much larger share in the film, the scientist Zurer Vitoria had to do much less than just wait for them to replace the batteries on the battery. the canister is filled with antimatter. In the book she, of course, is food for Langdon, to tell about his extensive knowledge of the Vatican, the Illuminati and the great hostility between them, but here she has neither love interest nor his intellectual equal. <br /> <br /> Evan McGregor, on the other hand, is chewing each scene as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, who temporarily looks after the papal office, while other famous cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new Pope. And he plays Patrick with this glitter in his eyes, with enough nuances to let you know that there is something more than it seems at first glance. There are no surprises for the readers of the novel, but McGregor's performance here is one of the film’s striking features, since Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks. <br /> <br /> The book itself, as always, is rich in, possibly, exact content. He had much more storylines about science and religion, as well as an abundance of information that Dan Brown explored and linked together in an exciting artistic work. Reading a book a few years ago, I thought that if a film was made from it, it would be easy to lose it and dwell in greater detail on the scenery. Unfortunately, this is what made this Ron Howard film with a tempo that does not allow a temporary respite. Unlike the first film, in which the characters sat for some “discussion time” over a cup of tea, this film moved things so quickly, it’s like reading a book over and over again, page by page is skipped to get to the bottom line. <br /> <br /> Catholic observers called “Angels and Demons” harmless, because, I think, he didn’t dwell on many contradictions, unlike the da Vinci Code, which struck the nerves in the center of faith. And if that, this film served as an excellent promotional video about tourism with a wonderful demonstration of many outstanding tourist attractions that will tempt many around the world to visit it. Naturally, some areas, such as the catacombs under the Basilica of St. Peter and the Vatican archives, remain outside the borders, but the walk along the Path of Enlightenment is now almost free. <br /> <br /> Nothing new for those who read the Book, except to see how it comes to life, but for those who did not, this film may simply make you take Dan Brown's novel, just to find out a little more about the importance of sights and such characters as Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini, who are intricately linked to the plot, but much has been left unsaid. Satisfying pop-root entertainment will not leave you indifferent.
