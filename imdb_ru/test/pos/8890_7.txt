A delightfully nasty black comedy about an old club (Danny DeVito) who wants to tear off his mother and has a plan to do it with a bitter divorced who wants to drive HIS ex-wife. The film is absolutely not to blame for its cynicism and gives us no love, but this time it works in favor of the film, and not as a shutdown. <br /> <br /> Anne Ramsey, as the mother of DeVito's battle ax, steals the show in a grotesquely-funny performance. Despite the fact that she is terrified, you end up cheering for her, because it seems that she can kick ass and Devito and Crystal at the same time, tying both hands behind her back. <br /> <br /> Rating: B +
