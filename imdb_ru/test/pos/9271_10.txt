So totally unique and interesting! Another great Canadian invention. The ordinary "Joe" (Dan) and a bunch of criminals who do not fit together (also known as Dolls) all live in a halfway house. Dan's job is to follow the four “threats to society” and help them rehabilitate. Bill, the killer dummy, Roco, the dog smoking cigarettes, the Buttons, the nymph teddy bear, and Cudles comforting the doll. Five of them find themselves in a variety of strange situations. Despite their suicidal, and often clearly perverse sexual tendencies, it is difficult not to find them attractive. <br /> <br /> I put this series on 10/10 only because it provides good entertainment, does not require a huge budget and exudes Canadian talent, which makes me proud
