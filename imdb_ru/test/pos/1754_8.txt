What I liked most about this full-length animated film of 1941 is the wonderful feeling that it gives in the early 1940s. These are songs, clothes, cars, the building language of the day, etc. You feel that you have retreated in time. <br /> <br /> After reading some of the reviews here, I see that it was a difficult luck movie released a couple of days before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Wow, no one would be interested in going to the movies for the full-length cartoon on those intense and shocking days, I'm sure. It’s a pity, because the guys missed some good animation, it would have impressed me almost 70 years ago. The colors are good, the pictures are nice and plot, since we cheer on the beetles led by "Hoppity" and his beautiful girlfriend "Honey" so that they are always happy and harmless. In addition, they all find grassy places in which they can live, and not worry about the people who trampled them. <br /> <br /> Although there is an ugly villain - "C. Bagley Beetle" - and his two minions. These helpers (“Swat, The Fly” and “Smack, Mosquito”) are comedians with Brooklyn-style accents! This is a familiar story where an unpleasant old man wants to marry a sweet young girl and uses unscrupulous means to force her hand. Meanwhile, a good guy has a deck folded against him, but at the very end, of course, prevails. <br /> <br /> My favorite part - it will sound worse than it was - when there was a good guy "" Hoppiti "was temporarily executed in an electric chair, and he danced in black and white. It was a fantastic animation! <br /> <br /> You know, well, I didn’t perceive it as a small child; I would be afraid to play outside and crush all these wonderful people-beetles! You never know what (or who) is in this grass under your feet!
