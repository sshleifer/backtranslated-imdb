In this film there was everything that I needed in the film: - Women, skateboarding, violence, music by Kh.I.M. and Tony Hawk !!! The artwork and camera effects in this movie are amazing. The music in this movie is the best I've heard in any other movie. Each track blends so well with its own scene. I thought the acting was really good, considering that none of the Bams film crew had ever starred in scripts. Although the whole concept of the film is the story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend (Gloren), who sleeps with Hellboy behind him, it is a predictable and age-old story. The way they acted is very unpredictable, for example: Falcone and the gas tank, Sam Raab, Dunn smashes the bottles behind Vava and all the scenes of Don Vito. These films are a must see!
