Mullholland Drive proves once again that David Lynch is a master of cinematic expression. At the show last night, I witnessed a brilliant addition to the history of cinema. The performances are amazing, the points are fascinating, and the photo is fascinating. Davidâ€™s ability to intertwine many elements of filmmaking into a unique and stunning cinematic experience is unmatched. When I watched Mallholland Drive, I could not help but understand that with David Lynch in this world we are truly blessed. The movie is also blessed because in the films of David Lynch we are shown that the vision of one person can be realized with amazing results. We understand that blockbusters are not the only way. We understand that a true cinematographer has a chance in this world, and in this we are truly blessed.
