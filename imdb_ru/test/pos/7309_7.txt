The film begins with the silly housewife (Norma Shearer), who learns that her husband (Rod La Rocha) cheated on her. Three years have passed, and, apparently, they divorced over the years because of infidelity. Oddly enough, at this time, La Roque did not see Shearer or his two children when Shearer took them to Paris. <br /> <br /> Marie Dressler is a wealthy social lady, and she invited a new and improved Norma to come to her house for the weekend - ostensibly to help Marie break the nascent romance between her daughter and La Rocque! Apparently, Norma is now a super-vamp, and with her magical sex appeal she can ruin the romance - and no one seems to understand that she and La Roque were married. Several others are there for the weekend, and immediately Norma becomes a hit with her cheerful, carefree sexual manners - and almost all men (including La Roc) are fascinated by her. Nobody tells anyone that they were married, but it is obvious that she wants to return a new and improved Norm! This film - a complex comedy about manners among the bark - is in some way similar to the “Rules of the Game” by Jean Renoir. Oddly enough, despite the seriousness of the Depression, such films about quite rich people were quite popular, although many today will undoubtedly find them too funny in places. However, fortunately, there are many cute and funny moments in LET US BE GAY (especially towards the end, when Marie Dressler shows her true colors). Although this is not a very good film, it is definitely a good one and not just a regular passer-by. My only real regret is that I didn’t like the very end. You just have to see it yourself - maybe you will agree with the ending, maybe not, but I'm sure you will like this clever movie.
