Many comments seem to see this movie as a baseball movie, but I feel that this is only secondary. It is really about living in Japan, and it really does well. <br /> <br /> I spent a few years living in Japan, and I believe that the reason this film is not too good is that you must have experienced Japan to get it. I watched it with a well-traveled friend who had never been to Japan, and he noted that many events in the film were so ridiculous that they destroyed the suspension of disbelief. My answer was that these events were the absolute naked truth about life in Japan! <br /> <br /> I think this film is definitely worth seeing, especially if you lived in Japan or are interested in it.
