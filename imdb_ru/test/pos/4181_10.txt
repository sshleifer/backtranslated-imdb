This film begins as it ends, and ends as it begins. What is in the middle is a collection of comedies, philosophy, music, observations, comments, mini-stories, colors and more. He looks at the world and our life and tells the story of the Apes from the point of view of the group members themselves. It also looks at television and film and makes a visual comment. It also shocks the scenes of war and shows that we are just pawns in the big game. It speaks of all this and much more, but if you don’t look at it objectively, you won’t see much more than the scenes put together to combine music. This is such a film that is never boring, because it is so cleverly done.
