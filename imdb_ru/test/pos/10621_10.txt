Yes, I felt as if I was gutted when I saw this for the first time. But only the next day I began to see the true brilliance of this creation. I will not repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the film, but there is one new area that I want to touch ... ** SPOILERS ** Why did the teacher put the broken glass in the student pocket? Most reviewers noted that this only reflected her cruelty and reaction to unsatisfactory performance. I have to disagree. Watch the scene again. Huppert is moved to tears, watching her student play on stage. The student is a pretty expressive girl (crying and voicing her fears) - the exact opposite of Huppert's character. There is a scene later in the film after the girl is injured when Huppert discusses the accident with the girl's mother. The mother, clearly upset, declares: “We left everything so that she could learn to play the piano,” and Huppert immediately clicks: “You mean that she left everything, right?” <br /> <br / > So I thought that Huppert just saved this young, expressive student from her own destiny. She did not want the girl to end up as HER, repressed and hardened, doomed a solo concert for life ... gradually killing her soul in the pursuit of perfection. Maybe she saw herself on stage many years ago, before everything became bad. Perhaps she would like to escape when she was at that age. Does she ruin student life or just free her? <br /> <br /> For me, this understanding made all the difference in what I experienced in this film. Brilliant.
