Malcolm McDowell diagnoses the daughter of Megan Gallagher form of the disease when they believe they see "Huldre", troll-like creatures who live with "stones and roots" (quoting the film). <Br /> <br /> Basically, the family moves to an older house, which has a smaller dollhouse in the backyard. The daughter (well played by Sofia Vasilyeva) begins to be friends with the creatures until they become vindictive. The family cat also disappears. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes with Megan Gallagher (“Millennium”) and Malcolm McDowell as a psychiatrist. There is also something strange that happened to one of McDowell's patients. <br /> <br /> If you like this type of story, you might also like “Bad Ronald”, who had a similar strange theme, and the house is often visited. Bad Ronald (Scott Jacoby) is only this movie from the 70s. 7/10.
