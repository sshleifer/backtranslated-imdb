All those who identify it as a simple “Elephant” robbery - are there any other comments that you can make to the film essentially as a separate movie (regardless of its obvious similarity to other films). <Br /> <br /> All those who question the reality of the film - in terms of its stereotypical characters (obligatory gay, athlete, disabled child, etc.) - I'm not sure how much time has passed since as you were in school - but no matter how amateur acting can be - the events that take place alone are surprisingly close to what might actually happen. <br /> <br /> And all those who ignore the film as so simple: there are only six teenagers with the usual teenage fear, who are pushing one for the edge ... somebody thought and noticed that the girl who committed suicide actually was not one of those six !! As one comment indicates, she had a screen time of no more than 2 minutes (not counting the final scenes). I think that the meaning of the film is not only to raise the issue of teenage anxiety and how far it can go, but also that it is not obvious who is always in danger of committing such an act (suicide) .. .
