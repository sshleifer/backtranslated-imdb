A sentence poetic beauty could not have been more perfect for the cinematic brilliance of a far from tedious English patient. With such a dramatic scale that keeps a person firmly on his feet, and strength in a film that does not lose heart, this film proudly celebrates the secrets and romances of World War II, taking elements Kasab Anki and Lawrence of Arabia along with some independence in the form of Tuscany. <br /> <br /> The English patient shamelessly pulls heart strings and leads us through the mysterious first act, romantic second act and beautiful ... beautiful final act, and it is not This is just a wonderful pace and setting, this is the performance of Ralph Fiennes, which arouses our sympathy even when Count Almacy turns out to be a completely unattractive character from the very beginning.
