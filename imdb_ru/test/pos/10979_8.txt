I saw the film last night, without knowing anything about it (nothing more seemed interesting, and I had a connection with the Buffalo to this film - UB grad). It was a very nice movie. I liked the pace (it is gaining momentum after a slow start) and the plot. Well written plot and good character development and relationships. Highly recommend to anyone who likes to watch movies with interesting stories. Then I started talking about this movie for a few beers - most discussions last no more than a few minutes.
