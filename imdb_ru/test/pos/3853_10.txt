The Duchess is a cute white cat who lives with her three kittens in the mansion of her wealthy owner in Paris. When an evil butler hears that a rich old woman first of all leaves everything to her cats, the butler is angry because he wants to get everything first. Therefore, he puts them to sleep and leaves them on the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start a long way home. A street cat named Thomas O'Malley meets with them and offers to help them. When Edgar sees them arriving home, he is furious and starts mailing them to Timbactu. But Thomas's friends come to help save the day. A rich lady decides to leave her home for every avenue of the cat in Paris. <br /> <br /> This is a charming movie. The songs, including “Everyone wants to be a cat,” are lively and optimistic. Great voice: Eva Gabor (who would later play Miss Bianca in the Disney movies “Rescuers”) as Duchess, Phil Harris (Balu in “Jungle Beech”, “Little John in Robin Hood”) as Thomas, telling interesting characters to his characters Presumably, Walt Disney, before he died in 1966, gave the go-ahead to this film. Recommended for Disney lovers or cat lovers everywhere! 10/10
