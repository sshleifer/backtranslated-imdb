Undoubtedly, one of the most interesting directors of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog, was pushing the boundaries of cinema, perhaps more so than any other commercial film director. I have known Herzog for several decades, and I have never been impressed by either man or his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was, but I could not imagine how Herzog was leading his actors and film crew into the real jungle, not only to make the film, but also to live it. No other director goes crazy about the purity of the film making process, and the subsequent knowledge of such productions as Fitzcarraldo has been turned into a cinematic legend. <br /> <br /> Today I sat down at Fatu Morgan, Duke of 1969. The film, which can be called an allegorical cinematic postcard. Without investigating the actual locations, I assume that he was shot somewhere in Africa, both in the coastal zone and in the desert, a region that could once have been the cradle of an infant man, child civilization, child life on earth. It is this origin, the biblical concept of the Garden of Eden and the Apocalypse, which Herzog deals with, as told by the narrative spread throughout the 79-minute run. <br /> <br /> Watching FM, I could not help but feel that I was a passenger on a deep journey. In the introductory sequence, the name translates as “Mirage”, and Herzog compares this translation with multiple repetitions of commercial aircraft landing on the runway. These images are perverted, their three-dimensionality is crushed by a flat long lens, layers of exhaust gases, heat waves and light aberrations are superimposed on each other. The effect made me come to the conclusion: things are not as they seem. <br /> <br /> FM is divided into 3 very different chapters: 1) The Creation of the World, 2) Paradise, and 3) The Golden Age. Chapter One, opens with countless languid images, where joyless, barren landscapes, rotting dead animals, broken shells of wrecked planes and abandoned cars slowly fall into the desert sun. The people inhabiting this inhospitable landscape are ragged, unsmiling and obvious prisoners of the desert. The story tells about the time before life, about the time when the canvas of the earth was empty, and everything that existed was heaven. While the story begins with a simpler, cleaner era, a portrait of a young boy holding an animal like a fox at the throat evokes a cold image of a cruel, ruthless man’s attempt to impose domination over nature. <br /> <br /> In the next chapter, we get to know the same thing, but the images and people are more animated and seem filled with life and vitality. We listen to the talk of biologists wearing glasses about how difficult it is for a monitor lizard to hunt for prey in such a lifeless environment. Holding a wriggling monitor, his tongue flutters from flies, he also tells how difficult it is to catch these creatures in the burning 140-degree heat. The parallel is duly noted, and Herzog continues to explore this concept through repetitive, frank portraits of people affected by the sun, the desert and the painstaking efforts necessary for existence in this harsh world. He also puts forward the theme that if a person does not control the situation, he claims that he controls his environment, and not always in the most pleasant way. <br /> <br /> The last chapter takes us out of the blast furnace of the desert to the more familiar territory of the Duke, inhabited by eccentrics and absurd behavior. It seems that no one has a more effective symbiotic relationship with the weirdness of the world than Herzog - perhaps it is here that he feels at home. Like Errol Morris, Herzog decides to put his camera in as objective a position as possible, before he allows the film to be shot. The subsequent flirting, which Herzog has with his subject, is the result of the fact that he could continue to shoot far beyond the level where most directors would scream. Like Morris, this long turn pushes the moment of “switching on” when subjects feel obliged to offer, and because of discomfort when they are pushed to work overtime, their facade gives way to something real. The most humorous portrait in this chapter is a group of two people playing a strange, polka-like song that Herzog repeats in this chapter. The drummer of the group wears the same glasses as the biologist, as well as the other guy who does the magic trick by asking the question: what about the glasses? They definitely add levity to the film, but one has to wonder whether they have any deeper meaning or significance, or is it just another example of Herzog's playfulness. <br /> <br /> Herzog uses folk and blues in the narrative. music as an experimental documentary soundtrack. Leonard Cohen captures most of the screen time, his two beautifully melancholic songs "For So Long Marianne" and "Suzanna". ideally complement the scrolling landscapes, adding the convincing feeling that we are truly ready for the trip. Towards the end of the journey, Herzog returns to one of the many shots that recur throughout the film: the distant setting of a lonely vehicle crossing an endless desert swept by a water mirage filling the horizon. Despite the general gloom of FM, the crescendo of the film and the motive of the mirage instill hope in you, the belief that, in spite of everything, life will continue and may even flourish. <br /> <br /> Having finished writing this post, I turned to the Foreign Ministry to find out that Herzog had shot Sahara in Cameroon just a few weeks after the bloody coup. According to his legend, Herzog and his team were arrested, beaten and imprisoned. While imprisoned, Herzog contracted schistosomiasis, a blood parasite. It is really difficult not to like such a hypnotic and strict film as Fata Morgana; Knowing that the director is willing to die to do this makes you respect him even more. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
