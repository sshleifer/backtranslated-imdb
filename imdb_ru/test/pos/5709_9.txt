Four beautiful young nurses in the last year of nursing school experience all sorts of shocks and excitements in their lives: sweet Susan (charming brunette Elaine Giftos) is trying to soothe Greg's bitter, incurably ill (exciting Darrell Larson), eager but neurotic Fred (beautiful blonde Karen Carlson) meets with the beautiful gynecologist Jim Caspar (affable Lawrence Casey), hippie hippie Priscilla (stunningly gorgeous Barbara Lee) soaked in the laid-back orgovtsem Les drug (solid Richard Rust), compassionate, and Lynn (played well Brioni Farrell) helps the angry Mexican revolutionary Victor Charlie (excellent Reni Santoni). Despite the fact that this film was made for the legendary exploitative clothes of Roger Corman New World Pictures, this is nothing more than your standard meaningless piece of mocking soft shlok. On the contrary, it is a very pleasant, charming and even often thoughtful time capsule of social and political upheavals in the early 70s (the story of Lynn and the revolutionaries is particularly powerful and provocative). Special thanks to director Stephanie Rothman, who brings the desired and refreshing intelligence and sensitivity to the material. In addition, all four attractive and attractive women conduct their work in a good and worthy of praise. Scotty MacGregor also seems to be the wise observer of Mrs. Boswell and the 70th-ever trailer guy Ronald Hans, who works as a psychiatrist. Stevan Larner's polished cinematography, a fantastic rock soundtrack and an exquisite folk score of Clancy B. Grass III - that's all right. The real sleeper.
