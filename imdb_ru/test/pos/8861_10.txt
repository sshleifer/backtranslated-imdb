Many people have a movie that they consider their favorite movie. My film will always be “The Thing!” By John Carpenter! The main reason why this film is a cult film is perhaps the splash effect, created mainly by genius Rob Bottin, and that this particular film made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from New York ). In my opinion, this is not a big film because of the effects, it is connected with the history, the atmosphere and, of course, acting. I watched thousands and thousands of films (3-6 every day for the last 10 years), but none of them influenced me like this one, even the great "Das Boot". <br /> <br /> Here is My suggestion for those who love sci-fi films and horror films: put yourself in a good chair in your home. Be sure that nobody interrupts you. If you do not have a projector, sit next to the TV and watch this miracle movie. Let it devour you, and you will understand it in my opinion! <br /> <br /> Best viewing time: end of February from 5 to 9 pm.
