I went to see ITALIAN WORK with mixed reviews in my head. I was pleasantly surprised, doing about 2 hours. I thought the actors were just as gorgeous as the special effects when the safe and the truck just disappeared from view. If you like high-speed action movies, this is the one that is worth seeing.
