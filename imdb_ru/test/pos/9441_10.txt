Oh oh, man, I was glad I didn't miss it. I wanted to publish this review, since this episode, in particular, is doing something that some recent film hasnâ€™t done. He pays homage to DOOM. Yes, his plot is different, and the characters are obviously in a completely different universe (obviously, the doctor, who is the universe), but the sensation, pace, links, and location are perfect. And for all the original Doom fans, listen to the sound effect of opening and closing the doors, for me it was icing. <br /> <br /> Please all doctors and Doom fans, check this out. this is a gem!
