This is a rather stupid film, including what may be the least erotic ever to appear on the big screen (the heroine drenches the V-8 with her whole body and invites the hero to lick it off - fu!). And yet he also has the brilliant Lucinda Dickey in that far and away her most erotic performance. In those old days, women — even heroine heroes — with real muscles were rare, and I still remember how my jaw dropped when Dickie took off his shirt, revealing the most powerful female back and biceps I've ever seen . ever seen. Dickie’s beauty and vitality carries the film: she could have become a Schwarzenegger woman if someone had a vision to promote her.
