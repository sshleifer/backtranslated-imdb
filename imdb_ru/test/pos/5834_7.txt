This is a heavy show to watch. It is not something to sit back and relax. It kept me on the edge of my seat for several seasons. People screwed up, raped, tortured and die like flies. Everywhere there are male organs, excrement, vomiting and blood. Oz is a bold show. This raises issues such as racism, homosexuality, the reality of prisoners and, above all; capital punishment. He, in my opinion, is also successful in this, in contrast to, for example, the one-track Medium. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's boring for me. He had strange storylines, and they spent a lot of time with characters that I wasn’t interested in. Oddly enough, the first season seemed pretty boring to me. If I watched it while it showed, I think I would not watch it. I love seasons 2 - 4. Seasons 5 and 6 can be observed (although I think that you cannot pronounce the words "Cyril" and "Line of Death" in one sentence). <br /> <br /> There are so many wonderful characters to root for. Older guys Bob and Busmalis, in which I fell in love from day one. Said, Adebesi, Panchamo and Schillinger, four very strong and charismatic leaders in their own way. August Hill, whose monologues have so effectively tied up the episodes. The staff with people like Sister Pete and Ray Mukad are great too. Also minor characters who were shot only for a couple of episodes or a few seasons, but also left a good impression. <br /> <br /> My favorite brothers are O'Reilly. Their relationship was the most painful and warmest that I saw on TV. If there is anything, I will always remember this show, it is them. There will never be another “pairing” or how to call it, it will make me sick so much. That is why, when the ends come to them, it is almost painful for many. I wish this never happened. I wish I had ever watched this. <br /> <br /> But good Fontana. I recommend it.
