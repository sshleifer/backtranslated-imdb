Johnny Knoxville and the boys from Jackass go to the top for "Jackass number two." When watching the press, the laughter was so loud and hoarse that it was difficult to hear the entire dialogue. Tricks going wild, and jokes funnier and more outrageous than ever before. <br /> <br /> All the guys put their limbs on the line to make a great movie, and they succeeded. If you like this genre, you will like this movie. If not, do not worry. <br /> <br /> Some of the funniest moments are jokes that guys play on themselves, and they have nothing to do with what happens to them. They will do everything to do the trick. <br /> <br /> Many critics panicked for Johnny Knoxville for the less active role in the first film, but not to worry, he is ahead and in the center in second place, and they have enough material in the bank to go half number three. <br /> <br /> This is a must see for fans of this type of humor. <br /> <br /> Chris Sanson, Entertainment Editor, Fort Bend Herald
