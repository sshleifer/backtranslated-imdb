Legendary Hammy and arrogant horror movie star Konrad Radzoff (superbly played with Ferdy Mein's evil sardonic aplomb) die from a heart attack. A bunch of drama school students steal Radzoffâ€™s corpse from his crypt and take him to a worn mansion so they can have fun with it. Radzoff returns to life and selects rude young men for the desecration of his grave. Writer / director Norman Thaddeus Wayne composes a fresh, original and even quite stylish accent on the usual premise of body counting, offers a neat recollection of a brilliant Hollywood environment and does a solid job of maintaining a pleasant oog-boogie atmosphere, Killing kits deliver terrible goods: sets a girl on fire, succulent decapitation (severed head rolls straight down the stairs to the lawn so that the crow can bite at it!), And another poor girl is crushed with a rating of raising coffin like certain horrible highlights. Kudos is also intended for B-flick's star-like composition of familiar faces: Maine has a delightfully glittering ball with his luxurious role, Leon Askin makes a funny cameo, as the bitter washed director Wolfgang, Nita Talbot adds some class as a layered psychic medium to Mrs. Romer, plus there are nice turns Luka Berkovichi in the role of undergraduate nicknamed Jennifer Starrett in the role of cute Meg, Jeffrey Combs in the role of calling Stu and Scott Thomson in the role of a botanist Bobo. Something pops up Chuck "Porky" Mitchell as a detective, Patrick Wright in one of his usual police units and Tully Cochrane as a corpse. Joel King's polished cinematography gives the film an attractive glossy look. Jerry Moseley's gloomy score also strikes with a shiver. Cheerful little scare.
