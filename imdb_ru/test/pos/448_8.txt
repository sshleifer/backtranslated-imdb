Anatol Litvak shot the 1959 film Journey with Yul Brynner, Deborah Kerr, Robert Morley, E.G. Marshall, Ann Jackson and Jason Robards. <br /> <br /> The film takes place during an uprising in Hungary in 1956 and concerns a group of travelers who are having problems getting out of Budapest due to political problems in this part of the world. They are put on a bus to Vienna, but the Russians, led by Major Surov (Brynner), confiscate their passports and are detained for interrogation. One of the passengers is Paul Fleming (Robards), posing as an American, but in reality a Hungarian freedom fighter who, according to the major, is smuggled out of Hungary. In fact, Lady Ashmore (Kerr) is hiding it. She becomes the center of the major's romantic attention. <br /> <br /> A very good film that conveys the tension and bustle of the Cold War, and all the performances are wonderful. Brynner is especially good as a passionate major who is not so bad, and Ann Jackson gives a realistic, powerful job as a pregnant woman who does not want her child to be born in a communist country. <br /> <br /> Good script, good director, good cast - there should be more such films. Highly recommended.
