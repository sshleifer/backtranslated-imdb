The unfairly forgotten classic “The Intruder in the Dust” is one of the great films of the 1940s, which, unfortunately, was in the shadows. Based on the story of William Volcker and filmed in his hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, “The Intruder” tells the story of Lucas Beauchamp (played with great dignity by Juano Hernandez), a black man who is unjustly accused of killing a local white person. and the white boy (Claude Jarman, Jr.), who uses this situation as an opportunity to pay off the previous debt to Boshan. Awesome game, especially the two great actors, Porter Hall (as the father of the deceased) and Elizabeth Patterson (better known as Mrs. Trambull in the movie I Love Lucy), like an old woman, ready to stand up against the townspeople to see this right ready. This direct, intense and sincere study of racial fanaticism deserves more attention.
