In such a successful film, it is difficult to single out any one factor. All departments work in an ideal union to create one of the most exciting human dramas ever filmed. <br /> <br /> Staging is a tribute to the ensemble efforts of writers, producers, actors and film crews. Not to mention a few, Hugo Friedhofer's magnificent score is a subconscious miracle, a subtle but striking photograph of Greg Toland, and William Wyler's incredibly effective leadership — all this combined with the perfect cast for creating American classics. <br /> <br /> The DVD version is a special pleasure to watch. How nice to see that the “Best years of our life” are so well preserved for future generations.
