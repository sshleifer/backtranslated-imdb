Unfortunately, every person I ask about this series says that I have never heard of it. I love to remember this from early childhood (I was not 10 years old when he came out). <br /> <br /> My favorite story is the Short Story. Something about how the story of the "stone soup" was woven into the big story, every time I get turned on. And then the narrator explains why he has nothing to tell, and this becomes history. I have always been a fan of Jim Henson, and this is just one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> I add this DVD to myself with Labrint, Dark Crystal, Endless Story, Bride Princess. The Last Unicorn, Willow and Mirror Mask. These are all DVDs I share with my brothers and sisters who are 6, 5 and 4 years old.
