A few years ago, I saw the SEA OF DUST part of the screening audience in New York. I liked the movie at the time, so I was a little confused by some of the changes that have been made since then. Perhaps this is my memory, but it seems that the exposition shown at the Rhode Island Film Festival did not contain fragments of the exposition. I'm really not sure which version I prefer, but I can honestly say that I have found something that would appreciate both. <br /> <br /> Let me start with a warning that this is not a movie about popcorn. Although this was announced as a tribute to Hammer Films, people awaiting a clash between Van Helsing and Dracula will be greatly disappointed. There is some schism, but no nudity (the main product of the later films of the British production house). And although SEA OF DUST is filled with gorgeous eye candy (it was really shot like a sixties film) and contains Hammer’s Ingrid Pitt starlet, it’s not like any of the company's pictures in tone or performance. This film is very dark, very confusing and (sometimes) very funny. I don’t remember that the earlier version was as crazy as this one, but that’s not so bad (especially the Black Forest autopsy that plays like a Three Stooges shorts). And some of Miss Pitt’s rantings are quite interesting. As if someone had wounded her and freed her. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of this film, however, is not in the borrowed details. This is in ideas. As a casual viewer of the Sci Fi Channel, I regularly took on the task of finding variations by one note on a topic (a CGI monster kills and then is destroyed). SEA OF DUST is so full of ideas that after a while you begin to refute them. <br /> <br /> But don’t get me wrong. I'm not complaining. In any case, I applaud these guys for making such an adventurous low-budget picture and for having the courage to fill it with so many concepts. It will not be a picnic for people who hate to think in the movie (you know who you are). But for the rest of us, those who are tired of the formula of modern horror films, predictability, lack of respect for the audience, this may just be your ticket.
