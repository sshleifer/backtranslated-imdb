For me, a ten-star film is one that never dies in my memory, and yet you can watch it again and again with the same pleasure as the first time. This may be a technically erroneous film; pleasure has nothing to do with spitting (my personal top 10 is at least special!). "The Thing" by John Carpenter is one of the few films that satisfy this criterion. <br /> <br /> I’m a science fiction fan from my childhood in the sixties and I’ve read John Campbell’s short film. the story on which the film is based (“Who goes there”) before I saw Howard Hawks’s original black and white film (like many people, this viewing was illegal, on TV, when I was supposed to be in bed!). This film, like many that you see in childhood in such circumstances, seemed almost perfect: suspense, the inexplicable nature of the newcomer, photography; It all seemed to work. I watched it many times in subsequent years (and still do when it is shown on TV). Because of this, I have avoided the Carpenter version for years - watching the remakes of my favorite movie, I thought, is always a mistake. When I finally watched it in 1988/9, again on TV, because there was nothing else, I realized that I need to replace “always a mistake” with “usually a mistake”! Carpenter created something different from the original film, closer to the original plot, and truly amazing. From the initial scene of the helicopter and the husky, through the internally disturbing scene in the dog pound to this ending (sorry, there are no spoilers!), I was hooked. The sound track alone lives with me - all I need to hear is a close resemblance to that bass guitar beat, and I am again * in * the final scene ... <br /> <br /> Bye Seeing “The Thing “I saw Carpenter as another monkey based only on comments and reviews in the mainstream press. Since I watched “The Thing,” I think I saw most of his films - I did not miss the opportunity to do it, but if someone comes up, it’s enough just to see his name as a director to make a decision to see it. He is thoughtful and knows how to create a film so that it reaches the point at which something will remain in memory. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen “The Thing” and you like science, make up yourself - do yourself a favor - sit in a dark room, wrap yourself in heat and get ready for your memory to increase!
