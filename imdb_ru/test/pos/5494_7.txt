This is another one of Eastwood's many films in which intrigue, thriller, and a portion of romance are mixed, as well as Gauntlet, Fire Fox and so on. Clint's range of action is now quite familiar. In this, he is silent and a little outrageous, especially with women and superiors. There are no surprises in his performance. But the film itself is surprising; it is above average. <br /> <br /> Clint - Frank, a secret service agent who could not, at the time of doubt, catch the bullet that killed John F. Kennedy. Then he drank, which drove his family away, and now struggles with the bureaucracy until John Malkovich, who calls himself “Bout,” connects to him with some sort of distorted relationship based on their overall disappointed conviction. that everything is meaningless, except for the desire to avoid sadness and predictability. Now, this is a rather complicated approach to a performer, like Clint, to designing, but he does it quite well, less robotically than usual. And he seems to carry with him, like a burden of stone, the memory of that moment in Dallas. He is tested again in the middle of this film. He hangs down from the roof of a tall building, clutching his hand on Bout, he pulls his gun and directs it to Bout, who asks him if he is really ready to shoot. If he does this, of course, he will save the president from an attempt on the killer trained by the CIA, but he does so at the cost of his own life. Booth tells him about the situation when they hold hands in the air. And Clint even speaks briefly with Rene Rousseau about his inability to save the president in Dallas. "If I responded quickly enough, I could have made this shot ... and that would be good for me." This is underestimated, but his voice is choking slightly, his eyes are watering and his lips are trembling. This is one of the few scenes in any of Clint’s films that can be properly called “touching”. From his renewed determination, we know that this time he got another chance. (The irony is that he does not like the current president. Who could? He gives rant speeches in Colorado about how they “cut the nation out of the desert.” Didn't they do the same in Las Vegas?) <Br / <br /> It is often said that a movie is as good as its villain. This is not true, nothing is so simple, but in this case, you can bring an argument in favor of its truth. Reptile John Malkovich with Tatar eyes is amazing. <br /> <br /> Talking about disappointed. Well, he can tinker a little, sniffing with contempt, even when he plugs two innocent hunters between his eyes, but he is charming on the screen. Rene Russo does little. Fred Thompson, as the White House’s chief assistant, has now returned to politics, a relief for moviegoers. If the range of Clint is limited, then Thompson has something smaller. In each film in which he appeared, he wears the same solemn and disgruntled expression, as if he was constantly tormented by some kind of volcanic digestive disorders. <br /> <br /> The direction of Wolfgang Peterson is as good as in Das. Booth, which is pretty good. In the final shootout, there is a lot of the usual tense walkthrough. And when Clint and Rousseau get into a passionate embrace in their hotel room and run back to bed, like two weasels in the heat, Peterson playfully shows us his legs a series of objects falling on the floor — not only ordinary clothes, but handcuffs, pistols, ringing tones, palm pilots, Dick Tracy's wrist watches, and other impediments. <br /> < br /> Well written and worth seeing.
