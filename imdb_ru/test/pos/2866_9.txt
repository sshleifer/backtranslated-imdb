This movie was so awesome! I saw it on Friday evening with a couple of my friends. While the first credits rolled in, we saw that Lionsgate Films made this film. It was they who made this stupid Wolf Stream movie, which was absolutely funny! When we saw it, we groaned. We thought it would be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The film was not only better than Wolf Creek (which is actually not so difficult), it is one of the best horror films I have seen in a long time! They really redeemed themselves with this film. It was awful, clever and scary, which are combinations to an amazing horror movie. Kane is great, like Jacob Goodnight, and Christina Vidal, Samantha Noble, and Luke Pegler did a pretty good job with a group of criminals cleaning up the old motel. There were some rough scenes in it, and you are really a little sad about some of the people who are dying. In general, a great horror movie to watch on Friday or Saturday evening with the lights off and with friends. Just do not watch it in the hotel.
