An interesting film with Jordana Brewster in the role of a young woman who travels around Europe in an attempt to find out what happened to her older sister (Cameron Diaz), who mysteriously died many years ago. Brewster is very good and keeps you informed, despite some unrealistic conspiracies, for example, when she amazingly finds and begins an affair with a much older guy of his dead sister (Christopher Eccleston). Still mostly good. Grade: B
