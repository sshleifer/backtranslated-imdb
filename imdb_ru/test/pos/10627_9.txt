I completely disagree with the comments of one of the critics before me, who broke the film. After reading the book, being impressed by it, although it is a kind of literature that you really CAN'T UNDERSTAND (like writing Hubert Selby), I expected to be shocked, but the effect was more subtle than this. Isabelle Hubert is a brilliant actress who manages to convey a multi-layered character. There are many scenes that fully focus on her and her subtle changes, and I can imagine some actresses who would succeed in doing so with so much disregard for their own reputation or image. It is cold, distance, cruelty and at the same time helplessness, pain and pain. There is a person who controls and controls at the same time. Perhaps this is unrealistic - although when you read a newspaper, you read about something far worse than this, - but there is a truth in this that is very difficult to bear. I think this is a great movie, but I didnâ€™t like to watch it. It's not boring, but there are times when I wanted it to end. By the way, her male colleague also acted very well (and I think that he was also selected).
