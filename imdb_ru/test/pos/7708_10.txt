This is one of the nine shorts on the animatrix anime. It's my favorite. The job is amazing. The black and white grain texture perfectly conveys the mood that the segment is trying to represent. The story is tough, and the ending is true for the film noir. <br /> <br /> Overall, I gave Animatrix a “7”, but this particular segment deserves a “10”.
