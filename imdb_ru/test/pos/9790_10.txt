Bobby and Mikey are two little boys who move across the country with their divorced mother to start a new life. Shortly after the family settled, their mother marries the "King", who eventually becomes a stepfather, especially with Bobby. Therefore, Bobby decides that he will “fly away” from insults in his birthday present. <br /> <br /> This film was difficult to watch, especially the scenes of insults. It was difficult to observe how an innocent, playful little boy is insulted, turned into a sullen frightened and closed young man. The acting is great. <br /> <br /> I cried throughout the last half of the film. There were also some funny scenes in it, such as “Monster Brew” and a dog that finds bottles of pop music. <br /> <br /> I would not advise young children to watch this. It was a movie that was painful to watch, and yet it really flew away.
