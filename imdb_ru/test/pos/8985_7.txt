Peter Lorre is turning into one of his best performances as a Hungarian watchmaker who came to United Staes to create a new life for himself and someday bring his girlfriend across a large pond to be with him. Lorra’s infectious optimism and bright eyes are very effective, which makes the performance even better when his face burned terribly in a hotel fire, and when no one gives him the opportunity to work, reluctantly turns into a criminal life. The range of Lorre as an actor is seldom as obvious as in this film, with its cheerful, good-natured immigrant, to his depressing, melancholic, disfigured search for the truth that America, as he believed, gave him, to his suave, intelligent , better hood than your average, to his sympathetic relationship with a blind woman with whom he falls in love. The story is well thought out, has some interesting twists and turns and gives Lorra many opportunities to shine. Director Robert Florey does quality work behind the lens, and all auxiliary actors help the film with Evelyn Keyes, who gives a particularly good turn as a blind girl. I liked the end - and the truth - that was to manifest itself in the character of Lorre, despite all the negative things that society has done to him. For a small picture, “Man by Mask” is a good movie for its time.
