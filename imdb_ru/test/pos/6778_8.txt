De Grønne slagtere, or Green Butchers, as he is called in English, is a very dark comedy about two losers who work for a popular butcher. They are fed up with criticism of their bosses and decide to start a business on their own. Their store is expensive, and there is not even electricity in it. Worse, they have no customers (as predicted by their former boss). When a man visits them in their store, he challenges them to provide meat for dinner, which he organizes. <br /> <br /> Then a tragic accident occurs. One of the butchers locks the electrician in the freezer when he closes the store. The man dies, and the neurotic one of two butchers decides to cut the fillet from the electrician's hip and serves him for a dinner party instead of calling the police. This is an incredible success. Suddenly, everyone in the village wants to try this incredible "chicken". Stunned by his sudden success, the butcher sees no other choice but to kill more people he can sell as a chicken. <br /> <br /> I believe that everyone can not use the subject of cannibalism, especially not because it is shown with a lot of humor. Personally, I really liked it. This shows beautifully how far some people would go to achieve social recognition and get out of their isolation. This may sound a bit far-fetched, but I'm sure you'll be surprised to see how people in real life sometimes act. <br /> <br /> In addition to the original plot, the actors also pleased me. performances and humor. There is no revaluation, as can be expected in such films, all this is very sober and realistic (I think this is typical of Scandinavian and Scandinavian films). Same for humor. I’m sure I wouldn’t like it the same way as now, if the humor was excessive, or with a lot of farting vomiting, as you often see in American films. I liked this movie and I give it 8/10.
