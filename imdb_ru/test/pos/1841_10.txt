I saw this film a few years ago and was literally swept away by it. So cute and so romantic. David Duchovny and Mrs Driver have chemistry so hot that you will need to remove a layer of clothing. Support throw - 100% top level. Just watch Carol O'Connor and Robert Loggia play against each other â€” pure poetry. Bonnie Hunt and Jim Bellushi and a wonderful team, and some of the films are the most charming moments when they are on the screen. Like Jim Belushi, screaming at his children to go to sleep "FOREVER!" or he is dancing in the kitchen. This film made us want me to know such people in my life. Not to mention the fact that a woman does not want David Duchovny for a guy?
