During my trip to the youth leadership forum, I surfed on the channel until I found “Tommy Boy” on TBS. Since I have never seen this movie before, I wanted to check it out. My roommate, who had already seen this, told me: "This film is a classic." After watching the entire film, I came to the conclusion that he was right. <br /> <br /> “Tommy Boy” constantly cheers from start to finish thanks to the comedic duo Chris Farley and David Spade. Farley is a riot in the role of the protagonist, a spastic fool who just floats through life, as if that doesn't matter. His idler will soon stop when his father (Brian Dennehy), the rich “King of the broken shoes”, dies of a heart attack on his wedding day. This leads Tommy, with the help of his sarcastic childhood friend Richard (David Spade), to hit the road to sell enough brake pads to save the company. <br /> <br /> The main reason why Tommy Boy's works are funny plays from the main roles. Farley is the funniest person in this film, the second funniest person is Spade, and the third is Rob Lowe, the villain of the film who was unlucky. Another funny guy is Dan Aykroyd in the role of Ray Zalinsky, a famous extraordinary auto parts manufacturer. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the film works is a large number of jokes. Chris Farley has funny moments, and David Spade has funny funny comments and remarks. The jokes in the film (some of which include a deer and a bathroom in the plane) are laughable, thanks to director Peter Segal (Naked Gun 33 1/3), screenwriters Bonnie and Terry Turner <br /> <br /> (“Third rock from the sun ", show 70s) and actors. <br /> <br /> “Tommy Boy” is a really funny movie, although for some unknown reason, most film critics (including Roger Ebert) find it awful and unfunny. (I wonder when their sense of humor died?) I recommend "Tommy Boy" for those who are big fans of comedy. Many thanks, roommate.
