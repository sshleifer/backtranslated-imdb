This is a wonderful film taking place during the romantic period of the civil war. This film is a must-have for Eastwood fans, and Eastwood claims to be one of his favorite films he has made. I could not agree more. Caution! This is a spoiler - Eastwood eventually dies. Eastwood and director Don Siegel rightly argued that the ending should be unexpected and should be unhappy for several reasons. They wanted to stick to a book, for example. Secondly, there can not always be a happy ending. Thirdly, it was written during the Vietnam War - they wanted a negative statement about this terrible war, where people died unnecessarily. I agree with all of this. It is a wonderfully filmed movie, and I love most of the films related to the civil war. This is rather a portrait of how deceptive women can be - that they can be more dangerous than men, so the name is largely due to the statement of the film “START” - to be deceived. The song, which Eastwood plays at the beginning and at the end of the film, is another statement against not only the civil war, but also the war in Vietnam and, perhaps, indirectly, the women he faces during the film. A wonderful story of love and deception, as well as many memorable scenes. NOTE: this movie has an R rating for no reason. It is unlikely that there is any language, perhaps it is some subject related to sex, but in fact there is no nudity in it. Great movie - 9/10.
