Let's assume for a moment that you have not experimented with a psychotropic mushroom, and you are wondering about the so-called bad experience and how something like this can manifest on its own ?? Well, go and insert a fresh copy of The Beguiled. You see, with the film you have clean trips (Solaris and everything else, director Andrei Tarkovsky), cool trips, that is, an experience you will never recover from (Sweet Movie and El Topo), and you are a bad trip organic, category, specifically designed for a film such as Seduced, and this is the content that those enthusiastic writers of The Times, who made the right decisions in their lives and graduated from Harvard English, are called "hallucinogenic in tone." In the third act of this film, shot under the direction of Don Siegel, you may not notice that your two heavy lead hands have shrunk and take all the signs of a burrowing insectivorous mammal, and you definitely will not fall under the suspicion that your spine has reached the same tortuous shape and tangled the texture of a faded fruit tree, innumerable by age, but you feel something. <br /> <br /> In 1970, when this film was being shot, most Americans were looking for an anode for their team. the pain, perhaps a movie like The Graduate, was a big world endism, and, of course, you had the horrible collapse of the Vietnam War. What you get with "Cheated", with the exception of commonplace drug metaphors, is a script adapted by a novel by a guy who, at least for the time being, wanted to be known as Grimes Grice, and an indication of the director who helped carry out the work and career of Sam Peckipah . Born in Chicago, Illinois, 12 years after “The Great Fire”, Donnie Siegel, Seduced, demonstrates his attempt to combat all this modern cultural insanity of the early 1970s in the form of an artifact of a classic film. The Beguiled - an incredible film and an outstanding contribution to cinematographic art in almost all aspects: filming, editing, directing and plotting - all this is fantastic, and you are unlikely to see something like that. Undoubtedly, an ominous film, its effects, as I have already said, are dizzying and falsifying; frankly, it's hard to believe that Universal ever came up with its name for this picture, but you will see when you see some of the cute and pleasant camera movements, and cinematographer Bruce Surtis using every bit of the grim myth you keep in your head about American Plantation south, combining beauty with evil in each location. Needless to say, Clint Eastwood has never been like this. Old Clint, he instantly moves from shy to pale, his eyes like two Archimedean spirals in close-up. The rest of the cast is equally demanding and supernatural. <br /> <br /> This Beguiled will never make the AFI 100 in my life, but that doesn’t stop me from saying that this is one of the best American sync sound films. ever did. While most people catalog it as Western to include people on the Western Channel, Seduced is a problem because you really do not know what it is: a kind of war film? Drama? Psychological thriller? Perhaps the answer to all these emotionally made films of Noir, starring Kirk Douglas? I actually call this play a horror film, because when my old man, who likes to fend off cheap, unreasonable violence, projected in such entertainment as “The Wire,” saw this long shot of Geraldine Page at a high angle, winding Clint's bloody leg Pa rather quickly advised us to look at something else, such as the Bowl at the Depth, just before he disappeared into another room. My advice: look at this one and make sure that it is on a very large screen, preferably on the DPL home theater you are considering. I would put “Seduced” under the order along with this important purchase for the buyer, turned overhead, shed some cinematic light on the big blank wall and tried not to lose my grip, because, like Norman Bates: even deceived.
