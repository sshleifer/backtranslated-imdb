I usually do not comment on IMDB films, but in this case I feel that I should. I like movies and I want to make them, and this film is a great example of good filmmaking. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films that I saw on a small screen (it was originally watched on the air). on AMC, I think, and then on the DVD that I just watched), which made me feel it in my stomach. This is a small gnawing feeling that the director will hope that you will feel while watching his thriller. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmonâ€™s great performance followed by Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas. I felt such sympathy for Lemmon, the character Jack Godell, who wanted people to just heed his warning. <br /> <br /> But in this film, the absence of a musical score impresses me the most, and it also makes it beautiful for me. In addition to the initial titles, there is no background music to increase tension, because it is not needed. And while the credits are running, white on black, in silence it indicates the meaning. <br /> <br /> I use the film as an example for everyone who says that the music makes the film. I think the film should make a film, and the music should only strengthen it. But for the "Syndrome of China" music does not have to reflect the realism and urgency depicted here. Characters portray all this much better than music, ever. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film, it is one of my favorites. If you like movies, you will not be disappointed. If you prefer movie soundtracks, you may not want to try.
