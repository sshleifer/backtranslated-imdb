Better than the original, “Gamers: Dorkness Rising” manages to play an amusing comedy with a good acting game, great special effects and comedy that surpasses the knowledge base of “gamers” and does it with a small budget. I saw a lot of low-budget films that were terrible, and almost none of them were as good as their high-budget counterparts. This movie amazes most popular movies! The parts are a bit weak (bits with pirates and ninjas - albeit funny ones) go on for quite a long time without explanation and for some time take you out of the film), but in general this is a very strong film. <br /> <br /> I am very happy to announce that I bought this film as soon as I saw it and brought it home. <br /> <br /> Is there a chance that we are looking forward to another feature film from these guys? :)
