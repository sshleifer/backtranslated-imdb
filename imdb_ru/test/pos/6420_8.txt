In a strange experiment, an astronaut is thrown to the moon when Alice (Florinda Bolkan), a worried translator living in Italy, wakes up from a nightmare about a moon mission mixed with an old film that scared her as a child. She also does not remember the last three days, except for the torn photos of the Hotel Garma, which she finds in her apartment. Dismissed from work, Alice goes to this resort island to try to piece together the secret ... <br /> <br /> Often advertised as a dialect because of its director (Luigi Buzzoni from FIFTH CORD) and the presence of Evelyn Stewart, Nicoletta Elmi and Klaus Kinsky, FOOTPRINTS, is in fact a deliberate psycho-thriller with fantastic overtones. The blurring difference between dreams, reality, memory and movies, the disturbing story is beautifully photographed by Oscar-winning Vittorio Storaro with the thoughtful score of Nikolai Piovani. It also combines elements of such diverse films as Armando Crispino's MACCHE SOLARI and Lusino Visconti's Death in Venice, which depicts alienation, isolation, hallucination, and possibly insanity. Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan, on the screen all the time, plays Carol Hammond in an unnecessary role in Lucio Fulci’s Lizard in a Woman’s Skin as Alice, a young woman who makes a secret that questions her responsibility. Places reflect Alice’s unstable state of mind; Garm Island, the off-season, with its Arab influence and ancient ruins, is a lonely, almost mystical place, unwilling to reveal its secrets. Evelyn Stewart is a little bit worried at first, Nicoletta Elmi and Oscar-winner Leela Kedrova are hotel guests, Peter McEneri plays a handsome biologist trying to help Balkan, and the ever-intense Klaus Kinski is Blackmann in the film. -in the movie "Footprints on the moon". <br /> <br /> FOOTPRINTS is a cool case “Guaranteed for 100% Euro-weird,” but not for everyone. There is only one kill to the end, but you won't see how it starts when the film starts to come together.
