I first saw this film in the theater back in the 40s, when I was a child and always remembered the ending. There is nothing like a first impression, but some films always give pleasure at every viewing. Something just resonates with them. This is one of those films, and I agree with another reviewer, who said that Fritz Lang should have sent more westerns. To add to this, I always liked Randolph Scott and Robert Young. In fact, Robert Young plays a major role in what I consider to be my favorite movie, if I need to name only one, which is not so easy to do. This film is the Northwest Passage. This led me to the excellent historical novels of Kenneth Roberts. Western Union also led me to read the novel by Zein Gray, which in this case turned out to be one of those rare times when I like the film more than the novel. Not that Gray's novel was bad; I just like the story of the movie better. The film is in no way similar to a novel. It’s a completely different story, one of the biggest deviations from the book I’ve seen. <br /> <br /> I can’t add a lot of other reviews besides saying that I agree with many of them. I would also like it to be released on DVD. "Whatever happens to Randolph Scott, happened to the best of me."
