Having seen “Aristocats: Special Edition” in two packages with “Fox in the Hound”, I decided to buy it, since both of these films were favorite in childhood. <br /> <br /> “Aristocrats” - definitely a classic. It may not be a five-star classic, but it is a funny movie that entertains the evening well. This is a little light refreshment from a darker, more serious Disney classic. Aristocats is trying to be a carefree musical comedy, and I think it is almost successful. <br /> <br /> The storyline doesn’t really make much sense, and I don’t think the plot is particularly strong, but it’s certainly not weak. The animation and background are a bit in places, typical of Disney movies of the 70s, but they have a rustic, old-fashioned charm. <br /> <br /> Strengths of Aristocats - characters, music and humor. The music is very catchy - try to get out of the head "Everyone wants to be a cat!" The songs are written by the Sherman brothers, who also wrote music for The Jungle Book. There was one song called “She never felt lonely”, which was supposed to appear in the film, but, unfortunately, did not get into the final part. It's a shame, because I think it would fit very well. <br /> <br /> Characters are unforgettable. Thomas O'Malley is voiced by Phil Harris, and basically this is Balu in feline form. Eva Gabor gives the Duchess this warm and maternal feeling, and the kitten's voices actually sound like children, and not like an actor imitating a child's voice. There are a dozen minor characters here, and yet you still understand their identities. Edgar, the "villainous" butler, plays the same role as Cruelle De Ville, but he is more funny than scary, often finding himself in funny situations. Despite the fact that he is a bad guy, he is still cute. <br /> <br /> Two British geese - Abigail and Amelia really made me go berserk with my crazy (and drunk) uncle. I also like dogs that tend to argue about who the "leader" is. I could go on, but I will not spoil it. But I can tell you that “Aristocats” are funny and will entertain everyone without resorting to a rudimentary toilet humor. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that “Aristocats” may not be Disney’s main achievement, or even their strongest film of the 1970s (this award is the link between lifeguards and many of Winnie the Pooh’s adventures). But this is a pleasant romp that is sure to entertain. If you're looking for a dazzling piece of art, you better watch Bambi. But if you want to spend a fun night, Aristocats is what you need. This is a charming and attractive film, and it is impossible not to love. Enjoy! (And besides, it's good to have a movie where cats are not considered villains).
