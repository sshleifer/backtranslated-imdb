A good and enjoyable film, full of Mediterranean landscapes (Kefalonia is a very beautiful Greek island), which stores many of the characteristics of the novel. I think that the Greek landscapes add something special and magical to the film. However, I did not like the fact that the main characters, such as Mandras and Pelagiaâ€™s father, were not Greek actors, but foreigners. I mean, the actors tried to express the Greek way of life, but I did not succeed, and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation, when they tried to use Greek words, was terrible, and it was bad for the plot of the film. Irene Papas was really great in her role, a typical example of a mother who lived on an island in the 40s who lost her husband and tries to live alone. John Hurt, Pelagia's father, also behaved very well. He reminded me of the Greek in many of his reactions.
