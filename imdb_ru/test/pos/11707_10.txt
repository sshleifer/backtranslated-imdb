WORTH IT IS FOR: If not for the work of Mick Molloy, then for Judith Lucy. She brings her usual stylish style of impetuous curse to the role and steals the show piece by piece. <br /> <br /> IMHO: I'm not very autograph hunter, but I collected 3. The first is Samuel L. Jackson, the other 2 in this film: Tony Martin and Mick Molloy. Alto Martin only starred in a cameo role, Molloy is not only removed, but also co-authored and co-authored this film. I have been a fan of them for many years (obviously, I was the only one who laughed while urinating on the set in the first episode of the short Mick Molloy show), so I came to this with high expectations. I am happy to say that I was not disappointed. With Mick doing most of the work on this, there are a lot of his usual trademarks. Phrases like "blow your ass" and "these bowls are the damn house" everywhere, as well as a lot of winnie-blues that suck. This is also a silly, original story that can be expected from someone like him. It's like one of those American comedy sports comedies where they make a baseball team out of prisoners or something like that. But instead of trying to make boring American sports, such as baseball or gridiron, interesting, this film focuses on the sport, usually left by the gray army: Lawn Bowls. But the main difference between this comedy and the sports type is that it is very, very funny. What's even better, even if the theme of this film is a young ham, joining an old game with people, she never offends older people, and she never becomes disgustingly tearful or something else. It just laughs well at genuine 1972 prices. Mick is great in the first real acting role I ever saw him, like Judith Lucy and the rest of the cast, but then most of them had a lot of practice ... This is the best Australian comedy I've seen a long time ago. Look at him and learn the joys of lawn balls! <br /> <br /> LIKE: Major League? <br /> <br /> ACCOUNT: 8/10
