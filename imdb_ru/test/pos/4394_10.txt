When I first saw this movie, it does not seem to go anywhere. When I watched it a second time, it made much more sense. Give him a chance, look at it more than once, there are many key elements that form a story that can be missed during the first and even second viewing. The Cohen brothers brilliantly entwine real events of the early 20th century into this story to create a believable setting and plot. The combination of the leading role of Clooney fits well with the actions of Turturro and Nelson. The appearance of John Goodman in the movie is ridiculous. The soundtrack is great too. This film has become my familyâ€™s favorite household item. 10/10, exactly.
