There are several films that have a huge amount of non-stop action ninja like Ninja III: Dominance. It is a story of love, ransom and revenge, however, it’s basically a story about deceiving and killing people for no reason. If you were looking for a movie where a ninja goes crazy and takes a lot of different people to the grave just because he is a ninja and he can do it, then this movie is for you. I can’t come up with a single film to compare this, because no film is so cool. Wait, oh, have you ever seen a thing with two heads? There is a part in the fact that the title thing goes on a motorcycle and about a million police cars chase after it / them, but they continue to crumble and what not, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T KNOW THE THING WITH TWO HEADS !!! Well, this is what ninja III looks like. I highly recommend this movie, especially if you like the following things: Ninjas, swords, Lucinda Dickey from Breakin 'and Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, video games about jumping in a bar, ambiguous and undeveloped love stories or "good" ninjas
