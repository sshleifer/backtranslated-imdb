“Only Valiant” qualifies as a sandy good western. This cavalry of Gregory Peck against Indian fescue is a solemn suicide mission without a trace of humor. Veteran director Gordon Douglas filmed a grim, painful outdoors epic with an ideal composition of tough guys under considerable pressure; even Lon Chaney, Jr. superbly recorded as a powerful Arab soldier. Ostensibly screenwriter from the “Colorado Territory” Edmund H. North and scribe “A Place in the Sun” Harry Brown drew his script from the tough novel of the western director Charles Marquis Warren about a group of tough cavalrymen cut off from any escape route that should prevent the deadly red skins from destructive raid against helpless white settlers. North and Brown adhere to Warren’s novel for the most part and last-minute revelations - when it seems that our heroes can’t survive the onslaught of Native Americans - this is a traffic jam! This beginning of the century story develops an effective sense of claustrophobia in the second half of the action. Douglas and company take the sets in the studio and make them look convincing during the night hours. A clear black and white photograph of the cinematographer "Going My Way" by Lionel Linden lends this Western gloomy image, emphasizing its intensity and atmosphere. Actor Michael Ansara, who later played the main villain in "The Guns of the Magnificent Seven," is extremely effective in the small role of the hated Indian leader Thusos. <br /> <br /> “Only Valiant” begins with an excessive voice narration by Army intelligence officer Joe Harmony. “This is my stamping ground. I am a scout for the army. My work has been cut for me for a long time. Behind this passage is the whole Pacea nation. ” (The picture shows the territory with Flinthead). The mountains stretch across the screen with a passage with a narrow spot.) They left the pass, killing everything in the sights. Then we built a fort - Fort Invincible. He plugged the pass like a cork in a bottle. Things for a while was fine. But their Pachs are pretty clever. One day a bottle smashed a cork plum. ” We are shown the burning remnants of Fort Invincible with a dead man attached to the wall of a picket fence, and a spear sticking out of his belly. Captain Richard Lance (Gregory Peck from “12:00 High”) and his men jump on horses and capture Toussos (Michael Ansara), and Joe Harmony (Jeff Corey from True Grit) wants to shoot him on the spot. Harmony notes that Toussos is "the guy who started this whole business." Captain Lance intervenes: "The army does not shoot prisoners, Joe." As expected, Harmony is terrified of this perspective. “He is no ordinary traumatized person. He is as close to God as any man can get. If you shoot him now, everything will calm down. Without Tusos, who woke them, the other Indians will become sensible, as fast as they are. you can. You will take him alive; you will have every groin in the territory following him. We had three years of this, you can stop it now. ' As expected, Captain Lance refuses to kill Toussos, and Lance’s decision to bring the Indian back into action leads to action. <br /> <br /> Colonel Drum (Herbert Hayes from Union Station) surprises Lance when he tells him that Tusos should have been shot. Like this, they should get Tucsos to another post. Everyone from soldiers to Joe Harmony knows that taking Tusos to Fort Grant is asking to die. Apaches are in the mountains, and the fort is in force. In the meantime, we meet Captain Eversham’s daughter, Katie Eversham (Barbara Payton of Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye), and young lieutenant William Holloway (Gig Young of “They Shoot Horses, Are They?”) narrative complication. You see, Lance and Holloway want to marry Katie. Obviously, Katie wants Lance. Colonel Drum refuses to allow Lance to take Tusos to Fort Grant because the Drum cannot spare Lance. The drum changes orders, and Holloway gets the job at the last minute, and everyone is shocked. Lance never changed the order. In addition, Lance saw Katie and Holloway kiss publicly, and everyone thinks that Lance reassigned Holloway due to jealousy. Indeed, one officer notes that rewriting orders for a possible rewriting of the Bible is possible. As expected, Tuxos fled, and the surviving soldiers and Harmony returned the dead Holloway. <br /> <br /> While the Drum expects that a convoy of 400 soldiers will arrive on any given day, Harmony indicates to Lance that Tusos will attack. Tusos saw the fort and knows that they have no strength. Lance asks to take 6 or 7 people of his choice to Fort Invincible and prevent Tusos from collecting a military party. A narrow place in the mountains does not allow Indians to go by force; instead, they should go one at a time. Lance believes that his people can prevent them from arriving before the aid convoy arrives. The drum gives him permission, and Lance chooses the worst people. They all hate him and willingly kill him. <br /> <br /> “Only Valiant” is an example of a new western military breed after the Second World War. This is not a fanatical John Ford Western. Indeed, the people of Lance want to kill him, and this foreshadows the attitude of the troops during the Vietnam War, when they robbed their officers. Lance is responsible for all but a few who know the circumstances that led to the change of order, and Holloway was responsible for the details. Black and white photography underlines the terrible nature of this western. “Only the Valiant” is the last western way to the last minute of delay. Peck reportedly hated this film, but then it’s not a stupid western in Technicolor. In any case, “Only Valiant” justifies its origin from Warner Brothers. He is small, but significant and dirty, with many dramatic and unpleasant characters, almost a western “Dirty Dozen”.
