Today I watched this film at the Philadelphia Film Festival, and I enjoyed it. This is an interesting and skilful analysis of the overly widespread revelation that the marriage of our parents was more flawed and difficult than we originally imagined. In addition, this film is an excellent example of the process of revealing the truth about the lives of our parents after their death and the problems associated with it. However, I found the sound quality (recording and editing) relatively poor and annoying. *** This may well be related to the specific conditions of the theater and projection. *** I am not a director / student or something like that and do not pretend to have a real understanding of the sound production process, but as a consumer I found the audio part of the film distracting. In particular, I heard very unpleasant noises made by the lips during the film (especially one long interview with the younger sister), and often the level of background noise was higher in volume than the voices of people (for example, the scene when a small group sorted through mothers' documents). anyone else saw this movie, noticed something about the sound ... thanks
