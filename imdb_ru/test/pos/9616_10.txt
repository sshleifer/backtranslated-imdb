Well, as a lifelong fan of Kung Fu movies, I have to say that this is one of the best I've ever seen. Of course, in the plot there is nothing special, but the person entertains him. Like most movies of the genre. This film is filled with action and not the boar of its viewers. It's damn fun when I look, I have a smile all the time on my face. It also affects future films such as Kill Bill. (Many of the Kill Bill sound effects are taken, for example, from this film.) This is an important preview for all famous kung fu viewers. A form open to closure, this film is filled with fights that are truly among the best I've ever seen in the genre. There are several Kung Fu films that match the magic and entertainment of this film. So, if you are looking for a movie about the great Kung Fu, be sure to watch this movie.
