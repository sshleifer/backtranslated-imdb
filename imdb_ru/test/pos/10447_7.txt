Spoilers: this film has its problems, but in the end it conveys the message. I liked it because it ends up with how things really happen. The good guy tries and tries, his heart is broken several times, but in the end there is no typical Hollywood finale. It ends with the fact that such things always end, or at least they always have in my experience and that of friends. Anyone who thinks that the end of this is not the way it actually happens, as it seemed in the first comment, believing that the girl will come, will understand that he is meeting an asshole who treats her badly because he is not at all up to her things are either naive or live in a more perfect world than me. I give him 7/10, extra points simply because he was not afraid to finish on a note, did not give real permission, only the main character was left beaten, confused, and one, like many people of countless generations were before.
