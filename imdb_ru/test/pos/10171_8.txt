Alfred Hitchcock's more confident story about the film, which he shot twenty-one a year ago, is infinitely superior to the original. Hitchcock himself said that his first version was the work of an amateur, and although this is certainly a good film, he seems to be right. However, this remake, although definitely better, is not one of Hitchcock’s best works. This, of course, does not mean that it is not good, it is simply more than self-indulgence, and it delays. Hitchcock seems to be too interested in pulling out certain elements, and these are parts of the film that do not quite fit the plot, which can become annoying. Some of these protracted episodes, such as the script in which James Stewart and Doris Day eat in a Moroccan restaurant, are good because they help to establish a different culture in which our American heroes find themselves, but there is an opera for every scene of the restaurant makes the movie worse. <br /> <br /> The story tells about an elderly doctor and his wife, who are going to Morocco to rest with their young son. There they meet a Frenchman in a bus and another middle-aged couple in a restaurant. However, things are going badly when the Frenchman dies from a knife in his back, soon after whispering something to the doctor. The holiday then turns into a full-blown nightmare, when the couple's son is kidnapped, which causes them to interrupt him and go to London to try to find him. The film is very strong paranoia, and he manages to endure it to the end. In fact, I would even say that this is the most paranoid movie Hitchcock has ever made. Like most Hitchcock films, this film is very exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire movie, and only the aforementioned operatic sequence stands out as the moment in which tension dissipates. The film also features not only a little humor, which gives a carefree relief to pathological events and actually works quite well. <br /> <br /> The original version of this story was perfectly supported by the fantastic Peter. Lorre. Unfortunately, this film does not benefit from his presence, but this is made up for by the performances of the marvelous James Stewart and Doris Day. James Stewart is the man who will always claim the crown of "the greatest actor of all time." All his collaboration with Hitchcock demonstrates fascinating ideas from him, and this one is no different. (Although his best performance remains in "Smith Goes to Washington"). Stewart conveys all the courage, conviction and weakness of a man who lost his child and will do everything to return him brilliantly. In fact, this is one of the best things in this film; You can really feel the loss of a pair everywhere, and that makes it even more exciting. Doris Day, on the other hand, is a rather strange choice of actors for this film. She is definitely a good actress, but she is more connected with musicals, and seeing her in a thriller is rather strange (even if she bends her vocal cords a bit). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned; This is not Hitchcock's best movie, but it does have something to rejoice about, and although I would recommend Hitchcock’s many films before recommending this one, I’ll definitely give it two thumbs.
