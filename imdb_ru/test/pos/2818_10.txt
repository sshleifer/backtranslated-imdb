I love to see the main character, in this film her name was Rose. Rose raised many interesting questions on her way to achieving her goal. Is it possible to achieve peace and inner satisfaction through external means? Does this teach our society? Could someone be a victim of memory that could lead to the persecution of others? Is someone responsible for being the product of his environment? To what extent can you control or control your environment? How is a “typical” person like or different from Rose? Finally, would the outcome or the story change if it was from another country, for example, from France or Italy? I liked that this film caused me all these questions, while he entertained, stimulated and made me guess to the end! Every time I watched it, I found out more about the film and about myself.
