This show was incredible, but too esoteric for most people. If you had not really seen the European variety in the 70s or 80s (or at least Mexican), the whole performance probably would have been lost to you. If you had, this show was dead on a spit of satire of a false spectacle and superficiality, in which these shows are immersed in their worst. "Viva Variety" is a show in which every time it tries to get off the ground in each episode, but always plunges into a fight. and the actions went very wrong. Johns is joined by the owners, “Johnny Bluegins,” a dumb jerk who seems to have been named because blue jeans are a very popular product in his country, and this means that children will like it, which of course not. <br /> <br /> The result was a fun parody parody. Imagine a dispute that probably occurred on BACKSTAGE in the last days of the Sonny & Cher Show. Now imagine that this happens ONCE in front of you, and the stars are trying to maintain composure. Now add raw actions and a European mentality (tuxedos, dresses, booze, accents and smoke). NOW you have "Viva Variety". <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard a musician whose music was written for other musicians? Too conceptual? Viva Variety did it for comedians. WAY is too esoteric for a standard American audience. It was funny as in hell. And doomed.
