We all know about Gulliver's travels. Tiny people, yes, of course. Liliputi. Giants too, some of us may remember. Someone may remember the word yahoo from here. That would be a stop for most people. <br /> <br /> Swift's book is omnipresent in school libraries. This was what I read for the first time, and there were a lot of people who read it the last time. It is treacherously frivolously written, like many old adventure books. Kids can read this. However, it is dripping with satire, black and uncompromising. I think this is what most screenwriters forget when they adapt this film. <br /> <br /> However, this film is remembered. Our hero, Ted Danson, gives a decent and serious job as a person adapted to the world, which is thrown into mysterious countries, just like ours. Gulliver's Travel criticizes everything. Theists, scientists, government, ordinary people, ethnicity, humanity itself. Few were spared, and most of the satire today is just as fresh. <br /> <br /> The film, although very true to the story, also dares to add new perspectives, and it all works very well. The author of the script deserves every praise for the ability to balance so well between time and activity (that is, not boring). <br /> <br /> Production values ​​go far beyond the television movie. With some marketing, this film would work well at the box office. All the fantastic worlds that Gulliver visits are made well, explained in detail and often very funny, much like the book of Swift. <br /> <br /> All the actors are professionals, as this is a British production. Mary Steenbergen stands out with Dr. James Fox Bates, a frighteningly cruel doctor who, like Nurse Ratched, wants only the best patient. <br /> <br /> So a modest offer, if you ever get a chance to get this movie, do it. This is a real pleasure.
