When I first bought this film, I had doubts about it, although the cast was quite impressive. But seeing this, I really do not regret spending the money. In fact, I would like to spend it over and over and over on films like this ... An absurd combination of humor, drama, thrills and big questions. This is exactly what makes it a great movie. Well, some may not like what they see, and some may even turn it off after a while. your loss He has a wonderful way to solve problems that we all faced in one way or another, and the characters that you think you donâ€™t like, throughout the film turn out to be those you really love for in a short time. For anyone with an open mind, with a sense of humor and life - watch this film, I promise, you will not be disappointed!
