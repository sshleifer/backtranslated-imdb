For the most part, I only enjoy the movie that allows you to move away from the current time in the future or the past. This film is pure escapism. The dance begins almost immediately, and Debra Paget in her purple harem bikini dress, in my opinion, has no equal in the movies. Her dance, though sultry, surpasses her dance in Fritz Lang's Tigre of Echnapur, available on DVD, where she played the dancer of the Temple Sita. <br /> <br /> One of the problems of the film is the closed setting. There are several outdoor scenes shot, and they, like other scenes, are a bit claustrophobic. The same places are used again and again, but with some interesting secret passages and waterways. Her secret dual identity is absolutely unbelievable with beauty of such magnitude. Debra even owns a saber and keeps 2 enemy soldiers in fear on the stairs, she can do it all. <br /> <br /> What works is Debra Paget like a princess. With her beauty, she will certainly be the center of attention anywhere at any time in history. This film, we hope, will become available on DVD, will be a mandatory acquisition. In general, with humor, I liked it. <br /> <br />
