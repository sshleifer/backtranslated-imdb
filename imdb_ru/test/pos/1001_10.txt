Despite the title, and unlike some other stories of love and war, this film is not too sticky and pink, because love is like a rose: that is, with thorns. The four main actors set their characters realistic and with good feeling and balance between the tragic and the practical. <br /> <br /> The cabaret / chanson-Esquire music and lyrics (sung by Keira Knightley herself) entice the viewer deeper and deeper in the film, from one place to another, between fierce war and among peaceful love too biographical, but it’s mostly a romantic story, though, therefore, it follows the life of Dylan Thomas and the triangular relationships that are imbued with joy and jealousy. <br /> <br /> London this time is visualized from a different angle, Dylan’s bohemian life during the bombings of the Germans unfolds in the floating atmosphere of small bedrooms, pubs and bars. Independent women, soldiers and charismatic poet are constantly engulfed in feelings of love and anger. <br /> <br /> Maybe the end is too twisted and to some extent hangs over the rest of the film, but overall this is a beautiful romantic story.
