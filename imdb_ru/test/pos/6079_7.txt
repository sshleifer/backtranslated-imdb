The book is better than the film, mainly because of the prose of the writer Honditier. Before I saw this film, someone who saw it told me that the love depicted in this film is not real. After seeing this film, I see how her disbelief in this regard could also distract other viewers. To be honest, some of the vivid manifestations of love were ludicrous and seemed to be on the verge of a parody. But by the end everyone should understand that this is a great work of art. This is not specifically about love, it uses “love” to dialectically reveal the human gap or the arbitrary boundaries of countries that help justify war and hate. It is about misunderstanding and blindly following things that supposedly divide us. The critical scene for the real theme of this film is when the requests of the hero or antihero for help for his lost lover in the desert are ignored and ignored for the reasons shown in this scene. This film is also about hope and forgiveness, about hope embodied in the interracial relationship between the recovering character Binoche and the Indian minesweeper (echoed in the relationship of a Sikh friend with his white counterpart, who ultimately dies pointlessly) and the forgiveness embodied in Caravaggio. and then crowding out what he thinks will be confessions of a hero for his military "crimes" (betrayal of the country). I think the film could have been made even better than it is. I don’t know if a more realistic depiction of the circumstances of love would make the real themes and moments of this film even more obvious or not, but I agree that this film is not about realistic romantic love, because the people behind it. The artwork or film implies an early scene. when possible lovers first meet. The hero tells that a new car, a broken car, a fast car, etc. (I paraphrase) is still just a car, no matter what adjective you put in front of it. She answers, but parental love, platonic love, romantic love, etc. are very different kinds of love. This is ironic, because this film is really about the only love that all people should want, which is love of the world (or non-materialistic things, which are usually the real causes of war, embodied in something that most of us want for example, "cars"). let's say). Otherwise, we may remain in a hopeless situation to die in a cave in a vast desert with ancient wall drawings / figures of swimmers, indicating that the seas and the life-supporting waters that had once been there almost disappeared. I believe that the “English patient” won an Oscar because of these loud messages not specifically for his description of romantic love. Awards, as a rule, go that way. The relationship of the hero and heroine was necessary to attract an audience, unfortunately, this view of love is outdated in the era of divorce, and so many lonely people who seem to be unable to come together on so many levels, so ridiculous versions of mythology into love are difficult to penetrate even in dreams in which the love of cinema has always been, especially in good old Hollywood. The film may not meet the expectations of people, but the film of 7 is worth seeing anyway.
