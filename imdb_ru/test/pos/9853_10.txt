In Sudan, Arabs rule and constantly fight with Christians and animists who inhabit the southern part of this East African country. This film tells about a group of boys from the Dinka tribe, a tribe of herders, who were left orphans after their village was destroyed and their families were killed in a brutal attack by Arab forces. Most of these boys are currently teenagers and got the nickname “Lost Boys”. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker follows a group of “Lost Boys” on their journey, as they were accepted as refugees in the United States. where they land in houston. Those who have been accepted as refugees are given celebrity status because they feel (from what they have heard) that America is amazing. A trip from Sudan to America is like a “trip to paradise,” says one young man. A huge group is invited for their departure, and they are told that they should do the Sudan well, and as soon as they are educated, to return to the Sudan so that they can contribute to the Dinka community. They are also warned not to look like “those with baggy pants” who are responsible for the negative stereotype of black men, and, no matter what, do not forget the Dink culture. <br /> <br /> You observe how boys come from a third world country to America and how they try to integrate into American society, because they have practically nothing to do with this rich world, where everything is massively overproduced and overly consumed. They are taught cleanliness and how to use all utilities that we take for granted every day. Sometimes it's funny, humiliating others. <br /> <br /> Listening to their comments about black Americans and American society / culture is quite interesting. As the film progresses, you see how American culture begins to spoil their previously modest thinking. <br /> <br /> One of the boys, Peter, was not happy with the work and earning enough money to survive, so he got up and moved from Houston to Kansas City so that he could get an education. When other boys visit him, they say that they cannot go to any schools. The main reason they came to America was to get an education, and the media said the boys were brought from Sudan for training. This is because the boys were given an arbitrary age, which makes them older than they really are, which prevents them from entering high school. <br /> <br /> The film matches images from Houston to Kansas. We observe how Peter goes to school, where he supports a group of conservative Christian children, and how Santiago is trying to go to a driving school (although he still goes without a license) and works at Walmart. We see how Peter struggles with school life when he tries to create his school basketball team, and Santiago has problems with work, rent, reducing tensions at home in Sudan and, above all, with loneliness. > <br /> It has come to the point that the boys want to return to Sudan and tell them that everything they learn about America is a lie. “You have to do this alone here, do it all alone,” says one of the boys. A cursed message to the lifestyle of a liberal-capitalist society, showing how it forces people to become radical individualists (a trend that has led to the creation of both neoconservative and radical Islamist movements). However, their biggest problem with America is that there is no time; Time is money, and we do not spend a second! <br /> <br /> Despite all this, boys never lose their sense of Dink culture. They celebrate South Sudan’s Liberation Day, which marks the day when the SPLA began fighting in Sudan, a struggle that continues today. They also meet with other “Lost Boys” on the anniversary of their arrival in America, where they discuss their experiences in America compared to what they had in Sudan. When asked, one boy said that if he could earn a living, he would prefer to live in Sudan. In America, too lonely, he adds. They never lose their sense of community, which was due to them as part of their culture! <br /> <br /> This film makes us think about how we live, makes us doubt the artificial happiness of materialism and the nature of our societies created within us. It will also change my view of the refugees, and I will never again take for granted how hard they should work and what immigrants mean for a country like my own, Canada. This is a wonderful movie. I laughed, I cried ... a very emotional journey and a very well-made documentary. 10 out of 10.
