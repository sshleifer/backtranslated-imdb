I am a Christian, and thought this film was pretty good! :) Although acting was not an Oscar award, I thought it was good, considering that the actors had limited acting experience at the time of making this film. <br /> <br /> Gospel Message and Transforming Power Jesus Christ was wonderfully explained. The message that the director was trying to convey (which is important, not how the characters dressed!) Definitely reached. The theme of attracting the main characters to participate in illegal drag racing was also a good idea (cool muscle cars, by the way). I think this film will definitely interest many young people. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this film, this is a great tool for witnesses! :)
