All the credit goes to the writer / director Gilles Mimuni, who fashioned this tortuous, perverted story of deception and betrayal. Keeping maximum control, he keeps the audience at arm's length, never allowing them to fully understand what is happening. Even his smart ending makes you guess. <br /> <br /> The three main performances are also top-notch: Vincent Cassel, Roman Bringer and Monica Bellucci do everything they can to add to the secret. Jean-Philippe Ecophie complements strength in his supporting role. It would be unfair to disclose the details of the plot or features of the characters. <br /> <br /> Thierry Arbogast effectively uses the camera to solve this riddle, while editing Cardina Biggerstaff keeps the story a step ahead of us. The theme of Peter Chase is very sublime in his marriage with the ideal of the script. <br /> <br /> Many may say that Gilles Mimouni is trying to solve some deeper questions regarding their love. For me, this is just an obsessive, elusive mystery that weaves an exciting web. Only the French are capable of this. Hollywood would spoil it with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Monday, March 2, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon <br /> <br /> No one makes a thriller like the French. When they get it right, they really get it right. <br /> <br /> Vincent Cassell intrigues as deceptive Max, Romana Beringer is obsessive as new Lisa, and Monica Bellucci is mysterious as the first Lisa. The plot from Gilles Mimuni is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and deadly crossed wires. <br /> <br /> All the merit should be that he manipulates the cunning plot, as well as the actions of the three leashes. Like Lucien, Jean-Philippe Ecoffi is strong and emotional. <br /> <br /> Friday, January 15, 1999 - Videos
