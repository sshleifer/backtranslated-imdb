Rajkumar Santoshi tries his hand at comedy and succeeds. One of the few good films in which Salman Khan is involved. Very funny movie from start to finish. All the characters are involved in the film and, believe me, there are many of them. Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Ravina Tandon, Karisma Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Vidzhu Hot, Jagdip, Deven Verma, Shakti Kapoor, Harish Patel, Tika Talsania and others. Direction, editing, sound is not at the proper level, but it still does not matter, because the actors more than make up for this part.
