Klaus Kinsky appeared in a significant amount of Western spaghetti during the 60s and early 70s; he usually cast minor roles as evil villains. Kooky Klaus gets a juicy lead role in the role of the Madman Johnny Laster, a dirty, daring and irresponsible sex maniac who comes up with a plan to kidnap the perfect heiress in order to get her significant inheritance. Johnny and his gang become wanted fugitives after the plan failed catastrophically. Writer / director Mario Costa skillfully creates a disgustingly irresistible portrait of a seriously ill and perverse piece of a snuff with a low standard of living: the plot unfolds at a steady pace, the tone, respectively, is sandy and serious, and the exciting fighting scenes are set with real skills and abilities (skirmishes in the quarries especially exciting and exciting). Ironically dressed in white, exuding an oily charisma from every rotten pore and jumping on beautiful women at every opportunity, Johnny Kinsky makes an amazingly eerie and monstrous cattle. Kinski is simply awesome, like this superbly repulsive character; He gets great support from juicy Gabriella Georgelli as a cute, fiery Saluna girl Juanita, Stephen Tedd as a cheerful Riccardo, Giovanni Pallavicino in the role of ruthless gang leader Machete, Giuliano Rafaella as a smart attorney Gary Pinkerton and Paolo Casella played a role on the role of the band, Giuliano Rafaella in the role of clever lawyer Gary Pinkerton and Paolo Casella in the role of the role played by the band, Giuliano Rafaella in the role of clever attorney . Kudos also for the dark and energetic score of Stelvio Cipriani. Worth seeing on Kinsky fans.
