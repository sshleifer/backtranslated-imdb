I always thought that the Return of Batman was a great continuation of Batman. The story was interesting, and Danny DeVito, Christopher Walken and Michael Keaton gave excellent performances. Also, let's face it, Tim Burton was a genius and made the character of the comic more just than Joel Skryumaher. <br /> <br /> Plot: Oswald Kobblepot, also known as Penguin (played by Danny DeVito), was left by his parents as a child for deformation. He uses this as a pretext to disguise a sinister conspiracy to kidnap Gotham's firstborn with the help of his thugs (Red Triangle Brigade) and the very shadow magnate Max Shrek (played by Christopher Walken). Max Shrek later makes Penguin mayor of Gotham. Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is pushed out of the window by Max Shrek and is animated by cats. Later, she develops cat quality and seeks to destroy Max Shrek and Batman. The reasons for which she wants to destroy the dark knight are not explained. <br /> <br /> Opinion: The Return of Batman is a classic. It has a darker feel in terms of the atmosphere. Tim Burton has always been able to make a dark background attractive. Michael Keaton is still sharp as Batman. Danny Devito shoots the show in the role of Oswald Cobblot / Penguin. If you think about it, he would have done a better Disrupter for the Spawn film than John Leguizamo. Michelle Pfeiffer has given Catwoman more personality than Halle Berry ever could. Max Shrek - one of the best roles of Christopher Walken. The main reason I like Batman Returns is because itâ€™s fun. It is not only creative, but also fun. Something very big budget films in our days is not enough. The Batman series goes to the dogs after Tim Burton decided not to do anymore. You do not believe me, look at Batman forever, Batman and Robin. Thank God that Christopher Nolan breathed life into the Batman series.
