Well, when it comes to storylines, this film is far from believable, and also a bit stupid. Nevertheless, despite the many shortcomings, the film has time to work - provided that you turn off your brain and just allow yourself to enjoy all this rage. If you can't, then you probably won’t like this movie at all. <br /> <br /> In one of the weirdest scenes of the 1930s, Robert Montgomery plays a guy living near the Arctic Circle in a wireless station. It is unknown how exactly he came to such a remote outpost, but a constant group of guests comes to this very, very lonely and isolated existence - even though years have passed since he saw no one but the Eskimos. <br /> <br /> First, Reginald Owen and Mirna Loy arrive when their plane crashes. Allegedly they are on their way to Montreal - as they got it far from the course, it's impossible to believe! Reginald is a stuffy and boring guy who really cares about Montgomery, since Robert hasn’t seen a woman for a very long time, and Owen seems constantly afraid that Montgomery wants to steal Loy for himself. As for Montgomery, this is exactly what his plans are! For a long time, you never understand why Loy is engaged to Owen - because he is as attractive as raw bread. <br /> <br /> Soon, Loy and Montgomery fall in love, but this is all for nothing, when, Again and again, the old bride Montgomery comes to announce that she is there to marry him !! Given that for more than two years she had never written or refused to follow him, Montgomery naturally assumed that the relationship was over - but the sudden arrival of annoying the bride and annoying was enough to destroy the plans of Loy and Montgomery. <br /> <br /> You can see for yourself how this is all decided. As for the film, the plot is very stupid and contrived - I can not protect it. BUT, it's also quite funny and charming, and I see this movie as a strange comedy, which is only a step or two below modern films, such as “BRINGING UP BABY”. Stupid, a little, but also very cute. It is worth seeing, despite the fact that it is not particularly believable.
