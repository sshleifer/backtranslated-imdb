This movie is great! Fear of watching documentaries? Cancel your psychiatrist and see the story of little Dieter. You will not believe how fascinating this beautiful film is until you have experienced it. I look forward to saying that it comes from virtually any Vietnam War movie, including Apocalypse Now. This is a real story, this is a personal story, a story about the love of flying, the dream of becoming a pilot and a nightmare, when he is knocked over the territory of the enemy. Everything is filmed in the style of “return to ...” - on the spot, Herzog asks questions, Dieter answers them with a memorable German-English accent and with an excellent memory indicates what happened about 25 years ago. There is this part that I told friends again and again: after jumping out of a US Navy plane, Dieter becomes a Vietcong prisoner of war. Blindfolded, most of his days are pulled through the jungles of Southeast Asia for miles — on bare feet. Exhausted, humiliated, disorientated, exhausted and covered with infectious wounds, they arrive in a small, friendly village to spend the night. The next morning, after passing a few hours, Dieter discovered that someone had stolen his wedding ring from his finger. That's all. He can no longer tolerate. He begins to cry, as a result of complete exhaustion. Viet Cong men react with surprise. Dieter manages to explain what happened. Immediately the group returns to the village and starts looking for the man who stole the ring. They find a man, immediately cut off his finger and return the ring to Dieter. - The film is full of these stunning and surprising situations. Huge cultural differences, the clash of the East and the West, the fear of the unknown (i.e. Everything behind America, on the one hand, the Asian jungle and its secrets on the other) can be felt throughout the film. Back problems? This is because you sat on the edge of your seat for two hours and did not notice.
