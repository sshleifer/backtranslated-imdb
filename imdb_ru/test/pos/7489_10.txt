ONE GOOD THING: This hidden treasure of criminal drama is incredibly entertaining from beginning to end. An example of low-budget filmmaking at its best, screenwriter / director Skip Woods seems to use everything he could find (for example: Lamborghini, a super model, a phone for cows) and a rumor for dialogue to add levels of satire to the plot and everything else. its camera settings. <br /> <br /> OTHER GOOD: This film seems to be made for a DVD era, with several segments that make up a great story (similar to the work of Tarantino and Desperate Robert Rodriguez). In each “chapter” of the film, the main character Thomas Jane spends one day at home, meeting with quick and memorable performances by Aaron Eckhart, Glen Plummer, Mickey Rourke, Michael Jeter, James LeGros and the unforgettable role of Polina Porizkova. <br /> <br /> EVEN ANOTHER GOOD: Not really a “good” thing, but incredibly shocking and memorable ... Everyone who sees this film remembers one important scene. Despite the fact that “Liberation” will always be remembered because of the terrible rape of Ned Beattie, Thursday will go down in history as a film in which a woman is violently raping an unwitting man. Unforgettable. <br /> <br /> ONE BAD THING: the name makes people think that it is somehow related (or derived) to the Friday Cinema series featuring Ice Cube. <br /> <br /> GRADE: A +
