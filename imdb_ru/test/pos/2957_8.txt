Clayton Moore made his last official screen appearance in the role of the Masked Man in Leslie Selander’s epic adventure “The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold”, in which JJ Silverheads played the lead role as his loyal Indian intelligence agent Tonto. Selander was an experienced Western leader for 40 years in films and on television, with more than 100 westerns as a director. This fast-growing equestrian opera took on a revisionist perspective in its portrayal of Native Americans, who gradually gained recognition from Hollywood cabarets in 1950 after director Delmar Daves paved the way with James Stewart’s Western Broken Arrow. Racial intolerance appears as the main theme in the script of Robert Schaefer and Eric Freivald. Having written 13 episodes of the television series Lone Ranger, Schaefer and Freivald were well acquainted with the formula, but they raised the stakes on this theatrical outlet. Our vigilant heroes rush to the aid of the Indians, who are killed by white hombras with hoods for no apparent reason. The mystery about the identity of these killers and the reasons for their murderous behavior is revealed quite early, so you do not need to guess what is happening. <br /> <br /> Although the violence in this saga with Selander seems tame by modern standards, the fact that the Lone Ranger shoots a bad guy to kill him in one scene and not hurt him, and that vile lady kills a double accomplice, Throwing a tomahawk in the back between the shoulder blades, was rather impudent. The television series never reached such a length, and when the Lone Ranger owned his six-pointer weapon, he fired the villain’s fist and did not blow it up. Another discrepancy here is that the Indians lynch one of the raiders and torture him for information, but they are never accused of stealing this minion. Douglas Kennedy was not villainous statue Laila Böttger, threatening a masked man in a film directed by Stuart Heyslera "The Lone Ranger", but he himself has proved good enough as a cowardly criminal who do not hesitate to kill one of his henchmen, when the villain threatens to divulge his name and the identity of his buddies a group of vengeful Indians. <br /> <br /> “The Lone Ranger and the Lost Golden City” begins with a narration about the origin of the main character in the mask as an ambush Texas Ranger and his transformation into the Lone Ranger with Tonto playing the role of his partner. This opening two-minute advanced training is a great way to unleash a series-oriented character so that everyone, including non-Lone Ranger fans, is on an equal footing. The main story about the gang of ruthless white hoods, which are called "not surprising", the hooded raiders start with the fact that they kill the Indians and steal the medallions worn around the neck. The Lone Ranger and Tonto arrive too late to intervene, but they find a child hidden nearby. Taking the child and the dead Indian, they travel to a nearby Spanish mission led by Padre Vincente Esteban (Ralph Moody from The Outsider) and give him the body and the baby. Initially, Padre must assure Indian maiden Paviva (Lisa Montell from Gabi) that a masked man means that they are not harmful and are their friend. The Padre sends Tonto to town for a doctor, Dr. James Rolfe (Dean Frederiks from Gun Fever), and Tonto quickly faces trouble in the form of a frisky city lawyer, Sheriff Oscar Mattison (Charles Watts from Giant). ) who hates Indians. Tonto is trying to see a doctor who treats prisoners in a sheriff's prison, and Mathison's people begin to annoy him when Rolfe intervenes and returns to the assignment. <br /> <br /> In the end, the Lone Ranger and Tonto can capture one of the hooded raiders other than the Indian Redbird (Maurice Hara from "Drum Beat"), and his brave fellows kidnap the minions and take him back to their the village. They stab him and shoot him with arrows to weaken his tongue. Chief villain Ross Brady (Douglas Kennedy from Hell Crossing) and his cohort William (Lane Bradford from Devil Canyon) leave for the village, and Brady uses his Winchester to kill his captured henchman. Little did Brady know what his minion was saying. The Lone Ranger and Tonto arrive shortly afterwards and argue Redbird for treason. Redbird tells them what the man said before he died, and the Lone Ranger decides to take a disguise so that he can learn more. He pretended to be a bounty hunter gentleman with a mustache and an artificial southern accent. <br /> <br /> Despite its short 83-minute duration, “The Lone Ranger and the Lost Golden City” experience neither excitement nor surprises. Selander continues to move forward in full swing. The dialogue is largely explanatory, not memorable, as Schaefer and Freivald promote the plot more often than spring surprises, but there is one major surprise that is associated with a good Indian theme. There is also a scene where the Lone Ranger puts forward his credo of justice, accessible to all under the law, at the time when the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Earl Warren, began to make important high court decisions that recognize and soften the conditions associated with racial segregation of civil rights, the separation of church and state, and the procedure for police arrest in the United States. One thing that distinguishes the “Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold” from its predecessor is its epic scale with memories of the age of the Spanish conquistadors with a bit of science fiction associated with the form of a devastating meteor. As a rule, the stories of the “Lone Ranger” were limited to the 19th century, without being carried away by European history. No, The Lone Ranger was not the first film about the Spanish conquistadors. "Seven Golden Cities" by Robert D. Webb (1955) concerned the Spaniards, who were looking for places of the same name in the southwest, and western Selander knocked out the "Gold of the Seven Saints" by Gordon Douglas (1961).
