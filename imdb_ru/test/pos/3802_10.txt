This must be one of the most magnificent things I have ever seen in a movie. I don’t know how serious it is, as it seems, but it hardly matters. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. Packaging and marketing do this only because you * know * that mothers often have to reprogram their child so that he perceives our reality after he has checked it in the video store, expecting something completely different. Look at the roadmap on one side! And where else in America can you see how a ten-year-old child swears as much as this one, and then snatched his eyes by the pervert of Crime's rival Miracle Zed? And this scene of the food inspector is the best! The number of well-known actors in this film is one of the best: soon, much sooner than you think, you will also find yourself saying: “Is that meat roll? Is this Drew Barrymore? Doctor Holidayk from Star Trek: Voyager? Is it a flea? Is it the owner of the Twin Peaks sawmill pumping protein out of the car's exhaust? And isn't this guy from a new movie about Rob Zombie? He is very similar to Shrek. "I think my favorite scene is at the very end, with Phil in full force. I mean, please, why are there more films than shown on airplanes? This director barely has anything besides his name “Return to Salem", but in this creation he shows a true stumbling genius man! If you are an intellectual looking for something that could celebrate your evening, I highly recommend this film for satisfaction. the film is too funny, but imagine that it was taken out of context: * boy wrestling I’m holding my hand over an aggressive meatloaf, which seems to be obsessed with getting rid of anger, being not accepted in Guns N Roses, looks over his shoulder and sees a doctor from Voyager come to the bar * Can you imagine what any surfer of the channel would think half-active for the last six years after seeing this? Now imagine if you really care about Meat Loaf or Voyager for a start! Or imagine if you're a fan of fleas. Notice, fans of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, this movie contains great music, but its soundtrack is more plasticine than Mad Max 3. What does this mean for you? This is a backward, inverted Mongoloid cousin, sister-mother-puppy from The Rocky Horror Picture Show. How about when Gus's sleeve flies back onto his arm in an act of mastery of the quality of the special effects of cable access? When I watched this film, at the suggestion of my cousin, who watched half of the film in a fit of half-conscious childhood in the early half of the nineties, and since then I have been haunted by vague memories of him, I have not slept for three days. It made me laugh! Of course, this is also an alarm movie. The music does not encourage expectations, but ultimately it comes to the fact that it is fully established that the American Censorship Committee explicitly missed this film completely, and everything can happen in it, and probably this will happen at any moment when Gus turns the corner or see as much as the camera angle changes. I caught myself on the fact that these cards can fall out of his window at any second. Watch this movie. Awesome!
