I saw this black and white comedy film yesterday at the London Film Festival. It is constructively compared to “Pulp Fiction,” but perhaps it is closer to the structure of Amores Perrot and to the more reckless mood of clerks Kevin Smith. Four floors intersect in a French diner. The first vignette is that Frank (Edward Baer) cannot hold a diner. The waitress Susie (Anna Muglalis) took pity and told him her story. The second has two incompetent kidnappers: Leon (Boules Lanners) and Paul (Serge Lariviere) take a teenage girl from her rich family. Unfortunately for them, she is suicidal, and her family does not seem to want her return. The third is a dialogue between two aging rock stars who run into each other at a diner (Alain Bashung and Arno play themselves). The final part tells about four former criminals who secretly take out their old partner from the hospital to visit their old refuge, which has since turned into ?? snack bar. Epilogue returns to Frank and Suzy to complete their story (in fact, this is not an epilogue, but rather a conclusion). <br /> <br /> The structure doesn't really work. Stories are not as intertwined as in Pulp Fiction. In addition, the diner is not decisive for the action of at least two of the stories in how the car accident was decisive in the four stories about Amores Perrot. The quality of individual stories varies. The cover story is a nice idea, with a couple of good jokes, but it won't work; and the reunion of the rock star is pointless and boring. On the other hand, the abduction story is ridiculous, although its connection with the visitor is insignificant. The most balanced and successful story is the story of Frank and Suzy. <br /> <br /> This film is not entirely successful, but it has moments of interest and fun. I look forward to seeing more of Samuel Bencetrit’s work from the script and the director.
