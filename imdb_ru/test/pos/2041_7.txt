<br /> <br /> SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW <br /> <br /> “Long Kiss for the Night” is another vivid example of the common ailment of many modern films; it starts with a very interesting concept - a trained killer, whose memory has been erased, regains consciousness of himself - and the initial installation is interesting, but then it seems that the authors do not know very well where to go next, and all this calms down more and more confusing and / or meaningless ways, leaving a disappointing taste for something that was good, but promised to be much better. The villains are remarkably unremarkable, and even Jackson's humorous twist seems more like something from his days before Pulp Fiction; Harlin, like on Thug Island, seems to have made every effort so that no one pushes his then-wife into the background. Her hero is by far the best in the film, and this fact makes you feel even more upset because they could not do something better with him. <br /> <br /> However, in this film there is still something that for me distinguishes it from the usual Hollywood actor and puts it above average, if only fair. This is something very subtle, I cannot understand what I am capable of; it is an anxious, cold, dark, even painful edge, a nightmarish and unreal feeling, a decadent air, an evil stripe that continues to appear in various ways. This is a dark reddish photo and an almost eternal night in which the characters live, this is in Samantha’s dream in front of the mirror, in her angry eyes and smile, when she is going to kill a person or when she announces that she will like to look at her sworn enemy. die with your daughter, listening, it's in Mitch's return behind the wheel of a car, while he splashes so much blood out of his mouth that he can barely speak ... I don't know, this is the atmosphere, something I can't determine, but that scares me a little and makes this film still strangely intriguing for me.
