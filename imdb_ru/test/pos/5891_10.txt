The best years of our life perfectly reflect the era of my youth and the feelings of that time. The cast was equally wonderful. Perhaps it was Dana Andrews best role in his career, and he also had to be nominated for an Oscar. There are so many wonderful scenes in this film that itâ€™s almost impossible to list them. Cinematography is one of the best movies. This film is a time capsule of what happened in the 1940s. Be sure to watch the movie for any real movie fan. Some critics say that this film has aged. I disagree. The theme of human desire is timeless. And the obstacles faced by veterans returning from war will always be with us. It's just a great movie that can be watched over and over.
