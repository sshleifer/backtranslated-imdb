** 1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and John Abrahams. Directed by Jome Colle Serra. <br /> <br /> Another classic horror movie, converted with a crazy teenage game, despite the grizzlies and creative death. Based on Vincent Price's movie "House of Wax Figures" of 1953, where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures. Still with a fantastic stage design that turns the whole house into wax, the film is a typical classic horror remake, such as the classic Texas chainsaw slaughter of Tob Hooper in 1974, later reworked despite the creativity and so-called action, the film was still just awful picture. Directed by Serra showed mild enthusiasm in his direction, but still worth seeing. My final rating is 7/10.
