I was fully involved in the story, but I was wondering if I shouldnâ€™t have been so sympathetic to the plight of the character Hurt for respect. Because when it comes down, I really think that glam reporters like Barbara Walters are the devil. ... or maybe the filmmakers told us that we are all ignorant supporters of fur news.
