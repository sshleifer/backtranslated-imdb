LE CERCLE ROUGE is a very good film, although it suffers a little because there have already been similar films. In many respects, the film resembles previous robberies, such as RIFIFI, GRAND SLAM and many others. Thus, although director Melville and the actors did an excellent job, it all seems like a deja vu case. Because of this, it was hard for me to give this great movie a higher score. <br /> <br /> One unusual aspect of the film is how fraudsters get together. Instead of the usual means, Vogel escapes from prison and accidentally meets with Corey, a professional criminal who has just been released from prison! Both are not bad, but for the most part of the film they worked in parallel until they met. In addition, as expected, most of the film deals with meticulous details in planning and executing a crime. I also appreciated how in the film the scammers were shown in such a cold and detached way - something relatively common in French crime films, but rarely found in American films until recent years. <br /> <br /> In general, very well thought out and worthy of seeing ... if you don't mind that it seems a bit repetitive, you will see a great game, directing and tremendous tension.
