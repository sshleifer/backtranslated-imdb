This film is one of the most amazing examples of convincing and cunning filmmaking I've ever seen. The duke seems to reflect the almost transcendental tragedy and beauty of Dieterâ€™s history, as well as his charming personal character. By the end of the film, I was left to wish that I had the opportunity to meet with Dieter before his death. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, cinematography is very intimate and strikingly beautiful. The narrative is confusing, with a great understanding of the subject and its ability to experience and reproduce traumatic events. Few documentary filmmakers have such a strong ability to invest their audience in a character so carefully. This film is a must see !!!
