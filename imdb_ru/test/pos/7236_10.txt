Tromao and Juliet (1996) is another jewel in the film archive Troma Studios. For example, "Poisonous Avenger", "War of Trom", "Class of nuclear bombs", "Terrible horror" and a sergeant. Kabukiman N.Yu.P.DD This film is an instant Troma classic. James Gunn tells Romeo and Juliet about the medieval tragedy and reinterprets it as a modern street punk drama. If you have seen or read the play before, nothing much has changed, except for the fact that it was "trotizirovana." <br /> <br /> Lloyd Kaufman adds his own perverted vision to the script and makes it a very enjoyable movie. Actors do a very good job with the script. I was surprised at how well they conducted the dialogue, much better than some big-budget Hollywood actors using a monstrous budget and expensive sets. I really liked this movie. Lloyd Kaufman does not disappoint, because you know what to expect from his films and other productions of Troma. I would rather watch one of his films and have fun than watch a boring expensive film with spoiled paid actors, inept scripts, lazy directors and these horrible PCG special effects. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. If you like funny movies with unusual special effects, amazing acting and inspirational directors, then this movie is just for you!
