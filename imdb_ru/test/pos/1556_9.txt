I gave these 9 stars out of a possible 10. If there were only a few tiny plot lines in it, I would give them 10. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this is a very interesting film. <br /> <br /> Judith Ivy, who plays a nice old folly, should have won an Oscar for her performance. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace (depicting Alice), whom I had never seen before, also does an excellent job with her work. and has the sexiest body I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> In shock, to curse the old car, Alice poked her head out of the net. for Florida, where she has a girlfriend (or maybe her sister, I'm not sure, and it's my fault, not a movie), and high hopes to go to college, which she and her family can't afford. br /> <br /> She seems rather vulnerable on the road alone, and, of course, she faces some slightly rude characters, and soon after that it is discovered that there is a hole in one of her tires. <br /> <br /> While she is at a rest stop, she is assisted by a woman named Sandra and her husband Bill, an elderly couple who travel to RV. <br /> <br /> They are heading south to Florida. and take it under their wing, but is everything as they imagine? Memories and paranoia go down in history as our young heroine learns some new lessons about life.
