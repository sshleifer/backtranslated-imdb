I cannot believe that 25 years have passed since I first watched this story on TV. I remembered that I was very touched by this, and I was lucky to get a VHS tape a few years ago. I have not watched it again until recently. Since then, I have been watching this again and again. I must have watched it 10 times in the last 2 weeks. <br /> <br /> The game is great, the story is irresistible, and I’m ashamed to say that I still haven’t appreciated the talent of the actor Brian Brown. The playful facial expressions shown in the first half — when he gave Jean the stolen medicine in Malaya — are so contrasted with his very restrained and nervous body language shown in the second half: in their first drink together in Cain and on the estate, we have to wait until wedding reception, especially the final dance scene, to see his open demonstration of love for Jean. The same dancing eyes that first showed his admiration in Malaya. Who would not want to be his mrs bung? <br /> <br /> While Joe turned from a cocky, almost bigger than a life figure in the Malay jungle, into a somewhat shy middle Joe in her back yard, Jin took the opposite road; her wartime experience seems to have given her new confidence. She did not lose time and went for what she wanted. She took steps to take what she could get — just the way Joe had told her. <br /> <br /> For me, all these transformations help to show that this is more than just a love story - this is a story about growth, courage and fragility in life. Lawyer - Noel - and sweet, and sad figure. He also gave Jean a lot - he gave the last hope for love. In the end, he did what true love requires — he placed her happiness above his own. <br /> <br /> I liked the fight between Joe and Jin, who is not in the book. I thought that this was an appropriate and necessary addition, because it helped to remember the inner struggle that they had to face in order to make possible a life together. <br /> <br /> Now I'm older, maybe I understand life, love and loss a little better. This story touches me even more deeply. <br /> <br /> However, I am surprised to see that B. Brown has blue eyes in the advertising photo shown on this site. He definitely did not in "The City Like Alice". Well, 25 years is a long time!
