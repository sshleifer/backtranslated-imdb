The first thing I noticed in this movie was how well everything was set up. Quality film from all sides. <br /> <br /> I suppose you could love this film only for its action, but I liked it not only for that. <br /> <br /> This is a pure thriller / horror movie. It offers a more complete script than most horror films. I thought that, at least, the US version ended up brilliantly and was gorgeous in everything. The story seemed fair and cruel. <br /> <br /> The film has a great, tense script that makes the action move, with believable characters in most plausible situations.
