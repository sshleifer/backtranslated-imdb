Acting, of course! Think about it, “The ground in the closet” could easily be so terrible - the whole movie was filmed in the same room, where there were only two people, they would have better talk about damn interesting things. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't turn out terribly. On the contrary, thanks to the incredible images of both Stow and Rickman, Closet Land is a masterpiece in itself. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that it is for everyone. People whose attention span has decreased due to brilliant sex scenes and the occasional pistol shooting may have trouble digesting Closet Land. However, those who can evaluate a good story without explosions should look at it (no matter how many video stores you need to call to find someone who has it available).
