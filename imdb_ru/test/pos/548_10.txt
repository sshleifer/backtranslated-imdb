Ann (Natalie Portman) tells us how much she hates her mother, Adele (Susan Sarandon). This is how the movie begins. Adele decided that she and her daughter were moving to California without asking anyone, and leaving her husband for no reason. The story of the relationship between mother and daughter. It's really deep and touching, thanks to the great work of the actresses. Natalie was nominated for a Golden Globe for this role. She is one of the most talented actresses I've ever seen, and Sarandon too. They really look like a mother-daughter. The soundtrack is great too. The film is incredible. *10 out of 10*
