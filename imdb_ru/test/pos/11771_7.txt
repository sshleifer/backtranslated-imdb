The first half hour of “Homebrew” was rather boring and not exciting, but as the film developed, I was interested in both character and plot. Several scenes are really scary, and you are afraid for the main characters to which you are really attached. The story of three employees on a hidden illegal marijuana farm in southern California. They witness the murder of the owner of the farm Malcolm (John Lithgow) and take the weeds themselves. The three rather simple farm hands will soon plunge into the terrible world of the mafia and local interests, and all the while trying to convince everyone that Malcolm is still alive. Although the film had several flaws and a slow start, it turned out to be worthwhile. 7/10 stars
