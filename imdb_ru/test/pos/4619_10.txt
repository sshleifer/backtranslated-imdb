I watched this movie tonight in the preview, and it was fantastic. This is good at portraying the problems that the average high school student is exposed to. <br /> <br /> I left the film feeling overwhelmed and saddened, and at the same time grateful that this film will have the opportunity to raise awareness of my audience about these issues (bullying, rape, suicide and depression). <br /> br /> This is a fantastic Australian movie. <br /> <br /> Watch it. <br /> <br /> Support him. <br /> <br /> Learn from him.
