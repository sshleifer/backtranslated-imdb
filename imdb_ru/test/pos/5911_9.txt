The age of Stuart did not bother me at all in this film, although he portrayed a much younger man. I still remember my passion for the story of Lindberg, and when I was completely grown up by the time this biopic was created, I had to see it. <br /> <br /> This is not only a great performance by Stuart, but also a lot of interesting technical data that makes it understandable to those who have been challenged, such as me. And the plane itself was great. <br /> <br /> I really liked this description of the period before my birth, and it awakened my childhood love of airplanes and the idea of ​​air travel.
