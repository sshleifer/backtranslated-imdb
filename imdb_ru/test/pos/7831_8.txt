Ladies and gentlemen, we really have a winner. In fact, this is not the case, but the boy this film is often funny and always funny and terrible. Poor Alma (picks up Julia Ruiz) suffers from the ancient Maya curse that causes deadly poisonous snakes inside her body. Alma and her irresponsible husband, the shaman Brukho (Albi Castro, who feverishly overeats with the delightful mobility of his eyes) leave on a train bound for Los Angeles. Naturally, a lot of deadly vipers are lost to terrorize the motley assortment of passengers. The Mallaci brothers, working on the absurd scenario of Eric Fosberg, treat the ridiculous premise directly, thus creating a monstrously pathetic piece of delusional cheese. The coarse effects of CGI, the pretentiously uninteresting common variety of Gardner snakes (scary rattlesnake sounds added to the soundtrack to fill them with a faint feeling of an otherwise non-existent threat) amazing "you gotta be kidding me!" excessive ridiculous endings are absolutely stunning in their terrific horror. Moreover, we also have a game (if unconvincing), playing the cast of a nameless actor, a pleasant piece of delicious unreasonable female nude, funk-hum'ni'Siver and a lot of incredibly rough and grotesque makeup f / x, indicates that fact that the character of an annoyingly cute little girl is eaten by a large reptile, and by a stoner engineer who is caught by a lit crack of a hollow light bulb (!?). Absolute Kitsch Intuition.
