I cannot add much to what has already been said, except that I have to do this because of the policy of a minimum of 10 lines. <br /> <br /> I actually got it on VHS-to-DVD to copy, but the quality is rather low, and it is imperative that it be officially released. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine what additions I would like to see (Tim Healy's character, I swear, making my way through one of them. Programs like football balls will be great!). You can imagine it now, right? But, of course, it seems that most people will have to continue to dream of releasing a DVD. <br /> <br /> Of course, God must be in the DVD release section at ITV, who also knows a little about British culture, web savvy and enough about them to look at IMDb from time to time? Well.
