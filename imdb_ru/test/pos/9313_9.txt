How is the bear's paw, elephant trunk or monkey? Let Cui Hark tell you in this wonderful and carefree comedy about the art of making traditional (?) Chinese fashion. <br /> <br /> This film shares the overall structure of the American sports film, but instead of focusing on baseball, it centers around cooking, which makes it even more interesting. I even think that Leslie Cheng's character is much like Charlie Sheen in the Major League ... <br /> <br /> This film also has a bit of a fight between Zhao Wen Zhao and Xiong Xin Xin (I like to see this after The Blade) and a pretty funny joke about Leon Lai's pop song ... <br /> <br /> This might not be the perfect movie for vegans.
