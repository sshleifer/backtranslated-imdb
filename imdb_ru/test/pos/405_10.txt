Note: after writing this review, I see that this list is really about the series, and not about the original film. Is to blame. I thought IMDb is for a database for movies, not a TV show. But since most people will watch this movie under BAGDAD CAFE, and not OUT OF ROSENHEIM, which, oddly enough, is the name of this movie in the list on IMDb, I will leave this comment here. <br /> <br /> I may have missed something, but when I read this other review, it seemed to be a complete review of the CBS series - which was probably based on this film. I have not seen the show, and I may like it or not, but I am sure that it is very different from this film. This film does NOT look like a TV show, and there is no Whoopi Goldberg and other Hollywood celebrities (except Jack Palance, who was very charming in his role). <br /> <br /> This is a terribly sweet movie that fully thinks "outside the box." This is not at all like a Hollywood film about the formula, so probably that is why (what is a good word for idiots?), Who decided to sell films or not, decided not to sell this one. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film captured my heart and imagination from the very beginning. From music (which is only part of the time, so you can't call it a musical) to cinematography and a really cool story. <br /> <br /> A German or Bavarian woman (very beautiful and rather complete)) enters into an argument with another German or Bavarian man with whom she travels in the California desert, and breaks up with him - he gets into the car and she goes to stand up for himself on a desolate and desolate highway off the beaten path. <br /> <br /> She finds a small and dilapidated but charming Baghdad cafe in Baghdad, California, and is registered. The rest of the story is magical. I do not want to try to describe this film, because I want you to enjoy every surprise. <br /> <br /> Warning: if you are racist or have something against big women, you will not like this film, since the main romantic is a big woman, and the characters of brown-red skin play big roles and are included as "part mix "without any racism. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10 for originality, entertainment and just amazing.
