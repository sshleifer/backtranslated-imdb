After visiting the Kimbell Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, USA, exploring art and architecture (also in the nearby Museum of Modern Art) and having a pleasant conversation with a knowledgeable lady of a bookstore, did I buy this DVD with a rather high expectation offer ?? and was not disappointed in the least. <br /> <br /> The thematic approach, dramatic tensions, exemplary interviews, archival footage and amazing architecture are also blended into one to explore the life of the late cult Louis I. Han. . <br /> <br /> The documentary begins: a contemplative classical music plays, archives are scanned with a reflected shadow face, blurred letters, symbolically pointing to the train window passing through the background landscape ?? the journey is focused and out of focus, the search ultimately ends with a newspaper article. Nathanial Khan reads from the front page of the New York Times, where his father is simultaneously praised as the best American architect alive, and his death announced. <br /> <br /> “When I first read this obituary, I must admit that I was looking for my own name. I was also his child, his only son. I didn't know my father very well. He never married my mother, and he never lived with us (??). He died when I was eleven. "<br /> <br /> So after years of this illegitimate son, there are still vague, fragmented thoughts and feelings about his father, who seems like a good professional and public figure, but who secretively private life avoids him and affects him to such an extent that he intends to do something about it. <br /> <br /> “For many years I struggled to be content with small pieces of my father’s life that I was allowed to see, but this was not enough. I needed to find him out. I needed to find out who he really is. So I went on a trip to see his buildings and find what was left of him. This will lead me to the other end of the world, looking for a man who left me with so many questions. ”<br /> <br /> So, there are two documentaries. Thirdly, thanks to the slow systematic discovery of the world-famous architect, we learn: 1) his ideas, buildings and architectural perspective and 2) his family, colleagues, the lives of the people he touched, and the human perspective < br /> <br /> The DVD also offers additional information. ation with questions and answers with the writer / director and additional frames that include such great quotes Louis I. Khan as "Everything everyone says is true. This is their truth. This cannot be a fact. "And" A good idea that does not occur is not an idea at all. " <br /> <br /> This film is a journey of discovery. Self-knowledge and the discovery of man, a great man, but still a man, imperfect, like all of us. We recognize him with the eyes of an admiring and slightly bitter son, but with openness and objectivity to truly explore, without making simple conclusions and not judging. <br /> <br /> Key interviews with people who interacted with him in various capacities. We gradually collected some pieces until the last interview with this man from Bangladesh, who really seems to be bringing him home with intuitive and reasonable comments. <br /> <br /> Brilliant architect, brilliant documentary.
