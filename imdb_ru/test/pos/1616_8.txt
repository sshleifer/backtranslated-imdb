I bought this DVD from Walmart cheaply, thinking it would be typical nonsense video, but it turned out much better than expected. In fact, there is no criticism to say this ... this is obviously a low budget, but it only adds to the old-fashioned fun. This is very cool and exciting. <br /> <br /> Everything is there: horror, sex, a great plane crash, and good characters. And I would say that this is quite original, because it really does not come out like any other movie I've seen. He has his own unique look, which I really liked, so this film deserves praise. I look forward to seeing even more of these amazing films from Panic Master Brett Piper, whom I had never heard before. <br /> <br /> The DVD menu is really creative, it has great music, so it's best to just keep it on when you're not ready to sit down and watch. It also includes some special features that are really interesting. But we will never see the director and will not hear him in the commentary, we must be embarrassed. It comes from Edgewood Studios in Vermont, USA. I highly recommend it to all horror lovers, you will like it!
