I first heard about this when I searched on the Internet for reviews of another Italian horror film, the modern Lady Perfume in Black (1974; by the way, whose recently purchased Raro Video R220 DVD)? ? where he is mentioned as being in the same spirit, but also as good. Looking at FOOTSTEPS for myself now, can I see where this reviewer came from ?? that both films deal with the psychological collapse of their main character. Stylistically, however, does this film owe a lot more to cinema art house than anything else ?? in particular, the works of Alain Rene and Michelangelo Antonioni (and, in particular, the “LAST YEAR IN MARIENBADE” [1961] and “PASSENGER” [1975], respectively); accordingly, some accused him of being “deadly dull” ?? an epithet often associated with such a "pretentious" (read: brain) fare! <br /> <br /> In any case, does the film include a search for a woman (Florinda Bolkan) to determine her movements in the preceding three days ?? which she does not seem to remember. After a series of mysterious clues, does she travel to the “mythical” country of Garma (then the nearby places bear the same fictitious names Muda and Revember) ?? where she encounters several people (including Lila Kedrova as an aristocratic regulator of the resort) who allegedly recall the heroine who remained there during her "blackout"! However, the most notable of them are a young man (Peter McEneri) and a little girl (Nicoletta Elmi, from Marion Bawa’s film “BARON BLOOD” [1972]) ?? the first always seems to happen on stage at auspicious moments, while the latter obviously confuses Balkan with another woman (sporting long red hair and a mean strip!). <br /> <br /> Although this is essentially a mood, it is nonetheless a fascinating mystery: inevitably, uncertain events occur at a deliberate pace ?? and where much of the film’s strength stems from a remarkable central performance (which can be seen as an expansion of the role of Bolkan in the beautiful Lucio Fulci giallo Lizard in the Skin of a Woman) [1971]. Nevertheless, the cinematographer Vittorio Storaro’s contribution (which provides any number of broad camera movements and effective color scheme — using orange / red / blue filters to create an atmosphere and giving a rich look to a disorienting, bizarre finale) and Nikolai Piovani’s melancholic assessment ( The composer is currently best known for his work on the Holocaust by Roberto Benigni, marked by Oscar, “LIFE IS BEAUTIFULL [1997]). <br /> <br /> Remembering this It is worth discussing how FOOTSTEPS was introduced in the version I was looking at: well, it seems difficult to get it in its original form (I can’t be sure that it isn’t cropped here or No, except that the film is designed for 89 minutes, while IMDb lists it at 96), this edition is taken from a rather battered English-language VHS (duplication is surprisingly good, given the international composition) with loaded Swedish subtitles for download (except In addition, the DivX copy froze for a few seconds at a crucial moment in the history circle mark 82 minutes)! However, we receive a welcome bonus, that is, a 9-minute “Highlights From The Soundtrack” in MP3 format. <br /> <br /> I understand that I have not yet mentioned the plot of the lunar mission plot in which Klaus Kinski is present. limited: by the way, around the same time he had an equally short but key role in another good artistic thriller with sci-fi inclinations (and also installed in a distinctive place) ?? namely, LIFESPAN (1974). While I was lying watching the film, I could not understand what possible connection this had with the central plot, with the exception that Balkan mentioned a recurring dream about the film that she had once seen, though not completely, called “ Steps to the Moon ”(a somewhat misleading alternative name for the film itself) is funny that she first recalls this picture as“ BLOOD ON THE MOON ”(which, of course, is the classic 1948 western noir with Robert Mitchum and directed by Robert Wise! ). However, I took this “rejection” as just another outlandish touch to the film (considering also the former work of Balkan as an interpreter at a conference discussing the future of the Earth) ?? and, of course, did not expect the astronauts at the very end to appear on the beach of Garmy in order to pursue the female leadership, where the sand then ominously turns into the surface of the moon ??! <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is likely to make more sense when re-watching ?? although, honestly, this is best treated as a visual / auditory experience, and one should not expect it to give a story that is rationalized in some way clearly and easily! For reference, the only other Bazzoni effort I managed to catch before was a mediocre direct giallo THE FIFTH CORD (1971) with Franco Nero in the lead role (which I recorded late on Italian television); Some time ago I managed to get him a spaghetti-western version of "Carmen" called "MAN, PRIDE AND HONEY" (1968) ?? also with Nero and Kinsky ?? like DivX (after I missed the morning broadcast of this), but the conversion somehow turned out to be wrong, and, therefore, the disc will not play properly!
