In recent years, there have been many biographical works of famous singers, and Ray, the story of Ray Charles, has a lot in common with Walk the Line, which was made the following year and tells the story of Johnny Cash. Cash and Charles were almost accurate contemporaries, both born in the early thirties and died in the 2003/04 year. Both grew up in poverty in the American Deep South. Both lost their brother in an accident in childhood. Both achieved success in the 1950s. Both had marriage problems, and both were addicted to drugs. All these issues are highlighted in both films. There is also a resemblance to Ron Howard's “Beautiful Mind”. Although this film was about math rather than a musician, he, like Luch, and Complete the Line, emphasized the role that the subject’s wife played in helping her husband overcome his problems. <br /> <br /> Ray Charles was born in 1930 from a single mother in a poor Negro community in Georgia. (Initially, his name was Raymond Charles Robinson, but when he started his career as a musician, he abandoned his last name to avoid confusion with boxer Sugar Ray Robinson). In a sense, Charles was even harder than Cache, who had to deal with two additional shortcomings in the form of blindness and racism, which affected all black Americans, especially in the south, during his life. Charles had a particularly traumatic childhood, he witnessed the death of his younger brother George as a result of drowning and blind, about a year or two later. He seemed to be haunted by nightmares and guilt over the death of George throughout his life. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is rather slow and is a standard film “From Dirty and Rich People”, telling a biopic film, telling the Story of how young Charles is taught to play the piano, becomes a performer in a nightclub, and then glorified as a major artist, falling in love with the beautiful Della Bea. The best scenes in this part of the film are memories from Charles’s childhood. There is a spectacular, repetitive image of colored glass bottles hanging on a tree in front of his house; perhaps it was one of his few visual memories of his life before he went blind. There is also a memorable scene in which the teenager Charles is ashamed of the biased bus driver, allowing him to get on the bus, pretending that he lost his sight on Omaha beach (in fact, he would have been only thirteen years old when landing in Normandy). <br /> <br /> The second half of the film becomes more interesting as it moves to more controversial territory, focusing on Charles’s addiction, problems in his marriage caused by his affair with Margie Hendricks, one of his fellow singers, and his battle against racism. In the early sixties, Charles caused a sensation by refusing to play in front of a stand-alone audience in Georgia (although, contrary to what the film says, this did not lead to the fact that he was forbidden to perform in the state). He also fought against racial divisions in the music industry itself, playing not only traditionally “black” music styles, such as gospel and rhythm-and-blues, but also traditionally “white” ones, such as country and western (regarded by many black Americans as music choice from the village community). <br /> <br /> Peter Bradshaw, film critic "The Guardian", noted that "Ray" is a solar film that diplomatically turns away from the dark side of things. It contains no mention of such matters as the death of Charles Aretha’s beloved mother as a teenager, his brief marriage with Eileen Williams in the early 1950s and his possible divorce from Della Bee in 1977. It also understates the extent of his conversion to a woman and the number of his extra-marital children. There is a similarity with “Beautiful Mind”, which also omits a number of conflicting details about the subject’s personal life, including divorce. <br /> <br /> Ray Charles fans will surely enjoy the movie for music, but it’s worth watching even for those who know little about him, mainly because of the Oscar-winning performance of Jamie Foxx in the lead role, which reproduces Charles’s mannerisms exactly what we think we’re actually watching the blind, even though Fox is a sighted person. (However, unlike Joaquin Phoenix on Walk the Line, Fox did not sing on his own - no doubt Charles’s special singing voice was too difficult to reproduce). He gets good support from some other performers, in particular, Sharon Warren as Areta and Kerry Washington as Della Bee. The film is uneven and long, but nevertheless useful. 7/10
