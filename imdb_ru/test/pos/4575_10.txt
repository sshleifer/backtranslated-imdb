I was one of the few who tried my best to see it in the theater. Since then, I have often thought about it. After two DVD views, I'm happy to say that everything went fine. As in any wonderful comedy, I laughed more at every viewing, both while waiting for jokes and after catching the missing items. <br /> <br /> Mike Judge is great at creating insanely comedic characters and incorporates them into his world to make sense. In Office Space, the environment makes characters believable. The future of idiocracy gives him the freedom to write incredibly stupid characters and make them work. I will wait to see if they will release the best DVD with some relevant features before buying it. But this film deserves support on a DVD not offered to him in the theater.
