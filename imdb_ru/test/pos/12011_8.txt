I think this film has become an important recording of the most terrifying aspect of the East German regime - the conclusion of its people under what the regime called its anti-fascist defensive wall. This is a document of despair and courage that should not be missed. However, I would like to comment on the actual location of this escape. This did not happen in Berlin or in the vicinity, as some respondents assumed, and had nothing to do with the Berlin Wall. The rescue ball flew over the Iron Curtain, which not only divided Germany, but also divided Europe at that time. The balloon took off from Pessneck, 170 miles south-west of Berlin in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), and flew 14 miles to File in Bavaria and Freedom in West Germany. The opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall in the same year. While a balloon flight created an entertainment cinema, it should remain a monument to those who died while trying to escape from East Berlin, other parts of the GDR or other states controlled by the Soviet Union.
