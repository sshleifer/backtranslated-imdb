Possessing unlimited raw energy and uncompromising vision, Talk Radio brilliantly explores the public's love of turning the personal problems of strangers into radio entertainment. <br /> <br /> Eric Bogosyan is sensational because Barry Champlain is a rude radio host. It is natural for this kind of roles and perfectly tunes one of the most impressive, interesting radio amateurs I have ever seen on the screen. Time and delivery of his insults to various visitors - brilliant blows. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin is also great as Barry's boss. He demonstrates the same explosive cynicism that he later demonstrated in 1992 by Glengarry Glen Ross. But the support role that really stands out is the stoned teenager played by Michael Wincott. You have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone and Robert Richardson do an excellent job of photography, which is almost entirely limited to one broadcast room. The claustrophobic sensation of the film perfectly reflects its tone. In the end, one of the highlights of the film is the use of people's personal moments to attract an audience. Stone demonstrates that these moments are often too isolated for the whole world. <br /> <br /> Talk Radio is a film with a strong emotional and brain effect, the likes of which are rarely seen today.
