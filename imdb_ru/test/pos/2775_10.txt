Suzy K is the original and is not like other Disney movies, *** a spoiler *** A boy named Zack moves to a new city and he has problems at school, he is a good basketball player. a girl died in the 1950s with her boyfriend when their car crashed near the bridge. Suzy (Amy Joe Johnson) from the power rangers - the pink ranger - helps Zach get the necklace as a ghost along the way he needs to explain to his sister about her ghost, and finally getting this necklace, Suzy returns to the bridge she died and she gets into her boyfriend's ghost car and they come up. later, when he misses her, he finds a girl who looks just like her. (Do you believe in reincarnation?) Susie Q is a good movie that can be seen from time to time, but it barely gives, because Disney needs to fill all the silly movies and shows I give him <br /> <br /> 7/10
