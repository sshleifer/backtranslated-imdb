You know, it’s very interesting to watch this ... half of the people involved in this are already dead ... <br /> <br /> In any case, I haven’t seen anything related to Muppet for a long time, but this is pure gold material . I'm a big fan of puns, and they are pretty well placed in this film, but one of its amazing aspects is its stimulation: it’s not a very high-speed children's pacing, when directors just randomly choose the course of the story without considering the depth of character, it’s just a kind of movement along with characters where they want to go. <br /> <br /> Kermit the Frog is a stunning character. His voice and puppet expression are fantastic. But, first of all, he points out why he is popular - “he can sing and joke too!” - but more appropriately, why he is so cute — he, without any effort, inspires everyone to look for their dreams. At the same time, he also has to deal with himself, which is an unusual topic in family films. <br /> <br /> There are also a number of comedians appearing here and there, some with great effect, others with a little less (I think the role of Mel Brooke was a bit overrated, isn't it?). Some parts of the film are just weird. But he is very creative and behaves to the same destination in a completely different direction. <br /> <br /> Moving straight ... <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
