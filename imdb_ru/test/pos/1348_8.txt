I caught this film at the OutFest show in Los Angeles in July 2006. It is rough around the edges (sound recording, in particular, shaky) and often very funny. The script is quite sharp and episodic and ends suddenly, but Ash Christian fills the film with a big sincere heart. It is also a refreshing change in tempo to have a fun movie that doesnâ€™t remove underwear models, obsessed with parties and chasing straight guys. Supports the warmly sympathetic Jonathan Cauett as Mr. Cox, Rodney's soul mate (Ash Christian), vibrant and energetic Ashley Finke as Rodney's best friend, and Deborah Teaker as Rodney's mom, who is bored with the best script and steals her every scene. The film is similar to its screenwriter / director / star - lumpy and a bit strange, but at the same time very cute.
