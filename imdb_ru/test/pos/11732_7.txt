I have not seen every movie that Burt Reynolds ever made, but this one (which I just finished watching for the third time) may well be his best! He suffers only from some slow stretches; Bert may have tried to make him more "artistic" than he should have. On the other hand, he managed to avoid many common clichés in the view of the role of the “tough cop” that he plays (pay attention, for example, to the scene in which he first tries to kiss Rachel Ward, or to fear he is expressed just before the final fight with indestructible Henry Silva). In fact, Silva and these two ninja killers are the three most memorable villains from the police thrillers of the 80s. The film also has some original touches, an amazing amount of humor, a fierce and exciting fist fight, and many well-directed shots. (***)
