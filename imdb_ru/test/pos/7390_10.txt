"Funny, your worst nightmare always seems so far away!" <br /> <br /> The characters of Dark Habour, a couple (Alan Rickman and Polly Hunter) and a bum (Norman Reedus), are immersed in a game full of hidden sexual energy and treason. From time to time, painful interruptions heighten tensions and give plenty of space for interpretations. A good game and story that, if you don't use your brain, will leave you confused. You should watch this at least twice. The very strength is in its unconventionality and, of course, in Alan Rickman. Those who love him will love this film. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: this is not a typical prime time movie, but well done!
