“Crossfire” was remembered not so much by the fact that all its three stars bore the name “Robert”, but by the fact that it was one of the first Hollywood films devoted to anti-Semitism. <br /> <br /> The story opens with a murder in the silhouette of a man we later recognize, a Jew named Joseph Samuel (Sam Leven). Policeman Captain Finlay (Robert Young) is scheduled to smoke a case. Ex-soldier Montgomery (Robert Ryan) comes to the scene of the murder, and through the memories we learn that he met Samuels in a bar with other soldiers who were collected from service after the Second World War. <Br /> <br /> According to Montgomery, he and his friend Floyd Bowers (Steve Brody) followed Samuel and the corporal. Arthur Mitchell (George Cooper) in Samuel's apartment for drinks. Montgomery tells Finlay that Mitchell was the first to leave the apartment and that soon he and Floyd followed him, and Samuels was still alive and well. <br /> <br /> Not finding Mitchell, Finley suspects him of murder. He recruits a sergeant. Peter Keely (Robert Mitchum) to help him find Mitchell. Mitchell, meanwhile, was amazed at the streets in a dazed state. In the bar, he meets a prostitute Ginny (Gloria Graham) and makes friends. She gives him the key to her apartment, and he goes there to rest. Suddenly, a man (Paul Kelly) appears looking for Ginny. Mitchell, still in a daze, leaves and returns to meet Kili and his buddies. Kili manages to hide him from the police and hide him in the cinema all night. <br /> <br /> From Mitchell’s point of view, we learn that Montgomery hates Jews and is probably the killer. Finley begins to focus his investigation on Montgomery, trying to prove his guilt. He arranges for one of the soldiers, a boy named Leroy (William Phipps), to set up a trap for Mongomery. <br /> <br /> "Crossfire" is considered one of the best in the genre of "cinematic noir." In fact, he received several Academy Award nominations, including Ryan and Graham for best support. It was placed on a modest budget in about three weeks. <br /> <br /> It has all the elements of a classic film noir, shadows, low-key lighting and a plot that unfolds mostly at night. The essential “femme fatale” of the play is Ginny Graham, who plays a minor role, but, nevertheless, your classic “femme fatale”. The unnamed character played by Paul Kelly (in a great role) was chewed and spat out by Ginny, and was she going to do the same with Mitchell? <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan stole the picture as the brutal Montgomery, although it would have thrown him into such roles for many years. Robert Young is a good discreet detective, but Robert Mitchum can do little but make friends with Mitchell's character. Other cast members include Jacqueline White as the wife of Mitchell, Lex Barker (who will play Tarzana next year) as one of Mitchum's friends and Richard Powers (who was previously known as Tom Keen) as Finlay's assistant. br /> <br /> Director Edward Dmitrik will soon face a non-American committee of the House of Representatives with communist ties and will spend a couple of years in prison.
