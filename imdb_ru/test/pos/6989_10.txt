Oh my gosh it was one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen, and, frankly, I can't stand sci-fi movies. <br /> <br /> Vin Diesel and his co-workers made this movie really enjoyable !! <br /> <br /> I also have to say that Vin Diesel is the sexiest and most talented male actor I've ever seen. Keep it up, Vin! you are fine !! As for everyone else, good work. I thought that drama and suspense really interested the audience. again, great work, and I support you, Vin. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, <br /> <br /> Alexandra
