This year Royal Rumble was not very bad, but last year’s was definitely better. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH - SEAN MIHAILS VS. EDGE Despite the fact that this match took too much time, everything was in order. Edge wins after using ropes to secure Shawn Michaels. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SECOND MATCH - CELLAR VS. Heidenreich in the match with the casket. Now I don’t really like the casket matches, this match was dull and careless, but in the end he picked up the pace when Undertaker nailed the Tombstone and then threw Heidenreich into the casket to win. 4/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD MATCH - JBL VS. KURT ANGLE VS. GREAT SHOW IN TRIAL-THREAT FOR WOMEN'S WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP Not a bad match with a triple threat. It is a pity that JBL wins again to retain his title after he won the clothesline from hell at an angle. 5/10 <br /> <br /> Fourth Match - Randy Orton VS. TRIPLE H FOR WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP FOR HEAVY DUTY Excellent match of these two men, the match was a little sloppy, but it was still good, and by the end got close to quite good. Although Orton lost the match, he was quick and gorgeous by the end. HHH nails the Pedigree to Orton to win, to retain his world title. 5/10 <br /> <br /> THE FIFTH MATCH - THE ROYAL THUNDER It was a cool Royal buzz {Every royal buzz is good}. After all 30 people entered, the last four remaining superstars in Rumble were Cena, Edge, Mysterio & Batista. Edge was able to throw out Mysterio, later Batista and Sina chained Edge together. Now it's up to the Seine and Batista. First, after changing the F-U, Batista went for Bomist Batista, but suddenly both men collapsed on the outside at the same time. After the controversial decision and Mr. McMahon makes his way to the ring to settle the matter. The match was resumed again when Batista and Sina fought him, but Batista broke out of the Seine, achieved a spinal injury and threw out Sina to win the 2005 Royal Drone and go on to Wrestlemania 21 to meet with the champion in Mainvento. , 10/10 It was a very good Royal Rumble, but last year it was always the best among all Royal Rumble in history. <br /> <br /> Overall: I will give 8/10 A & B +
