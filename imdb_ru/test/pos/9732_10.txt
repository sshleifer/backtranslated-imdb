This is the type of film that you shoot when you are incredibly tired or in some other way ... The game in this film is so bad that it seems deliberate, and to let you know how bad the special effects are, one scene when the doll come to life when you can see most of the hand holding the doll and moving it. The film looked as if it was shot with a video camera. When I first saw this film, the fistfight almost broke out when my friends and I called each other out of this film, that's how terrible it was. If you like to be angry at movies, I recommend this to you, otherwise run, as if your whole life depends on it.
