I saw this series on PBS in 1980 in college, and so far I can not get it out of my head, although I have never seen it since. I remember each cast (the cast was perfect, as mentioned in other comments), design, lighting and, of course, a story that is enough in itself to keep you glued to the set. Probably the best show I've ever seen alongside the original Roots.
