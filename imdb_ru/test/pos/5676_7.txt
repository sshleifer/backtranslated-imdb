When I read a quick review - 3 people died in a wild battle fighting a huge crocodile - I was not fully involved. It was like the typical horror formula of a yawn movie for a group of people chased by a monster - except for this case there are only three, so we wouldn't even get a grim “joy” from how they were shot one after another. <br /> <br /> However, I watched it (could not sleep; nothing more was done) and turned out to be much better than expected. The game is excellent, the atmosphere is tense, and you really experience this rare feeling of a low-budget winner. <br /> <br /> Horror, as it should be. First-class filmmaking. It’s not perfect, but it’s worth a look. I give him 7.
