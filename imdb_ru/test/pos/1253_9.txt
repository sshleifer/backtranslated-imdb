While my children enjoyed the film (and later announced that they wanted to buy it later), I think I got more from it than they did. At the beginning, a scene in a store at the airport is real life (I did not use a loud comment, but I thought). This is a good mid-life movie, a bit juicy, and some scenes do not work as well as others (why does the child stay with Bruce Willis when he finds out that his mother is dying?), But overall, it's a good time. It also gave our family a chance to talk - did my children think that my life was boring? What do they expect in 40 years? How can you not love a movie that starts pleasant conversations with your children?
