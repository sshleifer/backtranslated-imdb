A middle-aged man, Robert Jordan, tuned in on his way, takes a boy scout squad after his predecessor goes under duress. Jordan takes the package mainly to find out what the boys like so that he can revive his radio program, which is losing its appeal to the younger group. At first, he has difficulties with boys, especially with Mike, an 8-year-old who forms affection for an elderly man who does not reciprocate at all. Do Jordan and the scouts get something? Check out this interesting and funny movie from old times.
