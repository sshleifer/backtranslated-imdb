This almost documentary view of an adventurous boy living in the auto repair shops outside of New York is real. Real coverage. This sound. Less editing in the entire movie than in 1 minute of most movies. And although there are very few scenarios, there is a story. Filmed in primary colors, almost all red, white, blue and yellow, we get the real meaning of a boy's life that makes something out of nothing. He has a place to live, which he creates himself, has a good job and is trying to lead his sister into his little universe. People in the junk area also give us a look at this culture, which I did not know about. Basically, they seem decent and pay Ale, it seems, every day, and seems to be really concerned about his well-being. The actor (I think), who plays Ale, speaks more with one expression than one might imagine. It reminded me what a real little movie can do. This shows what children are capable of, even without much support and love. Would definitely recommend.
