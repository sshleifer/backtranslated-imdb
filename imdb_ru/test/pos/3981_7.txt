I don’t think that in my entire life I’ve seen a movie about a high school student who creates his own college just to impress his parents. Currently, movies are either remakes, or prequels, or stories that have been used in many different films. It has an original storyline, and the continuation of this, making it comedic films, only facilitates the deal. With this well thought out story and mixed laughter, this is a good movie. Now I’ve seen better, but when I entered the theater, I was thinking about another party dedicated to drugs, beer and fraternity, with some kind of sexual insinuation (other than American Pie), but I was surprised. To summarize, I liked the movie, and the next time you shuffle the paper for the movies, look for the time for the “Accepted” show. If you want to laugh out loud, then it is.
