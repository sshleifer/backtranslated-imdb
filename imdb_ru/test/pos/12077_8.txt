I still lived with my parents when they broadcast it on Dutch television. I used to watch movies alone, but others didnâ€™t care. But for some reason we all sat down and watched this movie. This film was previously broadcast on Wednesday night. This is the story of a woman who is about to die. But before she dies, she wants to make sure that her (many) children will have the best adoptive parents. So we watched it, and my dad (the most emotional of the four of us) started crying. I followed him almost immediately, and soon my sister and mother were also in touch. There we were completely touched by this simple but heartbreaking story. If you want to cry well, this is for you!
