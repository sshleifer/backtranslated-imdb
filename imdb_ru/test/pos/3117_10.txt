What can you say about a short short film filled with secondary actors and without “stars”, without absolutely bad performances, without a single poorly-defined line of dialogue and with cold violence, on the one hand, balanced warm “heart” main characters in the story? <br /> <br /> This is a gem, a diamond, a bit of a precious gem western, which evokes the spirit and legend of the American West. The West was not settled by such great heroes as Hicock, Cody, Masterson or Earp, but by the spread of ordinary men and women, farmers and ranches, merchants, miners and lumberjacks, whores and bartenders, as well as artists of the day, some of whom looked for wealth, some for peace and quiet, some for religious freedom. <br /> <br /> This is perhaps a very spiritual story, though not propagandizing any particular religion, since even non-Mormon cowboys depicted by Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. behave in good and noble ways to everyone in history, regardless of religious affiliation or belief, and in every way encourages tolerance and mercy, when the carriage encounters a stuck medicine, shows people. And truly biblically, like David and Goliath or Samson and the Philistines, they are guardian angels sent on a wagon train, who will eventually have to face the evil incarnate Clegg clan, comparing them to the serpent in Eden Garden, and regret what they should do next. This is a cute folk tale about the West, which strikes every goal that John seeks. <br /> <br /> Currently I have a western Santa Claus, whose red outfit is covered with a denim jacket, whose red cap on stockings has been replaced. Brown Stetson, who is carrying a burlap with gifts and a rope. To my Santa, I added a Winchester rifle with a loop to put on one of his shoulders, and a Colt revolver to tuck him in his belt. When people in the office ask why my Santa should carry a weapon, I simply reply: “Serpent!” In the end, isn't the Christmas spirit the one where everyone should get what he deserves? <br /> <br /> Fifty-five years later, especially after 911, the philosophy and attributes shown by the characters and the history of this film are still relevant today, as then.
