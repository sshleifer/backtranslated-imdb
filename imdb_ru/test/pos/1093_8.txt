This is by far the most definite police film I've ever seen. Although not directed by Ram Gopal Varma, he has all the elements of the RGV film. Straightforward dialogues, stupid interpretation of the plot, brilliant directing and excellent presentation (even those who have little work in the film). The chemistry between Nana and Don, even if they are professional rivals, is amazing. And such small events as an insider do not give Imtiazu information, even when he is in the locker, but only to Nane, when he is not at home. The change of working conditions with the change of the senior happens wonderfully. In the first half, he is completely absorbed in the film, in which Nana behaves like Jatin's mentor, explaining to him the subtleties and philosophy of the work. <br /> <br /> In general, one of the most exciting films about policemen in India is cinema. Definitely not to be missed.
