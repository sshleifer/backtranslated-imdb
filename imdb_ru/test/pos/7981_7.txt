This film is where the Batman franchise should have been stopped. Although I admit that the ideas of “Batman Forever” were excellent and could be easily implemented by a competent director, as it turned out that this was not the case. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the Warner Brothers executives were disappointed by how dark the second Batman movie by Tim Burton turned out to be. In addition to the idiocy of waiting for something else from Burton and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into a homage to the sixties series, I don’t understand how Batman’s Return is disappointing. <Br /> <br /> True, he is not quite equal to the first film - although he corrects all the minor flaws of the style found in Batman, a weaker scenario that shares antagonism not only between the two, but also the three characters. Comparison with the masterful combination of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Nevertheless, in spite of all this, he remains a terribly dismal film, true to what Batman has always been, and very satisfying. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton returns in the role of Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, in contact with the nouveau riche magnate Max Shrek (Christopher Walken, named after the German silent actor of the 1920s), his partner Osvald Cobblepot, Penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant make-up reminds Richard III of Lawrence Olivier) and Selina Kyle Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), with whom Wayne plays both herself and Batman. The four principals perform excellently, especially Walken and DeVito, and Keaton and Pfeiffer together explore the dark side of dual identity. <br /> <br /> This film has several intriguing concepts. The only weakness that I can pay special attention to is a certain weakness of the script in some places, which I think is mainly due to the way this film is a four-angle battle. Just do not have enough time to properly understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> Still, it's a damn good movie. I highly recommend watching this with the first one, and then crying about how good the series would be if it continued under Burton and Keaton.
