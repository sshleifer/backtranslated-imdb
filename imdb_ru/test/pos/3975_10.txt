The best thing about the American Bakery Pie. I found the humor and plot much more attractive to the audience than any American movie about cakes today. In addition, with regard to the relevance of the content, I found that it is acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American cinema films. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the film first came out, I read a few negative reviews and eventually did not see him while he was in the theater ... Now I regret this decision. The film far exceeded my expectations in terms of plot, dialogues / scenarios and overall quality. I give him two thumbs up!
