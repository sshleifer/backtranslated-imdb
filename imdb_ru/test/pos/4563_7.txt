Sharpe's Honor for the Unconsecrated is the fifth entry in a series of television films about the shooting of the English army during the Napoleonic wars and based on the books of Bernard Cornwell (which I strongly recommend reading). If you start by watching this particular movie, you will get the impression that Sharpe is not so much a soldier as the centrifugal force around which the rest of the army revolves. If this were the case, I would recommend starting with earlier chapters such as Sharp's Eagle or Sharpe's Company, but this is a worthy choice for a second viewing. <br /> <br /> This time the story is about spying things. When the French army in disorder retreats from Spain, Major Ducos, the slimy master spy sees an opportunity to change the situation. Attaching the murder of the Spanish marquis to Richard Sharp, the hero of the British army, the fragile British-Spanish alliance will begin to crumble, and everything will turn out again. When the Spanish nobles come to Wellington crying for Sharpe's blood, the English general is less than ready to hang his best soldier, so he fakes his death, and he soon goes on a secret mission behind enemy lines to find out who led the plot. Surprisingly, in the movie about Sharpe on the way you can save a gorgeous woman, and she thinks so. <br /> <br /> Of course, this leads to a more adventurous approach. Concentration is less focused on the work of the British military with Sharpe as a figurehead and more focused on his escapades in the countryside, evading French patrols, fanning with Spanish partisans and participating in daring escapes from fortified military positions. Sergeant Harper, his faithful right hand accompanies him, naturally, but the rest of the arrows remain in the camp, unaware that their leader is still alive. However, oddly enough, they are actually paid more attention than usual, as they find themselves in their own plot related to the birth of the child Harper. <br /> <br /> This slightly different approach creates an intriguing episode, but this is only a good thing in a long time. And if anyone is worried that there will be no standard battle at the climax, because the poor old French again get the right blow. In addition, Ducos makes Obadia Hakeswill's fantastic successor as the bad guy you love to hate. He is a two-faced, angry and absolutely angry son of a canine, and also strangely resembles that guy in black from the Raiders of the Lost Ark. In another place, Hagman stands out quite noticeably, as he has a chance for more screen time and it seems that you would like to give birth to your first child, even if he looks like a member of Iron Maiden, who was accidentally ejected backwards. <br /> <br /> In short, another strong chapter in Sharpeâ€™s series. Sharpe remains as heroic as ever, but this time much more bitter and mean, given the events in the previous film. This is not the best introduction if you have not seen any of the other chapters, but it shows Sharpe's side, which we usually do not observe: the action hero, not a professional soldier. And if this is not enough to seduce you, you should also look at the rather surreal look of an enraged Shaun Bean waving a live chicken in a group of nuns.
