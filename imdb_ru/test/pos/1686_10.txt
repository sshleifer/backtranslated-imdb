If there are people who don’t like this film, I don’t think they are human. This film unfolds all the emotions and shows many aspects of Judith Light's character. Made in 1997, this is one of the best films I have ever seen, and indeed a film in which Judith Light has starred to make me a big fan. This film, although sometimes I want to rattle my son for trusting her, is incredibly touching. I cry at the end every time, and it takes a lot! The plot has nothing to do, but Judith Light's acting is incredible. She looks beautiful all the time, and by the end you don’t want the fate imposed by the courts to happen to her. In general, the film deserves my highest praise! Thank you for doing this and reconsidering my view of the death penalty. I look forward to the release of this film on DVD or other media, as Lifetime begins to produce films for customers. Although I don’t have high hopes for this, because it happened almost 9 years ago, it’s still hard to believe, as this film is still rooted in my head after all this time.
