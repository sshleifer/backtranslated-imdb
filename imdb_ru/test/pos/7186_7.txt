It is known that the French are not good film producers. <br /> <br /> Although their Amelie gets high marks on the Oscars. “Asterix and Obelix” is a completely different film of what I'm used to from the French. This is a great movie, especially for children. The only thing that surprised me was that it was spoken in French and unconvincingly. Usually with English films (here in the Netherlands) I don’t need to read the subtitles. But with French, you just need to read to understand. The story itself is simply gorgeous for Obelix, who does not remember how fat he is, but there are also nice details, mostly in names like brucewillix and malcomix. You all know the story from the comics, and this film shows all the most slide after the book. It has everything from braking the nose of the Sphinx to a pirate red beard losing three more ships. I would say a great movie for the weekend with the kids.
