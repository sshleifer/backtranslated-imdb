I recently bought this movie on DVD at a discount store for $ 5. Although this is a no-nonsense DVD on the Geneon label (only a movie that starts playing immediately — no menu, no special features), the quality of the image and sound was GREAT. The film is based on the true story of one of the largest bank robberies in history. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan, whom I must admit, which I have not heard of, plays the main role - Pinky Green. A charming young man who had spent too many of his several years in prison and now wanted to go straight, but he was not allowed to do it! He portrays an American in England. David Niven plays the starring role of the bad guy, also with great charm for which he is known. Bad, but with doubt, as if he refused to refuse Pinky in his “strike” for work. Whack, in England, apparently, a fair share of doubles, not bullets in the head, as in American gangster films! The whole cast is doing a great job on creating a very believable film. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing for me is that the whole movie is quite pleasant and understandable (I often get confused and different characters) without any special effects. NO blood No violence. Not a single car chase! Just a well written story, well functioning, well directed and well photographed! If I had any complaints about the film, I would question the music. WHAT does the bluegrass music in the story of a bank robbery that takes place in England?
