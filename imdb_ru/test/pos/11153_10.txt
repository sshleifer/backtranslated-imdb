I was five years old when the series debuted in 1958, and then became a regular spectator. I remember that I really enjoyed the show, along with "Leave It To Beaver", "My Three Sons", "Ozzie and Harriet", "Dick Van Dyke", replays "I Love Lucy", "The Real McCoys", and etc. I am now enjoying the first season of Donna Reed on DVD and watch the first two episodes. Donna Stone is a smart, well-mannered, problem solver, calm, not out of the house mom, similar to June Cleaver and unlike Lucy Ricardo. In the second episode, I especially like how Miss Reed becomes a surrogate dad, selling her sweat dress and boxing gloves, and at the same time teaching her son how to physically defend himself against a much bigger bully. Although none of the neighbor mothers in whom I grew up, including mine, exactly did not meet the idealistic standards presented by Miss Reed, it is amazing when good manners and sensible decision-making prevail at the end of the day, unlike today's generally accepted standards of vulgarity and selfishness and indifference of neighbors. I cannot imagine that Jeff and Mary Stone would tell their parents that it is possible to enter the courtyards of their neighbors, leaving the dog to bark all day acceptable, or tell mom to "shut up" in the supermarket in front of everyone.
