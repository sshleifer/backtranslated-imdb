I saw it last week, and the outline of the cities of Korea was funny. Very tongue on the cheek and suitable for the political climate. Full points to the authors and Spike for this. The part where he makes the translator pull the rickshaw and throw out the Korean words could only be done by Spike. This is Fox's brave attempt. This is a brilliant show, and I hope that it will pass. My wife and I are regularly TIVOing, and although it runs into a couple of other programs, we are now watching it on MySpace. I hope Fox devotes all the resources for the show and does it daily. I can't wait to see Bobby Lee on his show. With people like Bernard Abedalla, behind the show, this is on the right track. Also Mary May, as his wife looks beautiful.
