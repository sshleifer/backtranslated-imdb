I have not seen this film since it came out in the mid-70s, but I remember it as a very realistic image of the music business (right there with Paul Simons "One Trick Pony" .. another much underrated IMO movie) < br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel works great as a producer, being between the music he believes in and the commercial trip, which the record company arranges for him to work. <br /> <br /> Since I spent my entire career in the music business as a composer / arranger / producer, I can really vouch for the credibility of this film. <br /> <br /> If he ever comes out on DVD, I'll buy it!
