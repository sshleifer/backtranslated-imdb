I was forced to leave a review about this film, which I shot from Blockbuster. This film has everything - comedy, drama, crime, suspense and "realism." <br /> <br /> This movie also had a lot of action with the right amount of humor! I will definitely watch it again! There were some funny parts, as well as action-drama. I like movies that make you think about what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Travis Milloy should shoot more films !!! In my general opinion, this film was great! I look forward to his next! Travis Milloy has a real talent as a writer and director.
