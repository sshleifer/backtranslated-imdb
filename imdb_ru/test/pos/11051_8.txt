MGM wisely chose the play of Anna Christie, who was awarded the Eugene O'Neill Award in 1921, for the first talking picture of Greta Garbo. <br /> <br /> Also wisely, the producers supported Garbo not by one, but by two members of the Original Broadway cast (George Marion in the role of Anna’s father, Chris and James T. Mac in the role of Johnny Priest - turned into “Johnny” Harp ”for films so as not to offend). <br /> <br /> This small change is interesting. As in many films, the accused (those who want FILMS to be FILMS and ignore their origins) that they are “a little more than stage plays shot”, the problem is not in the play, but in filmmakers who would not be more committed to their property. By breeding a large cinematic scene so that it does not offend anyone, or by opening it because they CAN, too many lose the qualities that made this work worth shooting first of all. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the studio’s respect for both O'Neill and Garbo allowed ANNA Christie to survive the usually destructive process perfectly in Francis Marion’s overall sensitive screen adaptation. Miracle of miracles, Marion even admits the POINT of the scene, where Anna Garbo reveals her past on the “farm” to the man whom she really wants to marry, and her father, who sent her there in tact! What the League of Decency should have thought of it! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem in the original play has always been that Chris's friend Marty seeks to get away with the first act, and then disappears from the last two, so that Anna can come on stage - the two sides of a really good woman men don't always recognize <br /> <br /> Marie Dressler, who played well (who also cut her teeth on the Broadway stage before heading to Hollywood), is the perfect balance for Anna Garbo in this area and a fast moving film just 90 years old . minutes, does not give us too much time to miss it - one of the few advantages from showing the atmosphere, and not eloquently described in the original - And screenwriter Marion is wise enough to move away from O'Neill to bring Dassler back for a touching scene two-thirds of the way through the film, which will remind many of the appearance of the second act of Julie Laverne in the SHOW BOAT. <br /> <br /> An early scene of Anne and Marty, taken together on the screen (16 minutes after the beginning of the film), taking measures of each other and setting all the tension in the rest of the story, is one of the most impressive scenes in the whole play. Do not miss. <br /> <br /> Anna Christie is a great tragic play and a good drama show. It is hard to imagine that the last remake, which would almost certainly have lost the grain and atmosphere of this 1930 remake (it was first filmed without sound in 1923 - also with original Broadway Chris George Marion) could have improved this excellent shooting. <br /> <br /> Inner scenes look closest to the play, but the appearance should not be missed by anyone with an eye to the atmosphere. While the background work of the screen does not meet modern technical standards, the background images give a better idea than most films of the real-world era in which the screen is installed (especially in New York harbor). <br /> <br /> Almost all the naturalistic speeches of Garbo in the era of sound weathered beautifully (only too often the mocked death scene from CAMILLE, 7 years later, sometimes causes chuckles due to heavy direction and parodies), but this ANNA Christie, together with the variety of her 1932 films “MATA HARI” and “GRAND HOTEL”, as well as the sublime lubic touch of her 1939 comedy “NONOTCHKA” (“Garbo laughs!”) will undoubtedly be her best. <br /> <br /> O 'Fans of Nill, who are fascinated by this play on the verge of his vaunted "sea play", should track the wonderful film in the form of World War II, released a year before the US entered the conflict, "The House of Long Swimming" (1940). He is almost as artfully drawn from these sea plays as this one from ANNA Christie, and it depicts young John Wayne in one of his rare non-Western, supporting an excellent team of veterans showing him the way.
