This film consists of 4 parts, and the duration of each film is about 170 minutes. It is based on the real life story of Joe Bonanno and tells everyone how he saw. So in some cases we may notice that we heard about it differently. The movie makes you sit on a chair until the end, I think you can watch all 4 in a row, and not notice that I watched 2 in a row and 2 the next day in a row. Making movies is normal, in some scenes it’s awesome, but overall it may seem trivial, but this film is not about acting or special effects and glamor, it’s one of the real shows, and history is the key to this movie. So whoever is looking for the same exciting Rambo / Matrix / Titanic movie, you can skip this one. The good thing about the movie is that you follow the main story so that you don't have long and boring love scenes or any other interruptions with something that is not important for the criminal business Bonanno.
