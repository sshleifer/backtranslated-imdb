"Oppenheimer" with Sam Waterston in the lead role and with David Suchet in the role of Evard Teller is an example of dokram in all its glory. Well written, well played by actors who have a plausible resemblance to their historical characters, very informative and very interesting. The scenography and costumes reflect the feeling of the United States during World War II, and the plot and the dialogue create the viewer’s feeling that he was really present at Los Alamos and was captured by the excitement of the Manhattan project. The only drawback is that this is a British production, and some actors lack the ability to influence a convincing American accent. (The art of modern Australian and Irish actors taking non-native dialects is striking.) The storyline is fully in line with Richard Rhodes' final story about the development of the atomic bomb. Unfortunately, the mini-series was shown only a few times on PBS in the early 1980s, and then apparently disappeared into oblivion. <br /> <br /> “Oppenheimer” compares favorably with the later “Fat Man and Little” feature film “The Boy” with Paul Newman as Leslie Groves (a chronically heavy and rather homely general would be very flattered) and Dwight Schulz (graduate Television "Teams") as Oppenheimer. As a mini-series, the Oppenheimer is about 4 times longer than the Newman function, but uses all the extra time completely to its advantage.
