“The Man with the Screaming Brain”, filmed exclusively in Bulgaria, is a funny love story between two rich ugly Americans and a murderer of a gypsy from a hotel. <br /> <br /> William Cole and his wife Jackie arrive in Bulgaria on a business trip and take a taxi driven by the energetic Egor. Things start to go awry when Tatoy, the maid, kill Egor and William, and the mad scientist injects a piece of Egor's brain into William's head. The robots eventually become involved, as well as gypsies with broken fingers, head injuries, Bruce Campbell on a pink Vespa with cute little streamers and a physical hero in the “all-me” comedy with a voice in his head that controls half of his body. <br /> <br /> “The Man with the Screaming Brain” is an incredibly funny movie. He has the funniest trekking picture I've ever seen (when Bruce Campbell's character, fresh from the lab and bundled with a giant scar on his forehead and blue hospital pajamas, runs into the square and scares the crowd of people) and a falling murder scene on which the whole viewer checked screams of laughter. All this is a hell of a riot from start to finish, and I would recommend it to any physical comedy lover, Bruce Campbell, or B-films in general.
