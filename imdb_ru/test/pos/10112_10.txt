The Tale of Two Sisters, or Jangwa, Hongrion, is a true masterpiece. A brilliant psychological thriller, a heart-rending drama and breathtaking horror - all in one beautifully organized package. From a complex plot, to a beautiful cinema, to an absolutely perfect cast, every aspect of this film is unusual. <br /> <br /> For fear of revealing too much about the plot, I’ll just say it’s very nice. At first it may seem a bit difficult to understand, but in the end it explains well. And if you prefer a psychological thriller, drama or horror, I promise you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, this is almost flawless. Filming, cinematography, lighting and especially the soundtrack - all this is fascinating. At first, the waltz seemed like a strange choice, but it turned out to be brilliant. <br /> <br /> With regard to casting, we are talking about absolute perfection. I am Soo-joon completely persuasive as a caller, but concerned about Soo-mi. Mun Kyung Yong is equally as convincing as her emotionally injured sister Soo-yong. These two girls were magical on the screen. Of course, I will watch their other films. Yom Jong-ah, like a stepmother, is deceptively cheerful and viciously vicious. Finally, Kapsu Su Kim copes well with the role of a tired, broken father. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. If you have not seen The Tale of Two Sisters, I highly recommend finding a copy. This is a real gem worthy of anyone's collection. <br /> <br /> (10/10)
