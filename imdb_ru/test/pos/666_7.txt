This particular PADO-GEDDON from the LATU EYE was littered with complaints (more on this later) when it was shown in 2001 after a national discussion about the possible "Sarah law" after the abduction and murder of schoolgirl Sarah Payne. In fact, his planning was postponed, while Phil Collins sought legal advice after he learned that the creator of the show, Chris Morris, had deceived him, and he began a campaign called Nonsense. <br /> <br /> If true It is said that this show was probably remembered more because of controversy than the content, which is of very bad taste, but I confess that I laughed out loud. The publication is dedicated to pedophiles and how society treats them and their victims. Chris Morris plays the lead, who tells viewers that the infamous pedophile was launched into space, and then admits that an eight-year-old child was accidentally placed in a capsule along with a pedophile. Give a scared baby cries. As I said, a very bad taste. <br /> <br /> Among other highlights of the show is Dr. Fox, who is giving a scientific lecture that pedophiles have the same nervous system with crabs (“No one knows this, but this is a scientific fact "). MP Barbara Follet publicly warns about the equipment pedophiles put on their genitals while surfing the net, and Kate Thornton warns viewers that pedophiles can send gas over the Internet, making young children acceptable to sexual predators, including one victim. “Once upon a time it was a shy innocent child. and who now has the sexuality of a sixty-year-old colonel. "Morris also shows serious photos to a police officer in the child protection squad who want to know if they are not classified as obscene. The photos showed Barbie surrounded by marital aides and dog body and erect penis, which could only belong to John Holmes. Hey, I never said that this show was tasteful, was it? <br /> <br /> PEDO-GEDDON should not be mentioned without hypocritical disruption and who surrounded him when politicians, children's organizations and policemen rushed to condemn the show for ridiculing a very serious topic. The show had a bad taste, even though I laughed until the end, but it’s a biting satire. in the mirror where the liberal elite allow convicted slimy pedophiles to walk the streets of Britain before they criticize a simple TV show for exacerbating tensions.
