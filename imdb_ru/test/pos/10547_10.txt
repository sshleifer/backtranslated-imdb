I love this movie, it's great and so funny, Ben comes up and I don't mind meeting him on vacation !! I rate this film as 10, because it is gr8, and I hope that they will never make it again, because it will never be the same. It's funny that Andre looks at the moon and shouts Nicole “go outside and look at the moon”, which always makes me laugh and never becomes old. Another thing is that Nicole looks much older than 14 years ... but she has an actress. But I need help with something. Is there no name for the song played at the end, when Nicole and Andre are dancing ??? It really bothers me, because I want 2 no, that it is, because it is a good song!
