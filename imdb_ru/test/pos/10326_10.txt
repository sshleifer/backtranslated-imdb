The whole civilized world by now knows that it is here that Emil Sitka says to his immortal: “Hold hands, love birds” But Shemp Howard, music professor, steals the show. See how he teaches Dee Green while she breaks The Voices of Spring. Watch Shemp shave by the mirror hanging from the ceiling on a string. Watch him while he suffers from Christine McIntyre. Watch him and you will laugh and learn. Mo is also not a fool. See how he is trying to get a woman to get into a bear trap. Larry, as usual, is a master of Zen reaction. In general, one of the best shorts Stooge. You will not find a single weak point.
