The show was awesome and very professional. Madonna nonstop dancing and singing for 2 hours. The discovery was pretty good when she came out of the disco ball, and the jump was a really good performance. The whole concert was full of energy, so it’s hard to say which of them were the brightest, because each song had something special and unique. I saw a couple of her previous tours live (the drowned world and the reinvention tour), they were good, but you can't compare with that. The dancers were fantastic, the light and the whole performance were just perfect. Madonna still looks very good. If you haven’t seen it yet, I highly recommend that you see it. You will enjoy the show from start to finish. Madonna is still dancing queen.
