This is really the only chance to see the magic of letters of James Joyce brought to life. All his novels are illegible (in any real sense), and this is the only long story he has written. It was the last film of John Houston, and he did not appear on the screen until he died, and it is easy to see his touch of greatness. “The Dead” are poetic in their approach to the screen, telling us more about Ireland than any modern film about the IRA and the “troubles” that could ever tell us. We hope that more people will watch this movie and get to know the best John Houston and James Joyce, and perhaps visit this story at your local bookstore (and find that this is probably the best novel ever written on paper ).
