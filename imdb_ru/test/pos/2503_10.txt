So well done. Photography, sound, music and performances were the best. It's also a funny storyline that brings a smile to every scene â€” I liked it, and I'm a 60-year-old heterosexual guy. Each character seemed to fit their target. This is the best performance I saw from Miss Capshaw - she starred in more films than I thought, but it was a remarkable achievement. I believe that this is a plus to the fact that you have Spielberg money, which allows you to get a rich budget and the best money you can buy technically. Two of the actors already have successful T.V. shows. - easy to understand why. Tom Selleck does his usual good work.
