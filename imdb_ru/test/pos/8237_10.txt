It is well known that Irene Dunn could sing a little more than a little. And I think that her talent for a comedian can only really be understood after someone has made his way through Haydn’s sonata or Debussy’s song and achieved success. Her instrument is her voice, and her treatment of her is pure musicality. She can do any part. The only thing she could not do was not succeed. This film is a great example. In it, she conveys Ruth Gordon (because the game is a thing), feminine, charming, self-willed and modest, generous, protective and warlike, but never pretentious. She manages to remain as believable as Alexander Knox in another difficult role with aplomb. The viewer believes in what he sees and cares about him. It is nice to see a film that is both interesting and intelligent, while pressing all the necessary patriotic buttons. I sincerely hope that all Dunn's works will once be on DVD, because it is very difficult to keep such a secret among several initiates.
