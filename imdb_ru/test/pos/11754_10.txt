Two great stars and a legendary director have created a great pulsating love story that is remembered and moves on many levels. <br /> <br /> Henry King shot Jennifer Jones in his first hit "Song of Bernadette", and he again directed Jennifer Jones to This film and Miss Jones are perfect for this role and give a sharp, beautiful presentation that reflects the conflict between character and Bill Holden, who hit a home round after a home run in the 1950s with a series of stunning hits starting from Sunset Boulevard, Stalag 17, Born yesterday, Country Girl, Picnic and, of course, River Qui is great in this roles It's hard to imagine anyone other than Holden in this film, I liked the finale, and I cry every time I see him. For anyone who has ever loved and lost, you will understand. For those who do not, you will not.
