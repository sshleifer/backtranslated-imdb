I consider myself a casual fan of Dario Argento. For every really good click (such as "Deep Red" and "Tenebre"), there seems to be one that is equally boring (its output, since Opera has a tendency to disappoint). Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that when At its best, there are several horror directors who can lead it. I think Opera is the best work of Argento. <br /> <br /> This film contains all of its trademarks. There are no well-developed characters, and the plot does not make much sense as soon as you begin to study it. Nevertheless, think of Argento as the European equivalent of Brian DePalma - style - that’s all that matters here, as it becomes an entity. Typically for Argento, there are several beautifully shot murder episodes. Those who are not familiar with the work of this person may take this as a sadistic remark (and this may be, given their misogyny in time), but this is true. Argento poses murders with the complexity of spectacular visual details. He really makes graphic violence a form of art. In addition, his direction and the appearance of his films are impeccable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, “Opera” is one of his most frightening works. Argento is the only director who, I think, rock music works well for horror episodes (when others try to do it, it sounds silly). Acting varies, with Cristina Marsillah playing a beautiful and quite sympathetic, but never particularly lively young operatic artist. The rest of the actors are professional and do their job, but again, with Argento, acting never matters. These are beautiful colors, terrifying violence and the overall atmosphere of a dream / nightmare. (9/10)
