I saw it at a German press show. Not giving away too much: most critics really thought that they liked it very much. Later, there was even applause, which is quite unusual for this view. From my point of view, and so far it was the funniest film of the year. It retains the charm and wit of three W + G shorts and is complemented by numerous references to these and other films. Of course, there are obvious hints on films about monsters and werewolves, especially on “American werewolf in London”, “Jaws”, “King Kong” and even on “Braindead” / “Dead Alive” by Peter Jackson, but also on other genres . <br /> <br /> The characterization was better accomplished in "Chicken Run", but in this film there was a completely new "cast" where the introduction was necessary. Here you can already know the two main characters. So, the new film "Wallace and Gromit" like best if you have already watched (and loved) shorts, but it also works on its own. Chicken Run was more convenient, but also more “plot-based”. Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece retains this insane and somewhat more “isolated” sensation of W + G shorts. Children should also enjoy it, especially because of cute rabbits (if you like cute rabbits, you definitely need to see it !! !), and also because Gromit does a lot and steals the show (children also love dogs ... :-)). But many jokes are meant for a more adult audience (there are even soft sexual hints in it). The film, like Shrek 1 + 2 and The Incredible, features an entertainment program for the whole family, with the addition of the British and at least a bit darker edge to the humor of American animated films. <Br /> <br /> Animation is ?? as expected ?? excellent, and they remained faithful to the Aardman style, because they didn't add too many digital effects — I understood only a few of them when it came to Wallace's inventions. <br /> <br /> Finally, the score works great in the film, although one of the main themes is definitely “borrowed” by Randy Edelman’s dragon heart score. <br /> <br /> It’s a bad thing that will probably take another six years until we see a new animated film. gem from nick park & ​​co.
