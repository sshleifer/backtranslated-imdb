This film is about a very delicate dispute, and if you are looking for something that makes you think that you are right. Tim Robbins did a wonderful job, and the result was some kind of documentary drama that needs to be shown in schools (for strong topics) What about the actors? Well, they are just great; Susan Sarandon is truly “the face of love,” and Sean Penn is incredible, as is almost always the case. Must see!
