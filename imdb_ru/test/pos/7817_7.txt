There are several reviews that comment on the cast of this film. Suffice it to say that Alex Kord plays a strong advantage over Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy. What worries me is that many of you may not be aware of (at least) the two existing versions of this film. In the US version, Clay McCord receives an amnesty from Governor Lem Carter, and then travels outside the city, redeemed. I agree that ending is less than satisfaction. However, in the original Italian cut, Clay McCord travels out of town (unarmed because he turned his pistols to the governor) and was hit by bounty hunters who slowly depopulated the city of Escondido gangsters. Kounty Killers is thrilled at the prospect of sharing a $ 10,000 reward, but disappointed that McCord entered into an amnesty agreement in the pocket of corpses. When they leave, you can hear the comment: “If this amnesty continues, I will begin to hunt bison!” This in itself takes a minute to pray ... a second to die and puts it on a level playing field with such films, like Keoma and The Big Gundown. At the end of the credits say that in the Italian section "FINE".
