Apolitical musicians Eva (Liv Ulmann) and Jan Rosenberg (Max von Sydow) have been married for seven years and live on a small farm on a remote island to escape from civil war on the continent. They give lingonberries a couple of customers to collect some money and buy some materials. They love each other, and Eva is twenty years old, and she wants to give birth to a child, but the reluctant Yang, a weak and sensitive person, does not want to have children. When the rebels arrive on the island, their peaceful and peaceful life turns into hell, and they fall into the center of accusations on both sides. When Colonel Jacobi (Gunnar Björnstrand) pursues Eve, Jan changes his behavior and becomes a cruel person, and the love and affection that they feel for each other are replaced by hatred and indifference. <br /> <br /> “Shame” - the anti-war film by master Ingmar Bergman is focused through the eyes of several artists who are apolitical and not listening to the news, but when the war arrives on their lands, their love, friendship and affection are destroyed by meaningless soldiers. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow, as usual, perform at the highest level, and I don’t recall that Liv Ullmann’s chest was in any other film. The process of cruelty of the Silent and Sensitive Jan Rosenberg by the war is impressive, and the gloomy open conclusion is a pessimistic and adequately dramatic story. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “Vergonia” (“Shame”)
