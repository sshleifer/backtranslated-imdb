I'm still waiting for the new DVD release of this amazing film. I have a beta max recording with french. Unfortunately, MGM skips the French track on its recent DVD ... It's just that English speaks French subtitles ... I don't know how to make MGM advise: I wrote letters to them, but of course there was no answer. If I insist, it is because exclusively, French dubbing was spectacular, funny, well written, etc. George Scottâ€™s play is always outstanding, and for people born like me in the 50s, Diane Rigg completely different than Madonna (for example). Thanks for the help ... Regards ...
