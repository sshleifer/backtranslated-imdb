And I don't understand why the show is beating so hard. In my opinion, this show is really excellent. Well, the first two episodes were not so good, but gaining momentum in the third episode. Which seems typical of Steve Moffat's sitcom. I would call it one of the best sitcoms ever created in Britain. <br /> <br /> The show itself is a farce at its best, itâ€™s not in the spirit of Fawlty Towers, but you can definitely rate it as a black adder, clutch or young! I watch the first season, and all I can say is that I am happy that I bought a DVD! <br /> <br /> The problem with this show was probably why it was hit so hard, according to the Internet, that the original press release compared it to Fawlty Towers, and everyone was disappointed that it was not! Well, even Green Wing is closer to Fawlty Towers than this show, all I can say is to clear your mind of all prejudices, give the show at least a run up (including episode 3), and then decide for yourself! <br /> <br /> All I can say is thanks to Steve Moffat for writing this, and thanks for all the staff who do this!
