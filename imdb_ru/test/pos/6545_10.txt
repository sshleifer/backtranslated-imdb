I remember watching this movie many years ago on VHS with friends. At first I thought it would be a boring car movie. But, to my great surprise, he turned out to be one of the best films that I remember when I watched his time. <br /> <br /> He has a good storyline, and, best of all, it has awesome Australian cars and street racing. Most of all I liked the Fox car, which was a used Dodge Charger. In my opinion, the paint work performed on this car was really outstanding :)! <br /> <br /> There are still black two-door 57 Chev, which will appear in the film later. <br /> <br /> I really managed to get a copy of this film on VHS last year at K-Mart here in Australia. I had plans to convert this film to DVD, since I believe that this film is worth it to convert. But to my surprise this weekend, when I was viewing the DVD bin, I came across it on the DVD. So, of course, I grabbed it while I could, because it was the only copy. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you really want to see classic street races with real muscle machines, including a great storyline without a rice cooker in sight. Then this movie is for you !!!! <br /> <br /> Here is additional information taken from the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> He will win at all costs, Fox is a young Man who lives in a fast lane. He believes that he is the fastest man on the road - but street racing is prohibited. If he doesnâ€™t accept his last challenge, he can lose his girlfriend ... if he accepts, he can lose his life. Life is dangerous, living fast and winning at any cost is their obsession. They do not turn around, do not give up ... and do not ask for help.
