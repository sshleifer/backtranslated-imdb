"Identity ?? “I am part of my environment, and I became separated from them, and he is able to clearly distinguish between these differences, which allow us to have an identity, and that within our identity is all that ever happened to us” (Ntozake Shange qtd in Lights in the Mirror. "). <br /> <br /> Things like Decalogue V scared me. I felt that if I accepted them I would compromise something. That I thought before, it’s really not worth going into it. I understand what naturalism is trying to say. I felt a tangible catharsis, and one that arose from parts, and the one that is still alive, which I still have to reckon with. It still works inside of me. <br /> <br /> The film itself was not sympathetic. Needless to say that the death penalty is a wicked thing There are, of course, evil people; should they die for another film? The decalogue shows that there are good, beautiful people who kill others when their society and primitive motives raise them. <br /> <br /> The “science” of naturalism is what helped me evaluate Decalogue V. It’s not worth writing why I don’t allow myself to come before, but now I see value in creating art like this to “make” people , or perhaps make people do something. <br /> <br /> Lazar has a way to compromise him. light Most of this value makes sense only in retrospect. This should not be too strange for an idea: after all, how much respectable science does not make sense in retrospect. I frown when I say this, but Naturalism seems much more productive and much less nihilistic when I can say to myself: "This collapse, this process, this natural process makes me want to break the system." <br /> <br /> I do not think that naturalism paints a portrait of humanity of the end of the world, ordering us to abandon our powdered wigs and go to the forest. Instead, I think that this is a cataloging of evidence and experiments, which of course we can ignore. We can ignore everything we want if we want to give naturalists more corpses for burial. <br /> <br /> Of course, despite the fact that their aesthetics were specially developed without sympathy for the probable and catastrophic fate of their characters, they are fascinated by the inaction of readers and the snobbery of writers. I see a wonderful risk in the hope that the audience will understand what to do with what they see. As already mentioned, in a hopeless form there is a danger that their fate is immortalized in stone. The danger lies in the fact that the promising belittle the Natural because it does not correspond to their worldview. <br /> <br /> And I don’t think that “promising” should be rich or happy. I have not seen this, but it seems that the film American Beauty proves the inadequacy of circumstances as a provider of vision or comfort. There are both ascetics and gluttons, as well as beggars, who wonder where their humanity is in them, who grieve because they cannot find anything that separates them from their landscape. <br /> <br /> Landscapes can be powerfully and beautifully depicted, but in reality landscapes do not work. They change, of course, and dramatically, but only because of the large set of laws of Nature, over which no one really has power. But this cannot be changed by itself.
