Starting with Naruto, 2 full-length theatrical films have appeared in the anime series, and the third will be released this summer. <br /> <br /> The first one, which was released in the summer of 2004, was a fun adventure. with the participation of the main characters Naruto in an exciting adventure. However, to deny the shortcomings of this film, you need to be blind, deaf and one-legged chicken. Although the first one was definitely enjoyable, there were many things that could be improved. Naruto Movie 2, however, takes all these aspects and surpasses them. <br /> <br /> The action was above all incredibly cinematic. Lighting, decor and style were three times more effective than in the first film. In the first we were given a basic action, well animated and choreographic animation, but nothing special, but the cinematography of this film was exceptional, using a combination of shadows and lighting to make the action more intense was very effective and added to the Power of the fighting. <br /> <br /> The animation was very good. He competed with Disney, however, since it was a film about television characters, there was nothing exceptional about character design and character details, but the animation was incredibly smooth and realistic. I think they even used double the number of cells every second, because there was absolutely nothing nervous about the animation, it was incredibly smooth. <br /> <br /> Music ... I think this film is failing, the original composer / conductor for the TV show was used for the film, and I really don’t feel that he did the job well. The music basically reminded me of the many plays used in the old SNES games. The composer is very good, but the synthesizers used for the film could not convey the melody very well. However, they did not fail the film at all, adding as a good accompaniment to the action. But, with the exception of a few violin / string pieces at the end and some choral works, the music did not go beyond and did not play anything special. <br /> <br /> The story was fun. It was a rather typical narrative storyline for Naruto, and it was very similar to the first films, except that, again, she took everything that was wrong with the story of the first film, and improved them. The characters were much more interesting, and the way the story progressed made me watch the whole movie. It made you think that the movie would end at any second, but then it would move on, but instead of feeling stretched, the action and the characters made everything stay fresh and exciting. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is good, but no matter how good it is, it is definitely for fans. I liked the movie, but it's because ... I'm a fan! But I see, as in the case of “Children's Comings” in Final Fantasy, it does not exceed the film, but simply serves as a fantastic fan service for a good one and a half hours. Although I think that this film serves as a good introduction to the series for current non-spectators, it will not give the full effect to anyone except those who are glued to Naruto screens. However, despite all this, it was a funny movie that could be enjoyed during this depressing period of frustrating fillers.
