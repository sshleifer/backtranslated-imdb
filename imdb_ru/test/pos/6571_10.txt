Each frame in the film is a lesson for new directors or existing directors to learn how to make a film. Hats off to Sehar. It is undervalued in the Indian film industry. The director has all the qualities to make this film in the range of rays Satyajira, Adura. Each character is effectively portrayed in the film. Although it is a simple story, it was adopted to such an extent that it can be considered one of the best in India. I have not enough adjectives to praise the film. Just as life goes on in a casual atmosphere, the film was shot. Although the songs in Indian films are considered a weak point, the songs in this film gave extra energy to the potential of the film ... especially the background rating ... it's amazing
