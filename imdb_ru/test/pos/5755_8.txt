This is the jewel of the film, an abundance of cruelty, Simon Pegg and Green Spev. <br /> <br /> A suspicious-looking powerplant and an out-of-control motorcycle add to this stone. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen this yet, I highly recommend it, maybe not as good as the bottom, but not too short. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen a man pierced by a nose on two hooks, then what are you waiting for to buy this film? <br /> <br /> I didn’t even see a turnaround at the end, when it turns out that Richie and Eddie are both ghosts. <br /> <br /> Feeb - 1 boiled egg.
