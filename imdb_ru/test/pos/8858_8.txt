The Thing should be one of the best movies of all time. Of course, these were amazing special effects at the time of its release, which made such a strong impression on me: in 1982 it just struck me, I had never seen anything like it! However, although the effects themselves made the film more horrible, the story itself, the musical score, the claustrophobic atmosphere of Anarctic, and the interaction and tension between the members of the doomed research station make it classic. <br /> <br /> Cinema is not getting better! In the initial scene with a helicopter chasing this husky, you just assume that it was some bored scientists from some station that let off steam. However, when you see that they continue their pursuit at the American base, you think that the Norwegians are suffering from some form of progressive or extreme strain of fever. However, this is offset by a threatening opening score that sets the pace! You just know that something is wrong! At the moment, this is a mystery until the “thing” reveals itself. <br /> <br /> However, the riddle returns, because it becomes Agatha Christie’s “Who does not know” science fiction style (i.e., ten small films about Indians), because the participants do not know who of their team is really alien. Suspicion continues to go back and forth between them, because one by one they eventually become confused or unfold as an alien. The distrust between the film crew is absorbed as the film progresses to the final fight. <br /> <br /> After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and filmmaking, the special effects in the movie “The Thing” do not carry the same weight as in 1982, but otherwise it is very good with all the actors.
