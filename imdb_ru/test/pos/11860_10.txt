I first saw this film at the premiere party in Mr. Zwartz Fredrikstad’s hometown. There, between directors, musicians and other Norwegian celebrities, I laughed and laughed ... I just could not stop. If you like comedy with black humor, sharp lines and great acting, this is one movie you MUST see! This is the same as mixing “The Real Romance” with “The Wedding Singer” and adding the line “Lots of crazy about you”, Ilarios! <br /> <br /> 10 points!
