My friends and I gathered together in the same house to watch it on Friday evening, before going to the pub. It was the only program that made us miss the opening times. This is one of the best comedies I've ever watched, if not the best. David Jason was great and was compared many times to Buster Keaton with his clever tricks that were performed so believably. I wish I could get the TV show on DVD to watch again. He had an amazing ability to make stupid things believable, and this series shows how many talents he has in many different directions. He is an experienced “Traveler and a falling guy,” and I remember once watching a trailer where he showed people how to do it professionally. Of course, he is the one who teaches people this art. He only showed it in other programs that he did. Pshou, this program shows how talented he is. I got lost about why David Jason vetoed another series, because, in my opinion, it was one of the best things he had ever done, and I had been a fan of him since he did this series. They say that he did not like it, because it showed the rudeness of his early career. In my opinion, perhaps it was the right decision when he made it, but now his career has advanced so far that I think it would be a good time for him to do another series showing that he is looking back at his "secret life ". "is full of blunders that he does not see. rod
