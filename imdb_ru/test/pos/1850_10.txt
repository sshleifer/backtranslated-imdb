I saw this movie with my mother, and I liked it! It was such a cute story (not to mention that it is funny because of the cast!) They never make such films ... never! My favorite part is when Grace (Minnie Driver) finds out about the death of her boyfriend’s wife and that she’s deceased wife’s heart, and she screams: “WHAT GOD WANT?” I believe everyone ( whom you believe) have such thoughts from time to time. But despite the fact that it is very sad, it can make you believe in true love and destiny once and for all. (Sigh) <br /> <br /> The comic time between Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi will just make you upset, especially in the aforementioned scene, it's terrible, and yet so funny!) They make a good pair, and I hope to see them again soon. 10/10 stars
