What can I say about this movie, except that it is a lot of fun! <br /> <br /> John Cusack plays Hoops McCann, a recent high school graduate who has two choices: learn how to run a street-cleaning family business or spend summer in Nantucket with his friend George Calraymary (played by Joel Murray) and his crazy friends. <br /> <br /> When I say “zen,” believe me, he cannot become much more evil than the Stork brothers, Egg (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Clay (Tom Willard) and Ak Ak Raymond (Curtis Armstrong). Add to her a little girl named Squid and her monstrous mongrel and the great performance of Demi Moore, and you will get the opportunity to split around, laughing, the film. <br /> <br /> In this film and in history, the Line laughs freely, although the typical good versus the good and the good wins, gorgeous with the turn of the regatta as an opening. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a lot of laughter and fun. If you like * enjoying * your movies, then you can't miss One Crazy Summer!
