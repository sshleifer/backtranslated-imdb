This is my first John Carpenter film, I must say that The Thing impressed me a lot. From the very beginning, the film attracts you and never weakens. The special effects and movie models hold well even today. Besides Kurt Russell, I was not acquainted with any of the actors, but they were all exceptional in that they inspired fear, paranoia, and despair to survive. Universal DVD has many very interesting backstage add-ons. Highly recommended, 9/10.
