As is the case with many such films, my non-Catholicism prevented me from understanding this. In the church there are a lot of rules that evolved over the centuries. We have little time to learn them and take them at face value. Then add some bad guys who will take revenge for a long and distant act against them, working on these rules and trying to get around them, and you have this book and film. I caught myself thinking, “This is pretty cool. Why did they do it? ”In the character of Robert Langdon there is such a random thing, where, no matter what the problem, he always seems to make the right first move. I guess this is similar to viewing CSI, where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days. They know what lies on the ground. This film has so much land and so little time to truly understand everything that is happening. But if you create Robert Langdon, you need to set it up for work. This is normal, because heroic nerds like him saved the day forever. I thought the movie was funny. I thought the Da Vinci Code was fun too. Interesting and not as bad as it seemed to people. This is a miracle that can be watched, and it does not stop for a second.
