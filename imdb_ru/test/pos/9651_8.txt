The reason I look at this is because the previous review was written by someone who came out of this film, not even halfway through. Unfortunately for him, he missed the film of stunning beauty. He agreed that the film began very slowly, in fact, my friend, with whom I briefly fell asleep, woke him up before his snoring disturbed the rest of the audience. Fortunately, from there the film turned into a story of love, drugs and what it was like to be young and free in the experimental 60s. Fantastic performances of two main roles and a great look at the film, which gave it a real authentic look. Be patient, like so many great movies, wait for them, and this is definitely a film that I look forward to seeing again! 8/10
