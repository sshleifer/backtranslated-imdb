The film is a remake of the 1956 BBC series called My Friend Charles, and, as such, it skips over the material in a relatively short time. I found it fast moving, enjoyable and unassuming. Has anyone else noticed the scene near the end where john mills was gasping? - the producers obviously decided to omit the scenes - maybe censorship? - but they noticed when he was sitting by the window of the apartment, breathing deeply, followed by similar scenes with the car window open. The series of Francis Durbridge seemed to all live in the same universe where unexplainable events took place, people were not what they seemed, but the villain was someone close to the hero / victim. ,
