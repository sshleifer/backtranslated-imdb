By now everyone knows that 15 Park Avenue is a story about a schizophrenic girl and her half-sister. <br /> <br /> The manifestation of schizophrenia is still regarded as a disease that people often feel if it is ignored. There are also those who, no matter how strange it may seem when shown in a film, think that the disease manifests itself as a result of some kind of supernatural influence. I think Ms. Sen deserves a lot of praise for 15 Park Avenue. She made a good turn not only to the general public, but also to those who deal with schizophrenics ... relatives, social workers, psychoanalysts. The film actually helps to dispel many myths and misconceptions about the exact nature of this psychological disorder. I am told that the film is largely based on her personal experience with a person very close to her who suffers from this mental illness. In this regard, I am sure that nothing of what has been shown is not disproportionate ... on the contrary, this is a true representation of the facts. <br /> <br /> in general, as expected. Konkona Saint Sharma, Shabana Azmi and, of course, Rahul Bose, are really very good. They look like very "real" characters ... reliable enough to be able to identify with them from time to time. People may consider me terribly strange, but I think that there are times when you can identify with Miti! I guess we all have a band of "madness" inside of us .... maybe some are bigger than others. These are people who are highlighted. After all, do we all have our secret fantasies and dreams? Impossible, at times? Will we be called “out of our rockers” if people can look into these areas of our mind? Will a person with low self-esteem be considered schizophrenic because he / she avoids the company ... preferring instead to live in his own world, because this is the only place where there is a feeling of security? <Br /> <br /> Konkona, like Miti, outstanding !! Her performance is so easy ... she lives her role. She showed the ability to put an audience to sleep, forgetting about the gap between reality and the game! As an example, the case when she was upset at the place of the show on television of the arrest of Saddam Hussein. Her reaction seems so free and tense ... as if she is really heartbroken because of this tragedy! Her Indian English brand is also very spontaneous and natural. <br /> <br /> However, this cannot be said for at least a couple of other actors. Kanwaljeet and Waheeda Rehman, the magnificent actors, both seem to feel uneasy when they engage in dialogue in English. Their diction is less than perfect ... unnatural and amazed, the fact that they are making maximum efforts becomes more than obvious. Their dialogues are confusing and tend to disrupt the smooth progress of the story. <br /> <br /> Mithi (Concon's) brutal rape seems somewhat unnecessary. I feel that any other incident would be enough. The fact is that something causes an extreme manifestation of the disease. As the psychiatrist explains, it is impossible to say with any degree of conviction or confidence that the rape incident helped to reveal the hidden tendency to schizophrenia. Then why are we exposed to the scene where Mithi lies bleeding and unconscious? Has Mrs. Sen tried to make a social statement about the state of politics in our country, where the voice of the masses is muffled by a handful of people who resort to violence in order to remain in power? If so, then the rape scene is justified, but not strictly in the context of the main part of the film. <br /> <br /> The ending seems somewhat unexpected. Is the audience expected to find a solution? Where does Mitya disappear? Does Mrs. Sen want us to feel that perhaps what the psychiatrist says about whose reality is more real and therefore trustworthy, right? In other words, is she trying to say that we are not without bias, assessing who is on this side of the fine line between sanity and insanity? I'm not very sure. <br /> <br /> In general, a thought-provoking film that is worth seeing. However, if you're the kind of person who likes things to be neat and tidy ... everything is sliced ​​and dried, with a waterproof solution to every problem that arises ... this film is clearly not for you!
