My partner and I had never heard of this film and decided to give it a chance to choose a name from the list of films by cable, not knowing about it. When he opened and opened the cast, we thought: how could it be bad? - Katie Bates, Jonathan Price, Rupert Everett, Lynn Redgrave, Dan Acroyd and others. As the story progressed, we more and more tickled our choice, and soon the film made us laugh out loud. This is not a “great” film, but it is one of those rare films in which there is such a wonderful combination of memorable characters shot through surreal events like “true strange than fiction” that I couldn't help but love it. I had no problems “to suspend my disbelief” in some of the foolish elements of the plot, because the intentions of the filmmakers were so spiritual, although they still managed to play a trick on all the participants. As others have said on IMDb, this is a comfortable movie, and I, too, would not be surprised if it becomes a cult classic.
