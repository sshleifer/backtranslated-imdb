There is much in common between “Never Say Never” and “Thunderball”, not only in Shona Connery, but also in the plot and the plot. with the exception of the actors, all the others are the same as hijacking atomic bombs, asking for ransom, trading in nuclear weapons on the ship, etc. The only difference is the scene of the incident on the plot of the thunder ball, this is in the Bahamas over North Africa. And in the thunder-ball, NATO itself / the RAF loads nuclear weapons into the plane, and in “Never Say Never,” it is replaced by the “ruddy ax hand”, and the air falls over the US and is abducted in the Caribbean. Almost 99% is the same. If someone wants to challenge this, then he is very happy.
