I recently rented this video after watching the "Final Climb" of the same author. I was not prepared for how intense this film will be. I found this attractive from start to finish, and rooted for teenagers to get away from their attempted crime. The ending was definitely alarming, with some of her alleged violence, but well done. I highly recommend this picture.
