Do not expect the classic military comedy, which claims to ridicule the military, only strengthening the militaristic views. Instead, it destroys the elements that make the military such a deadly machine. Like the East German version of The Buffalo Soldiers. <br /> <br /> “NBA” works at a meta level that sympathizes with the attempts of its heroes to escape from military exercises in any accessible way. This is not about loud laughter, but about long smiles. Utopia, of course (in one scene you will be shown a harsh reality), but very thoughtfully. <br /> <br /> Just to fill in the required 10 lines: do not enter this film, if you were an army officer and liked your work.
