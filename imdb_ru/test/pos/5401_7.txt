The New York Times review says that Sigourney Weaver's character is taut and upset, and later she can be the sister of an MTM character in Ordinary People. What? Never. This lady was strange from the start. NOTHING like MTM in ordinary people. Excuse me. <br /> <br /> Next, the New York Times goes on to say that Sandy Travis Sigourney Weaver and Ben Travis Jeff Daniel are 40 years old, "children of the 60s." Miss Weaver must be dancing a jig. I believe that at the time when she made Imaginary Heroes, she was 55 years old. She was born in 1949. <br /> <br /> In addition to the correction of perception in the New York Time, it was a pretty good film, considering that it was shot by someone so young. Obviously, Sigourney Weaver thought so, as did Jeff Daniels. The young man playing Tim was outstanding. <br /> <br /> I would like to make a few critical remarks about the script. For example, I never understood why Sandy Travis missed her son. Her frustrated behavior may have been caused by his death, but this behavior continued throughout the film, which I felt was more associated with her stagnant marriage, her relationship with Tim, and where he came from, and other unresolved issues than from any mourning for her eldest son. Ben's mourning was much clearer. <br /> <br /> So Matt Travis was an asshole. His mom thought so too? Still, a very watchable movie. What is becoming clearer and clearer is not that there are no roles for women over a certain age, but that such a director as this one is required to love an elderly woman (Mrs. Weaver) so clearly and almost his film is a tribute to her. Like anti-woody allen.
