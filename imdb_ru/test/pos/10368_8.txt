Although I definitely read this book by Agatha Christie at some point, I did not remember anything about it, except for the title “Abernethie”. And this is good, because, having seen that this story unfolds, not knowing how it will end, I once again appreciated the clear Genius of Agatha Christie: the main reason for its success and timelessness. In addition to her stories, excellent production values, beautiful locations, beautiful music, first-class play, elegant direction, etc. the very beginning - the clues fell everywhere, even in the opening sequence! There are also some rather unnerving moments, unlike peaceful English-looking places in the countryside, and some minor touches of humor. It is necessary to look behind the mysterious lovers and just a very good film as a whole. (***)
