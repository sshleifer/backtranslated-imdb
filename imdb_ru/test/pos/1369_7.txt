My buddies and I spent most of the Sabbath day watching a series of “bad” films. Among the films that we watched, the strongest contender (for good pay for a bad movie) was easily Jack O. It's funny that movies like "Gigli", "Glitter" and "You Got Served" are listed at the bottom of IMDB. Although they are definitely bad films, they do not belong to the bottom 100. They rob Jack-O, Time Keeper, etc. About the Majesty of the Bad Film, which they so deservedly deserve. <br /> <br /> So what makes Jack-O so great (in terms of a bad movie)? First, director Steve Latshaw decided to play his son Ryan Latshaw in the role of Shawn Kelly. Unfortunately for Steve, Ryan Latshaw was dangerously close to being expelled a lump of wood. Seriously, the child has no ability to imitate. The end result: an unintended comic A child could listen to a joke, or just a few steps from a broken head, and his expression was stony “insensible.” Another aspect of the film that we found stunning was a huge amount of double sleep sequences "What is double sleep? Well, this is when a character wakes up from a nightmare, and then something same nightmarish happens, and then the character wakes up again. Basically: they wake up after waking up from a nightmare. Smart device, no? I believe that the character of Sean Kelly survived at least 3 sequences of double sleep. <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what else? Oh yeah! In this film, thousands of actors. It’s truly amazing to see how many talking roles are presented throughout the film. Best of all: almost none of the characters has anything to do with the story. They either killed Jack O, or they did not pursue any goal. <br /> <br /> Jack-O himself was pretty sweet. Like most other B-movie monsters, Jack-O has an amazing ability, it seems, to teleport over long distances. He always hangs somewhere in the background when you are dealing with the main character. But what is surprising is that when he actually chases someone, he moves at a wobbly / stumbling speed, and yet he can keep up with the sprint people. <br /> <br /> That's all for now. Concluding remarks: if you are looking for an inadvertently hilarious bad movie, you cannot go wrong by renting this beast. <br /> <br /> Bad movie rating: 7/10 Good movie rating: 3.5 / 10
