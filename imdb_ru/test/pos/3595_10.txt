This film is a love story against a background of war. Everything in the film was perfect. I just watched the movie yesterday and I want to get my DVD as soon as possible and watch it many times. The story ends when it began. I was very happy that he came back, and I was proud that she became a doctor and fulfilled her father's dream. She honored her father, boyfriend, husband, and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also a phenomenal actor. Some stories have happy endings. Aside from the point of view of a love story, I thought about how the war affected a beautiful, serene and peaceful island, and it made me realize that a real devastating war could befall his people ... the government makes a decision, and people suffer. Her father was a very educated man and wanted more for his daughter, while she had constant dreams. I liked the scene where she complains about the lack of a dowry, and I also liked the scene where both experienced an earthquake. They were survivors.
