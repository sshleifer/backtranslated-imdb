Sean Connery is very good as Great Raisuli, Lord of the Reefs and Defender of the Faithful. This is an adventure film with Arabs, Germans and USMC. In the interaction of the main and minor characters a lot of humor. The story is based on a true incident in which a rich Greek-American businessman was abducted by Raisuli in the early 1900s. Milius replaced Candice Bergen and her two children with abduction victims, and this opens the story to many literary rights. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film gives Milius the opportunity to remind the viewer of two of the most famous (although mostly forgotten) political quotes from the era of TR. Brian Keith (very well, as TR) says: “Pedekaris is alive or Raisuli is dead!”; and John Houston (also good as Secretary of State John Hay) asks the Japanese ambassador for dinner at the White House: "Do you like knives, do you like forks?"
