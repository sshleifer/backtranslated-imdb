Excellent historical material showing how the attitude has changed in 40 years. Great design, attractive stars, great lines (“Miss Bender, I don’t care if you beat it on your own drum!”, Says Amanda Farrow Hope Lange very short time). If you saw this film, panned and scanned on TV, and not in the mail version for pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics), you really have not seen it. We hope that this guilty pleasure from the film will soon be available on DVD in the version with boxes and the original 4-track stereo soundtrack. A great introductory title that really catches the mood of 1959 in New York, while Johnny Mathis sings the song “Best of Everything” in an echo chamber surrounded by a choir of violins and another choir of background screamers. Miscarriage Madness! Love affair at work! Boughs cold-blooded bosses! Love is ripped off! It is all here to enjoy.
