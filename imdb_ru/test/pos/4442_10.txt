During his career, Lucio Fulci made many wonderful films, and how many of them showed a huge mass of blood, led to the fact that he received the title "The Godfather of the Mountain." Although "Do not torture the duckling" was done before Fulci became widely known among the hounds, and that's not all! This, of course, sandy and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best movie that ever shot Fulci! Do not actually try to duck head and shoulders above many genres of Jallo in terms of production values, and unlike many of the later Fulci films, everything about this Jallo is great. The plot focuses on a small village community where corpses began to appear. The killings are even more shocking, because only boys are the victims. Shortly after the police admit that an innocent person has committed a crime, a reporter named Andrea Martelli arrives in the village and decides to launch an investigation into the killings on her own. Soon, Martelli confronts various suspects, including a sexy young woman named Patricia, an ominous priest and a local witch who loves to make stuffed wax and insert pins into them. <br /> <br /> Although this film may not have a lot of blood, it has two of the nastiest Fulchi sequences to make up for it. The most unpleasant thing is that the woman was brutally murdered by a group of men in the cemetery, while the image of a man falling from a rock and falling on any number of stones on the way down can lead to a reversal in the stomach. Do not try to duck with an absolutely magnificent Italian composition. Barbara Boucher (my personal favorite) is incredibly sexy in her role as Patricia and gets the opportunity to strain her acting muscles more than in many subsequent films. Thomas Millian is great as usual, while the rest of the cast is well developed such as Irene Pappas, Florinda Bolkan and Marc Porel. The cinematography is amazingly demonstrated, and Fulci really gives the viewer the impression that he pays a lot of attention and effort to every scene. The story unfolds slowly, and this is always interesting, since Fulci never allows the film to deviate too far from the central storyline. There is no big mystery regarding the identity of the killer; but Fulci almost manages to make us guess to the very end, and “Do not try to duck” reaches its maximum. In general, it is a shame that Fulci has not made more such films. “Don't torture the duckling” is his best work, and I insist that all Giallo fans see this!
