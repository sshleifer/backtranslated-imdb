This film is immediately conspicuous, with atmospheric aerial views of very nice Hong Kong. Filmed in those rich colors of the 1950s films that modern blockbusters never seem to shoot. Probably a sign of those times, because it is not powerful, saw it all before the film, full of chaos and violence. However, in the back, when thousands of refugees try to leave China, chaos and violence occur. This is a very touching and convincing story, full of hope and love in a tragic time in a recent story. The story of two people in love from different cultures. And what they are trying to overcome is the heart of this very beautiful and touching film.
