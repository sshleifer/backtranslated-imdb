I thought that I could be disappointed that I would watch this film again after so many years. On the contrary, now I was more impressed than in my youthful youth, with her honesty and bold humor. In 1969, the transition of African-American groups from the prevailing policy of reconciliation and integration to confrontation and self-determination was still quite new and more than controversial. It took courage and dexterity to portray both the establishment and the anti-establishment as caricatures that they often approximated in real life. Particular mention should be made of Arnold Johnson's speech: he successfully avoided turning his character into a sociopathy or a joke. I prefer to watch this than “Sir with Love” on any old day!
