Ah, Batman returns, is it possible to have a sequel that will be almost as good as the original? With Batman Returns, it came pretty close! We have amazing actors and a great plot with a dark knight and two new villains, Catwoman and Penguin. We got Michael Keaton back in the role of Batman, and he is still as great as ever. Michelle Pfiffer, the perfect choice for a catwoman and was ideally thrown into place. No matter how I loved and was such an incredible actress, Annette Benning, she could not be a catwoman, she really did not have that appearance. Danny DeVito, who could have introduced him as a penguin? He was just great and terrible! <br /> <br /> Batman returns with the more loving community of Gotham City, with whom they celebrate Christmas, with Max Shrek, played by the creepy Christopher Walken. The ideal villain who mistreats her sweet secretary, Celina, who accidentally hears too much in her office, forcing him to push her out the window in the hope that she will die, and never reveal information about Penguin's knowledge and trying to make him beloved Gotham. When she survives and is awakened by cats, she wants revenge and is ready to go for it with her cats! But there is another active villain, Penguin, who is looking for his parents who abandoned him, and now he is looking for a new mayor of Gotham City! Can Batman prevent both supervillains from creating their khan and preventing the mayor from destroying the city as well? <br /> <br /> You must see! The return of Batman is as good as the original Batman, despite the fact that the first one remains a true classic, this one will still give you a ride. And come on, I mean, we have Michelle in the skin! Her classic moment of meeting Batman and the penguin "Meow" is a classic! There are memorable characters, lines and sets! You will have a blast! Trust me! <br /> <br /> 9/10
