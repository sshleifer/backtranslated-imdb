Greta Garbo's stars in Anna Christie, the very early MGM of 1930's Tokka, the first time Garbo's Talks, Anna Christie, is a powerful film, but not for everyone. The film was shot as a stage play, a short film about the set and cinematography, a long conversation and dramatic characteristics. Eugene O'Neill, who wrote the play “Anna Christie,” is known for his dark works, and Garbo's character, Anna Christie, is a gloomy figure with a painful past. <br /> <br /> DVD sound quality was mediocre. It does not help that George F. Marion, who plays Anna's estranged father, Chris Christofferson, is orally difficult to understand. Marion performs well in the role of old drunken sailors, balancing on insanity with her looping on the evil “devil sea”. But his dialogue is written with a very heavy Swedish accent, this is true for the original O'Nills play. The dialogue between Marie Dressler and Marty Owens is equally difficult to understand. Dressler faithfully portrays the broken old drunken women, the "rat wharf." Her dialogue is also true to the original O'Nills play, as well as to Charles Bickford in the role of Irish sailors Matt Burke, who pursues Anna in difficult relationships. Garbo is actually easier to understand. <br /> <br /> The strength of the film is Greta Garbo. She demonstrates the painful insight into the victims of neglect and abuse, leading to prostitution. Garbo was at that time a huge star and was considered one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. Here her look is not glamorous, he was tortured. Her posture almost doubles in agony. She wrinkled her face to become a pathetic creature on the screen. Garbo transmits these passionate feelings to the viewer to convince us of his suffering. <br /> <br /> This is a dark theme, and Garbo brings it to life. This is not an easy meal, not fun, not for everyone. "Anna Christie" - these are strong emotions, extracted from the depths for inspection, this is one damn trip.
