I recorded it on Sundance and had no idea that it was a film about Miike. I thought it was just another kung fu movie. <br /> <br /> Then I saw things like a dancing saxophonist <br /> <br />, similar to the eastern Gato Barbieri, and I knew that it must be Miike. <br /> <br /> I missed the initial initial credits, and I had to wait until the end of the final credits to see Miike credits. <br /> <br /> Until he disappointed me. , Listening, City of Lost Souls, Iti Killer and Happiness the Catacuris - all these were good films, and now I learned that it was the third in the trilogy. <br /> <br /> In addition to Miike and Todd Solendz, now no one makes interesting films.
