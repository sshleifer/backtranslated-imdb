I saw it in Europe Plexus. A great movie!! <br /> <br /> This film is a study of Spirit and flesh in our time. The main character, Jim Kirk, leads the cumbersome RV. across America, often stopping to fill their gas absorption tank. He is middle aged and confused. He feeds his fat, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. He is Flesh: agitated and occasionally carried away, rather oblivious to the growing tension around him, but feeling him like bouts of discomfort. <br /> <br /> Spirit fills the film with speeches and other sounds, as well as with what appears and passes in sight. The spirit eventually collides with the flesh, and Kirk falls, unable to understand what happened to him. He denied how bad things had become because of his disobedience to all of us, because we are all focused on the needs and desires of our flesh. We are all in the same denial, and therefore we, like Kirk, risk falling and being carried away by the sands of the desert, just like him.
