This is a good film with good performances Paz Vega and Leonardo Sbaralya. Of course, Vicente Aranda is a legend of Spanish cinema and, of course, one of the great directors of Spanish cinema, but I don’t think this is one of his best films, even if it’s good. The script plays with introducing Merimeé as a character, it's a nice touch, but it's unbelievable. The music is written by José Nieto, the Spanish National Cinema Award. I mean, this film is very good in all technical aspects. There are very good actors in the lead roles, such as Antonio Degent, Maria Botto and others. I give it 7 out of 10, because I think it could be the best movie, but since it’s not boring at all.
