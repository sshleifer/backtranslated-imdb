In April 1947, New York faced an epidemic crisis. Eugene Labar, a carpet importer from Mexico, arrived in the city and brought the deadly smallpox virus with him. He tripped from the bus, complaining of fever and headache, and soon died at Midtown hospital, but not before he infected a dozen passersby. The damage has already been done; For the first time in many decades, smallpox stalked the streets of New York. City health authorities have taken quick measures to isolate patients and isolate the virus by adopting a free vaccination campaign in which more than six million New Yorkers were immunized against smallpox. Thanks to their quick response, the virus was contained with minimal casualties. The outbreak, however, should have left an indelible mark, for several years it was followed by two similar thematic thrillers about films-noirs, in which doctors had to track down one infectious carrier in the city of millions: “Panic of Elia Kazan on the streets” (1950) and “Low Budget Earl McAvoy” “Killer Chasing New York” (1950). <br /> <br /> MakEvoya's film unfolds in an untidy style of documentary drama. Reed Hadley's narrative sounds like he was pulled out of a newsreel, telling the facts, as if reading out the official police transcript. This technique sometimes seems a bit cheap, but, fortunately, the narrative is largely limited to the film’s flyleaf, and also provides some explanatory filler during breaks in the plot. The “killer” pursuing New York in this story is not the importer of carpets from Mexico, but the excellent diamond smuggler Sheila Bennet (Evelyn Case), who just arrived from Cuba. For several days, Sheila has two parties that independently pursue her: a treasury agent (Barry Kelly) who wants to arrest her for smuggling crimes, and a group of doctors (led by William Bishop) who identified her as the source of a smallpox outbreak. As in the “Panic on the Streets”, the rest of the routine hunt gets an increased sense of urgency, especially when the persecuted initially have no idea about the identity or appearance of the suspect. <br /> <br /> Killer That Stalked New York, “for the most part, manages to get around your low production budget. In addition to a few selected lines of dialogue (“we have to stop it!”, Exclaims Dr. Wood at some point, as if coming to a difficult decision), directors and film crew members allow the story to unfold in a realistic, exciting way. Indeed, in this respect, a low budget may well help the film’s intentions, which requires a documentary style that adds to the immediacy of the flash script. Evelyn Case perfectly plays a leading role, demonstrating stubborn stability in the face of unimaginable torment; by the end of the film, she seems so rudely disabled by her illness that it almost hurts to look at her face. In addition to the virus, Charles Corwin is the main villain of the play, as Sheila's greedy and adulterous husband, who, you can be sure, gets everything that comes to him. And if all the nurses looked like Dorothy Malone, then perhaps smallpox fishing would not look like such a bad break in the end.
