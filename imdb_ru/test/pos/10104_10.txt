I first saw this film two years ago in a cinema and fell in love with this dark story about two pensive teenage sisters who are at home in their big country house with their father and stepmother. Their relationship with their stepmother is at least strained, as the stepmother is becoming increasingly unstable in her battles with younger girls. The film, however, combines ghostly effects and horrors in oriental style, which add a strange and disturbing aspect of the story, which is not clear at the first viewing, but even more intriguing. <br /> <br /> The direction is incredibly good and the acting is stunning, and the stepmother, in particular, moves incredibly well from one style of mood to another in the film. The big house adds eeriness, and in the film there are enough points where you jump out of your seat. This film clearly shows to me why Korean cinema is perhaps the best and most original in the world at the moment. Unfortunately, nothing like this happens in the Western world, and I really see how this will affect filmmakers around the world in the next decade. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this viewing is highly recommended, real joy and fear ...
