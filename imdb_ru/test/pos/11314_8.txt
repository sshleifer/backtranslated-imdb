Before I saw this picture, I was pretty skeptical, I don’t like films with the agenda of the day, and I don’t like to be afraid to think like a writer. I was also afraid that it would look like a two-part mini-series “10.4”, which has a contrived concept, has little to do with the real world and a very poor performance. The beginning reads: “This film is fiction, but the events depicted and information on emergency planning in the UK are based on extensive research”; and the general feeling is that you are not sold for an idea, but that you are teaching a lesson in civic awareness. The message that is being transmitted is obvious from the very beginning: it is on, and we are not ready. The use of real places and a scenario that not only can happen - there are plans, when this happens - all this adds to the disturbing effect that the film will have on even the most cynical viewers. The point of view of the film is the point of view of society, and it keeps away from the heartbreaking personal moments that will not convey the message, so none of those Romeo-Juliet dramas to which we are used.
