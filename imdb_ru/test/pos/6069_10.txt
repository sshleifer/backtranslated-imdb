I chose the English Patient for an additional credit history. I thought this movie would be incredibly boring. Instead, he became one of my favorites. He quite accurately describes life in World War II, and the love story is amazing. A love story made the movie so incredible. I felt this interesting feeling of passion or something. It made me want to watch the movie again and again. Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes are awesome actors, and the way they played their characters is amazing. It looked great together and actually seemed to be in love. I recommend this film to anyone looking for a film for leisure or work.
