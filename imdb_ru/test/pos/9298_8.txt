Let's face it, Australian television is for the most part terrible, but it's a real diamond that not many people watch. The Chaser team, which makes a satirical newspaper and CNNN, is trying something new by mixing live comedy, pre-recorded scenes and political satire in one show, filmed in front of a live audience, like Rove, but funny. They love to cause controversy, and this causes some funny moments on the show, especially Chris tells his wife that she is “leaving” live on TV at breakfast, and Julian sends a check for novelty signed by Saddam Hosein, the head of the AWB. It must be one of the funniest Australian shows from the days of the Micallef program.
