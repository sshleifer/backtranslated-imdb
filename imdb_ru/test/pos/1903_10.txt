“Dolemit” is one of the best films in which the hero plays a pimp who shoots a man, while at the same time talking to all the best women that the ghetto should provide. Keep in mind that these women know karate and are beautiful sly ladies. <br /> <br /> SPOILER - the scene of the final fight is pretty crazy, with Dolemite pulling a heart out of Willie Green. Make sure your copy is without stars. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are many innovative and brilliant characters in the film, such as the Hamburger, pimp, Rev, mayor, queen bee and others. The clothes are gorgeous, and the sets are made in the style of the 70s. There are several misunderstandings in production, such as, for example, unexpectedly appearing boom microphones, but this adds charm and laughter. <br /> <br /> I would recommend to drink 6 packs before and during this film, and keep the squares and the person at a great distance.
