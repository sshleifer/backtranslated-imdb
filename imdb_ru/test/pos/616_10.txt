I'm just starting to explore the wonderful world of Monsieur Ozon. So far I have only seen 4 films, and the last one struck me that they were all really about single women and their actions. Not one lonely female character out of 12, and all of them have a strong environmental impact. <br /> <br /> This film is probably the only one (out of four) where this effect is forever. <br /> The gay theme is almost a standard part of the background for Ozone films, so it does not capture the accent (although the appearance of the characters might). Watch your feelings, not their objects. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant and fleeting, truly similar to a summer romance, and, being a relaxation of thought and mind, it provides food for the soul.
