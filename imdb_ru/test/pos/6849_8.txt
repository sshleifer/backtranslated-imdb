And it happened in France! Why not in the rest of the world, while the studios continue to release expensive trash after Grisham (Does anyone remember him as a good writer, and not the authorâ€™s most dedicated screenwriter on this side, Stephen King?) Has it all have minor holes in the plot and tend to be too smart for some (short) time for their own sake, but in fact they are useful and, obviously, are a matter of love. I would be interested to know what was the budget. AND. This time it's not a cheap copy of Tarantino! (Well, the film noir did not start with Tarantino, you know.) Will he be rescued by Europe again, like John Dahl films, so that Mr. Guttirez could make another one like that? If you ever read this, Mr. Guttirez, thanks and
