I first saw the film a couple of years ago, and was impressed, but its sensuality. This is one of the most touching films I've ever seen, although it may seem a bit pretentious and artificial - too beautiful if you want. In any case, one thing is certain: the cameraman did an excellent job - each painting deserves to be cut and shown as a separate world of art, comparable to the paintings of Chirico or Bernard Buffet. <br /> <br /> The music creates the perfect background for the story, especially the one that U2 plays between the first and second novels on the beach. As for the casting - I can not be objective, because I really like Sophie Marceau and Jean Reno, and I can not add more to the commendable comments of others. <br /> <br /> However, the fact that many people (critics and sophisticated in movies) criticized the film made me watch it more critically the second time. No doubt the setting is gorgeous, and the casting is gorgeous. But this is somehow not enough to create a comprehensive and cohesive film. The second novel (when Sophie Marceau tells her story to Malkovich is somehow superficial and talks little about the motives of the people involved - was it only about shooting a beautiful and sensual love scene with a naked Marceau or what?). Apparently, this adds nothing to the idea of ​​the film, and even Malkovich’s hoarse voice is unable to connect it with the main plot. <br /> <br /> Other stories are more justified and really beautifully filmed, which condones many of the logical errors within them. The scene when Jean Reno looks at the city through the huge window of his apartment on top of a tall building is absolutely incredible. The feeling of humid air and thin fog, which spreads in the first scene of Ferrera, is literally felt through the screen. Without a doubt, Antonioni is a great master of shades and midtones. My favorite novel is the last, the most romantic, deep and meaningful - I think that it is the most similar to Antonioni in the entire film - almost a parable. Probably the overall positive impression of the film is mainly due to the last one shot somewhere in a small Gothic Italian town with its winding narrow streets and curved sidewalks, fountains with drinking water and monumental cathedrals ... It was succinct but very touching. <br /> <br /> I hope that My impressions and comments about the film, no matter how chaotic they are, motivate someone to spend the evening watching it (it works better with a home theater when someone is with you cares than in the cinema). Enjoy. <br /> <br /> I apologize for imperfect English and any possible typos
