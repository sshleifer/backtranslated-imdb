While “Jackal” [remake of the excellent “Jackal Day”] has better aesthetics [and boat loading budget], this movie nails the real person of “Carlos” ... <br /> <br /> Quinn Excellent when Naval officer enlisted support to impersonate the cunning Jackal to get him out of hiding, and, at the hands of Kingsley and Sutherland, turned around to do it. Risking his family, his career and all that he believes in, he takes on the task, albeit reluctantly. <br /> <br /> To say that would spoil it more ... it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 Niro ~ Stars [of 4]
