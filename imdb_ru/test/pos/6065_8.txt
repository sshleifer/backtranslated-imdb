First of all, I am American - I have not seen a single IMDb comment about this series from the American audience. Secondly, I work in the television business in development. Thus, I fall into a large part of the sediment that comes out of American broadcast programs. The “first block” is an example of television, which is a return to what I would call 70s-style scenarios in terms of capabilities. Namely, those films made by young authors who had complete freedom of action, so that the dramas feel more realistic and allow them to organically develop their character. This is more reminiscent of star British dramas such as Cracker and Prime Suspect, as well as the brilliant Australian Underbelly. The “first block” contains individual cases that are transmitted and then resolved every week. Secrets are not unusual or especially Byzantine. They usually focus around one single turn, usually at 40 minutes, and the resolution turns neatly 15 minutes after that. What makes this series a breath of fresh air is that it contains the main characters that you hooked and which can be associated with episode 2. These are real, breathing, lively characters who have personal baggage, but this is not talkative, inconspicuous American fleet luggage, such as Gray's Anatomy or Desperate Housewives, give out a spoon. These are realistic people whose prehistory unfolds slowly throughout the series, as if you were working with them daily. After a meaningless decade, "CSI's," "NCIS's," and "Criminal Minds," along with their subsequent creations, are pleased to refresh themselves by actually sitting down to look at friends with whom you want to spend time, as is the case with Unit One. “The rapid banter, the unemotional wooden dialogue and the excessive danger that the American series I mentioned hit us every week is absurd compared to the nuances and quiet resonance that you get with this wonderful Danish series. I am on the seventh episode first season, but I already bought all four seasons and am in a long time. If you need explosions and stuffed testosterone along with The Who music and a fast, neon, trembling action camera with cipher-like protagonists d diet for watching a TV drama, I suggest you stay away from this series. If you are an adult, eager thin, sharp, thoughtful and, yes, sometimes simple procedural crime dramas, I urge you to check out this show.
