I must have seen it on TV when it was first shown a few decades ago. Then I thought it was brilliant, and, as I recall, now I could have been right. Although I live in London and its environs, I cannot call myself a Londoner and do not know him at all - who, other than taxi drivers? As soon as the viewer understands the premise; that there is a group of people trying to learn the seemingly illiterate and rise to the status of demigods, then the rest is just fun. The characters contrast well, their family relationships are equally diverse and so differently dependent on the events of the film. Do not think that this documentary is pure drama, and “Knowledge” is one of the characters. I have never seen anything like this film before or after. Watch it!
