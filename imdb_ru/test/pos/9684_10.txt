I love everything about the family guy. <br /> <br /> My favorite characters in the family are Brian and Stewie, and I like the episodes in which they are mainly represented, for example, “Road to Rhode Island” (season 2) when they interact. fine. The comments they make just make me stitched. Peter's behavior is also very funny, as some of his actions are "just great, they are backward." The voice acting is excellent, especially Seth MacFarlane, because he provides the voices of half of the Griffin family, as well as their perverted neighbor Glenn Kougumir, and how he controls this band (especially with singing), I just don’t know. He deserves his two Amys for giving the voice of the evil genius Stewie baby. Adam West also steals the show with his funny and completely insane permanent character mayor of Quahoga. What I like about Chris (about which Seth Green speaks) is what he says about his father when it comes to reason and common sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing that annoys me is that UK Fox decided to change the seasons in order to increase sales of DVDs, which in no way reflects the program itself, but rather marketing. <br /> <br /> If you like Family Guy, I would strongly recommend another Seth MacFarlane project - American Dad, who uses a different style of humor, but is still extremely funny.
