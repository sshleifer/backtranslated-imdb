This is very funny (except when Bruce is on the hospital scene, which is a bit sad). <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi and Stacy Keach are excellent and deserve attention. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not a big blockbuster controlled by a budget suit, but that's all it promises to be, and even more - and by the way, women are great in their roles, although I donâ€™t know them from other films, I would love to watch them again. <br /> <br /> The scene with two heads is inspired and, of course, is a showcase. for Bruce's outstanding physical comedy - he is one delicious guy! <br /> <br /> Thank you, Bruce, for the brain, this is your child!
