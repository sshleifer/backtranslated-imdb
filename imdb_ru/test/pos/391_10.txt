Great .... this one word pretty much sums up the whole movie. Everything from cinematography, directing, acting ... brilliantly. At any point in the movie, you can pause it, and you will undoubtedly look at something mosaic or "artsy farce," as some people would say. I assure you that after one viewing “Bobbycrush” will get stuck in your head. I know it from my own experience. Even the soundtrack is great. It fits very well with the tone and tempo of the film. Be thankful that Cam Archer exists in this world. We need more people like him to make films showing love and shame in absolutely real (and surrealistic) images.
