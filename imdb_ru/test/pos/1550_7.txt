I liked this film Colombo, its atmosphere, like a real thriller, and his approach even occasionally reminded me of a film noir, in the film the first 30 minutes or so. It is really beautiful and made in the good old style, with the correct angles of the camera and the use of light. This does not mean instantly that this film is brilliant, but it is solid enough to be considered a good record at the end of Colombo. This is definitely a better film than the usual “later” recording in the film “Colombo”. <br /> <br /> 26 years after the release of his previous film “Colombo”, George Hamilton returns to play the main role opposite Peter Falk, again as an assassin. In general, a different and new role, of course. I liked him in his role, and he was a good “villain” of Colombo, who gave the good old lieutenant good competition. They had some good sequences together. The problem with "modern" new films of Colombo has always been that it was not a well-known actor with Peter Falk. This film clearly does not suffer from this problem. But I have to say that in this film Peter Falk is not so good. He definitely played a better character, and his role is not consistent enough in this film, which is probably also related to his director Daryl Duke, who also directed the truly awful film “Thai Pan” among many other projects. . <br /> <br /> He has a pretty good and pleasant story, but the fact that the same plot to hide the murder was used earlier in the earlier film Colombo also certainly does not help. He used to be in the 1975 Colombo: Playback movie. Nevertheless, he, of course, also has enough “original” moments with a story, although, of course, in essence, every Colombo film is more or less the same. Well, okay, this is what made the Colombo series so wonderful and consistent. If it is not broken, do not fix it. <br /> <br /> It is also true that in this film there are more clues left for the lieutenant than usual, which does not mean that the film, its killer, is more stupid or sloppy, but I see more of this in writers who are overly enthusiastic than others. This does not make a film or story bad, and in fact, perhaps even makes it more enjoyable, to see how Colombo works hard, and to discover all sorts of small but important clues. Fortunately, the film is also filled with some pleasant, spectacular, reliever Colombo comedy. <br /> <br /> Just a good late recording of the movie Colombo. <br /> <br /> 7/10
