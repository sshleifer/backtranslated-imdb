The authors of the misguided have surpassed themselves. The second season finale is even more heartbreaking and tense than the first season finale. Lockeâ€™s distrust led not only to spiritual consequences for himself, but also to tragic physical consequences for the lives of others. Michael's betrayal led to success for him, but can he avoid the island? He will have to if he wants to stay alive. I have no doubt that one or several of his former friends will want to kill him for revenge. This final left more questions than the previous one; and I can't wait to fall. <br /> <br /> An additional note: what is the point of publishing a review just to write out all the spoilers? Where is the pleasure to spoil a surprise for everyone else? The current review on this page is nothing more than a big fat spoiler festival badly composed in barely read English with the obvious goal of driving someone crazy. Good job.
