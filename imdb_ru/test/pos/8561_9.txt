I agree that this film has achieved its goals perfectly. I saw it on Showtime late at night when I was a teenager, and again in college. I thought it was funny. And boobs are everywhere! It seems that in the late 70s and 80s there were a lot of films of this type, from films with an R rating, such as Porkys, to soft Au Pair Girls; It is a pity that they seem to have fallen on the sidelines in terms of popularity. A distinctive feature of HOTS is that, as in the two previous films, it is damn fun. HOTS is similar to the House of Animals version for girls, where girls form a kind of communication and participate in campus bedlam. On the other hand, the one who invented the clothes for girls "Hooters", certainly saw this film.
