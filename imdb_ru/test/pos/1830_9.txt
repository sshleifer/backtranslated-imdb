This film is sweet - not cloying, just heartfelt and kind. It seemed a little ridiculous to me, and the package * is incredibly incredible, but the characters are so charming (especially Minnie Driver) that they were completely focused on me from the very beginning, and soon they also fell in love. <br /> <brn> Bonnie Hunt did an excellent job in her directorial debut and also wrote well. I highly recommend this film and will see it again, I am sure.
