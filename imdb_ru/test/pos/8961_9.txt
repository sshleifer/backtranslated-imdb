I'm not quite sure about the accuracy of this film, but I can say that this film completely entertained me. the character of the rush, beautifully played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, was one of the most unique, but at the same time, entertaining characters in recent times. this film is informed, but still managed to avoid preaching to the audience. it made me laugh, grieved me, made me feel alive, and I'm glad I wasted time watching the movie. it does not take long to understand what is going on and will send you on a roller coaster journey with real human emotions. I thought I knew my story, apparently I did not know it at all! I give this move 9 out of 10, and recommend it to all adults, young people and young at heart, but not young ones. but as soon as they are allowed to watch movies with an "r" rating, make it a priority.
