CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Geellenhall) gets the opportunity to see his first secret interrogation when Anwar (Metvally) is accused of contact with a well-known terrorist bomb manufacturer. Anwar's wife (Witherspoon) goes crazy about the location of her husband. <br /> <br /> Do you just hate it when the movie title sends you to the dictionary? I must have an old edition, because this performance is not a piece of music. No, this is the way the government legally takes a resident or citizen somewhere to interrogate him and, perhaps, uses torture to obtain the desired information. <br /> <br /> While watching this film, I remembered a similar storyline on the TV show “Jordan Crossroads” (now on the air), and I expect that we will see even more of these storylines. It's unavoidable. The events of 911 are catalysts. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to look at because we don’t like it when people are tortured, and our government doesn’t tell the truth about things. We like the idea that no matter what happens or happens, we can go somewhere to find answers, but when this door is closed for us, we are really lost and hopeless, like Anwar's wife. <br /> <br /> All the performances were first-class, and maybe we will see more of Igay Naor (I don’t know how to pronounce it) because he looks like and can act like Telly Savalas No kidding. <br /> <br /> Violence: yes, sex: no, nudity: no, language: yes
