I first saw Sacrifice (it’s out of competition) more than 25 years ago, when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since childhood, I loved to watch everything that starred in the lead role of Elizabeth Montgomery. This film was (and still is) a real holiday - whether you are a fan of the work of Miss Montgomery or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal of rape in the event of rape and the suspected killer in The Legend of Lizzie Borden. Her performance in the movie “Victim as Kate” - a frightened woman trapped in an isolated house during a storm, with a killer after her - is gorgeous. If you like exciting thrillers, this is one movie that will keep you on the edge of your place to the end. It is worth mentioning another great performance of Eileen Heckhart, who plays a creepy and suspicious housekeeper. Unfortunately, like most of the films of Miss Montgomery, “The Sacrifice” is not available on DVD, and I believe that although it was released on VHS a few years ago, these days it is rare. I was lucky that I shot it when it was shown on television about ten years ago, and therefore I have a good copy of this very good film. Must see!
