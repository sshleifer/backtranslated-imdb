Well, I have to say, "the only film associated with club / DJ / electronic music and rave ... that respects ravers." <br /> <br /> Seriously now. This is a superbly fun, fast and fairly accurate image of the night of the raver. Although, it is in the club, its in Wales and somewhat outdated. The film does not take into account some sketches of the elements of club life, but does not move away from them at all. It presents an idyllic, but serious depiction of the ups and downs of the characters' lives. <br /> <br /> At the core of the film, and the best element of the script of Justin Kerrigan, are eccentric, unique, but at the same time completely unique characters. understandable and accessible. This simple film would not work and would be infinitely less interesting if it were not for Jeep, Coop, Nina, Moff and Lulu. Viewers may deny the political and social implications of the “Human Trafficking” subtext as a drug film, “The Deceiver”, an important landmark in British youth culture around the 90s, BUT ... they cannot deny that they are attractive characters. > <br /> This is insane, brutally honest, sobering, this is too much, but this is a great comedy. <br /> <br /> Raves are a difficult thing, as are the drugs taken at these events and the people you come across. But from someone who went to parties, became exhausted and still leaves ... Human trafficking is the best picture that can be made from a subculture. Whatever you do, avoid Groove, as this is the antithesis of all good in human trafficking.
