Someone viewed this film as a “waste of time” because he was expecting “beautiful landscapes of Brazil and Portugal”, but then everything looked “blurry” or gloomy, or something like that. I believe that this person missed the whole part of the film. This is reality. The essence of this film is to show that life is not really perfect, and to show what people experience in their lives for the sake of family, love and survival. A young man leaves the slums in Sao Paulo, Brazil, to go to Portugal to visit his mother's homeland after her death. He discovers that not everyone is free, and that people from Portugal look down on Brazilians. In the end, he finds life, love, but the story does not end as expected, and this is not a "fairy tale" story. Most of all I liked the final song Galica Costa "Zeca Bailero (Honey Baby)". It fits so well with the film; especially the final.
