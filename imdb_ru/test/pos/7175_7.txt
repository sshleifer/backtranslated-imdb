How important is the director? In this film, filmed in the politically turbulent times of the late 60s, when social organization issues were major conflicts, he asks this question, making a film that distracts the camera from the action and only asks to be shown by director William Greaves. This is an important work, as it shows how no other film shows the difficulties in blocking, organizing and setting up the scene; he reveals the role of the team, something that most directors would like to completely disappear, and that invisibility is necessary to suspend disbelief; it also takes into account the role of performance and scenarios, as well as how they correspond / do not correspond to reality, and what this has to say about how the director ultimately influences reality (if at all). <br /> <br /> A documentary, pseudo-documentary or fictional story (depending on what you prefer, through your interpretations of topics) has its brain in an over-educated, super-intellectual team, its courage in lost performers struggling to indefinite and ambiguous instructions and his heart in the director, who acts as a desire to portray, present, express, without having the slightest idea how to make one of these things or why he wants to do this. This is a film that purposefully repeats platitudes in order to see if they can become something more than a commonplace. This film, which sometimes shows several shots at the same time, is simply to ensure that editing remains for the audience, and also shows how alarmingly different shots change the perspective. <br /> <br /> This is an important job, and this is something that everyone is interested in the industry. and the process of filming a movie must be watched and understood. He, like many experimental films, has no real appeal for a mass audience - it is not for them. This is for the industry, and for the 60s - the question of what to do with the environment for group efforts, which still depends on one “voice” and “author”. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
