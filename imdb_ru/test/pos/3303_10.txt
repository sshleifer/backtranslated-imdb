Best of all. What is best? This is different for everyone, but for most of us it is love. But, alas, not everyone knows where and who to turn for real love. This story is the whole search for love gambit. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as they say, “we are the captains of our own ships,” and also in our lives. We are responsible for the choices we make in our lives. As soon as we make this choice, we must live with them. When we look at this story and see how these women make choices that are likely to change their lives forever, we ask ourselves: will we make the same choice as these women or will we be wiser? Who knows?
