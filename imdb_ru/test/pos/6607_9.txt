Take an item that I know little about and make it exciting, why not? It happened so that in about 1979 director Robert Altman said that he did not believe that he had ever made a real film and that he expects one of these skateboarding children - if he doesnâ€™t break his neck - the first film. Well, I wouldn't expect it from Stacy Peralta, but he is a skateboarder who made a good movie. Of course, he was forced by the nature of the film, which he made, to use the existing frames, and, of course, it is good that there were so many archival materials. Peralta edited it well, along with the unusual conversations of his former colleagues, as they are today. The whole effect is postmodern in the best sense, but it was done. Altman's prediction did not quite come true. However, what Peralta did was to capture enough energy from those dizzying days, so that we could appreciate how it was when Z-Boys invented modern skateboarding. This is all good. I highly recommend Dogtown.
