Nigel Balchin's labyrinth-like novel “The Path through the Forest” was adapted by Julian Fellowes, who also directs this “terribly British” part of the living room's waiting. This is a film based on the cast of various benign / malign characters, and this is where Fellowes’s directing choice is excellent. The story has a linear line that is easy to follow, but the beauty of the film is the metamorphosis of each player, as one incident ignites the minefield of disasters. <br /> <br /> James Manning (Tom Wilkinson) is a successful lawyer obsessed with business in London, married to Anna (Emily Watson) who needs more in life: the couple, being childless, live in the country in a beautiful estate, which helps their old "cleaner" Maggie (Linda Bassett). They attend social events and meet, among other things, with William Boole (Rupert Everett), a passively lazy rich neighbor. Ann decides that they must entertain their neighbors against James’s rude protest. Ann begins planning: James is satisfied with “not visiting because of business”. On the night of the party, an accident occurs in which Maggie's husband is accidentally killed by someone in the Range Rover (she noticed). When James returns home, he sees a scratch on William's Range Rover and suspects William is the culprit. Anne dissuades James from going to the police with information: "What can be good about this, except to destroy the life of Bill as a secular man, father and son of an important heir?" The virus spreads from this first "lie": James confronts Bill, who discourages James from going to the police, Ann admits that she was the one who drove Bill and is the only one responsible, James convinces Ann to keep it secret, because it will destroy his Ann’s reputation recognizes that she has an affair with Bill, and all three agree that they will hold on to their big lies for the greater good. In the end, Ann concedes guilt for not telling her beloved Maggie that she is guilty, and Maggie, herself guilty of the previous theft, whose life was saved by Anna’s mercy to hire her anyway, is an agent who brings the story to her amazing completion. A lie gives birth to a lie, which gives rise to a lie and so on. <br /> <br /> The main influence of this intrigue is the way in which an isolated tragedy affects each of the characters. Everyone changes in a dramatic way. Tom Wilkinson shows the best results in his career, filled with brilliant performances: he can say more with the help of his posture and facial expressions than about any actor who spoke to the public today. In the same way, the gifted Emily Watson adds another excellent role to her repertoire, as the surprisingly clever Rupert Everett does, who, despite being another rich British "gentleman", gives us a person in whom both spirit and ultimately needy. And always beautiful Linda Bassett takes on a small role and pretends that her character quietly occupies a central place in the chaotic web of lies. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of Tony Pierce-Roberts and the musical accompaniment of Stanislav Syurevich immeasurably add in several atmospheres the story comes across. This is an ensemble game in all its glory, which always means that the director (Julian Fellowes) is well versed in the play. The interaction of these wonderful people makes the tricky story work very well. Grady harp
