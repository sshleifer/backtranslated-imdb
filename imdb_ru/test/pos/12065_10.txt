A fun show with so many wonderful stories that it reflects the world today, as we know it, in such a funny way that it literally stole my laugh for other shows. I laughed so hard that I just found other comedy shows unfunny. The unique recognition of each character is a great original technique that makes the series fun and very humorous. You may think that this is an ordinary comedy show about hard life with your family. At first I thought so, but I discovered that it contains new and unique techniques that completely distinguish it from any other ordinary comedy show. Michael Rapaport is a star. I really want this show not to be canceled.
