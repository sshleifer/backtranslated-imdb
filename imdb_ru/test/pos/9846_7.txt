The great James Cagney, whose top list is in large letters, does not appear until the second third of the film and probably has less screen time than Dudley Diggs, who plays the role of a school reformer. But when Jimmy arrives as a deputy commissioner for the reform of reform schools, he cuts the air with his hands, jumps on the feet and spits out a sharp dialogue, "Warners First National" with all the usual, and expected, fake. Psychology in this crisp antiques, one of Warners’s many attempts to assert his place as a “socially conscious” studio, does not go far: Diggs is bad only because the script requires it, and there is a strange notion that juvenile Offenders will turn into falling children if they will be given a little autonomy. But this is done in that simple, fast style that the studio specialized in, and it will never get bored. Frankie Darro, who got into all kinds of trouble on the screen during a brief stint as Rothen Street Kid's beloved Watners, is the perfect DJ - a beautiful, charismatic, hard nut with a pug nose and a piercing hatred that can dry out. No child actor today can touch him.
