I just watched this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival, and I must say that it seemed to me that it was amazing. The combination of humor and sincerity really made the film worth seeing. The film was about a seventeen-year-old boy whose mother and father are very religious. Seventeen Ben decides to work on the retirement of an actress who teaches his girls, driving and life. It is very funny and touching. I have to honestly say that now this is one of my favorite films. I recommend this film to everyone. If you have not caught one of the performances at the film festival, it should appear in cinemas later this year. Please watch it! This is a great movie.
