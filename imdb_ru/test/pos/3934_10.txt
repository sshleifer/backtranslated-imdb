I'm not sure why this average film is so low on IMDb, when it's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror movie. This is the definition of being a horror movie. I consider myself a big fan of horror and have to say that this house delivers the goods. “House of Wax” is the story of a group of college kids heading to a football match who decide to set up camp for the night and chat with the local crank. Waking up the next morning, they make a terrible discovery and decide to go to the city for a broken car. The city is creepy and I will just stay there. Because then really terrible chaos begins. believe me, when I say that if you are looking for a horror movie, go watch it, then you will like it. It is amazingly devilish and inventive with its murder scenes, the story is interesting, and the characters are decently drawn with actors giving them personality traits. Paris Hilton included those who do a good job with their role. the film is a bit superficial, but it's so much fun and who cares. This film should eat the box office, and all horror fans should take part in it. Watch the film “House of Wax Figures”, which describes cleansed skin, super glued lips, dead animal carcasses, hot wax sprayed on a still-living person, finger trimming, beheading, a pole over his head and much more. I was lucky to see this film at the Tribeca premiere, and all the actors were ready to promote the film. And boy, they have something to be proud of, the House of Wax - the most terrible ride on roller cars of the year! 9/10
