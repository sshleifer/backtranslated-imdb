This is one of the greatest tributes to Julie's music, along with her album "Trapped in the Body of White Girl". I will quote the great Medusa: “Do not be afraid to be naked, just put on your underwear, and they will take you home every time.” This is good advice. "You can dance at my party!" Yes, justify your dance shoes! ..... You are invited to a party in my pants. Come on, man, let's dance, at the party in my pants. ”Julie Brown is fun !!! It's almost sad that this video lasts only 51 minutes, but every minute is awesome !!!
