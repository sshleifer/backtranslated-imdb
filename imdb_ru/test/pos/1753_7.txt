Hoppity is a charming, albeit slightly fictitious, animated film that, given that it was shot in 1941, it stood the test of time incredibly well. Now I have to admit that I have a weakness for “HoppityGoes To Town” (as it is called in the United Kingdom) when I watched the VHS version, which our parents recorded on TV many times on tape. this morning just in time to catch him on channel four (at 06:15, nonetheless!) so. Perhaps one day I will share this forgotten classic with my own children. With a good run for children (88 minutes) and a simple but exciting storyline, this little guy story really does have something for everyone. I really could see that it was successfully redone in CGI. Pay attention to Pixar.
