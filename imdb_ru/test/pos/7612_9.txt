I really love this movie. It always makes me cry. If you rate Drew Barrymore half as much as I do, you will love this movie. It has everything I need in the film. He has good actors, good characters, good mood ... and many pleasant moments. Remembered moments when we see Josie in high school make me cry. Everytime. I am sure that you will like this one, do not judge based on the fact that it looks like a movie for teens, although it is, in a sense, a movie for teens Of course, if you are a guy, and all you see is hardcore films with special effects in only the 250 best films of all time, then this is not for you. But if you like romantic comedies, you will not forget them after watching, pick them up at the video store and enjoy: Drew Barrymore is great in this!
