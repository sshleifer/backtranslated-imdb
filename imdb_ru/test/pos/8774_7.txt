In general, this is an interesting and strange film. Do not try to understand it. There are more holes in this story than a computer can keep up with, but Robert Cummings and the actors in the minor characters in this story, similar to The Runaway, are mostly interesting to see. <br /> <br /> Unlike a popular television show, and then a 1993 film, this fugitive is not looking for a one-handed, but a two-handed Nazi saboteur named “Frank Fry”. Cummings ("Barry Kane") is accused when a defensive installation explodes in Los Angeles and flees in search of the person who did this (Fry) to clear his name. <br /> <br /> The first 40 minutes or so is very tense and interesting. Then Priscilla Lane (“Pat Martin”) enters the story, and she begins to stumble a bit with some kind of silly dialogue. Director Alfred Hitchcock often did this with his female characters, and I wonder if he understands how a woman talks. Lane's character here was a little lame. <br /> <br /> In fact, the villains played by Otto Kruger (Charles Tobin) and Norman Lloyd (Frank Fry) were the best, in my opinion ... ... just fascinating. Kruger's action and dialogue were especially good. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen this movie, but have seen the well-known Hitchcock North beyond Northwest, you will laugh at the finale and really enjoy it. Instead of a catastrophic scene on Mount Rushmore, here we have a memorable last 10 minutes in the state of Liberty. As usual, Hitchcock's viewing angles are excellent and interesting to watch.
