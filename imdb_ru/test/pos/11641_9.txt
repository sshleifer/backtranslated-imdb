One of the clearest statements against the death penalty ever filmed is a fairly direct attack on the most disgusting way to do justice. The latter sequence, with the parallel between the crimes that convict Poncelet committed and his own execution, is simply magnificent. <br /> <br /> No, what about the work of Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon? It makes you gasp for breath, they are two giants, and their performances reach the highest emotions. <br /> <br /> Tim Robbins clearly states that he is not only a good actor, but also a good director. <Br /> <br /> * My rating: 9/10
