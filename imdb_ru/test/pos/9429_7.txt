In the universal series of modern stories about Sherlock Holmes with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, “Sherlock HOLMES AND SECRET WEAPON” is not among the best films, although it is interesting. I think the problem is that most of the film’s “duel” between Holmes and his sworn enemy Moriarty (played by Lionel Atville here) seems to delay the actual point of view of the professor. <br /> <br /> Moriarty appears in three of the Holmes films with Rathbone. In "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes," he was played by George Zucco, who was very fond of meanness for his role. For my money, Zukko’s performance as a professor was the best of the three (he even performed a short comedy when he disguised himself as a “police sergeant” - as if he was preparing to sing the “Police Lot”). "from Gilbert and Sullivan). Next comes Mr. Atville's performance here - more on this. Finally, there is an intellectual, Moriarty Henry Daniel, in the movie" Sherlock Holmes and the Lady in Green. "This is Mr. Daniel's typically cool, cool performance, but his encounters with Holmes they seem to him a tiresome bore. They prevent him from fulfilling the basic plan. In the stories in which the Professor emerges, he really feels that Holmes is a sworn enemy who will remain dangerous while he is alive. However, because of an intellectual tennis matchBetween him and Rathbone, Rathbone (in his autobiography) really felt that Danielle was the best from the film Moriartis. <br /> <br /> If Zucco captured the love of evil in the Professor, and Daniel seemed to demonstrate the tired Oxford Don (in the stories the professor - a respected mathematician, whose volume on the binomial theorem had “European fashion”, and who wrote the intriguing book “ASTEROID'S DYNAMICS”), Atville demonstrates the Professor as a pragmatic businessman. First of all, he sold his services to (apparently) Nazi Germany. This is never considered, but it can be assumed (as it was before the Nazis began to really crumble), he believes that they will win the war. Secondly, he is not a fool. When Dr. Tobel (William Post-Jr.) showed that he was close to a physical breakdown due to the torture of Moriarty’s gang, the professor decided to kidnap one of the other scientists who help Tobel because he is as good a scientist as Tobel and will be able to collect the blast. For some reason I cannot see how Zucco makes such a sensible decision on the spot, and if Daniel had to accept him, he seemed to be annoyed that he had another delay in his plans. <br /> <br /> By the way In all Holmes TV series concerning the professor, one trick is used - how to get rid of him. If you read the stories of Holmes, Moriarty appears as a villain three times: in the last story “Memories of Sherlock Holmes” (“THE ADVENTURE OF THE FINAL TASK”), in the first story “The Return of Sherlock Holmes” (“THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE”) and the last of four novels Novels (VALLEY OF FEAR). It's amazing how many Professor ran for such a small number of speeches (he is mentioned in two or three other stories - in passing). But because of his fate at the waterfalls of Reichenbach in the "FINAL PROBLEM" and "EMPTY HOUSE" we always see him fall to his death. Zucco falls from the White Tower on Tower Hill. Daniel (with great imagination) tries to run away from Gregson and the police, but he is shot dead when he jumps and the wounded man cannot hold onto the wall of a nearby building. Atville (they did not see him here, but they heard him) seem to fall into the hatch, which he planted in the evacuation tunnel). After a while it is very tiring to see how the professor always gets into these films. Turning to Gene Wilder's comedy (admittedly, comedy) “Smarter than Brother” Sherlock Holmes, where Leo McKern is a surprisingly stupid and villainous Moriarty (full, finally, with an Irish accent) who is not killed at the end, but simply left thinking - in boat - over how his careful schemes did not work. I liked it more. <br /> <br /> The use of the “Dancing People” code, such as using the “Devil's Root” in “Dressed in Murder”, extracts some of the riddle from the story. “ADVENTURE OF DANCERS” appeared in “The Return of Sherlock Holmes” and tells about Holmes's client, whose wife received strange, heartbreaking messages in this code. Charles Higham, in his biography of The Adventures of Conan Doyle, suggests that Sir Arthur may have taken the code from the magazine game of the 1870s, but we really don’t know. The code is basically one of the letter replacements for the figures of dancing men. The story in a short story is dramatic, but deals with a triangle. The only innovation in the film is that Tobel makes small changes that confuse Holmes and Moriarty. <br /> <br /> The film will be entertaining, but I still think that THE HOUSE OF FEAR, SCARLET CLAW and SHERLOCK HOLMES FACE DEATH are the best films.
