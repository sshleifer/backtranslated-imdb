I like it! I love Poly Shore. It seems some people disagree. This is humor, and it is not like everyone else. The film is great. I love the storyline and most of the people in the film. Funny the first time she meets him at school. I like the fact that she chooses him because of the guy at home. I like that Tiffany Theisan is not a bad girl after all. All secrets are revealed. Only the people you want to see remain at the end. (Except for those of you who don't love Paulie Shore.) Even if you don't like him, there are funny moments, and her family is tormenting him most of the film. She is a country girl who has gone mad and must be heard. She finally does it. In it, just the right amount of love and romance. I give him 8 out of 10.
