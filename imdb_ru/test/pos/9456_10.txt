When I saw the first preview of this, I almost fainted from excitement. For a long time I was a fan of the “Twelfth Night” - Shakespeare started me, so having a modern adaptation is a dream. My expectation was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The plot basically corresponds to the original storyline, which means: difficult! I don't even want to try to relate it, the summer story will probably cover the basics. Just imagine that the girl is pretending to be a boy in a boarding school, and think about all the possible situations that you could create. I will not even stop to doubt the plausibility of such a conspiracy; reality is not the essence of the film. <br /> <br /> What it is is absolutely ridiculous. Almost every scene nails a comedy. Kudos to writers, directors and actors on this account. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is the star of this film and she wears her beautifully. She is super-sweet, not a fox and knows how to make an impeccable comedy. I admire her so much for the fact that she did not become a complete tramp in her films or public life, as many stars do today. I am glad that at least one decent young actress has remained in Hollywood. Well, I’ve got off the soap ... <br /> <br /> Channing Tatum, yes, he is hot and complex like a gorilla, but he really makes me laugh! My favorite scenes throughout the film are when he tries to talk to Olivia first, talking about cheese, and then about his training regime. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast also did not fail, with amazing additions to the characters in the forms of a mad debutant mother and Monica, the classic wicked girlfriend. <br /> <br /> In general, a lot of fun, a lot of laughter and a very attractive cast. Maybe not at the same level as the original, but it is superior to the modern versions of other pieces, including 10 popular things that I hate about you.
