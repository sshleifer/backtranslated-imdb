My resume on one line hints that this is not a good movie, but it is not. I really liked the movie, but I probably expected too much. <br /> <br /> Adele, whom Susan Sarandon unmistakably portrays, did not look like a very cute character. She is frivolous and irresponsible to some unforgivable degree, if not for the great love she had for her daughter. This is the only thing she can do without fail. Adel's daughter, Anna, is a sad girl who is so busy to fill her mother's shortcomings that she seems to be not only 14-17 years old. This, of course, makes Natalie Portman the perfect choice to play with Anna, since she also seems to have never been 14-17 years old. Portman shoots this role so easily that you almost forget that she hasn't been in films for 20 years. Nevertheless, even with two serious leaders, Wayne Wang never seems to attract an audience, as he did with Luck of Joy and even more so with Smoke. Although I did not read the book, the film seems to have made the necessary changes to the story to bring it to the big screen, changes that can drain the emotional urgency of the story. I liked the film when I watched two great actresses doing their job, but I never lost in this experience and never had a bearing on their plight.
