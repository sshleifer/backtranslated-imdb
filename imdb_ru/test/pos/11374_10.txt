"Boogie Nights" follows a theme that is very familiar to gangster films (although it does not fit into this genre) - rise and fall. We see the rise of several people, some of whom are out of complete obscurity, reach great heights ... and then fall from grace because of their excesses. <br /> <br /> I think this is the first feature of the author / director Paul Thomas Anderson, and this is a great start! I have seen elements of the influence of other directors, such as Robert Altman, but the film has its own peculiarities in the originality and development of the plot. <br /> <br /> Character development is the best feature of the film. I really identified with all the characters and felt their pain and success with them. All performances were brilliant. (It was especially nice to see a small part performed by a veteran porn in real life, Nina Hartley). <br /> <br /> Basically, this film combines comedy and tragedy with the result of being one of the best films of 1997 that was offended at the Oscars (probably because of "racy" - as they would say - of and general conservatism of the Academy.
