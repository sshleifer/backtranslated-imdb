Schenbarth takes place in the 1940s, immediately after the Second World War. The protagonist Gunnar (Gustav Hammarsten) quits his job to get a chance to "make a difference" in the bombed post-war Europe. He packs the book of his favorite philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein and embarks on a journey that ultimately proves Wittgenstein’s famous statement: "Nothing is what it seems." <br /> <br /> There are two main plots and several plots on this film, which takes place on a train heading to Berlin. Writer / director Peter Dalle (also playing the role of train conductor) brought together an impressive cast, including Swedish legends Lena Naiman, Gosta Ekman and Robert Gustafsson. Overall, the acting is great. <br /> <br /> Schenbarth offers a slightly perverted comedy of farce in combination with a more subtle black humor (for example, a nun who loses faith and begins to swear violently). This is how Killinggänget meets Peter Jackson (Braindead, Bad Taste) on Schindler's list. I laughed for most of the movie, and when I woke up the next morning, I laughed even more. Intellectual film for fans of Swedish comedy.
