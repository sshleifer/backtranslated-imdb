or any stories reminiscent of the Leopold and Loeb case, you may find this film interesting. The cast includes Robert Kalpa, in which Stephen Caffrey and Harrison Hershberger act as college students. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk, as usual, himself, pretends that he was deceived by premature students. Caffrey ("Longtime Companion", "The Buried Alive") is excellent, and must fulfill more of these threatening roles. In fact, the two friends of the fraternity are tired of their demanding parents, who expect nothing less than academic excellence, visiting the best schools will be funded only if they match. There is a great scene in which Culp rakes Caffrey for coal after he gets a low grade, threatens to cut off his trust funds, and later Caffrey tells his friend: "I hate him, I want him to die" ... <br /> <br /> In Beverly Hills, things are not so good. This is always a great topic. I believe that this film was released in 1990 immediately after the murder of Menendez. If you look at Menedez, Beverly Hills Murder, and then compare it with this film, you can find interesting parallels.
