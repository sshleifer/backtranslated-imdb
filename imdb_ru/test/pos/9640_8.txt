An exciting, rich and interesting film that tells the story of a group of people deployed at a naval base in Italy and their adventures on a Navy submarine during the First World War. Tommy and Brick (played by Robert Montgomery and Robert Young) are two buddies, and I must say that they make up a couple of very handsome officers. A new captain arrives on board, some already called "dead pan" Toler (Walter Houston), and he is a real supporter of following the rule book and the "code of honor." Soon Tommy and Brick chase an attractive blonde at an officer's dance, Tommy insults the captain - and, of course, the blonde is actually the captain's daughter. But Tommy still wins when he and his daughter sneak from dance to street carnival on the street, and are soon contacted during an air raid - unfortunately for him, she shows that she is married. Later, Tommy finds himself in a real problem when he disobeys orders, trying to save his friend. <br /> <br /> This film is quite entertaining, with an exciting storyline that caught my interest and first-class views of all. Mortal death scene with Sterling Holloway really haunts me - the most memorable scene in this film, I thought. Eugene Pallett and Jimmy Durante add a bit of humor by playing a couple of pranks - the character of Durant is actually learning to be a dentist by mail and constantly encounters a British man who ridicules his nose on land. Well - if you're looking for a movie that shows a man playing kangaroo, then that would be the one.
