I would say that this film is disturbing. Cruelty is depicted very painful, it's like a psychosis in 40 minutes. At the same time, it is a cruel self-analysis of human behavior. The scenes are brutal, from the slaughter of the horse to the brutal sex scene in the kitchen. Every emotion is exploited to the extreme, the butcher’s frustration, the love of his daughter are almost incestuous, fury when he learns that she has been abused, every feeling is so natural and so wrong. This film tells the truth about human nature very honestly and cruelly. The meaning of the film is that a person’s life can change in a second as a result of his behavior, and that the most primitive emotions are the strongest and can determine the action. I liked the unique style of shooting, simplicity and cruelty, accompanied by silence, in which only internal thoughts penetrate.
