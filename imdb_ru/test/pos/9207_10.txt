I think Josh Duhamel is so awesome !! The rest of the show is fun to watch, but I think it is the beautiful and sexy Josh Duhamel that makes the Las Vegas show really funny! At the time of "Magnum" I loved Tom Selleck, I thought he was the sexiest man on earth! A bunch of TV shows is a prerequisite for women to enjoy watching something, especially for the sake of harmless entertainment !! I would do anything to "win a date with Ted Hamilton" !! Josh Duhamel is incredible and I will always be crazy about him !! Josh is definitely a KURIK !! and I will watch Las Vegas all the time, Josh Duhamel is also a big reason !!
