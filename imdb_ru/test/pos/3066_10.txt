Mel Brooks really surpassed himself in this film. No one can deny that Blazing Saddles was a classic and breakthrough comedy film style, but Men In Tights was the pinnacle of his creative genius. This film is a must see. If you like this movie, I would also recommend Space Balls and History of the World. The same thing happens in the opposite direction. If you have seen any of these films, then Men In Tights should be next on your list.
