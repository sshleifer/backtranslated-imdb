Russian actress TATYANA SAMOILOVA very much reminds me of a young Audrey Hepburn, and the camera in the film “Cranes Flies” seems to love her just as much. She is the focal point of a bitter-sweet military novel against the background of the Second World War in Moscow. <br /> <br /> The film is almost poetic in its magnificent black and white cinema, which was the main reason for watching the movie in the first film. place since I never heard of it and decided to try it when it was broadcast on TCM. <br /> <br /> This is a very touching love story about a girl’s deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away his role as a soldier called up in wartime in Russia. She cannot forget the memories of her romantic attachment to him, but inexplicably marries the one who has imposed on her, a pianist who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier from whom she hopes to hear. Their marriage is troubling because she cannot let go of the memory of a happier time with her beloved soldier. <br /> <br /> By the end of the story she accepts the idea that he will never return and is able to confront reality and cope with the situation. At the station there is a very sharp final scene, where the arriving soldiers greet their loved ones, and the weeping girl shares the joy of the returning soldiers, giving flowers from her bouquet to the joyful families. <br /> <br /> The stylish and bright camera work - this is what the film carries, as well as an honestly played story. <br /> <br /> Made with taste, but perhaps the English subtitles did not tell the whole story, because some elements of the plot seemed a bit blurry to me, as if they were clouded. <br /> <br /> To summarize: it's easy to see why he won an award at the Cannes Film Festival. He reminded me, in style, of another great Russian film, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER.
