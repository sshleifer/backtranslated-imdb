The first reviewer is right - in this film we see ourselves, clinging to the majority, feeling decent, trying to avoid trouble, just trying to live our lives, and we see how easily these very human traits so fundamental to the functioning of society can lead us to complicity in great evil. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds during World War II, when radio, newspapers and films remind us of Hitler’s attacks on Jews to highlight irony. the same kind of violent anti-semitism happening in america. At times it seemed a little ponderous. <br /> <br /> This is more like a play than a movie, but it is so suggestive that such quibbles mean little. Perhaps less trivial is the fact that the whole plot is connected with one small fact that seemed to me rather implausible. Larry lived without incident until middle age; and yet all he needs is to start wearing glasses for everyone - EVERYONE - in order, at first glance, to accept him as a Jew. I eagerly suspended disbelief because the plot made me move forward, but the implausibility bothered me throughout the entire film. (And, frankly, I did not understand why his wife was also mistaken for a Jew. Larry seemed to think so because she was called “Hart.” And later, when he married her, I don’t know why his neighbors suggested she was Jewish.) For the first part of the film, I wondered if there would be elements of fantasy. Larry's modesty seemed exaggerated, almost to the point of a grotesque. Why not call the police after seeing rape, even if the attacker was a neighbor? And I thought that the lighting seemed to suggest something a little unreal — the red color of the houses seemed too red, the entrance to Gertrude seemed intentionally lit, as a rule, the colors were almost small in intensity. <br /> <br /> In the credits I see that this was filmed on Campbell Avenue and Wallace Avenue in Toronto, so I plan to go there (near Bloor and Dufferin) today to check the colors. Indeed :) It was nice to remind you that the clergy at that time often led the evil of racism. (Remember how the Pope refused to oppose Hitler, seeking only to protect the Church? By the way, it was the same Pope, who, when the American troops were going to liberate Rome, asked the first soldiers to enter the city not to be black. ever heard of this movie before. It's a shame. This is certainly of great interest to every thinking person, to anyone interested in American history or racism; This is one of the most vivid illustrations I have ever seen in Bertrand Russell's dictum: “Do not go with the crowd to do evil.”
