Very well aged - still thrilling and stressful today. Of course, one of the best films Hitch. Beautifully shot, with an excellent background for indecision, sexual attractiveness, provided by the beautiful Ruth Roman. Because of the great premise, you feel you have to watch it to the end. If you lose faith in Hitch and doubt his title as Master of Suspension, I recommend this cute little movie as an antidote. 5 out of 5
