This film was made thirteen years before I was born, but I still think that this is the cleverest, most dismal, most harmless piece of fun ever created. It simply could not go wrong with the actors from the prominent British characters, whom he brags. <br /> <br /> How to start? Alastair Sim-incomparable; Margaret Rutherford-ditto, the wonderfully awkward, innocent Gossez, perfected by the overbearing Joyce Grenfell. Kaddish Victor Hyde-Brown (special Guy Middleton) and other employees sum up the results of post-war England middle class. <br /> <br /> Sometimes humor is obvious, but it is a special version of Ealing, which is never offensive. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie more than I would like to remember, and I still laugh every time, like a debilitating antics. The assault on the girls' school hostels, superbly planned, but ultimately doomed twin tours of the school and the chaotic ending associated with the arrival of the third school in addition to anarchy, are invaluable. <br /> <br /> This is an old clich√©, I know, but they no longer make them that way. How I wish they did. If you have not seen this, please do not be disappointed.
