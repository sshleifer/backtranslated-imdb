Putney Swope is a story about a black man on the board of a large advertising company who was accidentally elected chairman of the board of directors, when the owner of the company overturns, trying to drive away the idea, which he obviously was very excited about. heart and dismisses the majority of all in the agency, hires a new team (all black, except for the white guy) and proceeds to release the most offensive and non-commercial commercials that you could ever ask. behind. Now he has a rather motley team, and despite this, they somehow succeed, earning money. I rather like the scene where potential advertisers are freed from bags of cash, and then they say "get out." And their ads will follow later, whether they like it or not. The story is good, but, of course, the main point here are the vile commercials themselves, especially those that relate to the cream for acne "Face Off". This is a rather outdated, but still fun movie, full of fun moments. Robert Downey Sr. worked at that time at an advertising agency, doing experimental advertising, and I think that was his middle finger at Madison Avenue agencies. Very good and damn funny. 8 out of 10.
