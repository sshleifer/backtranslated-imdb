“A minute to pray, a second to die” is a high-quality western spaghetti with a solid cast of actors and an interesting storyline. This is shot beautifully, with relatively high production value for a film in this genre. <br /> <br /> Alex Kord does an amazing job portraying Clay McCord, a criminal who is suffering from more and more debilitating seizures. He seeks amnesty before his enemies approach him, but he is too impudent for his own good when he asks for it. Robert Ryan provides the best performance in the film as governor of New Mexico. Mario Brega and Arthur Kennedy are also great here. <br /> <br /> This film is very good, but it does not stand out to me as one of the best westerns of spaghetti. He lacks the style to be in the same league with any of the greats. It has some cool spaghetti overtones, but overall it’s too much like an American western. This is especially noticeable in the musical score, which is normal, since films are generally released, but rather boring by Euro-Western standards. The soundtrack reminds me of music from The Unforgiven. Although there is an interesting story, it is told in a manner that I do not like. If a spaghetti western fan and a Hollywood western fan had to watch a movie together, it would be a perfect compromise. <br /> <br /> All this does not mean that anyone should avoid this movie. I really enjoyed watching it very much. As I said, this is a very well made film, and I recommend it to anyone who loves westerns, spaghetti or something else.
