In the last years of World War II, one of the classic MGM games was released, thanks to which young Elizabeth Taylor became a star. She starred in several films as a child in front of National Velvet, but when she came out, her place in the movie was guaranteed. Ironically, from a biological point of view, she will grow up fairly quickly after the release of National Velvet, and her next task as an actress was to get significant roles for adults, because casting directors saw in her only a small innocent Velvet Brown who loved her jumping horse. <br /> <br /> I’m not sure how it will work, because horses with obstacles must have confirmed pedigrees, and Pi must be a subject not considered in National Velvet. All we know is that he is in the hands of Reginald Owen - a reckless and inexhaustible horse, and after he broke free and caused significant damage, Owen got rid of him at a nominal price for the local butcher Donald Crisp. <br /> <br /> At the same time as this all happens, Mickey Rooney begins roaming the life of the Browns family, which includes Crisp, wife Ann Revere, and daughters Angela Lansbury, Juanita Quigley and Elizabeth Taylor, and their younger brother Butch Jenkins Rooney is a former jockey who is now on the open road and goes to the Brown family, where his father was once a horse trainer for the family of Anna Revere. It is he who sees Pi's potential (short for pirate) as a jumper with obstacles, and it is Elizabeth who convinces Crisp not to miss this chance. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Taylor was so sweet and innocent in National Velvet. A good book says that you must have faith as a child, and she has her to save. She instills Rooney in him to believe in Pi’s heart and abilities and keep a little for herself. <br /> <br /> Anne Revere received the award for Best Supporting Actress in the National Velvet nomination. She is a very wise mother who has hidden depths that the public does not suspect. It turns out that in her youth she had a taste of fame and glory of sailing on the English Channel, and she gives her prize money, accumulated over all these years, to her daughter. This scene probably brought her an Oscar. National Velvet also received another Academy Award for film editing. <br /> <br /> For 60 years after the debut of National Velvet, as a family classic, I have not lost anything. His portrayal of life between the world wars in Britain still stands out. And National Velvet launched the movie legend. Can't do much better than this for high respect.
