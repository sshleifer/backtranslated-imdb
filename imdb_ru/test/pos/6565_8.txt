Hey, now I've never seen a manga comic, but apparently this movie is based on one thing. Oh, well, that's life. In any case, this is quite a strange film, at least, because in a small Japanese town, everything literally gets out of control. People become obsessed with Uzumaks (spiraling), and this young girl watches her friend's father video a snail, and later in the movie people start becoming snails? It also seems that the boyâ€™s father becomes so obsessed that he somehow commits suicide in home appliances. There is some strange humor here that can be at home in a Tim Burton film, but there is some abomination and bloodshed that only Japanese can do with justice. As in many Japanese films, the end is the end, and is something decided? Well, not in my opinion, it is not. There are some hints as to why this all happens, but they have not been studied, and much remains either to the imagination, or it was not considered important. However, there are many things for the eyes, and if you are not obsessed with everything that makes sense, it is worth seeing because it is so original and bizarre. My favorite was a father with rotating eyeballs, personally. 8 out of 10 stars.
