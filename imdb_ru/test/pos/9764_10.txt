This film sleeps - I watched every mini-series that has ever been on TV, several times, and this one is the best. Perfectly played, great acted, and the characters are well developed. Helen Morse is perfect for the role of Gene Paget - harsh, restrained, sharp and a bit belligerent. She bounces well on Joe Harmon, the cowboy, the silent guy. I was sorry that the film did not stick to the book, because there was no romantic interest between Noel Struan and Jean Paget. For those who do not know, this is taken from a real story about the British, who marched around Malaya for 3 years with the Japanese, who really did not know what to do with them. Very few of them survived. Neville Shut spoke with one of them, and this is her story. This film deserves to be in the collection of everyone who loves the history of the Second World War.
