Yesterday I watched this film in the Singapore Theater (February 4, 2006) and found out what happens to people with schizophrenia and their loved ones. <br /> <br /> Ms. Aparna Sen should be congratulated not only on taking a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally retarded with a deep understanding of their predicament, which is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and a storm of unrest, raging in their minds. <br /> <br /> We had Hollywood films on the subject, such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, where Jack Nicholson claimed honor. Since then, research has helped to better understand the problem and eliminate some misconceptions about treatment. For example, in "... the cuckoo's nest" shock therapy was portrayed as barbaric, but in "15 ..." it was noted that it was not as bad as it was announced. <Br /> <br /> Another misconception is that child abuse is the cause of schizophrenia. But scientists such as Dr. E. Fuller Torrey have emphasized that research has shown that childhood schizophrenia is a brain disease and is believed to have some genetic roots. <br /> <br /> It is now established that schizophrenia can be treated like any clinical disease and its development can be checked if it is detected at an early stage. Even at fairly advanced stages, regular medication and counseling can be effective. <br /> <br /> The same understanding that Ms. Sen demonstrated is evident in the way actors play their roles. In keeping with the seriousness of the topic, action is monitored everywhere with Ms. Concante Saint-Charmaâ€™s defiant silence and eyes reflecting the helpless confusion of an agitated mind speaking louder than some of the ranting to which we are accustomed in most films that have including mentally retarded characters . <br /> <br /> Like me, most of the theater viewers looked confused at the sudden finale. This leaves a lot of questions in terms of plot. <br /> <br /> Has the search for Mitya ended? Why is she not found in number 15? Did the children actually play when Mitya went past the gate, her eyes sparkling with recognition? Can anyone understand this puzzle?
