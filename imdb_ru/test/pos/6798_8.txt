Mickey Rooney (like Mi Taylor) - a young man, sailing on a figurative road to the ruins, where he meets 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor (like Velvet Brown) - she loves horses, but he has a sad story with animals. Miss Taylor is fascinated by Mr. Rooney's horse; she takes him home and gives him room and food with her family. They are very well supported by Anna Revere and Donald Crisp (both Mr. and Mrs. Brown). Butch Jenkins and Angela Lansbury are Taylor's intense siblings. <br /> <br /> The plot of the National Velvet is implausible; for example, the circumstances that led to Taylorâ€™s trip to the Big Race are pretty tense (but probably on paper it was more believable). Nevertheless, the relationship of characters with horses and with the character of Miss Revere is well thought out. Rooney and Taylor are superb starring; There is a balance between the disappearing "child star" Rooney and the abundant new "child star" Taylor, which adds depth to their characteristics. <br /> <br /> The excellent characteristics of Rooney and Taylor are further enhanced by the beautiful direction of the photo. and editing from Clarence Brown, Leonard Smith, and Robert Kern. Sentimental classic. <br /> <br /> ******** National Velvet (12/14/44) Clarence Brown ~ Mickey Rooney, Elizabeth Taylor, Ann Revere
