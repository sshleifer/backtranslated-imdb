The first half of the movie scared the hell out of me, and usually it’s not so easy to scare me, but the second half of this thriller didn’t work very well, but still very scary! A good thriller than using simple ways to make a good horror. Low budget, staged in Russia, unknown cast and made in Europe. but still great fun, and yes, there are a few laughs that add to good deeds!
