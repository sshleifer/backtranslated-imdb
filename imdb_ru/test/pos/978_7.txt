This movie was fun! Especially if you are between 8 and 15 years old. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes make up a believable team of 8 classes, returning to an adult who really deserves it. Paul Giamatti makes a wonderful adult that you really want to “get.” My 13-year-old daughter and her friend liked that. Parents: There are no really bad words or any gender to worry about. I recommend this for the “right” crowd. AP
