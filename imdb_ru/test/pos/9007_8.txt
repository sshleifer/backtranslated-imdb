New voices scare me! Kuzko does not need to take some damn academy to become emperor again! It's the same thing over and over again, right? This is a baby show, right? Isma turns Cuzco into something silly, like an animal. He learns a lesson. YET !!!!! David Spade and John Goodman never returned ... * snort *! Nothing changes because Disney will not do anything. ‚Äù This is probably one of the most backward shows in the history! The first movie was damn better! Malina is probably the only person I like. Cusco is so weeping! Kronk is retarded! And Isma retarded-er (if it is even a word)! What I wanted to say is ... How could you, Disney ... why?
