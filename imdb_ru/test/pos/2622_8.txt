I watched this episode many times because I didn’t understand how Prue died. This is what happened. Prue, Piper and Phoebe are trying to save their innocent, Doctor, because Shaks wants to kill him. Phoebe goes upstairs to see the Book of Shadows, and Prue and Piper protect their innocents. Shax appears when Phoebe is still upstairs, so Shax throws an energy ball at the doctor, but Prue pushes him out of the way, and Prue gets hit in the chest with this and smashes into the wall, just like Piper. So, Phoebe comes down and says the spell, since only Phoebe said this, and not the power of the three Shaks was only injured. Phoebe is calling for Leo to heal Piper and Prue. So Leo treats them. Phoebe went to the Underworld to find Cole, and Prue and Piper are looking for Shek on the streets. Piper and Prue see that Shaks and Piper are using their Force to blow up Shaks, while the New Reporter got it all on tape. So everywhere there is news of the three powerful sisters of Halliwell, and Phoebe does not know anything, because she is still in the Underworld. Reporters and people all over Hollywell's home. Then a maniac comes to the house and says: “Can I be a part of your coven?” And Prue says: “No, this is our house, get out of here!” And Prue uses his strength to drive her out. When the maniac leaves the house, he cries, saying: "There, it means witches." Maniac is so angry that he shoots Piper in the stomach. Prue sits in her car and trays to go to the hospital, but people don’t miss it, so Prue uses her strength to lead people out of the way, making people want to kill her more. They got to the hospital, but Piper did not. Meanwhile, Phoebe is in the Underground World. Phoebe finds out that they were exposed, so Phoebe asks Cole to ask the source if he can turn back the clock. The source says that he will change the time only if Phoebe promises to stay here in the Underworld, so Cole told Phoebe what the source told him. Phoebe says: “What makes him think that I will make such a deal?” And then Cole says: “So you can save the life of one of your sisters.” Leo goes to the hospital to find out if Piper is really dead, and tells Phoebe that this is true. Then Phoebe agrees to stay only if Cole returns to warn Piper and Prue about the whistleblower and Piper's death. After returning to the hospital, the Special Forces tells about the shooting, Prue, but a second before they have time, rewind back when they were in the estate with the doctor, but this time Phoebe was not there to call Leo to heal Prue and Piper, therefore doctor throw into the wall too. The doctor died, and Prue died. But this is what I did not get, if Piper also threw into the wall, why only Prue died? Why didn't they show that Leo came and healed Piper and Leo trying to heal Prue? If you know the answer, please email me at angelpuss924@yahoo.com PS. I miss Prue, but I also like Paige, and I'm glad the show went on.
