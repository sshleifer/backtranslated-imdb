I thought this movie was pretty good. It was at TCM (Turner Classic Movies) at three in the morning, and its unusual humor kept me to five. Kelly performs very well in this role, especially with her grandmother (whose jokes almost made me laugh from the spot). The main actress was all right, but the father was able to keep his character isolated from the marital conflict and continued the humor. If you like a good original film, I would recommend it. Unlike the other commentary, I like Gene Kelly. He was the perfect lead actor for many early musicals, and I think that in this role he exudes his charisma. One downside is that the dance scenes get a little boring, but if you can get through them, you're clean.
