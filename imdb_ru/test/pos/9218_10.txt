It was the very first film that I myself saw in the theater. I was 7 years old, and to this day it is one of my favorite films. This is pure smart cheese. The cartoon was sold to young girls, selling dolls with soft bodies and large plastic heads, one for each color of the rainbow, with its own special animals, "sprites" and even a rainbow-talking horse. As a rule, each show was dedicated to how hope, togetherness and magic can make “all the better”. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the onset of spring, when all the light and color return to the world. but this time it does not happen for our beloved hero. The tainted princess conspires to overtake the soul that gives light (and implied life) to the universe, which turns out to be a gigantic diamond for its own insidious goals, without regard to reality, and now Rainbow and her recently found friends Orin, Onyx and Chris have to save the universe. As I said, this is stupid, but cute, and just like all the other cartoons of that period, such as the films CareBear, Strawberry Shortcake, Rose Petal and Smurfs. All films are made for selling dolls to children. And it works. :)
