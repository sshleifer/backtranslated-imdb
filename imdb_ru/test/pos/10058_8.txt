When I watch a movie, I usually look for entertainment. But, of course, if I know in what genre this step, then I will look for what it should do. For example, if this is a deep film, I expect the film to make me think and make me think about what he is saying. But who is this girl? This is not a deep film. But, nevertheless, it is interesting. This is a typical movie that is nice to watch. There is hardly a dull moment in the film, and there are many humorous roles in it. I watched it when I was younger. The cast is always interesting as usual. I was a bit in love with Griffin Dunn, although he was not the typical male smoothie at the time. Haviland Morris also stars. And the late Austrian actress Bibi Besh is also here! Overall delight!
