After reading all the books of Sarah Waters, I was looking forward to adapting the BBC Fingersmith. Especially since the “Tilting Velvet” was so well done by an old acquaintance of Andrew Davis. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the results, in fact I think it could be on a par with TTV; and romantic and interesting. And not like many ignorant people make you believe, senseless lesbian prank. Being a fan of Elaine Cassidy since she saw her unsophisticated turn in Felicia's Journey, I thought that she embodied both hard deception and growing fragility like Mod. Her transformation was believable and impressive. I recognized Sally Hawkins as Xena Blake from Tipping velvet, a small role in the first place, so I didn’t have so many expectations, but she was amazing in the role of Sue Trinder. Her eyes fascinated, conveying everything from rage to complete despair. Two of them, acting together, combining these talents, made this drama incomprehensible. Of course, Imelda Staunton, as usual, was amazing, she was undoubtedly a national treasure, and the cast was high. Even the direction from the rather unknown Eisling Walsh used the contrasting but beautiful shades of blue for Briar and brown for London. <br /> <br /> However, Ransley, the screenwriter, should be commended. Turn a 600-page book, where each line is of the highest quality, in a three-hour extravaganza - a great feat. He covered the main revelations at a steady pace, while at the same time giving us a lot of history and character development at the same time. He gives me complete admiration. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, a brilliant adaptation, where all participants gave 100% and made it one of the best BBC dramas I've ever seen.
