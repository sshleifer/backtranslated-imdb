I first saw this film in the early 90s and immediately fell in love with it. Richard Benjamin and his wife Paula shot the 1981 film “Saturday the 14th” in 1981 before making this film in 1983. I think they work quite well together. I laughed a few times in this movie. He also has a young Molly Ringwald, who later in the late 1980s co-starred in films such as Beautiful in Pink and Sixteen Candles. It's fun to watch her a little younger. I have not seen many people .. I do not even think that the average movie fan ever heard of this movie. but when I first came to him, I was glad that I did. I gave this film 10 out of 10 stars, as it seems to me This is a funny movie that the whole family can enjoy. In conclusion, I would like to say that it is not available on DVD, so I took a copy of the VHS on eBay, so if you're interested, you can find it there. The range is from $ 20 to $ 30, but I was counting on $ 12. I wish they ended up releasing it on DVD.
