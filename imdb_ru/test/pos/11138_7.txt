I was surprised to see it on TV on Friday, and I liked it. Between the presence of Bobby Phillips and numerous references to everything that could be considered a “cyberpunk”, this film was fun to watch. I liked the story that reminded me of the book I read (Earth, David Breen), and it was fun to watch on TV. Bobby looks great, but I also liked her performance as Cam, because she really was different from everyone else. But the biggest thing about this movie was the atmosphere described in the books of Gibson, Sterling, and others. It was just fun to watch it on TV.
