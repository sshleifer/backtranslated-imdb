Focus is another great movie starring William Macy. I first discovered Macy in Fargo, and I saw several of his films, and he had not yet deceived me. Macy is a typical “good guy who has something to hide.” In the Focus, he plays the role of Lawrence Newman, a dedicated and hard-working employee who shelters his disabled mother at home. The scene takes place after World War II, in the midst of McCarthyism. Newman is the head of the company's personnel department, which is basically an anti-Semite. After he accidentally hired a woman of Jewish descent, he was asked to buy glasses in order to improve his poor eyesight. <br /> <br /> Incredibly, the simple process of buying points has big implications for his life, and this is Gertrude Hart, his wife (played by the great Laura Dern). As the film unfolds, Newman will begin to see a completely different world, where being a Jew is akin to an animal. <br /> <br /> The cinema is alarming because it shows that racism is something completely normal. A frightening thought that in some places it probably still exists.
