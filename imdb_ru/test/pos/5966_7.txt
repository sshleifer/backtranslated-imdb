ASCENT is a very useful addition to recent reissues from the Soviet Union. The film, directed by Larisa Shepitko in 1977, discusses the moral consequences of loyalty and honor in the German-occupied Russia during World War II. On foot and in a blizzard, two members of the partisan Soviet group are sent in search of supplies and are captured by Nazi soldiers. The film focuses on how each person processes or assimilates their moral alternatives. One chooses dignity and honesty, and the other chooses to cooperate with the enemy. However, in the end, he cannot adhere to his selfish decision. The film widely uses slow, wide-angle frying pans, which go into extreme close-ups and highlight the spiritual problems in the souls of each person. This is not a very good film, but it does show a serious moral dilemma against the backdrop of the harsh and cold Soviet wildlife.
