I entered this movie while waiting for the slasher, and, although Mute Witness really influences this style of filmmaking, it is much more than a simple click. There are a number of thrillers that focus on a particular disability - blindness is more common (“Blind Terror”, “Wait until dark”, “Feline and ninetieth tails”), but this means that there is such a dumb example in the thriller as in fact, they are an integral part of the plot, since the fact that the protagonist cannot speak is often the reason she gets into dangerous situations from which it will be easy for someone else to get out. Our dumb witness is Billy Hughes, a makeup artist working on a horror film in a studio in Moscow. One night she finds herself locked up after several hours, and after trying to call her sister for help, she stumbled upon what at first glance seems like an illegal sex film, but it soon turns out to be a snuff film! She tries to convince the authorities of what she saw, but discovers that no one believes her stories ... <br /> <br /> Recently, the Hostel made headlines to show the creation of a snuff film in a foreign country, but this film did it first and actually does a better job. He may not be as unpleasant as Eli Roth's opus, but the blood is more effective, and since directed by Anthony Waller (who directed one of my favorite modern thrillers with The Guilty), he introduced a good sense of humor into the process. , Mute Witness - and bloody and funny enough to watch. The director certainly has a talent for creating exciting adventures, since this one never stands still. The plot is put into action quickly, and Waller constantly introduces plot twists, which are of great help in the overall entertainment value of the film. Acting is not bad for a B-film, with young performers Marina Zudina, Faye Ripley and Evan Richards performing well. The atmosphere is sandy, and the Russian locations are respectively unfriendly, which helps the film to preserve the atmosphere of foreboding. Overall, Mute Witness is a much better movie than you might expect. The plot flows well, the atmosphere and tension in place.
