Love is a multifaceted thing, directed by veteran Hollywood director Henry King, who began his career back in 1915, was one of his last great films. It was based on Han Suyin’s bestseller, simply called “Many Glorious Things”, a phrase borrowed by Francis Thompson from the Kingdom of God poem, where this many magnificent words “love” was used in a completely different and rather transcendental context to love To god The film, shot in the 50s, was marked along with the work of such directors as Douglas Sirk and Vincente Minnelli, a kind of revival of the melodrama, its heyday and again reaches its peak of popularity. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the handsome American reporter Mark Elliott, played by William Holden, once again played in one of his irresistible playboy roles, comes to Hong Kong and meets the young and handsome Han Suyin ( Jennifer Jones), half Chinese, of semi-English origin, who works as a doctor in a hospital and whose husband was recently murdered by Chinese Communists. Instantly, Mark feels quite attracted to her, but at first his deep feelings do not quite respond with the reciprocation of Khan’s heart, which remained cold after the death of her husband (“I now believe in the human heart only as a doctor”). But very soon she succumbs to the tempting temptations of hell, Mark, and they both enter into passionate relationships, which, apparently, cannot be stopped by the fact that Mark is unhappy and his wife does not want to divorce him or communicate with him. differences and prejudices caused by Han Chinese origin. Yet it is fate that has the last word in determining the justice of the eternity of such blissful love relationships, no matter how long they both consider it a merciless time, waiting in a rather alarming form of death, prepared at any moment to prove its inconstancy. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, one of the most romantic films ever made, “Love Is a Many Splendored Thing” includes wonderful performances by William Holden and Jennifer Jones, a wonderful Oscar-winning musical score. Alfred Newman and an extremely romantic, touching, heartbreaking, but ultimately heartbreaking story. Do not miss this great movie. 8/10 <br /> <br />
