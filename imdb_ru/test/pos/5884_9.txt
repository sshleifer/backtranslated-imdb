So many wonderful talents were used in “The Best Years of Life”, the result should be somewhat surprising. Think about what his director, William Wyler, faced; after a military victory over statesmen who committed heinous crimes and engulfed the world in battles, he made a film stating that the leaders of the United States are in themselves deeply anti-individual - that they "spent the best years of life of those who were called or misled to participate in the war - which, because it ignored the rights of individuals, was in vain, with the exception of the dispute over the degree of slavery to which people were subjected. "There are beautiful scenery by Julia Heron, cinematography Gregg Tolanda and the script of Robert E. Sherwood, author of The Road to Rome and other ways to protect people from tyrannical ideas. The ironic name was used to attract the talents of such actors as Frederick Marsh, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Dana Andrews, Virginia Mayo, Katie O'Donnell and Hoagie Carmichael in a large-scale, but thematic drama.The clever storyline is the experience of “couples” when the soldiers (three of whom were in the spotlight) tried to return home to the “culture of victory”. Their bitter experience and awareness of their own need to fight again with what was happening on the homefront is a serious and sobering counterpoint to the popular belief that "everything was fine with America." March and his wife adapt badly, and he drinks; O'Donnell's young man, Harold Russell, has hooks instead of hands and miracles, if life can even be worth living, and worst of all, Andrews wife throws him for the guy with the test, and he lost years, forcing employers to ignore or deprive his right to work, to consider his individual merits - to have even what he had before being pulled out of his life and thrown into the risk arena - not for anything, nor for the loss of everything he ever had . A terrific climax of the film comes when each of the three must confront and must fight again, each for the sake of his own happiness; and all three succeed in finding the courage to continue the struggle - each for the sake of his own happiness, which is now threatened by a curious anti-me, anti-reality, indifferent non-American United States. The direction of Wyler, especially the scene where Andrews is sitting in the cockpit of a canned B-17, is alone, and the scene of Russell's wedding is truly wonderful. This is the most powerful film, excellent on its own terms, and women and men can agree at once. Hugo Friedhofer's music and the costumes of Irina Sharaff add to her brilliance. One of the best and most unexpected films of all time in a stunning black and white.
