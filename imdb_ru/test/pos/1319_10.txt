This is my favorite movie, and I think it's perfect. Unlike any other movie that I can name, I never watch this movie and I think it would be better if they changed this or that or something else. Is this the definition of a work of art? I think so. Each stroke in Mishima is perfect, and all of this follows from Schroeder’s script. I always liked the work of Paul Schrader (you can't argue with Taxi Driver, and Light Sleeper is an amazing film), but although his writing often seems to border on a pompous, his directorial style is usually absent. I think this is intentional, because his films are usually devoted to the search for redemption and unfold in the real world; ugly and rude His style matches his themes, since he presents his characters in a simple and realistic way, and allows them to show the audience the truth of the situation. Imagine if Schröder drove a Taxi Driver or “Brought the Dead” instead of Scorsese. But, like the protagonists of these two films, while Mishima was Schroeder’s ideal material, right, vain, and contrary to society, his works were delicate and beautiful. In fact, he was a minor writing career as a woman writer, creating something that can reasonably be called romantic bowlers. Thus, you do not necessarily imagine that Schroeder was the perfect person to capture this subtlety and beauty in the film. I think the film shows what it was. The scenario, which he helped fashion, divides Mishima in three parts; his life, his death and his mind. His life is represented in black and white, camera, formal compositions. His death, which he will always remember best, is a pocket documentary style. And his mind is represented by dramatized excerpts from his novels, each of which reveals the thought processes of this complex man, who hardly ever wrote a character that was not a reflection of himself. These dramas are beautiful, thanks to Eiko Ishioka's remarkable production design and Schröder's creative production. In all parts, the acting is excellent, especially from Ken Ogata in the role of Mishima, who captures the main charm, arrogance and narcissism of man. The photo is excellent in everything and contains images that the viewer will keep forever. Finally, the music is simply gorgeous, perfectly matches the images, although it was written and recorded before the shooting, set up during the editing process and then overwritten. I don’t know how much music influenced the shooting, but it perfectly matches the image. I saw a lot of ideas about what different people think about the subject of the film, what Schroeder is trying to say. You know, big things about life, death, etc. But I don’t think the film says something. Mishima already said this, the film just repeats.
