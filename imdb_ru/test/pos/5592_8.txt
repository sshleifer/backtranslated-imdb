I really felt that the film was ahead of its time. The only potential daughter in law was such a strong, career-oriented woman. She knew what she wanted and was diplomatic, but firm in terms of mothers-in-law. The role of the mother was played very well (you just loved to hate her). Her need to control her sonâ€™s life was neurotic evil. If you have ever been in a relationship where you were tried and lacked (and all the participants knew about it), it could strike too close to home. Years have passed since I watched this film, and I remember how I thought that this plot and dialogue would work in a film of the 50s or 60s. It is difficult to watch because of the dynamics of mother and son, but I would love to see it again. I continue to hope to find it on one of the old movie channels, but so far no luck. Attempts to buy it were also in vain (I do not believe that it is on a tape or DVD).
