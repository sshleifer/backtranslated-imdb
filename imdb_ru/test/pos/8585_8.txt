Being a Belgian, I am interested in the history of the Congo. For many years it was our only colony (Rwanda was a Belgian protectorate, but not a colony), and this is part of our country's history. Nowadays, it seems very popular to say that everything that the Belgians did to the Congo was wrong, especially in the 19th century. I'm not saying that bad things did not happen. Of course they did, but then it was not abnormal. Do you really think that the French or the British were much better in their colonies? No, they were not. At that time, it was “normal” for our King Leopold II to use the Congo as a way to gain personal wealth. It was his private property (then it did not belong to the state), and he tried to derive maximum benefit from it. Of course, terrible things happened, such as chopping off hands, and, according to today's standards, this is unacceptable, but in those days it was a common practice. And I must say, all this has not happened again in recent decades ... I know a few people who lived in the Congo for many years before the independence of the Congo was declared. It is true that they had several black servants, but they are very good people, and I really cannot imagine that they ever treated them badly. As far as I know, they always treated them with great respect (however, I do not say that all Belgians did this). In fact, if they weren't so old now (almost all around 80 years old), they would love to return to the Congo. <br /> <br /> The good thing about this film is that it provides a historically accurate picture of what happened in the last years of the reign of Belgium and in the early years of Congo’s independence. The story is not as black and white (perhaps not the best words in this context, but how else to explain what I mean), as I was afraid it would be. This does not mean that everything the Belgians did was wrong, and everything the Congolese did was good. This perfectly shows how the Congolese, seeking independence from the Belgians, did not object to accepting help from the Russians and the Americans, who both watched raw materials such as copper, diamonds, bauxite, rubber ... and the Congolese entering their political camp. and not everyone was interested in their independence. This not only gives a good idea of ​​how Lumumba became more powerful, but also how Mobutu played a dual role. This shows the reaction of Belgium to some of our compatriots who are subjected to violence, threats and even murder (my father was one of the paratroopers who were sent to the Congo to save the Belgians). This gives a good picture of the political problems Lumumba faced, since Katanga Province did not want to be part of the Congolese Republic, about the role the Belgians played in the Lumumba assassination ... it all played a part in this film. <br /> <br /> The story seems very accurate, and the characters really look and behave like real ones. This film was able to give a very good idea of ​​what life was like in Congo in the late 50s and early 60s, and which should be seen by all who are interested in the history of the country. But this should also be shown in history lessons, especially in Belgium, because it is part of our history that should never be forgotten. I give it 7.5 / 10, maybe even 8/10.
