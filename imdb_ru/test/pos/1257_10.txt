From the point of view of what it is possible to make films that do not offend people with strong moral values, this film is definitely worth it. This is the second in a row Bruce Willis film, in which you can tell your story without a naked body, obscene humor, profanity or unwarranted violence. (I mean, of course, “The Sixth Sense.”) Both films attract more than one level. This one is also suitable for children, although, as others have noted, this is not a click for children. <br /> <br /> I was worried that the time travel device that runs this story is never explained, except that we know that Russell himself initiates him as a 70-year-old. Also, why should his dying mother come to school to get him when he wins the fight; why, if, as his older "I" says, he has to fight this child again and again for the next few years, doesn’t his mother have to come to him every time, and why he doesn’t learn to beat himself in the process. I also found the score rather annoying and not always suitable for acting on stage. <br /> <br /> However, good use of the red plane as a metaphor.
