Over the years, some of them were the most enjoyable films about dysfunctional families. <br /> <br /> Good afternoon, Monsieur Scholmy, such a film. <br /> <br /> This is an Israeli film about a Moroccan Jewish family. <br /> <br /> It can be any family, any culture. We all know or would like to know people similar to those in this comic gem. <br /> <br /> This 2003 admiration was written and directed by Shemi Zorkin. Let's hope he has a long career. <br /> <br /> The film is visible through the eyes of a 16-year-old son who seems to be taking care of everyone in the family. He was brilliantly played by Oshri Cohen (he was 18 years old when he was making a film. <br /> <br /> Since then he has starred in several, and I know that I will hunt them. I hope this young man will become a star. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is great. I hope I will see them again. <br /> <br /> I loved each of the actors to some extent. I think everyone who sees this will agree . <br /> <br /> He was nominated for many international awards and won 8. He deserved everyone. <br /> <br /> Now the film in a language other than English has a very limited US circulation, which I think is regrettable. <br /> <br /> Having rented this film, you will be glad you did. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> NOTE: Since the story is not new, this is the highest rating it can get.
