I just looked at the Dresser this evening, I saw it only once, about a decade ago. <br /> <br /> This is not a “big” movie, and I'm not trying to make a big splash, but my God, the brilliance of the two leads leaves me almost silent. Albert Finney and Tom Courtney are nothing short of amazing in this film. <br /> <br /> “A chest of drawers” ​​is the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his chest of drawers Norman (Courtney), a kind of valet. , staging the staging of "King Lear" during the blitz-London war in World War II. These are two people, each of whom depends on the other: Sir is almost helpless without the help of Norman, in order to persuade, persuade and intimidate him to step on the stage for his 227th Lyre speech. And Norman lives his life through Sir; without sir, he is needed, he is nothing, or thinks he is anyway. <br /> <br /> This is a character-driven movie; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. Finney, only 47 years old, is quite plausible as a very old, very patient, irritable, mocking, but brilliant theater actor. He hisses and is angry with his colleagues, even when they bow! And Courtney is no less convincing than a chest of drawers, which sometimes must act more like a mother than a valet in front of his elderly employer. However, the employer is the wrong term. Although technically their relationship with the employer and the employee, in most cases, Sir and Norman behave differently from older couples. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are others in this movie. But there is no doubt that the real stars are Finney, Courtney, and the wonderful script of Ronald Harwood. This is not to say that there are no other good performances, especially Eileen Atkins as the long-suffering director Madge. There is a wonderful scene in which Sir and Madge talk about old desires, old regrets and what could be. <br /> <br /> Although this is not talked about these days, it is worth remembering that Komod was nominated for five Oscars: nominations for the best male role in Finney and Courtney, Best Picture, and Best Director (Peter Yates) and Best Adapted Script. <br /> <br /> I remembered it as a good movie, but I was not ready to be completely hypnotized, as I was from beginning to end. If you want to see an example of what is a great acting game, and constantly get great pleasure, then I urge you to watch "Locker".
