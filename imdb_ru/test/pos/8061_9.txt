I read Anne Frank: The Young Girl's Diary when I was in high school, and I found myself completely absorbed in her story, as well as the Broadway play about her life in The Secret App. <br /> <However, I’m a little puzzled by how people perceive her diary and her personality, see her as a little saint, or bring hope to the world. I do not think this was the original intention of her diary. She wrote it mostly for herself, although she did some rigorous correspondence before the inhabitants of the Secret Supplement were betrayed, intending to publish it someday. <br /> <br /> But I never saw her as a saint or as a messenger of hope ... but as a very talented writer who could very well and entertainingly express his thoughts in a diary. Without a doubt, she was a very interesting writer, and she had an extraordinary talent for self-expression in words. You really should get to know her well through her diary. But the importance of her diary is that it is a testament and an important historical document, indicating that the Holocaust really took place. <br /> <br /> He also brought the Holocaust tragedy close to home, losing someone to whom we could give a familiar face and personality at such a young age ... literally depriving her young life of her and other people who were killed during the Holocaust. This is a blatant charge of systematically killing more than 6 million Jews by the Nazis, and this must not be forgotten. <br /> <br /> But I’m sad that her diary is so misunderstood as something more. When I look for hope, I have a Bible ... the first most widely read popular science book in the world. The words of God in the Bible are eternal ... but Anna's diary is a diary of a young girl in extraordinary circumstances, and that is all. She should not be worshiped or worshiped because she was an ordinary girl with many flaws, had an incredible talent as a writer, and died at the age of 15 from typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. She was a victim of the Holocaust, and, as this brilliant documentary showed so vividly, she was the most famous victim of Hitler. <br /> <br /> In addition to the story of Anne Frank ... stories from her family and friends and Holocaust survivors were exciting, vivid and powerful. I especially liked the testimony of Mip Guise, and I am surprised that she is still strong and alive today. Hannah Goslar's testimony was also very interesting. And I also liked hearing from Otto Frank. But I also agree that the moving picture of a young girl with dark hair and familiar big eyes at the end was particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> Another thing about the Holocaust, with which I somehow disagree with the documentary film ... is that I don’t believe that it was just a matter of discrimination ... but rather something deeper and deeper, and it was just an act of pure evil. Pure evil. Nothing but pure evil. <br /> <br /> An excellent documentary about Anne Frank and the Holocaust, which is worth seeing.
