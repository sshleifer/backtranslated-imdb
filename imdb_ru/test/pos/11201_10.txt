This is not a film that will hit you with a high budget, high-tech shots, quick camera movements or shimmering costumes invented by an overly zealous and hungry director. But this is a film by a director who is also a very good photographer, who has a very good perception of things as a person, and not as a demigod, unlike most directors. This is not a film in which actors and actresses try to show their best "performances" with unreal or, at best, learned by gestures and imitations. Rather, it is a film in which they act as real as possible. In fact, they are not professional actors at all. The conversations between the main characters, their expressions, their feelings are as real as your real life can easily be. You tell the same lies to the people around you with the same regrets that you avoid expressing in words. You show the same signs of trouble for an unwanted guest. This is the same sense of separation that you experience in modern urban life. And this is your chance to see yourself from the main characters. I have seen all the films of Nuri Bilge Ceylan, including his short film "The Goat" (Cacoon) thanks to those who burn it to DVD. Many compare it with Tarkovsky, Ozu and, maybe, with Bresson or Bergman, since he becomes a real author. And he sincerely says that his films are not in order to earn money, but in order to give a meaning to his life. You will find this kind of sincerity in Uzak.
