Many American brains who worship and support the political half-truths of gangsters like Michael Moore would have succeeded in watching this film more than once and see how hypnotic manipulators can frighten, intimidate and lie to an under-informed public and get people they fear or hatred killed, aggravated and disfigured. Robespierre in this beautiful epic with the help of a remote control kills the opposition, all in a fit of self-satisfied devotion to its principles. It seems that Robs found it quite justifiable to tear off the heads of his opponent, even when he sent his minions to fabricate false and misleading accusations against the state. Today, the captains of our rotting media are much more sensitive than Robs ... they just kill your character with hints and false allegations made without foundation or sources. Witness Dan Ratzer is trying to kill Wu on the eve of the 2004 election or the constant blow that was stolen in the 2000 election, although constitutional scholars continue to mock such irresponsible nonsense.
