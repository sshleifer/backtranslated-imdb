The first, and much better, of Kevin Klein's two fun roles. (The second is the dreary “De-Lovely” in which he played Cole Porter.) Inspired by Tom Hanks' emotional thank-you speech for “Philadelphia”, in which he released his senior school drama teacher, the nominated film in this version was clearly more “Forrest Gump "Than" Philadelphia. " Here the character Hanks plays Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> Reactions of reactions in most films are very funny and, as has often been noted, especially effective, as Kevin himself did, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck (a bold move, since he himself was the target of such rumors that he refuted !), Bob Newhart and Joan Cusack as the ultimate abandoned future bride. <br /> <br /> The actual teacher Tom Hanks criticized the graduation scene, saying that people do not behave in real life. But it is a farce, not a real life. That being said, it is not as effective as it could be, and the wrong direction of the final “wedding scene” that makes it look as if Tom and Kevin are going to be confused, I found rather meaningless, annoying and police. <Br /> <br /> The highlight of the film for me is, of course, Kevin’s scene with an audio tape “how to be a real person”, and it’s funny but certainly not realistic when the tape reacts to Kevin. actions. <br /> <br /> In general, the horn!
