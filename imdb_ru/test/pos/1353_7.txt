The main role in this western is played by Robert Walker, Jr. He is a young pistol who, with his partner, David Carradine, is torn apart after performing a contract strike on a Mexican general. Avoiding their pursuers, Carradine and Walker are separated. Walker is faced with the camp of lawyer Robert Mitchum, who loves Walker and makes him a kind of protégé and land-reclamation project. <br /> <br /> This is the first of two films that Robert Mitchum shot with writer / director Bert Kennedy. The second was a more humorous "Good guys and bad guys." <br /> <br /> It’s not that young Billy Young has any fun moments. But this is a trilateral story, which tells of Walker's return, Mitchum’s hunt for the bad ones that killed his son, and the romantic triangle with Mitchum, Angie Dickinson and city boss Jack Kelly. <br /> <br /> The film is replete with cronyism. David Carradine is the son of John. The daughter of Dean Martin, Dean, Walker, the son of Robert Walker, and Jennifer Jones and the son of Mitchum, Chris, play the son of Mitchum in some silent memories. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum began his career in westerns and always looks straight at the houses in them. Angie Dickinson essentially repeats the role she played in the Rio Bravo. Walker made a short career playing rebellious young men and doing a good job at it. I often wondered what happened to him. He looks obsessive like his father. Perhaps he did not want to come to such a tragic early end as his father. <br /> <br /> And this was not enough, Mitchum's fans hear the old crumpled eyes sing the title song at the beginning of the film.
