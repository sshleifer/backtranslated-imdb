This is one of the greatest films in history. A brilliant game of George Scott and Diane Riggs. This film is exciting and extremely deep. Do not be fooled into believing that this is just a comedy. This is a brilliant satire about the medical profession. This is not a beautiful picture. Incompetent surgeons kill healthy patients who spend all their time earning money outside the hospital. And yet, you really believe that this is a hospital. Manufacturers were very careful to include real medical terminology and real medical cases. This film really shows how difficult it is to manage a hospital, and how bad it was in 1971. I like this movie. Postscript - I noticed that the incompetent surgeon-dealer played the head of the firm in LA Law. The young doctor played Lou Grant. I also noticed that the registration nurse appeared since then in Becker and other shows.
