I knew the premise of this film, and, obviously, I cannot miss a good-sounding film, especially from the director of Suspension Master, Sir Alfred Hitchcock. Mostly tennis champion Guy Haynes (Farley Granger) meets the eccentric stranger Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train from Washington to New York. Bruno talks about perfect murder, Guy hates his wife, and Bruno hates his father, so Bruno “suggests” the substitution of murders. The guy obviously did not take him seriously, until, of course, his wife Miriam Joyce Haynes (Casey Rogers (or Laura Elliott)) was found dead in an amusement park. The guy, of course, is the main suspect, and Bruno continues to “run into him”, reminding him of their “plan” and giving him more things that will help him kill the father he wants to kill. This investigation into the murder and prosecution of Bruno threatens his tennis career and his relationship with the daughter of Senator Morton (in the north Leo J. Carroll from the northwest), Ann (Ruth Roman). Bruno realizes that Guy will not commit his murder, so he decides to plant evidence at the crime scene to make him guilty - a cigarette lighter with Guy's monogram in an amusement park. After his game of tennis, Guy and Ann (who obviously figured out the "murder plan") rush to an amusement park to stop Bruno, and they fight on an accelerating, unmanaged carousel. Also starring Patricia Hitchcock (daughter of the director) as Barbara Morton, Marion Lorne as Mrs. Anthony, Jonathan Hale as Mr. Anthony, Howard St. John as Police Captain Turley and John Brown as Professor Collins, and Hitchcock cameo the role of Man landing train with double bass. Several interesting dialogues and interactions with the characters, some interesting moments of expectation and, of course, an unforgettable finale of the carousel, a good classic film. He was nominated for an Oscar for best cinematography. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was 75th in the 100 greatest icons of pop culture, the film was 32nd in 100 years, 100 thrills. Fine!
