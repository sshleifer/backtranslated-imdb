The greatest effort plus the best cast ever assembled in a film directed by Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn in the front row. Someone said that this film is good because the director and screenwriter Tim Robbins, but I urge you that Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon gave me a really excellent performance that I cried out of my heart. Their game is so real! There is no doubt that this film is rated 4 and 3/4 out of 5!
