One of the best ever. Directing, photography, an exciting and dramatic story, a wonderful soundtrack and, most importantly, an incredible confidence in Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn, the best and most underrated actor "under 40" Having seen this film, I think, is there anyone who could not doubt to die to another person, despite all the ugly things he could do?
