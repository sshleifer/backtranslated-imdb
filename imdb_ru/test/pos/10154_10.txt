Alfred Hitchcock's remake of “The Man Who Knew Too Much” is generally considered not as good as the original, but for me this is one of the best films ever. I prefer this "Vertigo" and "Rear Window". <br /> <br /> Like the North by North-West, this is the story of an average person who is unwittingly thrown into the world of international intrigue. James Stewart plays the father of the son who was kidnapped because he is mistaken for an international spy. He will do everything to bring his son back and protect his family. <br /> <br /> Although the original was good for its time, by today's standards it is difficult to look at. The remake has a great quality of production, a charming day Doris and a really creepy villain. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about renting this, because you want to see it again and again.
