This series is about the stupid and unconventional English gentleman who is faced with all sorts of funny failures. <br /> <br /> I remember watching Mr. Bean with my family in 1990, when I was a child. My family laughed so much at every episode, the content of which still emerges in our daily conversations twenty years later. Memorable scenes that are still in my head include Mr. Bean trying to get out of his parking lot, lighting the light, counting the sheep, and him in the pool. We bought all the videos of Mr. Bean on VHS, no matter how expensive they are. It was worth it because we watched them again and again! Very rarely you can see very funny series, suitable for all ages.
