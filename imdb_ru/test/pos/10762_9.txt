A brilliant and sensitive film with intertwined storylines. As a general warning, the film gets pretty dark about halfway through. No matter how unexpected this may be, this is a change that I found suitable for the themes of the film, especially Ishkanani’s comparison with the dirty rich, and (as Finn says at the end) how each person is a tribe and how the whole tribe is reflected in each person. <br /> <br /> Anton Yelchin (Finn Earl) is impressive in this film. He is probably best known as Check from Star Trek or Kyle Reese in The Terminator of Salvation, but he was in a lot of movies that you probably never heard of (Alpha Dog, another brilliant performance Yelchin, “House D” Hearts in Atlantis, to name a few ...) The fact is that this child really takes this film and makes it his own. Other great performances from Diane Lane and Donald Sutherland - this is what raises this film one step higher, from excellent to excellent.
