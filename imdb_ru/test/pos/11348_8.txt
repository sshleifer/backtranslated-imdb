This extremely intimate story of an unsuccessful romance between two married people tied to their traditions in Hong Kong (in turbulent times, as we are told) in 1962, recalls the essence of old Hollywood in the scene behind the scenes of lush colors evoking memories. yet restrained sensuality (as opposed to necessary sexuality and random nude scenes that became part of the novel in the film), and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or intercourse. It is not difficult to see the influence of Margaret Duras, because she is known for her minimalism in telling stories, as well as describing a powerful drama, using the art of verbal and non-verbal communication of two characters with a strong connection, as well as the use of shooting scenes that may eventually take place in life. both characters. From Hiroshima MON AMOUR to MODERATO CANTABILE, her pen is clearly visible here from the moment we enter the cramped rooms of Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Su Li-chen (Maggie Cheung) to the last scenes that explain the intensity of regret that he feels That recalls the missed opportunity to confirm this relationship. <br /> <br /> The plot even recalls what Duras wrote: Mr. Chow and Mrs Soo Li-jen, these apartment neighbors, being quite successful professionals, begin to discover in the most banal way that their spouses are cheating on them, and they discover that they are completely natural. The question is, should they be guided by what they feel about each other, or should they not be like their partners? Each scene plays with the notion that at any moment they will give way to each other, and at some point it is suggested that they ultimately do as intrusive as the camera details our meetings with us (which seem to happen on a daily basis can be seen from the frequent change of Cheng’s dresses), we never see it. And if you don’t see any of their spouses reinforcing their own love story, what they don’t see, how they endure their appeal, makes the separation even more bitter, because at every moment we want something something happened - and the only thing that comes is when Leung reveals to her that he loves her, followed by his quiet cruel revelation that she will never leave her husband, which implies that he, too will not be. It also gives us an idea of ​​what culture and time can do: from a Western point of view, their romance could become more solid and lasting, especially in the 60s, but since this is Hong Kong, cultural values ​​are noticeably different from each other. . <br /> <br /> The performances here are of a very high order: it is very easy to play a passionate love affair, but constantly playing repressive, platonic relationships that are full of desire, barely intended, it is difficult and difficult to make all sensuality more cerebral than tangible or visual. Cheung and Leung are smoldering, and their flawed chemistry lingers long after the loans collapsed.
