I am an avid chipmunk fan from the late 70s - early 80s. When this movie came out, you had to watch it. And having seen it, I approached and bought! The film is great, I like the animation it brings, and the music is great (yes, I bought a soundtrack on a CD ...) Recommended video for everyone to watch and enjoy!
