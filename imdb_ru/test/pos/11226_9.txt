The harsh, cold landscape of the Big Sky Country, with its majestic snow-capped mountains adjacent to the barren plains, is poetically used here in this Lynch fairytale / slideshow about death and melancholy from young and talented Polish Brothers (who previously Turned fans of indie films to and the fascinating Twin Falls Idaho - a film about a young woman in love with two brothers who were Siamese twins). The little orphan boy dies, and the city is about to be flooded in the name of progress (in the form of a damned hydroelectric station). With his terribly pleasant musical accompaniment, minimalist dialogue and character development, as well as supernatural fantasy episodes involving some completely unique angels, Polish brothers focus their attention on what every good artist knows about what the film should be, moving pictures ... Scene images ... pictures of deep beauty captured on celluloid. It is best to look late at night so that memorable images can linger in your mind and wash you when you fall asleep. The fact that all this was done with a budget of less than two million dollars makes Hollywood ashamed of its overblown film costs and empty films and points to something big in the future from the Polish brothers.
