Looking for evidence that real life is more interesting than fiction? You just found it. This excellent documentary film about an aspiring full-length director (Mark Bortcharte) who refuses to admit defeat is the most fun movie I've ever seen, probably because he is also one of the most tragic. Oddly enough, the more I watch a movie, the more I am inspired.
