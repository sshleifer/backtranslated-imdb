Stephen Hawking has one of the greatest minds, or, if it is too simplistic to be considered one of the most curious and audacious, he also finds himself trapped in a body mutilated by a disease that leaves him in a wheelchair and a computer for communication. Maybe I didn’t know enough about Hawking (I always knew him as “that guy, speaking like a computer, who knows a lot about such things, the universe and so on, you know”) that he is British, that he was a pretty normal child, and, most surprisingly, the disease, which could lead to death at 21, put him in the spotlight. <br /> <br /> According to Errol Morris, equally curious and cold-blooded, visually Dazzling portrait in “A Brief History of Time”, Hawking was already brilliant, in splashes (when other Oxford students faced frightening algebraic equations, he answered more than three times more than an hour), but when faced with problems, mainly from other theories of other scientists, he bounced back with his own. Under some of the complex scientific discussions - and if you got a little less than B - in astronomy, like me, you will need to keep your ears especially impressed by explanations of the possible infinity of time or features of a black hole - there is a person who just wants to enjoy his goose on your birthday. <br /> <br /> Morris catches Hawking just for those who cannot get enough of his theories about how particles can enter and exit a black hole, or if there is even a creator or not, depending on how many man takes into account Einstein and time. But he also captures a story about a person and his condition, which makes it something much more interesting than if Morris did one thing or the other. Too much talk about space can hurt his head, and too much about his personal life, and one wonders what kind of noise is this guy around, whose book with the name of the film has been on bestseller lists for more than five years. <br /> <br /> Almost despite his appearance, Hawking determines what it means to be a conscious entity in the universe, from which, according to his observations, he will not be separated if and when the universe drips after another 10 billion years. Through all of this, in the Short History of Time, we see genius and his humility (not to mention the ten cents of his colleagues and family here and there) through the incomprehensibly hypothetical and mathematical thought process of the universe.
