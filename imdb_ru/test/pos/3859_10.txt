As a mother of 3 years and 2 years, I love AristoCats. This film has no double meanings, almost obscene words such as hell or damned, no parents who are functional idiots, and no jokes breaking the crotch or bloating that are so common even in the "best" children's films these days The storyline is sweet and interesting. The music is great. The love story is pretty romantic. Kittens are adorable, and other characters are unique and attract attention. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing. Characters are also pretty well chosen. I love to listen to the velvety voice of Eva Gabor, and there are many others who are familiar from childhood and are also well suited to characters. This is really a film about love, tolerance, good manners and loyalty. Who does not want their children to be exposed to these values? This is a film that I don’t mind watching again and again, unlike Happy Feet, where I couldn’t watch it all at least once, because it was so annoying. I would like production companies to make films similar to this one.
