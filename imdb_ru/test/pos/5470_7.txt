And I would rate it higher than 7 out of 10, if not for Barbara Hershey’s serious irregular Irish accent in the title role of Madalina Mother. Unfortunately, the accent came and went, and it distracted me a little. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, William L. Petersen’s performance in the role of Joad was outstanding, he brought warmth and depth to the character, despite some periodic dialogues. Exciting and sincere, I found him very surprising in the way he captured the character. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film is quite simple: building a forgotten staircase in a church. I believe it is based on a true story, and I heard about this ladder before I watched the movie. <br /> <br /> For its time, it was a phenomenal engineering feat — a floating double helix made without nails or screws. It exists to this day, although it is now privately owned. <br /> <br /> ** Minor spoiler ** Good cast, and Barbara dies so well in all of her films, and here she doesn't disappoint. A lot of special moments. <br /> <br /> 7/10
