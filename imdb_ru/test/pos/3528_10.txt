It was a great 1981 film, in which there was a wonderful story about three men and two girls who go camping together and pass through dense forests and high mountains with a big waterfall. This group of people is confronted with the property of George Kennedy (Roy MacLean), who plays the role of the Forest Ranger and rides a white horse. Roy Macklin warns these young people that no matter where they go, there should be no place for camping, and they should return. Of course, these young people do not pay attention and continue to swim in the nude near the waterfall, play great music, dance around the fire and drink a lot of beer and wine. There is an old wooden one-room school house in which guys and guys are lit, and from that moment the film begins to become very scary. There is one case where a young girl has to climb a tree to run away from a human beast that wants her body and starts chopping down a tree to catch her. Do not miss this movie, there are a lot of things.
