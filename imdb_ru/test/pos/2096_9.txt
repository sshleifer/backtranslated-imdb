When the noble clan of Hanabus is destroyed by the Samanosuke usurping clan, the loyal servant of Cogent (June Fujimaki) escapes with his eight-year-old son of his lord Tadafumi and his daughter Kozas. They are protected by the priestess Shinobu (Otome Tsukimiya), who serves the god of the Hanabus clan, Majin, a vengeful spirit, imprisoned in a gigantic figure carved on the slope of a local mountain. Ten years later, Kogenta and Tadafumi (Yoshihiko Aoyama) are trying to take revenge on Lord Samanosuke (Yutaro Gomi), but are captured and are trying to die. The priestess Shinobu, desperately trying to save her master, threatens Samanosuke with God's displeasure, but they kill her for it. Samanosuke, a conceited, cruel, narrow man, orders the destruction of the statue of Magin in order to destroy the last remnants of hope among the remaining supporters of Hanabus. But the god Magin, who until now was inexorably silent, has other ideas ... <br /> <br /> Dymadzhin - an exciting, eternal, deeply exciting tale. Generously filmed on a respectable budget, this is a film about values: values ​​of nobility, justice, decency, loyalty, self-sacrifice and love. We are talking about the hierarchy and rules, as well as the consequences of failure to fulfill the responsibility that the rule entails. These are things that are little talked about in our demotic times, with the exception of written toads, such as William Bennet, but, nevertheless, they are relevant, and Dymadzhin shows us why. <br /> <br /> Daimajin is a great example of why Japanese cinema is so great. The above values ​​are significant for those involved in this film, as well as for many Japanese directors. There is no word, no condescension, no irony. Instead, genuine attempts are being made to create a world in which these values ​​can find life again, and show what happens when they fall into decay. Just compare Daimajin, or the Lone Wolf and Cub series, or any Kurosawa film with the nihilistic nihilistic Kill Bill Tarantino, in order to understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> In the film, whose talent is so homogeneous excellent, I just would like to mention the magnificent score of master Akira Ifikuba, the talent and beauty of actors June Fujimaki, Yoshihiko Aoyama and Mivi Takada; and a terrific image from Ц Tsukimiya. Her death scene is one of the most exciting and significant that I have ever seen.
