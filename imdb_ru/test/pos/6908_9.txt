I went to see Glenn McQuide's film “I Sell the Dead” in its North American premiere at the Toronto Film Festival after Darkness. Seeing that this was the second show in the world, I did not quite know what to expect from this film, especially since I did not see the short film that inspired me to adapt the large screen. <br /> <br /> I will start with a slightly more complicated plot, without distributing spoilers. <br /> <br /> This film is about Arthur Blake, about how he became a grave robber, and about interesting and supernatural discoveries discovered by him and his mentor. <br /> <br /> The costume and set design in this film were excellent. I was amazed to learn that the entire film was shot in and around New York. The costumes were very accurate in time, and it really helped you as a spectator to think about time. This film works as well as a plot program, like a horror comedy. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the two characters was very smooth. They played with each other, acting lightly. The dialogue between them was very well written, Glenn added his comedic touches even in tense situations. <br /> <br /> The story is very exciting, and the ball is rolling from the start. I would compare it with a visual page turning, always wondering what will happen next. The characters themselves are very bright and unique, adding different emotional layers to the film itself. <br /> <br /> In general, I recommend this film to anyone tuned in to some dark humor, with a bit of mixed horror inches. <br /> <br /> 9/10
