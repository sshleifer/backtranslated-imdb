A strange but acceptable comedy with a mafia in which an FBI undercover agent (Matthew Modin) flirts with a worried widow of a gangster (Michelle Pfeffier) ​​to associate the two murders with an elusive mafia boss (Dean Stockwell). <br /> <br /> The film shows that this should not go beyond just for fun, and director Jonathan Demme (“The Silence of the Lambs”, “Philadelphia”) does not make the film look as if it is being held back. This is good, and it also avoids predictability.
