One of my favorite non-MGM musicals is a classic!> Rita Hayworth is in great shape, her beauty jumps out of the screen. Gene Kelly demonstrates his dancing skills and presents his sharp and innovative choreography to musicals, which over time will change the musical as a choreographer. Phil Silvers is the perfect second bananas, and Eva Arden introduces this film with lots of class. <br /> <br /> The structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why, in this era, when the main Broadway shows come from films, the cover girl was not adapted to the theater.
