I would give this TV series 10 plus if I could. The screenwriters were "smack," and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show. These characters were so real. It can be said that from the two main actresses, Miss Toussaint and Miss Potts, their relationship on camera and outside was genuine. This is not over when you hear the familiar words “Cut” at the end of “Take”. Shaw thought a lot about life, for example. Historical struggles, tragedies and triumphs, relationships, everyday situations, in every household the same situations, no matter who they are, really came down to being just a wonderful family show, which you can just sit on Your sofa in the living room and tell yourself: "Now, what did I learn from this particular episode?" <br /> <br /> I have to say that I recorded most of the episodes and found myself watching them again and again. /> <br /> Now you know why I gave him 10+ !!
