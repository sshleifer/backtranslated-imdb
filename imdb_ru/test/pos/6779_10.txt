The game was made in 1996, but still good today. the graphics are not so hot, and the actors are not Oscar worthy, but the plot is twisted, devilish and very pleasant. The dark story is irresistible from the first film and continues throughout the play. We played together several people for several reasons: 1) to use all our thoughts together. 2) do not be afraid. <br /> <br /> Play this game and you will not regret it, just donâ€™t try to find an earthquake engine there.
