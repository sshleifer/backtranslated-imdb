The opening night for the South Asian International Film Festival (SAIFF) in New York was an event that many of us have been waiting for. <br /> <br /> Can I finally see the Hari Om ?? I'm sick of watching the “promo” on the loop, and the long-lasting taste of Angel Nitin Souchni's song in the promo made me beg to hear everything else. I was impressed with the visual effects ?? and it is incredibly curious how a stern-looking auto rickshaw driver will win the hearts of a stunning, sophisticated French tourist! I remember being quite intrigued by the topic when I read one or two lines about it in the newspapers, a long time ago! Especially since I personally was very fascinated a few years ago by how bright the rickshaws in Jodhpur were! The snow and the crowd outside the theater only increased my anxiety. <br /> <br /> Once inside the theater, I discovered that the organizers of SAIFF only presented a catastrophe. I was uncomfortable and embarrassed by how poorly the event was organized, and I found myself in a difficult position trying to explain and offer excuses to my friends (from different countries), whom I invited to the list of VIP guests. I was hoping to prove to them that Indian cinema is not always about Bollywood? Finally and finally, the film began to give us fresh air. Or did I think so ?? Hari ohm ?? It began with chaos and noise. Auto rickshaws, beeps, traffic jams and lots of chaos I caught myself smiling when I felt a feeling of “home” arising inside me. <br /> <br /> So the journey of Hari Om began ?? auto rickshaw driver in Jaipur ?? The director could not make the best casting with this character. From monsoon wedding to hari ohm ?? Vijay Raaz, despite his appearance, who is not a hero, wears this film solely because of his acting skills and his character, full of all the nuances of a rickshaw driver in Rajasthan. He is a complete winner. But how and where he learned to speak English even so fluently, the question! However, his character depicts beautiful shades of humor and sensitivity. I love his innocent image of a simple guy from the village ?? Who has high hopes of ever being known ?? and yet knows when to break away from reality. <br /> <br /> Camilla, on the other hand, enters the film in a dress that NEVER dares to wear in such a place. It is funny, however, that no one seems to care too much about her, dressed like that. Although she looks very dazzling! Especially in the second half of the film, when she dresses up in Indian outfit. However, her relationship with her boyfriend seems very vague. This probably adds some kind of relationship to reality. <br /> <br /> Does the film introduce us to the most beautiful parts of Rajasthan ?? The surprising point is that in none of the places was nothing depicted except what they REALLY are. Do you see dirt, do you see primitive houses ?? you see Rajasthan just the way it is !! Still ?? is there only one adjective with which it leaves you ?? 'nice'. <br /> <br /> This is the first director who probably knows how to portray India exactly as it is - with mud, noise and all the negatives to which India is tied! Nevertheless, it looks like one of the most beautiful places. <br /> <br /> Kudos! him for that. <br /> <br /> The only drawback of the film that I could see is the pace ?? I found it rather slowly in certain parts ?? but rest assured, you will never be bored. <br /> <br /> Background points of Nitin Souhne add a cool international, but very Indian flavor to the film. The song "Angel", which plays at a very important moment in the film, is perfectly combined with visual effects. <br /> <br /> I also heard that, apart from the main characters, all the other actors are actually just normal people who have never encountered the camera before! This is commendable, given that most of our so-called reputable actors ?? I still can not portray realistic characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> In general, watching this movie was a wonderful experience ?? This is a stream of emotions. Does he have a romance, humor ?? realism?? beautiful visuals and locations ... great music, great cast? PACKAGE OFFER! When I left the theater - I was proud to be an Indian ?? A few days later I asked one of my Bulgarian friends who watched the movie with me, did he want to see another Indian movie? and his answer was ?? “Is it better than Hari Om? If so, then I will go ... if not, I think I will give up. From now on, Hari Om will be the benchmark for every Indian film that I see. ” Mr. Bala, are you reading?
