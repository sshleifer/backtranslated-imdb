This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in the history of cinema. Having seen this film, we can only retrospectively see that world cinema in the 1950s had such a purely humanistic drama, such a strong and adequate use of sound image editing and almost religious admiration for ethical choices in human life. Cinema was then not only one kind of art. It was much higher than ordinary life, and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war. They say that even Picasso was touched and cried that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years! The audience of that time was also different. I read that after watching Kurosawa's Ikiru (Live), in its first release, the young couple quietly said to each other: “This is a good movie, isn't it?”. I think that modern cinema, although technically developed and opened up some new narrative perspective, has lost the most important thing - the support of the audience. At one time, Siena was truly the most popular art and, unlike modern visual art and contemporary music, millions of people gave hope and ideals. From this point of view, “The Cranes Are Flying” should be in the pantheon of the classics of all time, such as “City of Light”, “Iquira” and “La Strada”.
