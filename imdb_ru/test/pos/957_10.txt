I have to admit that I really liked this movie. Of course, I'm sure you know that the star of "Malcolm in the middle" Frankie Muniz and the very sweet Amanda Bynes "The Amanda Show" appeared in this children's comedy as two friends, and I am sure that we can all last about the boy Jason Shepard (Frankie) and his friend Kaylee (Amanda), who goes on an adventure in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Ahead of spoilers <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, Jason is a typical 14-year-old boy who lies to get around everyday life problems. One day Jason was hit by Mr. Wolf (a big bad director). Jason's English newspaper is stolen by Wolf and begins an adventure with Kaylee to regain his father’s trust They fly to Hollywood in search of the Wolf to bring him back. Frankie and Amanda do various crazy stunts to get Wolf back, and all he needs to do is call Jason's father and tell him that he stole his idea. But the end is not a real surprise, as they are good provocateurs and victories. <br /> <br /> Story story with humor in fifth grade, but what you expect is a PG rating. I truly believe that this is one of the best family comedies of the year. Not only are the children playing great, great casting, well written, but it’s nice pure pleasure. It made me laugh and fall in love with this innocent message. I highly recommend this and would like to disagree with the one who gave this zero out of ten. An unemployed critic is not unemployed for nothing. I give it (well, I voted for ten out of ten) perfect.
