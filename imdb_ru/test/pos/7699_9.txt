A well-made melodrama telling the story of Sally, a tomboy dancer in a circus raised by a participant in the McGargl show (played by WC Fields), his cylinder, little mustaches, checkered pants and the skill of a juggler, pickpocket and runner carnival games like "Three Cards" and "Old shell". McGargl raised Sally, who has worshiped him as her “real father” since Sally's mother died (driven out of the house by her father, a judge when she married a circus man) and left Sally orphaned. Sally is furious and loyal to McGarleg, no matter what he aspires to - but McGarl seems to feel a little guilty because she has been in a circus for all these years, and not in her own family. When they end up performing at a carnival in the city where her rich grandparents live, McGargl uses the opportunity to “explore” the real Sally family with the idea that he can return her to them. But the grandfather, the judge, does not immediately love Sally, because he does not like the “show-girl” - what a stern, limited person he is, a real piece of this guy's work! Meanwhile, Sally is busy pursuing her as a beautiful and rich young man, the son of a man who helped his grandfather to get his wealth. <br /> <br /> This is a very good film, where there is some laughter here and there and a strange editing style (I don’t know how to describe it, except that it shows long frames, then it bounces back for a few seconds or suddenly changes the angle when displaying a close-up). Carol Dempster, who plays Sally, is amazing here - pretty cute and funny in her performance. RESTROOM. Fields, even without his famous voice, is very funny - just the way he moves, and his funny, comical reactions to things (like a small dog seen in one funny scene), we even see how he juggles a little in it. I love those who look into the old-fashioned circus and carnival that show here. The imprint of this film on DVD looks very beautiful, slightly colored in sepia, and the score for the piano is really excellent, performed by Philip Carly based on the original test sheets.
