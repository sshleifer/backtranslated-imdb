“Dolemit” is a film about the blasting of Dolemite and his army of female kungfu assassins led by Queen Bee. He fights to get his Total Experience Club back from Willy Green, using their kung fu abilities and their loyalty to him. I liked this film because of the witty dialogue, and also because of the ability of Rudi Ray Moore to preach to his brothers in rhyme.
