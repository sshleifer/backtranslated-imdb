This is a "reworked" presentation of Riverdance, organized in the Radio City concert hall in New York. Of the three Irish "dance" musicals that I watched in the mid to late 90s (including the first "Riverdance" and "Lord of the Dance"), I liked this one the most. <br /> <br /> I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more diverse and colorful scene, and he excluded two by unit from this original, which from the start was not good. It's just a very solid show with a few weak points. To be sure, there are some songs / dances that are just “honest”, but none of them are bad, which is surprising, considering that there are only 20 rooms. <br /> <br /> The cast is similar to the first Riverdance with the main exception of Colin Dunn, replacing Michael Flatley as a dancer. Both are extremely talented. The main difference may be in their appearance with Dunn, a small, black-haired guy with goat beards, while Flatly is a clean-shaven blond. I prefer Dunn, because Flatley's ego is so big that it sometimes annoys. The female leader, Jean Butler, fortunately, is still here and it is pleasant to observe: what a graceful beauty and talent! Butler and the rest of these women have the best legs I've ever seen in dancers. I also liked the dance of Maria Page, a Spanish flamenco performer, and two guys: Daniel B. Wooten and Ivan Thomas. One number - with these two couples against Dunn and two other dancers - 0 is called “Tap-teps”, and watching it is amazingly fun, maybe the highlight of the whole show. I also have no complaints about violinist Eileen Ivers. <br /> <br /> “Fast” Irish songs here I liked the most. I appreciated that the audience did not prevent the performance with shouts and shouts, as women do in the video "Lord Of The Dance".
