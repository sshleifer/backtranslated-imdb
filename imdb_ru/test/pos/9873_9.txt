This movie is pretty good, but the unreleased Production Film is my favorite movie in the series after the original. Jamieâ€™s story is treated differently, the scenes of death are 10 times better, there is more ritual-type material that gives more stories about Michael, Jamie and her child. There is also an alternative ending, which is also better. Why they have not released this version, I have no clue. If you can find this version, look it up.
