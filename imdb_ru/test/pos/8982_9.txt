Mike Nichols is in great shape. I was not a fan of "Closer," so it's nice to see him again at the top of this comedy in the darkest of circumstances. Only one glimpse in tone could ruin this convincing picture, but Nichols and his very strong cast were never mistaken in this biographical picture of a deeply spoiled, but completely convincing congressman. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman as the Ordinary - brilliant and brilliant - here plays a spoiled but ultra-smart CIA manipulator, and this happens in exchanges between the characters of Hanks and Hoffman, where comedy is in the air. Rarely is this funny, humorous and loud laughter in a film ... This sometimes hits a sharp satirical edge that makes you laugh and cry about the state of the world (often at the same time). <br /> <br /> Another important plus is the length of the picture. The film is based on the thick book of George Creel with the same title. The temptation for screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (his claim to fame - “The Western Wing”) must have been to make a thick film, but we get an exciting 90-plus minutes of remarkable history with broad consequences. <br /> <br /> This film deserves to be seen and recognized for having found an extraordinary balance between the darkest of the dark subjects and the ease of touching his sparkling witty scenario - even if he broke the obvious link between the help Herring and Wilson will provide the final consequences (9/11).
