Spoiler Alert I worked as an extra on this movie Lifetime TV (filmed in Seattle). This is really interesting when you take part in making a film, because usually they are still in the process of writing parts (as they did here) or making changes to editing and major changes from the final parts. <Br /> <br /> My husband and I worked in this film as extras, and I remember how they discussed on the set, how it remains to be determined whether the little girl will die in the end. Honestly, I never thought that Margaret Colinâ€™s character would actually receive adequate punishment for her hijacking crime, police lies, concealment, etc. Could you please imagine how the final would have changed if she had ended up killing him? the victim instead of eventually ending her coma well? Just something to think about. <br /> <br /> By the way, I play a police detective who can be seen for a split second, and my husband plays another detective you can see quite often (we counted four times). Margaret Colin was remarkable in work and very mundane, although Lisa Vidal (now a permanent person for life) was on the sidelines. <br /> <br /> In general, the film turned out to be around 7/10, but, like another Poster commented, it is still a real jerk and makes an excellent Saturday afternoon.
