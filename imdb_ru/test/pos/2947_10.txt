Fantastic documentary. The film in the film. I am so glad that Block is forged after the death of his mother. Makes you think about the time and money spent on therapy. What could happen if she didn't have that outlet? Did the therapist help her or just raise the addiction that kept his bank account on the same level? The audience should understand that in those days divorce was less preferable. She was a housewife â€” she went to therapy, not to college or for vocational training. She seemed to feel trapped in the situation. I wonder if the therapist has ever tried to make her think about what she could do to change her situation and free herself? Meanwhile, wife number 2 was just the opposite. She was there, working with his father; finished her bad marriage, supported herself and, it seems, a very confident, giving person. Regardless of the state of marriage, the blocks did something right, having raised 3 children who could look at the history of their parents, be fine with her and share it with us and possibly encourage us to start a conversation with our parents and spouses.
