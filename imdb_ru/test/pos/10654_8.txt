It was amazing that a silent film could be seen so easily. The economy from which it was edited, and the very structure of the films are the main elements contributing to this. <br /> <br /> The film truly reflects the spirit of the revolution with which it deals - you really sympathize with sailors and citizens. Of course, this film has its own agenda, but since this is almost a superfluous reason, it can be viewed as part of the entertainment in a much clearer sense. <br /> <br /> The voltage on the screen is excellent - starting from the battleship itself, and then moving to the mainland. Things are sharpened by the truth, and for the film of his era, this is really quite unshakable in revealing the victims made by the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s really worth going through (that is, if you can adjust your modern viewing habits within 90 minutes).
