There is not so much that comes close to the ideal pace of storytelling and tense action-packed levels, like "GoldenEye." When it came out, it was the greatest game of all time, and even today it remains strong. <br /> <br /> I admit that this game became boring after several months of playing, and not playing it again until two years later I returned to its best level, almost as if I had played it for the first time. <br /> <br /> There are 20 action-packed levels, which is probably the most James Bond game to date. Probably the most memorable is the level of Tank, which was probably the most explosive sequence of video games at the time. And shooting from the first person, as well as using Q gadgets, is something that James Bond fans always want to use. <br /> <br /> Honestly, as a James Bond fan, I am looking for aspects of the real James Bond experience. which now appear in PS2 games. So this game, although it has great action and useful gadgets, I expected a little more, even in 1997. I also did not like that in this game there was no Q or M, or Moneypenny, or any of MI6. While watching movies, Bond interacts with these characters at least several times in each movie, but they are nowhere to be seen in this game. And the voice dialogue would make the game more lively than the text dialogue they used. They had the technology. They just did not use it. <br /> <br /> Probably the most annoying feature of this game is that in some respects it exactly repeats the plot of the film, while in others it is not related. For example, there are two levels where you have to protect or save Natalia, although in the film she can take care of herself. There are also several unnecessary levels, for example the “Boat” level, where you need to defuse some bombs (which is not in the film), which adds nothing to the storyline. There are even several levels where you save Natalia, but at the beginning of the next level she is captured again. How? <br /> <br /> Oh well. Even these little things can not really omit this game. And although I prefer new games, this experience of Bond is definitely one that you will not forget. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
