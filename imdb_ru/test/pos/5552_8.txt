Brine was the most underrated film of the decade. Despite all my homework efforts, this is still considered a bad movie. I say, damn it, with everyone on this. Everyone does not understand that this is partly a comedy with a dramatic twist at the end. Danny Aiello plays the burned-down director with perfection and is conveyed by a sad depressed person. the scene when he tries to record the last message is pretty good. The interlude of the Stones film is absolutely ridiculous. "This is Harry Stone, and today I became a man!" In the whole beautiful and sadly misunderstood film. Plus a great cameo from Little Richard. Fun! I hope that more people will see this film, because 202 people are not enough for consensus. <br /> <br /> -Silence Dogood
