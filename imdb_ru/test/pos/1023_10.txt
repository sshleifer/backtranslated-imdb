Although I don’t like cricket at all, and I saw this film 13 years ago, I still think this is one of the best films for coming of age. I remember that day when I returned home from school and sat down for lunch, I saw the first titles of this film, and then ... I was so immersed in it that I felt that I was there, it really affected me personally. I still remember how I felt when I first saw it, I felt that the poor boy was my friend, experiencing the same teenage experience that we had in those days. what I really liked about this film is the main theme of the “shy” boy who dreams of the “kiss” of the girl of his dreams, no offense, but if it was an American film, you would surely see - at some point, mainly the culmination is a “shy” boy, “making love” with his girlfriend, and I still cannot understand these contradictory concepts ... I have a simple request if anyone knows how to burn this film on DVD by mail, please let me know because i need a poppo shot minanii .. Thank you
