I saw this movie in my local cable system called “Outside Foreclosure”. I was looking for new material to watch, since most of the repetitions on Saturday morning did not interest me. I have always been a fan of Andrew McCarthy and Michael Ironside, so I chose this film. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Personally, I liked the movie. Rich Rousse, who posted a comment that the film was spoiled for him by seeing scenes from the film on the back of the rental box, is completely justified. I was not disappointed if I found out anything about the film in advance. This made me rate the movie above the average on the page. <br /> <br /> I like unknown films, and this film is no exception. The film made me guess until the very end. I was surprised by the finale! <br /> <br /> Moments of reflection and memories of the past experiences of the main character during the film only added uncertainty. His reaction to these memories gave the film a sense of a humanitarian, but conflicting, side of police work. Fighting his faith is also a nice addition. <br /> <br /> If you like films with uncertainty, but also films that reveal the character's feelings, his personal inclination, this film is for you. <br /> <br /> If you find this film in the local cable or satellite guide, watch it! <br /> <br /> However, if you are looking for a rental video, follow Rich Rosing’s advice and ask someone to get a video. for you before watching this.
