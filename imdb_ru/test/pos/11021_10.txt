This film is really worth seeing - Robin Tunney is great, and Henry Thomas proves that he is one of those rarities, a children's “actor” who grew up to become a real actor. The characters are perfectly traced, and in the hands of others because of their depth, they could be unconvincing - but all the actors are simply amazing. The cast of this film should be in the same place as in the film Girl Interrupted (both films, by coincidence, were shot in the brilliant Clea Duval). Musical scores and musical compositions are ideally suited to each other, and there is a lot of action so that the film does not become just a study of the characters. If you want a story, you will not find it in this review, but I will say that the climax will haunt you for a long time.
