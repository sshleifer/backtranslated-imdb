I thoroughly enjoyed it, made for a television movie. I surfed the channel and came across the beginning of the movie. Boy, I'm glad I stopped. There is a real hot cast in this film, as well as an unlikely plot. There is a drama, comedy, an action movie, and, best of all, the human nature of this film makes it great. I hope this will be released on video, because I will buy a copy. Rating ... 9 out of 10 stars
