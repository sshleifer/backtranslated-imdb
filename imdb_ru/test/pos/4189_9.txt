I can not believe that this is not a huge cult strike. Perhaps people in 1968, thinking of the Monkees as a stupid factory pop group, mean to Beatles, refused to see it. Since then, this cynicism probably kept him out of sight. Do not make this mistake. _Head_ is an amazing film that most open-minded people will appreciate. It is very funny and very clever (and very tripo).
