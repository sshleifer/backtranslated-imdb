The 2005 edition of Royal Rumble was broadcast live from Save Mart in Fresno, California. The two main WWE Championships defended, the Undertaker battled Heidenreich in the Boxes match, Sean Michaels took Edge in the offense match that was built since October last year and, of course, everyone won for himself the Royal Rumble rope fits himself. Who was going to take the price this year? Chris Benoit? Edge? Eddie Guerrero? Edge? John Cena? Batiste? Edge? Sean Michaels? There was no shortage of rivals. <br /> <br /> It was Batista who won the people's victory in the battle for the main event, but not without contradictions, or, I would say, an unsuccessful finish. Batista and John Cena were the last two men in the ring. Batista had to quit a young Smackdown! the star over the top rope, but everything went wrong, and they both fell to the floor. The judges acted on their feet, since in 1994 we had a hand raising competition, similar to the Bret Hart and Lex Luger competitions. This led to the appearance of the chairman of the board of directors. Winnie Mac went down to the ring as much as he could, but he was hurt badly when he got into the ring. It was unusual to see Vince McMahon sitting down and telling the two men to resume the match. Then Batista did what he had to do for the first time, and threw Sinah onto the floor, closing his future with the title match for WrestleMania 21. <br /> <br /> This year’s undercard Royal Rumble had a very strong line up many of the biggest WWE stars competing in matches. Each brand had two big matches. <br /> <br /> Raws opened the evening with a match of Sean Michaels and Edge. It was a good technical competition. Back and fourth completely, until Edge got a mistake. It was a sensible decision on reservations, and Edge remained a contender for participating in the world heavyweight championship. <br /> <br /> The final match of the evening was the final match between the Undertaker Undertaker and Heidenreich. The match was not a classic, but again, were there any classic matches in the box? It was interesting. Especially when Snitsky intervened, and then Kane jumped out of the coffin for great popularity. The Undertaker did not surprise anyone when he won, slamming the lid on Heidenreich and this mediocre enmity. <br /> <br /> The first of two championship matches overnight was John Bradshaw Leyfields, who defended the WWE championship in the triple threat of a match against Kurt Angle and the Big Show. This match was very good. Again, not classic, but nonetheless interesting. JBL took the win after pinning Kurt Angle. However, his celebration was not long, but behind the scenes Teddy Long told him that in “No way out” he would defend the WWE championship in a match in a cage of barbed wire with the Big Show. Not a good way to spend a Sunday night. <br /> <br /> And, of course, without the Punch there is no show. The hit, of course, was the reigning world heavyweight champion Triple H. His rematch with Unforgiven 2004 with Randy Orton was much better than the original fight. It’s a pity, because they just don’t seem to snap into the ring, and that would be a good enemy if they did. Orton played a great role as a brain concussion and was defeated in the game. <br /> <br /> So, the first major tournament of 2005 was successful. He achieved his goals. The feud ended and new ones began. Now we were officially on our way to WrestleMania 21.
