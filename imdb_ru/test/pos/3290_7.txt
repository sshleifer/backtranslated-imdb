Brian (Wesley Ure) works in a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bane). Norton is in financial difficulties because, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who sells secrets to the owner of a rival firm (Jim Bacchus). This is not Brian, as he is a loyal and loyal worker and a good inventor. But Mr. Norton has no patience for Brian, partly because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli), has something that Brian and Norton are asking about Brian’s motives for caring for her. However, Brian came up with a great safety device. It is called CHOMPS, which means home security system for dogs. A dog-like device is actually a computer-controlled animal that can knock down walls and make siren sounds to capture burglars. The rival owner sends two spies (one of them is Red Buttons) to learn the details of the new invention. Will CHOMPS save Norton? This is a fun family movie from the old school of good, clean entertainment. ChOMPS, of course, is a real dog, played by the charming and talented Benji. In fact, Benji has a duel role, since Brian also has a "real" dog named Cheater. Just watching this little dog in action is pure joy, as he can climb the walls, “pull” the trucks and control the buttons of the car to catch the bad guys. The human cast is also pretty good, with everyone who gives optimistic performances that are infectious. Costumes, decorations and production values ​​are also good. Although you may have trouble finding a movie, it will be well worth the effort to provide viewing for your loved ones. CHOMPS is a wonderful, useful distraction from the world's ills.
