I saw this movie last night in Fillet. Film Festival. It was an interesting and funny film, in which there were charming and touching scenes. Peter Falk was superb, like the rest of the cast. They were believable and played their roles well. The film may have been a bit long, and the conclusion was in order. The audience laughed at the right places. The family dynamic was amazing, and although it was a Jewish family, they could be Italians, Irish, or any other, including Greeks. I recommend this movie if you are interested in laughing at a topic that is not so often addressed. IOT makes you think about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people in your life and those who are not entirely in your life.
