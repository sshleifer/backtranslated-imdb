One Life Stand is the perfect part of filmmaking that has not received due respect. His IMDB rating of 1.7 does not justify itself and, perhaps, is due to a very small number of views, and not the quality of the film itself. A film shot digitally in black and white looks good with production values ​​that fit its limited budget. The performances are great, especially with Gary Lewis, who gets better with every role. My only criticism is that it is a bit long, and it could be done with a little more humor to make up for the darker moments. Overall, however, this is a good job.
