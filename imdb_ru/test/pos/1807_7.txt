There were a lot of stupid teenagers making sex movies of the 80s, and a lot of fraudulent clicks, but there was only a handful created with a thought that made you laugh and captured the right period of time; it was one of them. Cage - Hillarius, as well as Foreman, who, because of her biography, disappeared from the Hollywood spotlight. I would like it to be released on DVD in a special version with comments by Cage and Foreman. Wishful thinking, I know. Ever want to plan a real 80s movie weekend, rent a Sure Thing, 16 candles and a breakfast club. This will take you back to the “Full Rada” of time, which, as it seemed at the time, was much easier. Studio memo: it's time to release a DVD!
