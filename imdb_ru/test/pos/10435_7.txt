I see that there are already good reviews of this film, I have a few points to comment on, the reasons why I thought there was something special about this film ... <br /> <br /> firstly , the film is realistic. to an adult who has forgotten what it feels like to be a teenager, this may seem unreal, but this is indeed the superdrama that is constantly evolving among teenagers. secondly, a good guy, a guy who treats women with respect, does not understand girls. so it is, in real life exactly the same! he is too good for his own good. people are just selfish third, it was nice to see a fat guy who was confident in himself. I mean, this role is already trustworthy from the actor, I'm not just talking about the character. Overall, I thought the film was a positive surprise, which is secretly hidden among stupid, funny sex comedies on a removable shelf. don't get me wrong, it's not all sad, it's a good laugh too.
