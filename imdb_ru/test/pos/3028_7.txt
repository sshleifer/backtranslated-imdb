Style over substance. But what is this style. The Cell is the internal version of most serial killer films. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visual effects. <br /> <br /> Psychotherapist Catherine Dean (J-Lo) comes to the dreams of his patients through artificial means to discover and help them overcome their phobias and obsessive ideas. A new patient who has fallen into a coma has been brought to her notice by the FBI. He is a serial killer who drowns his female victims, and then presents their bodies in grotesque scenarios, such as mannequins. Dean must enter the mind of a murderer and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his last victim. <br /> <br /> Directed by Tarsem Singh has incredible visions and prepares plays for this production. Each sequence of dreams is like a painting of a nightmare in motion, from landscapes to costumes. <br /> <br /> But the plot suffers from a lack of history of its characters. Stargher is the only person with full experience, and he is the last person you want to take care of. Without it, you basically have a movie that moves only in the present tense, and thatâ€™s a shame, because the movie is so visually stunning and really scary. Lopez is wasted, but she is not as amazing as an actress, although she is more gorgeous than ever. And Vince Vaughn? I don't even know why he was chosen. This is not his forte, and he overplays. He tried too hard to be his character, and it manifested. Stick comedy, Vince! Despite this, this film is so visually frightening, I still watch this film with the lights on and can never fall asleep right after that.
