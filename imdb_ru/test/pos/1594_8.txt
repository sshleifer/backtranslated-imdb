ATTENTION: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that from time to time this film moved rather slowly, the brilliant scenery, the richness of the characters and the powerful themes make Morte a Venezia a rewarding experience. I did not read the book by Thomas Mann, but I’m sure that Visconti’s visual magnificence, musical accompaniment and powerful memories of conflict and desire should do it right. <br /> <br /> Gustav von Aschenbach’s study hints at a person’s desire to rationalize and quantify our emotions, behavior and passion. This trend is demonstrated on stage in Germany between Alfred and Gustav, when Alfred describes music as mathematical, that is. quantitatively and emotionally. This conflict arises again in the scene when young Tadzio alone plays “Fuer Eliza” in the hotel’s lobby, and Gustav recalls his visit to the brothel, where he is drawn to a prostitute who plays the same song. In his memory, paying a prostitute, Gustav is clearly physically embraced by the consequences of his actions. This reaction serves as a reminder of the moral reaction to the temptations that Tajo represents. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Gustav is forced to take the most important decision: to stay in Venice and come to terms with his lust and temptations? Or flee Venice to save your life? His early attempt to escape from Venice at the station led to futility and foreshadows the result of the extension of his stay. <br /> <br /> In addition to the thrilling interaction of the characters, the powerful landscapes of the Visconti (especially Venice at dawn and the final scene), Tadzio, going into the water and pointing to the horizon, turns this film into a real masterpiece.
