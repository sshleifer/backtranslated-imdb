The film begins with the director talking to the camera and saying that he is going to show the story of Brazilian street children, whose families live in poverty and have to be stolen and killed in order to survive. In fact, the main character (Pixote) played a real street child, who is only 11 years old. What follows was one of the most brutal, depressing, and terrifying films I've ever seen. I saw it about 17 years ago (double counting with Black Orpheus) and never forgot it. I don't think I ever want to see it again - it was too much. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD !!!! The scene that will not leave me is when Pixot meets a prostitute who is forced to interrupt her own fruit. You do not see how she does it ... but you quickly look at what she received. Almost 20 years have passed, and one memory of this scene upsets me. SPOILER END !!!!! <br /> <br /> The film is becoming more violent, as it ends and ends only as it can. What is even more scary is that such stories really happened in Brazil in 1981 ... and they still happen today. <br /> <br /> A terrible, cruel movie ... but it's worth seeing if you can handle it, I'm surprised that I got an R rating - I saw an X-rated movie that is less visual. And 10.
