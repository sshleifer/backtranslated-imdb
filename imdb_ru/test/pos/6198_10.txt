I'm not sure how this could be better, so I gave him 10. The game was excellent - the main woman was such a HOT - the guy who played Darwin was a smoldering, brooding character who showed the inner turmoil he suffered truck - one of the examples) excellent. The storyline was believable, and the length of the series was almost correct (that is, I love Lost, but will it ever end?). As a Brit, I tend to think of Yankee as fanatical. The LAPD were in their rash attempts to arrest him, but other agencies were portrayed favorably. My main idea about such programs (as well as about excellent 24) - can this happen? Would this happen? Is this happening now? Probably, probably. <br /> <br /> I hope they make another series, but after reading some previous comments, this will not be the case. <br /> <br /> To summarize - If you haven't seen it yet, make sure you do.
