Ahhh, 1984 ... I was young and stupid, and I just got a taste for these exotic cigarettes when I lived in a squat on the Moss side of Manchester with the most incredible case of cockroach infection. <br /> <br /> After a few of these fools, this show was the material of ROTFLMAO - I was an avid fan. Then I look at the floor (or the walls, or somewhere else) and see my own collection of “little armadillos” running around. <br /> <br /> Not sure if this chemical was an improvement, but I remember how at that time I thought that the show’s surrealism was fantastic - it was my second favorite thing on television at the time (# 1 was the season Luis Bunuel’s films shown on channel 4). Radical art lives! <br /> <br /> You need this melody too! .... I swear I will never drink again ....
