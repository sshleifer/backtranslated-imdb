It is a masterpiece. “Big Nyunka” is a crazy, strange, funny and, in the end, touching look at the old couple and their quiet life, who argue because of sawing and scratching, when nuclear war rages outside. Everything in this gorgeous animated short film stands out as memorable: the wife’s stunner’s spectacle, the vacuum cleaner, the husband’s keen fetish (watch this background!) memorable finale. I'm so glad I found “The Big Snit,” which is one of the greatest pieces of film ever made.
