Catherine Braillat is a French director who likes to provoke her audience. She takes us with her to witness how the film is made on the spot. The film in production seems to be based on it, because in the center of the plot is Jeanne, a female director, very much like Miss Brailat. Zhanna acts as an alter ego of a real director. <br /> <br /> Jeanne comes to a standstill at the beginning of filming. Not only did she choose the wrong time to photograph this film during the cold period, as it has beach spots that are clearly too cold for actors and extras. Jeanne has problems with two main actors, especially a man who has problems accepting how the director decided to show him in the film; the lead actress is also not an angel. <br /> <br /> Film production, says Ms. Brailat, is a process unparalleled in creativity. First, there is a writing period in which, in this case, Jeanne wrote the script, which, when it goes into production, reveals problems that the writer / director did not think about. There is a problem in how she wants to photograph a love scene in which a young woman tells her first sexual contact. What looked clever on the written page does not necessarily mean that there is a difficult time in front of the camera. The actor is forced to wear a fake penis, and he has a lot of problems if he accepts the fact that makeup should touch him like he never thought another man would touch him. <br /> <br /> Radiant Ann Pario is amazing, like Jeanne, the director. She makes observations about the play, the actors and the film crew, which fit in well with the story being told. Gregoire Colin and Roxana Meskid play the main actors with all the uncertainty that some actors bring to the set. Jeanne must massage their ego to get what she wants at the end. Ashley Vaninger plays Leo, Jeanne's assistant. <br /> <br /> “Sex comedy” allows Miss Braye to give us her own insight into films in general. This is a great look at how films are made in the typical Braille style.
