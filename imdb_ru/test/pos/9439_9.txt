What is the most brutal film of all time? Rambo III? Commando? Robocop? Add these three very cruel ones together, and you still can’t compare with the bloody massacre in the Stabilizer, the wildest, stupid, and insane action movie I've ever seen. Within a hundred minutes, things explode, and people die in dozens of strange ways. It will make you laugh and cheer you, and when it's over, you will be more than exhausted. This film is a buried gem, a cult classic, unfortunately without a cult. <br /> <br /> The stabilizer is the nickname of our hero Peter O'Brian, a big fat man with a curly mullet. He arrives in Indonesia on the trail of the villain and the mean-spirited Greg Rainmaker. We know that he is evil because only his full name refers to him (“I hate SCUM as Greg RAINmaker!”) And uses the method of murder, which is so terrible that I can't even pronounce it here. Wait, yes, I can. He is attacking people in spiky shoes. Greg Rainmaker: Cleat Killer. <br /> <br /> When Greg Rainmaker does not pour alcohol on women for their sexual pleasure, he kidnaps important professors and heads a vast empire of the underworld. This is up to Goldson (Jewish militant? Gevalt!) And his motley team of assistants to stabilize the situation, killing everyone and blowing up a lot of things. Maybe “stabilize” has a different meaning in Indonesia. <br /> <br /> And violence, about violence. This is a film that does not want to, no, is not able to allow five minutes of screen time to pass without any explosion, knife, car accident or squib interrupting the dialogue. Violence is extreme; not graphic and bloody, just very strange. For example, The Stabilizer & intrudes into one of the Rainmaker warehouses (of course, driving through a solid concrete wall on a motorcycle). The stabilizer, being on the balcony, with strong fire from below, does the only thing it can do. He comes off the balcony at the head of a guy, his front wheel bounces off of him like a basketball. Amazing. <br /> <br /> From excessively unreasonable love scenes (both female main characters jump into a bag with the hero of their choice, not two minutes after the first time they talk to them alone) to a poorly duplicated Dialogue (“Victor, you, talented bastard! ”) There is everything in the Stabilizer. This film is for centuries, right there with Citizen Kane and Gymkata. It is not widely available in the release. If you find it anywhere at any price, buy it and enjoy the madness. <br /> <br />
