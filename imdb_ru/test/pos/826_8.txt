Like Steven Seagal, I'm also a big fan of Van Damme and have been watching most of his films since the beginning of my acting career. <br /> <br /> In this film, Van Damme plays the role of Jack Robido, a police officer who has just moved to New Mexico from New Orleans to work as part of a border patrol. In pursuit of memories of his past, it was Jack who should put an end to the group of seals of the former naval forces who smuggle illegal drugs into the United States, as a result of which his daughter died. <br /> <br /> In general, I found this film to be very good, Van Damme is in very good shape for 48 years and can really move. The scenes in the film are very intense, and the film even adds a few plot twists so that you don't guess. Unfortunately, Van Damme is not as intense as he said 10 years ago, despite the fact that Shepherd: Border Control is the third direct film that Van Damme made, possibly opening the door to a larger project. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this film to a Van Damme fan or to a militant lover in general; “Shepherd: Border Control” is a great film, not as good as “To Death”, but better than “Hard Corps”. Be sure to try, you will not be disappointed.
