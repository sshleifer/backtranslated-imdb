This is my favorite Hal Hartley movie. All his films are small jewels. I love independent films and I hope that Hal Hartley will never reach the mainstream and not sell. What if the Lord Jesus returns and falls in love with his people so much that he cannot open the last book and destroy unbelievers? It was nice to see PJ Harvey in a movie since I am a fan of her music. Do not watch it, if you are a fan of Hollywood movies, you will be disappointed.
