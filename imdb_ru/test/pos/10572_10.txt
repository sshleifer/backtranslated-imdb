I recently watched this movie and fell in love with it. I loved the storyline and the actors. Here is a bit of everything. I was completely captured by the unfolding of the story. There are so many surprises along the way. I highly recommend it. In fact, I liked it so much that I ran out and bought a book. I felt I had to read it in order to appreciate the art in writing behind the movie. I also wanted to make sure that I did not miss anything that was in the book, but was excluded from the film. I recommend that people who love the film read a book, because thereâ€™s enough difference in the book, especially in the second episode, to want to read it. This has become my favorite movie. Now I'm a fan of Sarah Waters and Elaine Cassidy!
