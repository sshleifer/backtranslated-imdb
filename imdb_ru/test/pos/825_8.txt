After 10 years, finally, we can say that our Belgian militant star is back again. Personally, I found this film even better than Wake Of Death, which makes it the best film in ... 10 years! Well, it doesn’t look like his bright years, such as Timekop, Universal Soldier, Sudden Death, or even his best effort to date: “Hard target” (one of the best action films ever created by one of best action movies by john woo). well, the story is exciting, the dialogue is rather funny, this one is better than expected. The bad guys are great, like in Hard Target, and the battle scenes are old school. Real fans know what to expect. I must say, I was disappointed in him, but Van Damme was finally back. More please....
