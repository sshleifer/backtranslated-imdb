Never, never have I been so impressed with the film as this little piece about the four groups of people who are facing a crisis, or many. In a sense, a bit like Short Cuts, but in a completely different way at the same time. <br /> <br /> There are a bunch of main characters that we all learn very well when their stories unfold, and when people show their good and their bad sides, their weaknesses and their strengths with lots of drama and laughter. <br /> <br /> I think this is the closest equivalent in the American film, which is much weaker. in all respects it is the royal tenenbaum. <br /> <br /> “Four shades of brown,” as the name implies in English, tells the story of a weary hotelier and his wife, as well as his elderly parents (who travel by magicians); about the receptionist in the crematorium of the animal and his family misadventures; about the culinary course members (who mostly talk about their miserable life) and, fourthly, about the funeral of a jockey-ryssary-knight who is trying to continue organizing a family from the afterlife, sing and appear in 3D during the funeral, thanks to high-tech equipment, which was worth all his fortune (the family gets zero, even the famous horse is not given to the family)! <br /> <br /> In this film, warmth and compassion, filled with grief and laughter, which I had never experienced before. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors were new to me, except for Robert Gustafsson and one or two others, but they all deserve the great success that the film received in the Swedish Gouldbagge. extravaganza (= Swedish Oscar) a week ago! <br /> <br /> The prize of the male, female and male actor went to this film, plus a few more for downloading! <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, go and see - the hours fly very fast!
