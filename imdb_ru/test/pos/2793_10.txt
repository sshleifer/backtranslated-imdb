I like this film (I don’t know why in England it is called “Luck in a Pot” - what nonsense, and a completely inappropriate title!) he felt just the same. This brings me back so many wonderful memories of the fun that I had with all my friends from different countries, and about the city itself. I really want to see the continuation of “Les Poupees Russes” (“Russian Dolls”), I suppose, he will not be released here? My brother saw it in France and said it was not so good, but he had the same composition (obviously Brother Wendy is getting married). Anyone know anything about this movie? and can it be released?
