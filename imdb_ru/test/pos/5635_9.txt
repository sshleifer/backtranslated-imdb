When we are young, we all choose for ourselves the ideal occupation: artist, actor, writer, rocket scientist, etc. While most of us grow out of our unrealizable dreams, the main character of the American film Mark has not yet had time to let it go ( and in thirty years with something) to become a rich recognized director. Despite the fact that Murphy's law will not leave Mark alone and something always seems to go wrong, Mark is able to persist during each deterrent incident with an even larger drive in order to achieve his goals. His desire to be a director controls his character so much that he sees any person or thing in his life as something that can be used to achieve a goal. Although I have noticed that other IMDB commentators criticize Mark's egoism, I think this is almost justified egoism, because for Mark not to become a famous director is tantamount to death. He constantly talks about leaving some mark on the world, and sees this as a way of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, any viewer of this film is early aware of the fact that Mark has zero chance of ever achieving his dream. Does he know about this? No, not in the least, and none of his family or friends wants to reveal a secret to him (in fact, even some of them believe in him). Oddly enough, but a disappointing future, which the viewer considers inevitable, because Mark does not interfere with finding humor in the film. This is a very very funny documentary. Most of the laughter comes from the fact that Mark shoots scenes for "Coven." There is a scene where an actor has to wrestle in the closet, and it just does not work. In another scene, very old Uncle Mark Bill speaks a few lines to the camera; Needless to say, after 20 doubles and stumbling, Bill finally decides that he has had enough. Great humor, unfortunately, comes from Mark himself. His script, which he seems to think worthy of Pulitzer, is ridiculously bad: "Everything is in order, everything is in order, there is something to live for, Jesus told me about it." <br /> <br /> “American cinema,” contrary to what people might think, is a documentary film that anyone can enjoy (although my sister, who watched some of the scenes, seemed to think it was completely weird). The fact that Chris Smith can successfully display a film that inspires both sadness from Mark's dull lifestyle and fun in scenes with Bill (who, unfortunately, passed away before the film was released) says a lot about him. I wonder how the dreamer Mark relates to this documentary. Does he understand that it throws him in a bad light? Or what does it set up to show him as a fool in many scenes of the film? Or does he see it as what will be shown before his own segment of the biography of A & E? This is an intriguing subject of surprise, and I hope that the last one will come true for him. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie: 9/10.
