Yes, let's deal with this before we begin: * This is the one to which Sean Connery returned in 1983 after staying with Roger Moore and me. * This is the last Connery movie. * And YES, this is a (sort of) remake of Thunderball, but more of the film is inspired by it. If all of you purists of Bond think that I will argue, you are right. “Bond” is one of the greatest films of all time, but this does not mean that the series should go on forever. This, I think, is one of two films where they could be of great benefit to themselves and put an end to the Bond saga. Still not offended? Then I will continue ... Hey, if you think that I am indifferent to Bond films, you are mistaken. I grew up with my mom, who GOING with them. At any free moment, Bond and his antics will be on TV. The rules of Bond, and “Never Say Never” (directed by Irvin “The Empire Strikes Back” Kershner) is one of the best. It may not be "Goldfinger" or "From Russia ...", and perhaps it was not done in the same production workshop as everyone else (I hear why they refuse to admit that it was ever done , but still stands head and shoulders above recent walks in Brosnan ... (if you didn’t spit on the screen, read on). CHARACTERIZATION !!!!! About something that many blockbusters are now forgetting about, but about something that is important to tell a good story. “Never” played a superior hand, considering 007 how he has been aging since Dr. No. He "gets along a little", so he has to do something like a trip to a medical farm - a direct order from "M" (!). Yes, if you have not seen this film, I will not be too upset by the plot, because A) Loads happen and B) Obviously, I want you to see it. Do not put off on my revelation about the "old Bond", Connery still receives many excellent items for charging, swimming, strikes, speed, shock and sniffing. The man is a legend, and this film is one of his most enjoyable performances in the role of Bond. An abundance of high-tech gadgets, several excellent villains and a great cast (including the fantastic cameo Rowan Atkinson) raise this film well above the expectations of the audience. <br /> <br /> This may have been the last Bond movie, and it would be a party to remember. The game of the secret agent, when someone was approaching retirement, was a refreshing stroke of genius - the last scene finishes the series perfectly ... ... but still we had more, and then another, and another Moore. However, if you are interested in knowing what Fatima Blush is, take this movie. Then you can at least pretend that 007 spent his last moments as a secret magician agent, in the arms of Kim Basinger and grinning at Mr. Bean. (PS * That other film that I think could have finished all this? Sandy License to Kill "
