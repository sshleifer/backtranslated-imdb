I watched this movie many years ago on TV and recorded it from there, I could never understand why my mother was upset when she watched it! That was because I was so young at the time. I just sat and watched this film again, I now have 2 of my own children, and I had to try to fight off the tears, but this did not happen, I cried for most of the film. when you have your own children! Such an amazing family, such a heartbreaking film, really wonderful! Someone said that 8 news is still alive, you are still in touch, I would like to know! Touched by the movie to everyone!
