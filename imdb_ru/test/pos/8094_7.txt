Written, directed and directed by Charlie Chaplin. This is an anti-fascist propaganda play of the great actor, piercing Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Chaplin plays Adenoid Hinkel, the dictator of Tomania, and the Jewish barber Spittle Hinkel. His parody of Hitler is brilliant. Anyone who has ever seen newsreel footage with Hitler will recognize the eerie resemblance of caricature. <br /> <br /> I thought that the film began slowly, with some typical Chaplin's slap in the face, telling about the adventures of a Jewish barber in the First World War. Having never seen it before, I must admit that after about 20 minutes I wondered what was going on. But the film is rapidly gaining momentum. There are some very funny moments and enough emphasis on the anti-Jewish character of "Hynckel-ism" to make a point of propaganda. The culmination of the film is the brilliant anti-Nazi speech delivered by Chaplin at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> As good as Chaplin in this film, although I thought it was all stolen by Jack Oka, who plays the dictator “Bacteria” - “Benzino Napaloni”. Our first glance at Oka shows how well he studied his subject — he had Mussolini’s arrogant pose. In the scenes in which Hinkel and Napaloni discuss the fate of Osterlich, I was stuck in the seams. <br /> <br /> It was a very good movie and it’s worth seeing.
