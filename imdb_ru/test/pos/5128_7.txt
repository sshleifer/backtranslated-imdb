This is a good family movie with a bit of laugh. I would like it to not have too many school things, such as a bully, to fill the film. In addition, it seems that it is too easy to save a piece of land from development. I mean, it just flowed too easily. It makes you aware of the wildlife. He had a nice way to present a piece of land, which is a quick runner, but too slow for me. This is too strange for me, and it reminded me to go back to school. Oh, the DVD is full of goodies, so don't miss. 7 out of 10 for a movie 10 out of 10 for a DVD with additional materials worth watching. Worth the time to see it!
