Pavarotti and the entire cast are excellent in this beautifully filmed opera by Giuseppe Verdi, the world's best opera composer. The coloratura soprano is especially impressive for its perfect presentation. The title role is well performed and well sung. The whole production is as perfect as one might expect. <br /> <br /> A masterpiece of cinematography! <br /> <br />
