I stumbled upon this movie on tv. I had not heard of this before and almost changed the channel, but he quickly hooked me. <br /> <br /> The history of the struggle of the Burmese people against the military dictatorship provoked me. The level of cruelty that some are willing to use to hold power is hard to believe. I am grateful for living in a country where the government is unlikely to shoot people on the streets. <br /> <br /> The story with Laura Bowman was a good thread to combine the history of political struggle.
