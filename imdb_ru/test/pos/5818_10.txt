Life is crazy. You're crazy, I'm crazy, we're all crazy. We are all a little Minnie and a little Moskowitz. Sometimes it seems that it is best to show prudence ... but what then could you miss? <br /> <br /> You have to be yourself. You don’t need to park your car and scream at people half randomly, but you can’t hide behind a veil (or dark sunglasses), pretend and act like everything is in order. And sometimes you really need to be careful, because why are you still alive? <br /> <br /> I am not going to “evaluate” this love in comparison with other Cassavetis films, because they are all absolutely 100% unique works and each has its own act of expression and exploration of our lives. In this sense, they are all gorgeous, and comparisons are odious. Undoubtedly, this film has one insane, sometimes maddening, but ultimately an amazing and liberating quality that exists in all of his films - you never know what will happen next, and you never know what the characters will think, do or feel next. And the characters themselves - and we really want to live differently? Unlike Moskovich, you can have an excellent job and reasonably invest money in your IRA, but at the same time live the life of an adventurer within you - your feelings, your spirit and your life experience. Yes, we can do it in both ways, this is what Cassavetes shows us. Thank God, someone did.
