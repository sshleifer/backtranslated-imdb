I am surprised that there is confusion about the title of this film. Obviously, this is a study of the nature of modern love. This suggests that love is love, while movement is good, but in which people reserve the right to put themselves in the first place, and if things get tough, they go out and move on to something else. <br /> <br /> This observation is important for generations, as it comes from generation X, comments on generation X, and ultimately aims at generation X. It expresses disappointment that love has transformed from what baby -Bumers, parents of generation X, originated in their marriages and family lives, which gave Generation X an innocent and generous childhood, which it eventually enjoyed. <br /> <br /> The attitude of Generation X to love is, of course, frivolous, but since decisions are made, commitments are violated, the biggest sacrifice is the children of Generation X. to recover from the shock I received from this epiphany.
