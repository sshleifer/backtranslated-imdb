First viewing 08/26/2001 - 8 out of 10 (Deer-John Cassavetes): The well-made early independent film Cassavetes presented a style that was very different from what Hollywood shows its audience. This film also presented some very taboo themes, especially actual racism, which was probably spread throughout the country, but was not shown by most white controlled directors of the time. The only black actors that were held in high esteem at this time were those who acted and showed personality as whites (also known as Sydney Poitier). In addition, the idea of ​​ending the film without truly completing the relationship we started leaves many viewers dumbfounded, but in fact makes the viewers understand that life is like this (it continues ...). I prefer this kind of ending, because it makes you think more about the characters and what can happen next, and the conclusions are not just laid out for you. The film tells about the lives of people (especially couples of people who have short relationships and have opposite skin colors), then we watch what happens when a white person realizes what he did. This is done very well and makes the film very special. The acting is supposedly improvised, which makes the film even more amazing. I think you can say that I liked this movie, if you can not say. If you can find it, watch this classic early independent movie.
