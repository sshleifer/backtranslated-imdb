SPOILERS AHEAD ------------------------- Chalk has everything in order. From the initial credits to the final credits, this film has a direct laugh. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force. Carey Evis transfers the film most of the time, but the cast plays a strong role when the plot is taken away from Robin Hood. From the very beginning, this film proclaims that you cannot take yourself seriously. If you took the time machine and gave the characters the thought of modern antics, you would get this movie. What makes this movie special, you say? Throughout the film, you see Blinken and Akuu walking alongside each other and becoming great friends of Robin Hood. But Blinken is never told or understood that he is black until the crowd says “black sheriff”, Blinken repeats “He is black”. This is an eternal scene. Simple one of the most exciting films of our time.
