I just took my 11-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son to this film, and I can't remember the film where I laughed so hard - literally out loud, deep laugh, because this film is funny. Of course, the storyline is predictable, but the trip is so pleasant that it does not matter that you know how it will end. The comedy feelings of the actors in time were impeccable. The actors were perfectly matched. My children mentioned that Amanda Bynes seems to be the last of the actresses of young women who do not ruin their lives. She is so refreshing. My children said it was their favorite 2006 film. Our money was spent on this film.
