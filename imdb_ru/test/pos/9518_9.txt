This is another pearl from the pen of Daniel Thompson - in fact, in the same year (1999), she wrote and directed La Bouche, the first of three author and directorial works. Belle Maman is, first of all, “French”, whatever that means, of course, different things for different people. The premise is simple: on the altar, where he marries Matilda Seigneur, fiance Vincent Lyndon sees his mother Catherine Deneuve for the first time and suffers from what the French call a coup that we know as love at first sight. , Theoretically, the story is either: 1) right then and there, suggesting that he canceled the wedding, or 2) just the beginning when he is passing the wedding and thus living a lie until it is resolved anyway. Thompson turns to # 2, but does not lead us astray with a strange story, such as the lesbian mother Deneuve smoking a Reno cigar (in real life, if someone doesn’t care, Renault maintains a long-term relationship with Stefan Odran (who removed) and adds a brilliant decoration to the luxuriously furnished men's room at the wedding reception, which takes the form of a cheerful song and dance. finally, he pours out his feelings for Deneva at the family meeting, at the same time destroying the joint. This is one to enjoy. Again and again.
