Now I myself had seen several episodes of Leauge Of Gentleman, which seemed ridiculous to me. When I brought the film, I was not sure if I knew enough about the series to understand it, boy, I was wrong. This is one of the best comedic films I've ever seen, and the sly acting film Leauge makes a movie. He has a very good and funny plot, and using only a few characters at any time helps, because it does not make him too confusing, which would destroy the film. Even if you have never seen The Leauge Of Gentleman get this film, it makes you laugh, and you can watch this film more than once, and this is a great movie to watch with friends. It really deserves to consider certain 10 out of 10.
