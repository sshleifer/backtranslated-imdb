Beautiful woman, wilderness, inbred monster male, super sweet monster truck, zombie brother killing on the road, and 2 friends ... one anal restrained, overly sensitive nerd, and the other a dirty, aloof teen using the Jeepers Creepers, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Road Trip, and you get a Monster Man. A funny horror / comedy movie that is never going to "say something." This is a simple, direct celebration of laughter. Simple and well done, this horrible comedy based on his friend film. This film offered fun and disgusting scenery. I highly recommend this to fans of fear who want to have fun.
