Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments, but I have to disagree with a couple of things. Firstly, this film does not look like cars that are in Paris. Not IMHO. Nothing like this. <br /> <br /> I think that there were elements of surrealism in the film, but I think that the director’s main approach is not “surrealistic” as such. therefore, it is not very similar to CARS Paris, I think it is more like a strange European work, where some scenes carry the hallmark of “strange” rather than surrealistic. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I think the music of Heuzenroeder is brilliant. They used the whistle, this old sound from country and western records, and it sounds better than most Australian films, which usually unite the creator of the film with the dull-sounding indie band the company wants to promote. <br /> <br /> As for the title of the film - I don’t know why it is called “Modern Love”, I hoped that David Bowie would appear in clothes and lipstick ... on the contrary, I start to show my age.
