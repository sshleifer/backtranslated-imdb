“The Happiest Days of Your Life” demonstrate some of the greatest British comedic talents of the time in a traditional high-class farcical manner. As a rule, this is a whistling tour of stuffy English behavior with a school for girls only, which provides an excellent setting for the dotti. Margaret Rutherford, Alaster Sim and - especially! - Joyce Grenfell is all fantastic, they dare us a lot, expressing their complete horror about what they have to deal with. As the movie progresses further, with a trip to school, things are getting more and more stupid and stupid, because the parents are a worthy cracker. <br /> <br /> At this point, I will again highlight Joyce Grenfell and her wonderful character Miss Gessage. She is so extraordinarily innocent, stupid, sorry and ineffective that she seems to be stealing the entire movie. She laughs most at the film when she flirts with a male teacher (“Call me sausage!”). <br /> <br /> Although some films are slow or outdated, and not always very exciting, they still support most of their brilliance and barely stop for romance. Good for a silly, harmless giggle. <br /> <br /> 7/10
