This epic unites superbly gifted actors and a film crew, the depth of narration, the superiority of most novels, excellent music, philosophy and connection with LIFE, which is hard for me to explain. Immersing myself in Die Zweite Heimat is like a spiritual experience for me, like fear, which can be obtained by looking at the stars in the clear night sky. The language and use of both color and monochrome segments adds a dramatic effect. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some places, including the office of Edgar Reitz. Since then, I have vowed to improve my German language skills - after Die Zweite Heimat, I feel almost German, as if I were at the head of the characters. I also try to match the piano playing of Henry Arnold (Hermann), but this is the only thing that always eludes me! This drama is unparalleled, and I was fortunate enough to see her on BBC2 in the UK and SBS in Australia. The sequel to Heimat 3 is currently being filmed in Germany.
