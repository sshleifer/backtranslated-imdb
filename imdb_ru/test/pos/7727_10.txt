I really liked Carmen, better than Original Sin (Angelina Jolie and Antonio Bandaras), who have some thematic similarities and which I also really liked. I felt that the game was stronger here (Paz Vega showed a wider range, he had more fire; and Svaraglia was also great). In general, their acting was tougher, more believable (less dreamy than Original Sin, and both actors had less “celebrity status” and a “pretty face” on which the film depended. <br /> <br /> Director Vincente Aranda also created a detailed world (again, better than “Original Sin”), which allows you to feel the dirt and everyday life of archaic Spain - for example, people unloading goods from a cart. on the street, workers change candles of street lamps, all in the background of the action. <br /> <br /> Although I very much sympathize with the recent idea of ​​ransoming our femme fatales (for example, “Fatal Woman of Brian de Palma”) “Carmen” is a piercing, modern look at the traditions of the noir-classic Double Indemnity, which is nice to watch, This is another great example of the triumph of bold European cinema over the brilliant and safe Hollywood fare.
