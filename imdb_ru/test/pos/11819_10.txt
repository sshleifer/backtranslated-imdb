Back in 1996, one of the pilots of the airliner where I worked gave me a copy of this film. He told me that it would make me cry. I never believed him, and we even made bets. Watching the movie .... I cried in the bucket! Even after watching the movie, I cried in the bathroom. It was the most touching movie I've ever seen. I like the part in which Dexter's mother opposed Eric's mother, the line sounded like this ... "your sons best friend just died today ... and it won't be easy ... if you ever lay hands on him .. . I'll kill you!" The last part, where Dexter took Eric's shoes, was the scene that never left my mind until today. Honestly, just thinking about it makes my eyes teary. The story of what is true friendship. My girlfriend liked it too ... She hated me for letting her see a movie. I cried a bucket, she cried a river.
