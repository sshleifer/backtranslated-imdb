I have to say this. Gary Busey has saved this film. If it were not for his good acting talents, this film would be below par. I recommend the film, but with difficulty. <br /> <br /> The film’s greatest difficulty lies in its widespread disregard for historical, geographical, and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? Why did producer Buddy Petty ignore? Where are the daily trips to Clovis, New Mexico, the studio? Why is Nashville considered a racist hate camp to destroy Holly’s sound? Why was Buddy’s two-week courtship for Maria considered a difficult, forbidden, mixed race stereotype? Why are boxes with buddy tiles as light as feathers? Finally, why are crickets portrayed as a problem impeding Holly's talent? <br /> <br /> On their faces, these inaccuracies should spell doom for any film proclaiming “The History of Buddy Holly”. Nonetheless, Busey does represent an exciting image of a man whose death eventually led to the day when the music died.
