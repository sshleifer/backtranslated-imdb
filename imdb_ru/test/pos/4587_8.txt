You can read all sorts of links to the world of idiocracy. The futuristic world inhabited by pampered, complacent idiots, fueled by the false technology of a bygone era: this idea has precedent in H.G. /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, the narrator explains the rapid degradation of humanity over five hundred years, but does not fill the gaps in the origin of all futuristic technologies. Much of the criticism of this very funny (and funny) film seems to be surrounded by this omission and the resulting complaint that the world is not “realistic.” As if “realism” has always been a necessary quality of satire. Is “Brazil” realistic? How about "Futurama" or "Transmetropolitan"? Hell, what about Gulliver's Travels? I thought not. “Idiocracy”, although perhaps not as clear as that of the best genres, falls into the same notes and is generally successful. <br /> <br /> In addition, I do not consider futuristic technologies to be a problem. It's pretty easy to understand that Mike Judge assesses the current trend towards automation and simple product interfaces, so even full idiots can use them. As in The Brave New World, society in the film seems to have reached some point of automated self-sufficiency in the past (apparently created by the now extinct "smart people" to appease an increasingly silly population). ), leaving the rest of humanity free, to indulge all the worst, most selfish impulses that they can come up with and grow even more stupid. The film happens to happen during the last breath of humanity, as everything starts to fall apart forever. This may still be “unrealistic,” but if so, this is a wonderfully well-represented brand of unrealism. <br /> <br /> Of course, stupid people take up most of the screen time, but they are just victims - they don’t know better. Mike Judge saves his real hatred for clever people in power who are dead by the time the movie starts, but who are very much alive now in the 21st century. People like scientists who chase after “hair growth and long-lasting erection” only because they can profit from snake oil treatment. People like politicians who allow corporations to simply buy the FDA and the FCC. People such as media leaders and their yuppies, who promote nonsense - which allow you to quickly destroy all culture, morality and health - are the result. <br /> <br /> In the end, who is really to blame, the Morlocks or Eloy? The world’s Paris Hiltons or brilliant executives and advertisers who put it on television and lowered our cultural standards enough to leave it there? This is all implied in “Idiocracy,” though. The line is here, the hint is there (look at the cheerful autodocument, which literally does all the work in the health care system). This is one of the few aspects of the film that is NO unnecessary narrator. It's easy for the viewer to understand or not, but this is one of the most interesting themes in the film, which is much smarter than any other comedy of the year. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that so many people leave the film, thinking that this is just an excuse to show that the back of the fart and people fall into the groin. Not that this is not funny either, and perhaps it is a little condone. But in Idiocracy, things are not as simple as they seem.
