K-Pax is a very intriguing movie. Is Prot (Kevin Spacey) really an alien, or is he a mentally deranged person who just thinks he is an alien? This is the question Dr. Powell (Jeff Bridges) must answer before the self-proclaimed deadline set by Prot for his departure from Earth. <br /> <br /> As the film unfolds and more evidence emerges, both theories grow in confidence. His ability to recall from memory the area of ​​the galaxy in which his home planet is located indicates knowledge that no man could possess. Nevertheless, hypnosis sessions lead us to a real person with a very real and traumatic life, filled with destructive events that could cause such a deviation of personality. The end seems to give an answer, but it is ambiguous enough to make you wonder if you really know. I usually don’t like a lady or a tiger graduation, but it’s painful. I have my own theory that fits all the clues, but I don’t know that my theory is more true than anyone else’s. <br /> <br /> Directed by Ian Softly (“The Wings of the Pigeon”) tells the story delicately, with great skill. This is a rare example of how a director stays in the shadows and encourages outstanding actor performers from talented actors to dominate the story. This does not mean that management is technically worse, because it is excellent. Nevertheless, Softley remains unobtrusive, providing tremendous power due to subtlety, a pleasant difference from modern avant-garde directors who visually grab and shake the viewer, as if shouting: “Look how brilliant I am!” <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey again Demonstrates amazing game in the role of Prot. This is a part that is extremely demanding, demanding that Spacey make a cool and logical Prot in one minute, and then change gears to cause his agonizing alter-ego under hypnosis the next. Spacey is as plausible as an alien and a man, which greatly complicates the viewer's task. Jeff Bridges is also terrific as a relentless psychologist who becomes obsessed with learning the truth about Prot. <br /> <br /> This is an inspired story for a thoughtful viewer. I rated it 9/10. If you have to have a closure at the end of the film, this film will be very disappointing. However, if you like a fascinating puzzle that makes you think long after the credits, you will not be disappointed.
