How would you feel if you had only a few weeks left to live? This film will help you to know the eyes of one guy who faced this situation. This is said with sympathy and without much emotion. Some may feel it rather slowly - but I think it adds to the realism of the film. Someone might regard this as a love story, but I think it is secondary to seeing his last days with his eyes. The love of his life is part of his life and gives him more influence. A modest and gentle film unfolds the story in the same way as life. Without clich√© and with unexpected events on the background of the passage. If you like your movies mildly emotionally realistic, this may be for you.
