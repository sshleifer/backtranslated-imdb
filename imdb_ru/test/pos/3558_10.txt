Based to some extent on the David Croft and Jimmy Perry scenarios, the experience of Butlins Holiday Camp animators in the UK during the same time period, the program follows “Hi-De-Hi!” Embodies the “farce, postal humor” of post-war Britain. Located in the fictional seaside town of Crimpton-on-Sea, "Hi-De-Hee" tells about comedy events in the Maplins holiday camp - one of many dotted along the British coast belongs to the mega-rich, but never seen (on the screen) Joe Maplin . <br /> <br /> Although the real show began in 1980 with a pilot episode and lasted until 1988, when the BBC found it too boring for its advanced comedy department, seasons 1-5 focused on 1959, while seasons 6 –9 highlighted 1960 — a time when the old British Style Holiday Camp began to fall. During the first 5 seasons, Jeffrey Fairbrother (brilliantly played by the late, great Simon Cadell) was the head of an entertainment camp, and this is a meaningful, but slightly thoughtful former university professor who broke out of his upper class and risked his team of animators in the “real” world. were in stark contrast to his own easygoing personality. from seaso At 6, Fairbrother was replaced by Clive Dempster (played by David Griffin when Cadell left the show at the height of his popularity), a former RAF war hero who in many ways resembled the Cadell character in the background, but more a villain, but not a gentleman. <br /> <br /> However, for nine seasons, the real Hi-De-Hai stars were Ted Bovis (superbly played by Paul Shane), the stereotypical working class, drinking ale, obscene comics — one who can never resist the opportunity to drive a rest; Gladys Pugh (played by Ruth Madoc, who is currently experiencing a career with appearing on the popular BBC comedy series Little Britain), chef Yellowcoat (that's the name of the staff because of the bright yellow jackets) and sports organizer - but more importantly the only person who saved Jeffrey Fairbrother and Clive Dempster from embarrassment by hiding their inexperience in running a holiday camp; Peggy Ollerenshou (Soo Pollard), a slightly befuddled, but pretty maid from the chalet with burning ambitions to become a Yellow Coat, and Spike Dixon (Jeffrey Holland), Ted's innocent protégé who had learned more about show business than he had hoped. /> <br /> As usual in the play “Croft and Perry”, the assembled cast of characters was a set of losers, superbly played by the actors involved. Mr. Partridge (played by the late Leslie Dwyer, who turned 70 at the time of leaving the show), an entertaining alcoholic alcoholic for children; Fred Cuilly (Felix Bowness), a former soccer champion with a dubious past; Yvonne and Barry Stewart-Hargreaves (Diane Holland and Barry Howard), former champions of snobbish ballroom dancing, who were at the twilight of their career; and Sylvia and Betty (Nikki Kelly and Ricky Howard), the two main Yellowouts girls who were always looking for jokes that Joe Maplin would never have allowed into one of his camps. <br /> <br /> Hello "typified the era of farce in the late 50s with its insolence and, to some extent, vulgar" mocking "humor (jokes about people sitting in the toilets, and jokes about" women with big knots " by order of the day.) But, despite the fact that it was funny in "Carry On", it was always so innocent and became something recommended for family viewing in the 80s. Of course, critics of the show noted that the show was a lot longer than a couple of years, but I disagree. While the first seasons were focused mainly on sadness and humor, the second The hi-de-haye series had more of the thoughts inherent in the script, and the main characters (especially Spike Dixon and Gladys Pugh) were able to grow with a more sensitive line story. However, there were several critics of the show. Clive Dempster was not Jeffrey Fairbrother and the former did not have screen chemistry with Gladys, like Jeffrey (I personally think it would be more likely if Gladys married Jeff); five seasons dedicated to 1959 and four - 1960 did not cause only a few continuity errors (disappearance of old faces and the introduction of new Persian The shells were not properly explained, especially with yellow coats that came and went with great regularity; and the character of Gladys Pugh, who in the pilot episode was made a freedom-loving cannibal, who suddenly turned into a naive virgin character! Also, quite pedantically, most of the holiday season of 1959 was covered in the first season, so stretching the rest of the year in the next five episodes was incredibly bordering, however, the show was not meant to be carefully considered, and the comedy more than outweighed its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> All In All, Hi-De-Hi was probably one of the BBC's most recent golden comedies, and even if it has never been able to compete with British comedy pillars like “Only fools and horses”, “Porridge” or even “Last” Summer Wine "," Hello De Hi "will be the best This was remembered as a comedy that the whole family could enjoy. If you have not checked it for yourself, I beg you to do this.
