It is a pity that, having received a limited rating, the audience that considers this film most useful is unlikely to see it. <br /> <br /> Imaginary heroes follow the life of a teenager after the suicide of his brothers. Of course, this is not the most original story in the world, but it spends a lot of time on the humanization of its parents, “imaginary heroes” who failed in the eyes of their sons. <br /> <br /> For teens who tend to blame their failures on their parents, but refuse to take on any real responsibility, the film gives a powerful signal that in the end we all have our problems that we need to cope with and that we all work our own way. <br /> <br /> But unlike other films, which, as a rule, encourage the independence of young people, this film solves problems between parents and children, and they become stronger for them. The fact that the eldest child committed suicide is regrettable, but later in the film they do not forget about it, and the responsibility of all parties for the tragedy is explained in detail. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this issue has already been addressed earlier, it was not exactly the same - the film pulls very little. Now, why it brought him a rating of R, confusing - you are unlikely to meet a teenager in this era, not being a realist, but still providing realism limits this very audience. <br /> <br /> My junior high school was shown this film, two suicides may have been prevented. In this case, the censors appear to have used extremely poor judgment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
