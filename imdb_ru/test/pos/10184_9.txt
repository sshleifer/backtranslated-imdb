I saw the second part of this beautiful period established on the ship somewhere in the 19th century. Golding's book should be responsible for some excellent dialogues, but everything else was good too! I especially liked the way they created the period and the feeling that the ship is so good. For me, it was a sense of completeness, which, I know, I cannot convey in words ... Perhaps that was how they mixed technical and historical details about sailing eighteen hundred in history without spoiling it. up. Benedict Cumberbatch was superb, like the rest of the cast. This is not often a mini-series sends me to the "zone", but this one did.
