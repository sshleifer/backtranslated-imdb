I think no! I mean, yes, if you compare this film with The Godfather, or maybe a slightly older film, for example Casablanca, or maybe even a newer film, for example, The English Patient. He has no camera work or cinematography, as in other films, but does this not mean that this is a bad film or not? I think that the reason why this film is underestimated is that many people always compare it with other great Oscar-winning films (you should never do this), which makes it difficult to understand beauty and realism in this film. In the categories “Best Picture”, “Best Actor in the Main Role” and “Best Female Role in the Main Role”, this film really deserved them all. Magnificent Dustin Hoffman again gives us one of his best performances. A couple of times in this film I forgot that it was not his son, because it was so real! I have never seen a film about relationships in different families where it would be easy for the actors to play this special role, but still so beautiful. So, in my opinion, Dustin Hoffman passes the test with flying flowers. There are several actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best: Katharine Hepburn, Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda and Ingrid Bergman (I can't help it, I think she's great). Meryl Streep, in spite of the fact that she plays a minor role, is amazing and real, and you just cannot resist being attracted to her talent and how she makes her her own and real. Wow, that's all I can say. Justin Henry was great, considering his age, his tears and his relationship with mom and dad were wonderful, so I say good work to sweet little Justin Henry. <br /> <br /> While I watched this movie for the third time, I could not stop crying. I tried, but I could not. Thank God, I was alone! This is probably the cleanest movie I've ever seen. Other films nominated for Best Picture were Apocalypse Now, Norma Rey, Breaking Off and All That Jazz. I’m ashamed because I haven’t seen any of them, but from what I heard, “Apocalypse Now” is great, but when I heard about Norma Rey, I only thought about Sally Field. I think that, given the other nominees, this film deserves five Oscars, and that it will continue to touch and make other people cry for a long time in the future, just as it has been for the past 28 years. Good work of all the actors and actresses in this film for giving us wonderful performances and memories of watching this film, which we will never forget. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
