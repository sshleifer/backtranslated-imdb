Tex Avery was the MGM cartoon director for the 1940s and '50s, and this was one of the most exciting moments in the history of cartoons. His cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with MANY strange strokes, which were later noted in the movie “Mask”. Eyes jump out when a guy sees a girl, impossible tricks and nonstop actions were trademarks of these films. <br /> <br /> This is one of several Droopy cartoons Avery was responsible for and he is one of the best. Droopy - Mountie, and he is determined to get his man ... although in this case it is a wolf who escaped from prison. Throughout the film, despite the many crazy stunts, Droopy does not lag behind this scam until the wolf ultimately gives up, because Droopy seems to be everywhere! Full of funny jokes and loaded with laughter, this is a great cartoon.
