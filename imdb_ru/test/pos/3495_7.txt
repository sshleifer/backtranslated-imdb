Anyone who has seen Ali G before should be well prepared for the full film, called Ali G Indahouse. <br /> <br /> Although I prefer Ali G when he interviews the rich and famous, his brand is completely On the big screen, comedy definitely entertains from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and ridiculous script that make this movie a riot for Ali G. fans like the plague, because it is definitely more than the same; for everyone else - watch this Aiiii! 7/10
