Contrary to the commentary published directly below, "The Great Footprint" (1930) was not filmed in a three-camera process "much like the later Cinerama." It was Napoleon's finale (1927), a completely different movie! The Great Trail was simultaneously shot in 35mm and 70mm versions (Grandeur), and both versions are shown on the Fox Movie Channel from time to time, so it's easy to compare one of them with the other. The Grandeur version (broadcast in the mailbox @ approximately in the original 2: 1 ratio) is more impressive cinematically with its wide-angle panoramas, but suffers from the same problem as the early CinemaScopes, due to the lack of close-ups imposed on the director Raul Walsh - for problems with focus. Scenes in which people participate, rather than crowds or long shots, are much more effective in the standard version, because the camera can get closer to the players, thereby achieving a greater sense of involvement for the viewer. Watching the two versions at the same time, everyone gets an accurate idea of ​​what frames Walsh chose to take close-up shots, in the standard version, but could not, in the Grandeur version. There are also several episodes involving El Brendel: a shell game with Ian Keith and some affairs with his wife and donkey, which are in the Grandeur version, but not in the standard version. <br /> <br /> For the record, The Big Trail is the only one of the three Fox Grandeur films that has been preserved in its original widescreen format. (The other two are “Fox Movietone Follies” of 1929, completely lost, and “Happy Days”, which have been preserved only in the standard format.) During this time, other studios also experimented with a wide film, but the only one that still exists in both formats. - The Bat Whispers, shot in 65 and 35 mm and released by United Artists. Other widescreen films were MGM's Billy Kid (1930) and Big Meadow (1931), RKO's Dangerous Lights (1930) and The Lash (1930), shot in WB, and all of them can be seen in their standard format in the films of Turner Classic Movies. Kismet WB (1930) was also shot both widely and standardly, but seemed to have completely disappeared; Rumor has it that he is lost. <br /> <br /> Why did a wide film fail in 1930? Theaters reeled (pun intended) due to the collapse of the stock market in October 1929 and the rising cost of installing sound equipment, which adversely affected the additional costs of installing additional new projection equipment and new wider screens to accommodate just a few films, photographed in various systems, which were not always compatible with each other. Only in 1953, Fox, now the twentieth century, will try again, and this time it will succeed with the introduction of a widescreen CinemaScope.
