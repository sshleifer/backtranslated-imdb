John Ford paid the wagons his tribute to the special painting “The Master of the Wagons”, made after two large Indian-cavalry epics ... This is a wonderful poetic film, full of the romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit ... <br /> <br /> From a photographic point of view it is very simple ... The camera only moves once or twice throughout the film, and never when the director would have moved it to emphasize the shot ... Ford even resists the temptation to track his ka A furious twilight snapshots of women walking wearily in the dust behind their wagons ... They come and go, while the camera remains still and the Audience remains a spectator of the march of history, not a participant in it ... Of course, when Ford wants to attract his audience emotionally or dramatically, as in Diligence, he knows how to do it ... But the "Wagon Master" is a gentle, nostalgic look back ... <br /> <br /> Filled with traditional western songs from The The book The Sons of the Pioneers tells of a journey west to Utah (in 1879). ormonskogo convoy led by Ward Bond as elders Viggsa and two young traders horses (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr.). And in a series of beautiful images, when the carriage is fighting against criminals, Indians and nature in the struggle for the Promised Land, the modest “Master of the Cars” succeeds in capturing the history and legend of the West ... <br /> <br /> Ford himself said that “The Master of Carriages” (about which he wrote the original story) was one of three of his films, “which were closest to what I wanted to achieve.” <br /> Ford’s career as a western director was astounding ... More than anyone else, he could use this genre to protect his feelings for family, society and the American way of life ... Ford saw frontier as a land that must be subordinated to a special class of settlers and legalists, whose great sacrifices make the land protected from those who come after ... These early Westerners were giants who deserved the legendary status they received, and the civilized inhabitants of the city, who followed them d Must always keep them in fear and respect ... Ford's westerns often use memories that highlight the historical authenticity of his approach ... <br /> <br /> In Wagon Master, for example, the folk songs on the soundtrack tell us about the difficulties of the pioneers a century ago, and Ford shows them to us almost in a documentary way ... In one episode the train camped in a circle, and the settlers decided to conduct a square dance ... To create a dance floor, they had to put boards over the desert sand, and with this ritual triumph Ford show There is a defeat in the desert through the landfall metaphor ... <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful film, full of amazing carefree optimism, and it's easy to see why Ford found it so satisfying ?? Does it ever break faith with the mood and style established in the first few sequences ?? But it remains to be asked whether the ultra-romantic is the best chosen theme? <br /> <br /> The experience with the wagon train must have been one of the most demanding and nervous tests of this man (with his woman). ) ever put it yourself ?? It must have been filled with doubts - was I wrong to sell everything and come? How can we hope to survive? How will we fight the other end - at almost every other aching step along the way? <br /> <br /> Yet none of these sensations manifest themselves in the “Master of carts”. Travel — such is common joy — does not seem particularly dangerous. Of course, it could be that the Mormons were so “rich” in the religious spirit that it used to act as an anesthetic ?? In other words, their reaction was not a reaction to ordinary human weakness ... If so, was Ford right and the doubters were wrong ?? <br /> <br /> What is beyond doubt is the correct and proper sense of boiling, especially in the first meeting of Ben Johnson and Harry Cary Jr. This is the essence of carefree adventurous youth, especially the Western youth of those extraordinary times are felt ?? This is a wonderful relationship, and they remain in memory ??
