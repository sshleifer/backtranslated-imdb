This is a continuation of the creation of Better Off Dead. In the competition Better Off Dead will win with the hand. But for star power, One Crazy Summer outshines Savage's best screenplay. Problems with One Crazy Summer (OCS): casting. Better Off Dead (BOD) was played much better. Friendship: OCS shows that Cusack looks at little brother Bill Murray with a hateful look. Trouble on the set ?? More outrageous friends in OCS, but more real friends in BOD. The plot was good. You can predict some of them, but even the predictable parts go further than you think they could. So, although this is an ugly stepsister Better Off Dead, worth a look. See Demi Moore before plastic surgery, if for some other reason. Fans of John Cusack, you have to see it, just to say what you have. If you do not like Bobcat Golthwaite, sorry. I don't like him either, but you can't avoid him in this. At the very least, he does an excellent job with the film, paying homage to another movie monster. Editing needed help at the beach, but for the most part there is nothing to complain about. Overall, this is good and fun. But try not to compare it with the BOD, otherwise you will not be enough. *sigh*
