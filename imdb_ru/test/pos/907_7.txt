This is one of the L & H shorts, which is most often referred to as the first “real” L & H team and, possibly, one of their best silent features. J. Piedmont Mumblehander (Ollie) - a millionaire who came to the docks to greet his nephew Philip, whom he had never seen. At first, Ollie laughs at everyone when this strange little man dissolves and draws much attention to himself with the way he behaves during the medical examination, but he becomes rather humble when it turns out that this is the guy whom he should be greeting Him said that Philip is good boy, but he has one weakness - women. Mumblehander and Philip go home, but their journey there is constantly interrupted by the fact that Philip every time he sees a woman, begins to dance, and then chases after a woman. Every time this happens, huge crowds gather not so much because he is chasing skirts, but because Philip himself wears a skirt (kilt). Finally, Mumblethunder manages to drag Philip to the tailor's workshop in order to evaluate suitable pants, but Philip escapes to pursue more skirts. Around a lot of laughter. It is also nice to see such a short video, because the boys are not exactly the heroes we know and love. Ollie is pretty much his usual character, but it's such a joy when Stan behaves differently from his normal male child. This shows that he was not a pony with one trick and excelled in other types of roles when he had the opportunity. With a duration of 19 minutes, it is short and sweet, providing classic liners that still leave me in stitches.
