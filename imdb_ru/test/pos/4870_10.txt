Well, that's why in any Wile E. Coyote-Road Runner cartoon we know that WEC is going to set all sorts of traps for RR, but always cripple ourselves in various ways. It certainly happens in Beep, Beep. Predictable? I assume that this is so, but when you think about it, these cartoons show that the more you try to harm someone else, the more you are harmed; it seems like Daffy Duck is always trying to undermine the integrity of Bugs Bunny, but Bugs sees it. <br /> <br /> In general, this is another classic from the crowd of Termite Terrace. Sometimes I think that if we really wanted to ease tensions in the Cold War, we could just let the Soviet Union watch the Looney Tunes cartoons; I am sure they would love them. Another wonderful one. <br /> <br /> PS: I found out about "Dangers!" second name is Wyle E. Coyote Ethelbert.
