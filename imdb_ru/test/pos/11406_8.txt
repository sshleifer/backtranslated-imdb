People say that this film is “a typical horror movie for teenagers” ... well, this is a horror movie with a teenage girl ... what are you expecting! This is a good film, I counted three actual screams in the audience while the film was on, and it was a very scared movie. I was not bored in the film at any moment, and I was even on the edge of my place at some point. The only thing that was a little bad was that it was a bit slow to get into the real storyline, but all of this led to why it was where it was, and why what happened happened. The game was good, the situation was good, and the storyline was good, I hope to see "When a stranger calls 2" in a few months! Good film!
