This film is excellent. The passion between Jade and Billy was remembered, and the acting was great. That is why you do not leave a 16-year-old and such a young man alone! This shows why a single mother should not meet with the younger man and teenage daughter in the house, because he looked young enough to be the son of Jesse. <br /> <br /> I give it ten out of ten, the cast was wonderful, and the movements between the actors were correct. <br /> <br /> The age difference between Jenny and Rob was also good because they were similar in age. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a fun movie, but I think no one should watch this movie because of the sex scenes.
