I would recommend this as the most successful attempt to make a film about the Soviet Afghan war. And this is a very honest and responsible picture, ranging from small details of uniforms and weapons and ending with human relations, the routine of war and Central Asian landscapes. He was shot dead in Tajikistan immediately after the withdrawal of troops, which occurred in 1989, and not in 1985. The Italian star Mr. Placido was just perfect in the role of Major Bandura. Other characters also looked very natural, especially the always drunk club manager. The entire film crew sometimes had to run away even under fire. The last scene is a type of harakiri behavior and reminded me of the last phrase from one famous samurai film - "We won all the battles, but lost the war." This may be the metaphor of the collapse of the USSR - a great country, which allows a little offended child to be shot in the back.
