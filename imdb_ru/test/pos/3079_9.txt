This movie is great! I can watch it again and again. Robin Hood is great cast, and Marian is beautiful. Personally, I think that the German Mariana is the most funny character, along with Latrina and the Sheriff! While the cosmic balls became boring and stupid after a while, this one always keeps your interest! It was a great movie, and it is never boring. A great cast is in roles, and it is perfectly forged, and it makes such a sense, and you can watch it again and again! You'll love this movie if you only watch it, unless you hate comedy or think that Robin Hood should be faked. But this old story gets boring, and this movie gives it a new taste!
