If ever a potential film should have sounded as if it would not work on the basis of reading the script on paper, it would be this film. Here we have what at first glance looks like an ominous and loose soft porn and Flick, complete with a huge poster in the theater, depicting almost naked Christina Ricci chained to none other than Mr. Bad Ass M.F., Samuel Jackson. But let me tell you that if a film ever comes to life on a large celluloid with tremendous spiritual power, then this is the redemptive sequel of Craig Brewer for Hustle & Flow, The Black Snake Moan. <br /> <br /> Without shame, ended From the very beginning, this film absorbs you with the opening scenes and continues to dig deeper and deeper with each subsequent frame. This is the main story of two deeply damaged characters who find each other with the strength and courage to move forward in their lives. Of course, before this, this story has already been made, but, as I have always said, the story tells about what gives her heart, depth, meaning and strength. <br /> <br /> Ricci is damaged - a digital character who abuses childhood, Rei and the equally heartbreaking musician Jackson, Lazarus, find each other in desperate circumstances, and Laz assumes the responsibility to try to help Rei. In itself, this is relatively unique: the idea of ​​a man trying to sincerely help a woman who is in great pain, and not trying to use it to their advantage, and from the very beginning we know that Laz's heart and the heart of the film In the right place. The film is based on the redemptive healing power of love (with music as a very close second), and the film resonates deeply with this truth - soulfully, slyly and brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Root Cause The film is so successful because of the hard, dedicated performances of Ricci and Jackson. Scenes that would seem ridiculous and pathetic in the hands of smaller artists are instead powerful, like everyone else. In particular, the arc-scene of the film, in which Jackson sings and plays the title song alone in his house, along with Ricci, amidst serious thunderstorms and violent demons from the past who run Rey in a rage in her head, which leads her to crawl to Lazarus and clinging to his leg, coming off is not funny, as it technically should have been, but rather as a heartbreaking catharsis. <br /> <br /> All auxiliary performances here are also fantastic. Justin Timberlake is quite believable as the passionate guy Rae Ronnie, and the always wonderful S. Epata Merkerson also plays the role of a character who clearly has feelings for Lazarus. John Cotran Jr. is also distinguished, as is Laza R.L. (Without a doubt, bow to the blues musician R. L. Burnside). In this film, everything works, let's face it, including the music / soundtrack, which features Burnside, Scott Bomar, Bobby Rush, Son House and, most importantly, Jackson himself, whose fantastic version of Stackolee I listen to, composing this review, Also in the film there is a really beautiful and touching version of “This Little Light of Mine”, sung by heartbreaking and careful Ricci. <br /> <br /> In a recent interview, Samuel Jackson said he believes his performance in this film is the best of his career; I could not agree with him more. This work, of which he can be proud of his monumental, along with all the others involved in this bold, highly wise and deeply spiritual project.
