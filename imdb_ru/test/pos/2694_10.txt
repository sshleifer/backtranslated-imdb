The king of queens is a comic genius. Kevin James, who plays IPS delivery man Doug Heffernan, is very funny, Leah Remini, who plays Doug Curry's wife, is incredibly hot (No. 19 on the list of 102 women’s hottest women in Stuff magazine) and very funny. The real magic of the series, however, scenes with Jerry Stiller - the most funny in the series. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Kerry's father, Arthur Spooner, who lives in the always cold basement of Doug and Kerry. I have to admit that I never watched this show until 2006. Whenever I watched it before, it never seemed funny, but with the cancellation of “Friends Still Standing" and "Yes, dear", I needed a new comedy. In fact, giving the Queen of Queen a chance, I found that it was absolutely fantastic. So funny that I downloaded the first 7 seasons and watched each season in 8-hour blocks. I urge everyone who has not seen this treasure to check it out. You will not be disappointed.
