“I'm ... proud of my head,” said Mike Nesmith. It should be, because this film, which has either been ridiculed by many of us, or studied and studied by film professors, works on many levels. <br /> <br /> Yes, he is unconventional. For many, this is frustrating. It’s as if the producers are giving you a film and tempting you: “You yourself understand this.” <br /> <br /> You probably already know that the Monkey TV show was an unrestrained marketing success that depended on a business acumen and not a little public deception. TV shows about the sale of soap and toothpaste at first, rather than entertain. The fact that Monkeys broke out of the box for a short time to make a “Head” is a testament to the popularity and importance of the group in pop culture, no matter where your head is. Find out one thing: “Head” is not the television series “Monkeys”. <br /> <br /> So, we have a “psychedelic documentary” about Western pop culture from a source with authority on this issue. "Head" is a film that can only come from those "inside the box." By 1968, the actors and the Apes team were experienced and weary professionals who saw their share of hopes and disappointments. The film was a deliberate attempt to change the position of the market. Thus, he did three things: make the film the way the monkeys represented it. Most importantly, re-invent the group for someone who does not obey the old bosses - and yes, hipper, than before. Make a film that exposes the American attitude to the spread of information. <br /> <br /> “Head”, therefore, actually concerns the manipulation of the media and its end result: deception. The media should inform, inform us about events in the world as a whole and ultimately ask us to form opinions about these events that can turn a thought into a positive action. Thus, we assume that the information we perceive is complete and impartial - otherwise how can we make a valuable conclusion on any one idea presented in a book, newspaper or television show? In one of the street interviews in the "Head" the guy confesses: "I did not watch either the newspaper or the TV." Is he a smaller or better man? Even the narcotic parallels are a soft veil "Things are not as they seem." Remember the old joke "Everything you know is wrong"? The scenario begins with the Monkeys' public recognition of their own “manufactured image” and literally begins with football. Is the football scene in the film a visual manifestation of the whole “Head” idea? Is the film an exercise in the stream of consciousness? Is the movie the culmination of marijuana smoking marathons? There are too many coincidences in the film, indicating the opposite. I assume that the “Head” is the culmination of motivations somewhere between intention and unintentional. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the insiders responsible for “The Head” seem to enjoy the fun in the film, but there is anger - anger at the chaos that characterized the end of the 60s, and anger at the means Mass media, especially television, have changed culture in a negative way. Drugs and violence were strong negative forces in the late 60s and still, but the producers of “Head” want you to know that bad “information” is a much greater danger. <br /> <br /> They attribute war to deceive and lie. What is the ideal way to spread misinformation than through television? Repeatedly mysterious black box is considered as an obstacle for monkeys and, apparently, for all of us. In one scene, Peter gloomily sits in a saloon with a melting ice cream cone, and one monkey asks him: "What happened?" "I bought this ice cream cone, and I do not want it." The film assumes that the first goal of the media is NOT to inform, but to sell blindly. “Head” goes further: put any idea in someone's head, and it goes merrily. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers know this, and the danger is real. “Head” is either a film that creates itself “along the way”, or a deliberate statement. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe it's just “The Pot Meets the Advertising,” as criticized in 1968. Jokes on "Monkeys" and us. Be careful what you ask for, you can get it. <br /> <br /> Greetings: true guilt. Very funny. Smart. I will delight fans. Find the substance, it is there. Strangely weird whimsical collection of characters. Good setup. The length is suitable. Many great liners, including my prophetic favorite of all time: "The tragedy of your time, my young friends, is that you can get exactly what you want." Drugs. No plot. No linear delivery of any thoughts, in particular. At least twenty-five stories that are intertwined on the principle of "stop and go." Therefore, it can easily disappoint. It may seem pretentious to some. People who hate Monkeys do not have to look, although this in itself is not a reason to avoid it. Psychedelic special effects can kill your sick CRT or acid-burned eyeballs. <br /> <br /> Match, cut.
