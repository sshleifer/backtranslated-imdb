This is another film, where the best to recommend cinema. It would be good if the film were a travel film, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic prowess this is not enough. The theme of interspecific respect and cooperation shyly plunges into the forbidden world of interspecific love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the motives of any kind. As in many films, one always wonders what a more innovative director and more creative screenwriter could achieve. Alas, we probably will never know.
