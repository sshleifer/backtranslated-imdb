Beyond the Clouds is in many ways the strangest film I've ever seen. Not because of the attractiveness of a cult, of blood, or even because of its ideas, but because of the elements that unite to make it a masterpiece of cinema. The director of the film “Beyond the Clouds” was Michelangelo Antonioni, one of the most famous directors of Italy. However, if you gave this film only quick custody, I mean passive, it would seem like one of those melodramatic and often meaningless novels. This film deserves a lot of attention, even to cover all his cheese. By cheese I mean not a slice, but a whole cheddar brick! The music seems to be from some sort of Italian porn, history and dialogue, like they are from patterned Japanese soap, and metaphors so obvious that you want to slap your head. <br /> <br /> But as soon as you get through all this, you are doing an existential work of art. Cheese penetrates the fine shooting and perfectly draws our attention to what you need to know. The main plot consists of four chapters, not related, and all about love. We learn that no matter what happens or what is said, people cannot communicate with each other. Instead, they can only communicate with each other. I believe that this is why dialogue and plot are so stupid, because conversations are excessively irrational with a lack of causality and excessive melodramatic reaction of people. <br /> <br /> I left this film in thought for myself; maybe all life is one big melodrama. We evaluate our feelings towards others as real and purposeful. I hate it because I have a reason. But what does the hated think? Maybe they think that my hatred is stupid and arbitrary. In other words, melodramatic. <br /> <br /> So melodrama is an existential function. A poor affair is simply a human interaction under a magnifying glass that allows us to see the futility of who we are and what we do. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, I recommend it to everyone!
