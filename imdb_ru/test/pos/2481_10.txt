In an unclear future, in the California camp for detainees, an English film crew is in court because young students and political dissidents are being tried in accordance with the fictitious “Rebellion Act”, which allows the US government to suspend civil liberties for its citizens in cases of emergency without right on bail or need of evidence. In such cases, the government is authorized to detain and detain anyone who, in his opinion, may be involved in sabotage in the future. The trial team includes a feminist, a black panther and a folk singer. <br /> <br /> Those accused by the conservative tribunal can choose a long prison term or three days in the Park of Punishments in which they can achieve their freedom by reaching the American flag in the desert. They should do it without food or water. They should also be prosecuted by the armed national guard and the police, who can return them to the camp if they are caught in order to receive the punishment assigned to each convict. The reality is different; those who choose the park of punishment are hunted, killed or animals without the hope of getting freedom after a police officer is found dead in the park. The park appears to be a training ground for police and guards who need to cope with these acts of repression so they can be used in open American society. <br /> <br /> Shot in 16 mm and developed documentary style Watkins in his famous Culloden and controversial The War Game for the BBC; he interacts with prisoners and guards and oversees the unconstitutional legal process, intersecting between them to create an absolutely convincing political film that still remains vital and relevant. Using his knowledge of the environment, Watkins created a spectacular, inexorable and ultimately frightening image of a film about a fictional American political camp for detainees, which would not have been convinced if it were not for its flawless design. Many of the actors are lovers, improvising with broad characters. Sparks fly in the scenes of the trial, in which each case is heard, in part due to the fact that Watkins kept those who were on trial, away from the jury before filming these scenes. Watkins also argues that actors often express their own opinions, which certainly explains the ferocity, as well as the plausibility of their performances. <br /> <br /> The film was heavily criticized for polarizing the opinions of those who see it. It was argued that the film is reactionary and unambiguously represents that conservatism and war are the root of American social problems. Although these criticisms can be valid, it is important to bear in mind that the film works at a fictional, metaphorical level, and perhaps it is the realism that the film so cleverly creates that encourages such a hot opinion about its content. In fact, the most important topic of films is the problem of polarization itself. "Conservative" judges and officers of cruel law are on the one hand, and "liberal" convicts - on the other, without any concessions on both sides. Looks like this is what the film really is about. The new law and the park itself are the result of a situation where the mediation between the two political positions was lost. <br /> <br /> Made during and in protest against the war in Vietnam and the treatment of those who opposed the war in America, the main topics of government persecution of its citizens and conservatism that infringes civil liberties are still resonant in the era of the Patriot Act and Identity Card. It is also worrisome about the news of Guantanamo Bay and the treatment of Iraqi prisoners in the hands of Allied forces. <br /> <br /> The threat of internal “terrorism” is such a volatile problem that the film cannot fail. associate with the current attitude to the subject. Not surprisingly, the film had a volatile distribution story, being extremely marginalized because of its content, but the alarming fact that this film can remain so relevant today indicates that the wait was not in vain. "Park of punishments" is a film for which you need to fight to be seen anywhere, and it requires your attention.
