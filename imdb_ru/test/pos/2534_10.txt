Pixote is one of the most powerful, shocking and moving films from Brazil. It is about the life of street children on the streets of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and its ten year old boy is in the center of attention. The camera follows them in an almost documentary style: from the center for minors (where most of the staff are corrupt, like in the police) and back onto the streets, and she never turns away from the city horrors. Prostitution, drug use / drug trafficking, corruption and murder — all these young people are witnesses; yet this is what they are painfully used to. Directed by Hector Babenko used real street children as actors, adding brutal reality to the films. Although not for everyone, I highly recommend the film. Emotionally destructive film. <br /> <br />
