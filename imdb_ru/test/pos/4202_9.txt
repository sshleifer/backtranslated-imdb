A very good film from 1939, where John Garfield plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks he committed a murder. The problem is that the killer and Garfield's girlfriend, Anne Sheridan, die in a short but good talk, trying to escape from the police. <br /> <br /> A crooked attorney convinces Garfield to flee from New York. He lands in Arizona and meets with dead-end children. They were sent there by a funding program to prevent them from avoiding further trouble. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garfield finds a new love interest, but he has to hide his identity, like everyone else. believes that he was not only a murderer, but also a victim of a car accident. <br /> <br /> May Robson is incredible because grandmother controls the lost youth. Claude Raines is also effective as a detective who suspects Garfield is still alive and stalks him when his picture is taken in Arizona. <br /> <br /> The film is really about Garfieldâ€™s relationship with the boys. While the end is good, you want Garfield back to New York to declare his innocence.
