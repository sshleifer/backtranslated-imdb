It's 3:30 in the morning. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie about six minutes ago, and it's fantastic. <br /> <br /> A teenage girl had a passionate night with her mom's lover, and she ruined everyoneâ€™s life. What is really interesting about this film is that no one can blame someone on one. <br /> <br /> Everything was great, and this story made me think. <br /> <br /> You should definitely see this movie if you can get it. <br /> <br /> I give him 10 points.
