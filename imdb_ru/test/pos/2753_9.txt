The show is GREAT. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Incredible dance. The editors couldn't spoil it, not because they weren't * so * bad *, but because the show really * was * good *. <br /> <br /> Editors - compulsive incisors, you can not see the scene without a break for more than 15 seconds. You can show different angles, but these guys worked with several cameras for the first time in their lives, and they will remind you how many cameras they have on average every five seconds ... They manage to shoot a start jump with one camera, then cut it in the middle and show the rest from a different angle. <br /> <br /> No matter how hard they tried, they couldnâ€™t spoil this wonderful show. It is necessary for lovers of dance and music.
