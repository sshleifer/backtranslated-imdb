The film turned out better than I expected. I worked on the set for a short period of time when Damien filmed this film. The fire, stunt and acting was pretty good in terms of editing. Everything you heard, the music was not so great. The best music would be the best in this movie. Some of them sound like hippy days. Damien remembers that you have gangster old gangster, or hip hop would do it. It was more realistic than blood in the blood. Casting was chosen very well. Suspectentertaint did a good job in this movie. The film gave me the lifestyle I used to live. But what you end up with is not always winning. And in my story it was so. I adapted to the film the first time I watched it. Damien Congratulations on this movie.
