I never understood what an amazing dancer Lana Turner is until I watched this movie. She was only 19 years old and she is gorgeous. How nice to watch her dance with George Murphy. The storyline was typical of its day, but the dances were really special. I never get tired of watching Fred and Ginger, but Lana Turner in this film was just awesome. I always thought of Lana as a so-called actress who tends to replay. She should have been more dancing and less playing the roles of Maddam X and Peyton Place. I had a new gratitude for her after watching this movie and her beautiful dance. It is a pity that the Academy does not give an Oscar for dancing.
