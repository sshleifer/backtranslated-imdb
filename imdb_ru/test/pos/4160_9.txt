This is Christmas! Christmas in terms of rebirth, or at least, this is what you can hope for in relation to Italian cinema. It was about 30-40 years old when Italian cinema did not create a work of art of this size. This is an absolutely modern film, which can also be viewed on the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, not to mention quoting any name. And finally, it is also a large production according to the Italian standards of the time. This film has a rare balance of different elements, all of which are understandable and enjoyable at different levels. Real poetry, real humor, real tenderness, real drama, real beauty. There is no rhetoric, there are no simple surrealistic labels, there is no typical tourist “Tornador” image, there is no excessive play, there is no director’s autoreferenceism. There is also a cool use of two heart-rending songs by Nina Simone, whose music, I believe, was never properly used for evaluation. So, if this is not a real rebirth for Italian cinema, it will be an extraordinary evolution for Emanuele Crialese after his “Respiro” of another excellent beautiful film. “Nuovomondo” should not be missed, it is such a “medical film” that helps to create films, watch films, help to enjoy life and understand it.
