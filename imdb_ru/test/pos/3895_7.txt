I can't say that this movie was fun, but I must have been smiling all the time. I like this darker comedy; “very bad things”, “8 heads in a duffle bag” or “cold look” there will be an ending, but the way the ending happened was. Another thing that catches your eye is how they managed to attract an audience. The way Terry looks at us is ridiculous, you can almost pretend that you are his accomplice.
