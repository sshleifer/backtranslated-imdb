I write this after watching the latest episode broadcast in the UK, and it’s probably difficult for me to maintain standards. In the latest episode, titled “Blink,” there are elements of gothic horror associated with statues that are not exactly as they appear. The doctor and Martha do not look very good, but this does not detract from a well thought out episode. The general standard reached a high level, and the last three episodes, the two members of the Family and the last, were the best for me that the current team ever did. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. just David Tennant, who keeps it together, helps a whole group of actors week after week. For those who expect a series of 3 abroad, the wait is worth it.
