If you like the Butterfly, Donnie Darko, or Machinist effect, you'll also love K-Pax. <br /> <br /> This film seemed to me really inspiring and at the same time depressing. Spacey provides excellent performance as a Prot. Also, let's not forget the appearance of Saul Williams in the film, whom I am a big fan of. <br /> <br /> After watching it, I recommended the film to many of my friends, and everyone was delighted. long away. <br /> <br /> But still, it is very undervalued, perhaps due to the lack of action and explosions. Sorry, this is not a film about explosions, but about how people behave and how people live in non-existent worlds. <br /> <br /> Go on and enjoy.
