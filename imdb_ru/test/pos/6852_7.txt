Well, Anatomie is not a reinvention of the horrormovie genre, but, nevertheless, it is well done. Good actors (first Potente and Fürmann) and some good ideas made me happy. Perhaps I would not be so sure if it were not a German film, but who cares? Nice to see familiar faces in a good, exciting story, with blood and good jokes. You all complain about duplication: I have not seen the duplicate version (of course), but I think that it’s not easy for you to watch duplicate movies. We (the Germans) are used to watching such films, so this is not a big problem. But try to look in German with subtitles. The actors are really good!
