Perhaps this movie was supposed to be just funny. Perhaps it was intended to excite teenage boys from all nudity. But what I learned from this was, in fact, what many believe. Namely: "The good guys end up last." <br /> <br /> In “Angelic Heart” there is a line from the character of Lisa Bonet, who says: “It takes a bad ass to make the girl's heart beat faster.” True. More likely. Women always say that they need flowers, sweets, politeness and all that. But (at least at an early age) they end up choosing a handsome, slimy, disrespectful, untamed guy. The one they know, they can't follow their convictions. And this is part of the attraction In the end, what's so interesting about a guy like you already wanted see it? I suppose it could have happened to Boaz Davidson. And what he has to say in this film, which is masked by sex, nude, parties, and everything else that teenagers can relate to, is that you break your heart. It happens to everyone, and it will happen to you. And this is a strong last statement in the film. But, having said all this, the film is hilarious. It is funny and rather well shows the tricks of high school students. <br /> <br /> This is a rare film that is elegant enough to please the youth crowd, which it serves, but at the same time smart enough and perceptive to show what it is; how to break your heart. No high school movie has ever done it better. As I said, I think that writers should have experienced a situation like this first-hand. Maybe all of us. <br /> <br /> This is an old film, but if you ever meet him gathering dust on a shelf in your local video store one night, pick it up, you might be surprised. It's damn better than Never Been Kissed.
