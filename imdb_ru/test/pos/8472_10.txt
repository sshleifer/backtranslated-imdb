Ray is one of those movies that makes you stop. You actually think about what you heard or think about what you read about this person, and it doesn't even come close. During my first viewing of Ray, I forgot that I was watching a movie, I felt like a peeping volume watching this man’s life through the window. This film is so convincing that it delays you and includes every emotion you experience during an emotional rollercoaster ride, and when it ends, you don’t want to do it again so soon, because it has such an emotional impact. in other films are missing. Jamie Fox deserved his Oscar and rightfully so that his performance is impressive, and this should be considered the standard for anyone who wants to make a biographical image in the near future. This film is as good as the subject, and earned the title of classic and legend.
