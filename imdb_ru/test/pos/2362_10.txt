Two unfortunate but cunning ladies decide to behave like WATERS OF HAVANA, going to Cuba to meet and blackmail rich gentlemen ... <br /> <br /> It was such an ephemeral comic fripper that studios made quite easily during 1930 s. The well-made and very pleasant audience of the Depression, it seems, could not get enough of these popular, funny photo-dramas. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondel and Glenda Farrell perfectly played crazy, fast-talking women who would go to great lengths to do a little dishonest test. Although Joan receives both the best bills and romantic scenes, both girls are as talented and watchable as they are magnificent. <br /> <br /> A handsome Lyle Talbot plays a dedicated fan of Joan, but he has relatively little to do. Plump, Cherubic Guy Kibby appears as the girls' intended target. Regardless of whether he wakes up to be in the wrong bed, or is pursued on the roof of the Cuban hacienda in his long foot soldiers, he is equally cheerful. He is followed by a number of acting characters — Allen Jenkins, Frank McHugh, Ruth Donnelly, Hobart Cavanaugh, Maud Abern, Dewey Robinson — all equally adept at pleasing the toughest crowd. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers recognize uncredited James Murray as a suspicious cashier with a fake check. This very talented actor was dragged out of complete obscurity to play a major role in King Vidor’s movie “The Crowd” (1928), one of the most prestigious films of the era of silence. Hope was great for a great career, but his celebrity quickly disappeared with sound pictures. After a long series of tiny roles and scattered roles, ravaged and destitute, his life ended in the waters of the New York River in 1936. He was only 35 years old. <br /> <br /> Although he was not a star of the first rank, Joan Blondel (1906-1979) and Glenda Farrell (1904-1971) animated many films on Warner Bros. during the 1930s, especially the eight in which they appeared together. Playing gold miners or working girls, reporters or secretaries, these blond and copper ladies were almost always suitable for any leader who was fortunate enough to have equal scores with them. Sage or gaze their characters showed that they are ready to take over the world - and any person in it. Never being as arrogant as Paramount's Mae West, you always had the feeling that, despite all its toughness, Blondell & Farrell used their resilience to protect vulnerable hearts that were ready to break the right guy. While many performances seven decades ago today look indecent or far-fetched, these two beautiful ladies are still energetic and sassy.
