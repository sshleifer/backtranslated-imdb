Now, guys, listen, I love this movie, although not as much as “Goodbye, King”, another favorite epic of John Milius. It was fun, much more than if it was based on the Tennessee Williams drama. This is a great yarn with a smell of political correctness. I love this film for its beautiful photo, its humor and its soft criticism of the bad guys (Berbers) and the REAL bad guys, spearmen for the acquisitive "civilized" world, with their repetitive rifles, artillery and large gunboats. there in the harbor. <br /> <br /> An outstanding scene is a Berber camp with blue-gray smoke from bonfires rising into the cold desert air. It is visually eloquent, very memorable. <br /> <br /> Established in Morocco in 1904, WIND is a helpless American woman (Candice Bergen) who was taken hostage by a dashing, albeit immodest, Berber thug (Sean Connery, a very model of Scottish Muslim nomad). An exciting story based on several historical facts. The picture is beautiful for Milius, underlined by Jerry Goldsmith's outstanding assessment. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Pedikaris and Raisuli lead a protracted prelude and jump in the desert between oases. Despite the fact that Raisuli proudly traces his ancestry to monkeys, he is an excellent gentleman - he even allows her to hold her head after she hits him at chess! Marine detachment stormed the palace Bashou, extinguishes the fires of competing hegemons with gasoline. Don't mess with the hull, Abdul. <br /> <br /> There are many entertaining stereotypes: <br /> <br /> The Ugly Sultan is reminiscent of a scattered ferret. Definitely not a liberal. <br /> <br /> A brutal German officer - a large militant dachshund with a monocle He gallantly decides to fight Raisuli with swords instead of shooting him in the manner of Indiana Jones. A duty of nobility, through Von Clausewitz? <br /> <br /> Lihiy Marine Officer - knocks the shit out of Bash of the Tangier army and stormed his palace, chewing tobacco. His speech is moderately aphasic. Bashai begged him not to breathe. <br /> <br /> Berbers - hordes of humiliated sycophants led by charming delusions of grandeur. None of them take a bath, except, perhaps, camel urine. <br /> <br /> President Teddy Roosevelt is undeservedly depicted as useless and preoccupied with weapons, toys, and stuffed grizzly bears. <br /> <br /> Beautiful American widow - gives a man a lesson in courage, like her two children. She obviously has a huge stock of clean, starched clothes, and her hair is rarely out of place. <br /> <br /> Raysuli sends a message to Teddy Roosevelt, in which he thanks him for the gift of the Remington recurring rifle, announcing <br /> <br /> “MESTER ROOSWELT, YOU ARE THE LION, AI YOU ARE FUTURE” WIND. "<br /> <br /> How true this is. <br /> <br /> Please do not accept my harsh remarks for not liking the film. I was having so much fun writing how to watch“ Yes, pitcher ".
