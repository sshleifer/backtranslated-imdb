This is a great look, you have to excuse the pun, when 22 women talk about their breasts - theirs, their mother, other women and how they affect many aspects of their lives. Young girls, older women and everything in between (of all shapes, sizes, configurations, etc.) speak of development, reaction, celebration, concealment, breast augmentation or reduction. <br /> <br /> This is a charming, delightfully sad, funny and all that between the Interviews with documentary footage and clips from those famous old "films about young women" that the girls took to the dining room to watch, the interview is an exciting window for men who love women and their breasts, in what the other half has to say, when they do not know what you are listening to.
