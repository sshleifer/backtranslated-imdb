A stunning and thoughtful look at the modern life of young people in Japan, like “Sand Grains”, in a subtle and significant way considers issues such as rape, homosexuality and hair loss. This gives an idea of ​​the youth culture, fighting for self-determination beyond the generation of their parents, with its strict conformity and facade. Typically for Japanese cinema, often what is not said is more important than those who do not understand Japanese cinema and culture. This may seem boring and minimalistic (almost like every movie that comes out of the Japanese bar Mangas) if you don’t know what to look for. I first saw it when I was 15 years old, and it was precisely this that initially caused my interest in Japan, its culture and language. Given that I am now 22 years old and I have been studying Japanese with the intention of living there for 2 years, it goes without saying that this is a powerful film. Enjoy!
