Photographing and film editing are exceptional for a given period of time. Eisenstein relies on every scene of the film leading to the rebellion of the sailor and the slaughter in the city. Although the film is a stellar event in cinema, it is also an example of socialist realism. by 1925, the Soviet government was actively using art, including cinema, as a means of spreading the message of the revolution. Eisensteins image of the uprising on the battleship Potempkin offers the viewer an understanding of the message of the Soviet elite. Marxist theory and class struggle perspectives are demonstrated as sailors representing oppressed workers and officers representing the elite of society. Most of the film demonstrates the message of the Communist Party and how the film was used as a propaganda tool.
