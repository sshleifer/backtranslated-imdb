Tipping the Velvet (2002) (television) was directed by Jeffrey Sachs for BBC television. The main plot is the story of the protagonist Nan Astley, who is well played by Rachel Sterling. In his teens, Nan works in his oyster family home. Everyone expects her to stay at home, then marry a suitable husband and take up family life. Nan also expects this. <br /> <br /> Things change when Nan meets Kitty Butler (Keely Howes), a beautiful and talented performer who wears men's clothes and wins the hearts of her audience. The audience includes Nan, who is sexually attracted by Kitty in such a way that she is not attracted by her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film follows Nan to London and through her (like) ups and downs (terrible) as lesbians, and sometimes as a copycat. <br /> <br /> As is typical for the BBC, every role, regardless of its size, is played by a different actor. The BBC has a depth and breadth of performers that are truly amazing. None of the support actors stand out in my head - they were equally good. Both Sterling and Howes are wonderful, and their acting is carried along by the film. <br /> <br /> It is always sad to remind you how hard life can be for a person who does not fit into society for a normal one. I know that itâ€™s not easy for lesbians even in the USA, even today. Imagine the obstacles of love and happiness for lesbians in Victorian England. We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go.
