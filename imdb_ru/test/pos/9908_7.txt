This film was recently shown with subtitles, not duplication, on the Australian Special Broadcasting Service. I thought I read here that sometimes there is an assumption that Revenge of the Rats is a continuation. In fact, the rats are taking revenge for what happens in this film or in the history of mankind. As far as I know, there is no prequel. <br /> <br /> And now let's get rid of the Led Hamelnitsu from the road. Perhaps this tale came to my mind when I watched a movie, but that's all. At the end of the film the word "chests" was used. The stunned mayor is trying to justify his actions, saying that "the chests were empty." “Chests” is not a word that you often hear these days, unless you read folk tales to your children, like me. Since I watched Revenge of the Rats, I have read two versions of the Pied Piper from Hamelin. Now I see a comparison. Metaphorical fat, but literally ugly mayor promises more than the city can afford to get rid of rats. This is about as far as I can follow the analogy. Children do not lead to the mountain door, and one lame boy tells about the land of winged horses and fountains, where there is always spring, and everyone is always happy. <br /> <br /> A lot of that is quite popular about this movie. Romance and resolution especially. Female characters play a potentially powerful role in society, but in fact they are completely powerless. Where this film is quite rebellious (compared to American cinema) is anti-authoritarian. The helicopter pilot was dismissed by the mayor for “good”. The mayor and the local government are depicted as corrupt and indulge in big money. Finally, one doctor in Frankfurt has to tackle the epidemic of a deadly and contagious disease. Apparently, there is no national authority on infectious diseases that would coordinate or send them back. <br /> <br /> I’m not a fan of horror, so any horror I see is usually mixed with humor. Right from the rat in the blood bank, you can see that most viewers will have the right balance of horror and comedy; The sheer number of rats is impressive, and horror fans seem to be happy too.
