This is one of those Tweety and Sylvester cartoons that made this legendary couple second after Bugs Bunny in terms of Looney Tunes popularity. <br /> <br /> Besides the fact that this duo has all the backup situations (Sylvester eats from the garbage) cans, the line “I say that I gloss over myself”, etc., Granny also plays in SOS Tweety which is one of those types of support characters that these Warner Bros. classics had in abundance to enrich their color and taste. This time the cat and the bird are on board the ocean liner, and the plugs taken from this situation are creative and alive. <br /> <br /> What a day in the history of cartoons, when Freese Freleng decided to create a pair with his Sylvester with a dead little yellow bird by Robert Clampett.
