Here is how I interpreted the film: first things first. There was not a single scene in the film where you can see how the bad guy (Taylor) torments or nails Ben's hands to the wall. However, the same cannot be said about girls. In the end, you see Taylor disappear as he walks. Looks like there was a message "Taylor was not." And the whole movie was Ben's imagination. In addition, there was no scene during the painful moments when one of the girls faces or is in the same frame as Ben. It was Taylor all the time. But actually Taylor was Ben. If they were two different people, then why wasn’t there a scene showing them both in the same frame in terrible times? But, of course, before that, you see them both together, and THIS chewing gum is just Ben's imagination at work. In addition, when Ben was not in prison, the text on the screen clearly indicates that Ben’s story was unreal, and there was no such place as he explained (read mine, cars, etc.). Even after Liz Hunter leaves Christy and returns to find Ben, she does not find him. What for??? Because Ben (Taylor) was looking for girls. Instead, Christie has all the time in the world to check out Taylor's webcam (Ben), photos, etc ... <br /> <br /> Somehow, it all comes down to the fact that Christy and Liz , they both knew that Taylor was Ben. So, I came to the conclusion that Ben was a schizophrenic, and the film in which you see him and Taylor in one frame was just a figment of his imagination. Otherwise, if Taylor really were, they would have to find him, given all the detailed explanations coming from Ben.
