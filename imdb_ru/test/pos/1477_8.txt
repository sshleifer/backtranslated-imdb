From the beginning, you'll love Sam Elliot's character (Falon): a trustworthy cop who is especially loyal to his partner. But too loyal and too vindictive when he sees his partner dead in the alley, because then he kills the one he considered the attacker before giving him a chance to explain. Falon is an alcoholic, and this inclines him to self-control, although he manages to direct his attention to finding out who is really behind the death of his partners. He takes a newcomer with him as his new partner (which seems too often to be seen in films), but Esay Morales succeeds with Sam Elliott, although the mysterious fragments begin to correspond to where Morales begins a self-established investigation into Falon; he basically wants to find answers, because Fallon does not let him understand the whole story, and he does not like what he finds. There at the last minute shows who the bad detectives are, which is normal; and they cannot force Falon to join them, which will lead to a dramatic end. Perfectly behaves with a touch of humor from Paul Sorvino, captain of detective stories. This is a good film that makes you want to watch it several times; so it can be called "sure to look" and a good addition to the film collection! (Filmed in San Francisco)
