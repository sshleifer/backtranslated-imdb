Overall, I give this film a worthy 7.6. To begin with, I will say that I like how the character is depicted and adapts to the screen. If you read comics from time to time or just watch the DVD supplements, you will see that the Blade character is completely different from the one we see in the film. Among the changes, Blade is now half as important as a vampire, and therefore acquires "all his strengths, but not his weaknesses." This is the merit of David Goyer, a fan of the dark genre of comics. Thanks to him, Blade has become a much more interesting character, and I consider him one of my favorite antiheroes. Wesley Snipes was born to play this role, although some probably suffered Desenel Washington or Will Smith (laughs). His acting here doesn't have to be exactly Oscar-winning, given his character, but I'm glad that he decides to play DayWalker in two sequels. Also starring Steven Dorff in the role of our main villain and Chris Christofferson in the role of Alfred Blade, so to speak. The game is really good, and the action supports the plot for sure. The first scene in the club is one of my favorite parts, which I have to say. As in this film, there are a few things that bother me, that they remove something like “Spiderman” or “X-Men” from this movie rating. Stephen Norrington portrayed the villains as I did not really like it, to be honest. Their stories were so full of comedy that I didn’t look like a comic strip movie. Plus “La Magra” is a bit disappointing as the last villain, but an intense sword fight compensates for this, I think. Not to mention the feeling of additional unrealism: a black man in a leather coat with a sword who fired from a cop among a policeman in bright daylight, somehow unnoticeable for passing by crowds, seemed a bit ... well .. dumb. Moving away from several of his flaws, the music of Mark Isham was magnificent and perfectly fit into the film. Fortunately, all these problems have been fixed and improved in the stunning continuation of "Blade 2".
