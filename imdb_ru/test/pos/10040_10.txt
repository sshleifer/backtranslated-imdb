Although "They died in boots" is not quite historically accurate, it is a very interesting western. Flynn is not only the perfect Custer, but the characters' actors are great. In addition to the action movies in the movie, Flynn and De Havilland's love scenes are very touching and believable (Flynn and De Havilland loved each other very much in real life). Flynn was always tortured for not being taken seriously, so that he knew that there were very few actors who could play the characters he played and play them well!
