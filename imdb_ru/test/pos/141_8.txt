i hate vampire movies. With that said, this one was very interesting to me. I want to point out one thing. “Bakjwi” literally means “bat” in Korean, and we all know that in many classic vampire stories you see how Count Dracula or vampires turn into bats and fly away or fly. We also know that bats are mammals that can fly, so many classify them as “exceptional.” When I watched the movie, I realized that the bat theme was deeply rooted in this film more than just to establish the connection between the bat and the vampire. <br /> <br /> The duality of human nature = if you ever read the fables of Aesop, there is one fable where mammals and birds fight, and the bat simply cannot take a side, and it tries to play both sides to its advantage. Mammals and birds learn what this bat did, and at the end of the story they drive the bat out of their lands. <br /> <br /> Two opposite sides of human nature are constantly fighting throughout the film, for example. Sang-Hen's priest's blind friend, San-Hen's attempt to quench his thirst and his sexual desire, ta-joo plays both sides, her usual dull life against her adventures in search of thrills, etc. (do not spoil too much, you will have to watch a movie), and this topic is beautifully presented on a plate with the delightful sides of romance, sex, violence, religion, dark comedy, tragedy, revenge, you name it! <br /> <br /> I feel that many I find this film dull and too long, but this film is very fresh and new, which I have not seen in b4. I would not say that this is the best work of CW Park, but this is mos. delayed is the strangest to understand, but gloomily intriguing!
