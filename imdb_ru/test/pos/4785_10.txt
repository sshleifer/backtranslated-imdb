Steamboat Willy was not the first cartoon with Mickey Mouse. The first film in which the American girlfriend was filmed was Mad Plane. "Plane Crazy" was released on May 15, 1928 in Hollywood, California, in the format of a silent film. “Steamboat Willy” was released on November 18, 1928 as a sound film (it was also released on July 29, 1928 as a silent film), thus making “Steamboat ..” the first sound film about Mickey, but NOT the first movie for a small American mouse. Although many game shows used the question: “What was the first appearance of Mickey Mouse?” The real answer is “Airplane is crazy” and not “Steamboat Willie.” These dates can be checked for IMDb in the "release dates" section.
