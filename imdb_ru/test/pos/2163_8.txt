Just watched this movie, and it's not bad; There are several tense moments and not many long lines of dialogue. It turns out pretty clever; fastpaced almost like "documentary style". This film will cause some nostalgia and a bit of paranoia of the Cold War with cars, street scenes and life in the 50s. The game is pretty solid, and for 85 minutes of running, it runs at a good pace. The atomic era movie buff should not miss it.
