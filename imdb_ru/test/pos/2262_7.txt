Everything is lit. A young Jewish American is looking for a woman who helped his grandfather avoid persecution of the Nazis, going on a cross-European tour with some unlikely partners. <br /> <br /> Liev Schreiber makes his debut in a director with playful longing. associated with his acting spirit. When successful actors decide to sit in the director's chair, we usually get a biographical look at the soul under the current mask - Check. We usually get a mix of genres - Check. But what we usually do not get is an insightful original film that is trustworthy, intelligent and touching. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood plays Jonathan, an inquisitive young man who collects bits of his life along the way. He is on a mission to find a woman in a photo. The picture in sepia depicts his grandfather (a strange resemblance to him) and a woman. To help his journey, he enlisted the help of guides, which include hip-hop-break-dance Alex (Eugene Hutz), his apathetic and irritated grandfather (Boris Leskin) and his dog - Sammy Davis Jr. What follows is essentially a comedy. There is a simple intro with offscreen comments. Alex is especially funny because he teaches his younger brother in 1969, proving how popular he is with chicks and break dancing, thus putting him as an antithesis of Jonathan. <br /> <br /> Schreiber begins to break characters. As they develop, comedy acts as a deliberate curtain of the story of three people associated with the Holocaust who do not really know themselves. All three hold the film with tenderness and authenticity, that Schreiber is unlikely to be mistaken, and just as charming and fantastic as the film, the horrors that can be broken, i.e. The past is presented in an almost acceptable tone even more disturbing. <br /> <br /> When an unlikely group finally finds a city that is looking for, they will learn about true atrocities and learn a lot about who they really are. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood is as authentic as ever, showing his usual innocence and power on the screen. Formally, the inhabitant of good in the Lord of the Rings and the abode of evil in the City of Sins, he plays Jonathan with aplomb, because he is bombarded with cultural upheavals and the search for truth. Boris Leskin, as a grandfather, also with humor and confidence expresses his melancholy and disappointment towards young people, as his own past is falling apart. However, it is Eugene Hutz in the role of Alex, who makes the show. The director used this old interpretation of the misunderstanding of the translation to create and maintain humor, which is actually funny and not useless. <br /> <br /> Schreiber made his debut in an enchanting spirit that has heart and soul. Continuous counting and beautiful photos create a fabulous haze around the story of personality, truth and family. If there was a complaint, it would be the speed with which the film changes direction; although it could be intentional, it may not be suitable for everyone. However, this is a grandiose effort that provides excellent comedy and connection between an unlikely group, while at the same time completely redefining another aspect of the horrors of World War II. <br /> <br /> -Chi & Ojo
