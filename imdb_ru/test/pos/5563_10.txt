One of the greatest crimes against science fiction television was the abolition of Farscape. This is one of the most well-written, well-played and comprehensive best shows in radio wave history, it sets new standards for science fiction television. One day, the flagship, the highest rated, critically acclaimed Sci-Fi Channel, defies explanation for why shows like Buffy, Tremors: The Series and even StarGate: SG-1 went on as long as they did. Yes, even Buffy. But I will save my Buffy, shocked at another time. The Sci-Fi channel was bad for Farscape, it was constantly thrown into the schedule, repetitions were rarely shown and never advertised. But although the show was canceled, everyone involved in its creation wants to bring it back (even Bens Henson, CEO of the Henson Company). There is also an extensive fan movement to bring the show back. In general, everything looks far away from the dark, and I hope the fans will get their season 5.
