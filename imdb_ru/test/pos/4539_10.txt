This is one of my all time favorite movies of all time. Are you talking pretty sorry? Well, yes, it is. But Chris is incredible, incredibly funny. His innocent brilliance is manifested in this film more than in any other film of his. Look at both scenes in the motel when Spade is caught with a zipper downstairs and the other: “JUST LEAVE FOR LOVE OF GOD !!!”
