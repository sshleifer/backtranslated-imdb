A close-knit musical family, a capricious benevolent father and four living daughters of a teenager, are firstly caused by the appearance of Felix, a dashing young composer, and, secondly, the deepest, Mickey, his brazenly attractive orchestral friend. <br /> <br /> Michael Curtis needs some time to make this piece of Americana float. The first part looks almost like rehashing a commercial about cereals, not without some strange, very bourgeois charm, and then John Garfield enters the scene like a doomed Mickey, first appearing in movies with disheveled black curls, sleepy, hung eyes, rough and disheveled the absolute opposite of smoothly convincing, insanely charming Felix Jeffrey Lynn. Garfield is ready, and REALLY needed, as opposed to the rest of the family (“I wouldn’t do anything that wouldn’t surprise me,” he muses), and suddenly the film becomes interesting, although I agree with critics who believe the plot unfolds not motivated enough. <br /> <br /> The four sisters were rather gently played and seriously signed, but Claude Raines, like the Surname family, has his moments. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye out for Garfield, although it is only a really durable thing about it.
