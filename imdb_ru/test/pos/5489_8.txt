Wolfgang Peterson's “line of fire” is a tricky and sometimes truly snow-white trip, even if once or twice we might feel that we were already on similar roads. As it is impossible, if Clint Eastwood, immediately after (allegedly) closing the book about his Western heritage, will most likely close the book in his detective photographs (do not count "Blood Labor" there). But there is more because Eastwood's character, brutal, demon-possessed and hard as a nail secret service agent, has a slightly enchanting side, even more romantic, that has never been seen in photographs where he breathed out his trademark line. Some difficulties are taking place here that do not depend on ordinary conceit, and it is noteworthy that such a possibly invented story (which did not save Kennedy from murder in '63) was made somewhat believable among the rest. his person, who most likely hides his wounds - most of the time. However, Eastwood is sent to the city to express himself in the film, and in these circumstances, the character looks specifically for him. <br /> <br /> But there is a risk that his role in the film will be insignificant. the usual ones (we still get “Harry” scenes where he is smarter and smarter than everyone else in the room, and he is scolded and asked to retreat from the top management, the chief of staff here), including the defense of the president, whom (wisely) we never see and do not know at all. Even a romantic plot that looks undercooked, if someone laughs at courage, would make the picture a bit different than if another quasi-dirty Harry appeared in the picture: an indelible villain. This time there is some kind of extra Hollywood wait, but incredibly intelligent wait (almost smarter than the rest of the film deserves), with the character “John Booth” played in the performance nominated for Oscar John Malkovich, as the person who is more called predator than a killer. There are ways that this can go wrong with Eastwood's character, but Malkovich may surpass some of his former fellow villains, being extremely cool and not gathered (there is that destructive, terrible scene where he kills the bank teller and her neighbor room), and as it turns out his past, there is still an element of “what the hell is with this guy” that makes the audience and agent Eastwood guess and deprive the paranoid. This is a classic performance of Malkovich, typically creepy and always measured by the level of madness and professionalism. <br /> <br /> Aside from the usual moments, this is just an elegant picture from Peterson and company, and they look quite attractive. is close to Don Siegel's fluffy realism. But Peterson also has a couple of cinematic tricks up his sleeve that sometimes made me smile; every time someone expresses such a blatant but exciting reverence for dizziness - jumping from roof to roof, the hero dangles from the ledge, “turning” - he still makes me shiver in my back. There are also telephone conversations between Eastwood and Malkovich, where we see the depths of the cat-and-mouse game, perhaps another blow to the ribs in relation to Hitkok. But in the end, even with all the excitement, brutal danger and a clear formalism in the climax, these are also characters in some ways everywhere, and everything is completely understandable, to give viewers an excellent amount of thought, at least in the sense of an unknown movie . Eastwod is a great leadership, Rousseau plays the possible love of a woman, sincere and mature, and Malkovich is the pinnacle of popularity. It also has some notable supporting roles and a good studio score. One of the best films of 1993.
