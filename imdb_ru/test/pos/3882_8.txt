In the early scene, Luke (David Pasquessi) and James (Jeff Garlin) walk down a neighbor’s street in Chicago, admiring the bucolic architecture when a woman passes by, angrily arguing in French on her mobile phone, prompting James to Note: “There’s nothing hot, than the evil Frenchwoman. " A few blocks later, they pass an old Filipino woman, also angry, also arguing on a mobile phone, and Luka notices for reference effect: "There is nothing hotter than an evil elderly Filipino woman." <br /> <br /> Jeff Garlin's humor "I want someone to eat cheese with" was best described by the word "banana." The film is a conversation. We could also eavesdrop. Instead of going for antics, the film relies on character flaws and human curiosity to deliver laughter. Although he is not innovative, he is far from trivial, and even if James considers himself rather thin, we know that he is rather average, and this upsets him. <br /> <br /> Self-improvement is the main theme of the film. Sarah Silverman, who plays Beth, is great as a catalyst for change; she enlivens James, and therefore reminds him to live better. However, achieving some idyllic dream is not the end of these characters, but something simpler: they can pick up what is in the life they love, just to save at least enough for themselves to continue. <Br /> <br /> A life lesson movie can be overwhelmed because he may forget to contact his audience. I want someone to eat cheese with delicate and attractive, and although its morality may not inspire, it is still resonant. This is a modest comedy, but it will stay with you.
