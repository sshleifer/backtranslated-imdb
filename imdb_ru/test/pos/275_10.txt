I, like many others, took it as a child, and I liked it, and it frightened me until I came of age. I tried to find this film and even looked for it to ever play on television again, since it was originally played on US networks. Does anyone know where to buy this film, or does anyone have one and want to make a copy for me? Also, does anyone know if there is a chance that he will be shown on TV again? Maybe all of us fans should write a radio station in the hope that it will go on the air again. I don’t think they did a good job of promoting this film in the past, because no one knows about it, people only know about Stepford’s wives and Stepford’s men. No one is familiar with the fact that there was a children's version. Maybe they should also redo it, since they seem to be doing this a lot lately with a lot of my favorite old thrillers / horror films. Well, if someone has any comments, please, I ask you to write me with information. Thanks Tyra tcampo23@aol.com
