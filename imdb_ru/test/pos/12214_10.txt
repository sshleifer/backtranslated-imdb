I do not believe that sixty percent of voters voted for this show for ten, now, how the hell is rating five five eight, it's impossible, I don’t understand, it’s completely pitiful, I mean how. In any case, the show is great, the story is gorgeous, and the characters are interesting, definitely ten out of ten from me, I think the creatures are great, they look great, and I wish I had a great Nimrod show. Much remained unanswered in the first season, and when Nimrod becomes even more, since the other creatures are huge, again, why the rating is so low, when the voices were so high <br /> <br /> 10/10
