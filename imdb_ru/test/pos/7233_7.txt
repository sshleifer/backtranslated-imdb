This film is really sick and funny. I made my friends cringe, describing it to them. I saw it about 8 months ago, and I still have the song "Should we pack up on the river", echoing in my head. <br /> <br /> In general, this is “Romero and Juliet,” but it goes beyond what you expect. Let's say, incest, references to child abuse, blood (of course), but, unfortunately, it has a kind of happy ending ... sort of ... it's more strange than happy. Kappi Kapulet was great! He has such an intellectual snobbish tone, he is offensive, but civilized. He quotes more Shakespeare than anyone else in the film ... all the while doing his sadistic role as husband and father. <br /> <br /> The meat guy was pretty cool too. He was Juliet's fiancé, deeply attracted to her, and was soon overwhelmed with grief over Thromeo. And Tromeo, a real romantic. He is a handsome, very sweet guy, desperately seeking true love. “She makes torches to burn brightly!” Unfortunately, Trome just had to resort to this terrible fake green vomit and their other antics. Sometimes they are really addicted to it. But hey, this film made a big impression on me. How often do I refer to this in real life situations ... wow, that's a pity. <br /> <br /> In any case, enjoy!
