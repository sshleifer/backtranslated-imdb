In one of the best youthful comedies filmed in the 1980s, there is a young Nicolas Cage starring in the Valley Girl. Deborah Foreman is hilarious as an object of desire Cage (and what happened to her?). Look for veteran actors Colleen Camp and Frederick Forrest as Julie's hippie parents - they are pretty funny!
