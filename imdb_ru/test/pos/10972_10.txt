MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a stunning film that is both predictable and unpredictable. You know that the characters, having learned that the so-called "Gift from God" was actually a loan, will return the money and that everyone will be happy at the end, but how they get there is not so obvious. Scenes are often funny and sometimes touching, because the characters value their lives and where they go. The composition of veteran actors is more than just a trip through nostalgia. Frank Gorshin, Shirley Jones and Cloris Lichman argue that they are capable of more than playing Riddler, Mother Partridge or girlfriend Mary Phyllis, while Jill Eikenberry and Wendy Malik play characters different from those we saw . The image of the nun Ursula Burton is both touching and funny, not laughing at the nuns or the church. If you're looking for a movie with a great cast, good music (including Shirley Jones’s “The Way You Look Tonight”) and an inspiring finale, try this movie. I do not think you will be disappointed.
