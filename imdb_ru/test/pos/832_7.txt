This film is good in its genre, and this genre is naturally action with a small / medium budget. It seems that Van Damme shows much better results when he is led by a good director. This is your main bar brawl, lane scene and basically a lot of gun fighting. Some basic drama, but not too deep. Isaac of Florence directs clicking "OK" if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it. But the man who steals the show: <br /> <br /> Scott Adkins. How is it that this guy is not the massive fighter of Arnold Schwarzenegger, whom I do not know. Director Isaac Florentin starred in the film with Scott Adkins before that, entitled “Special Forces” (2003), in which there are incredible martial arts talents who will satisfy the most demanding kung fu enthusiasts. Another amazing feature of Scott Adkins is Undisputed 2. Look at this guy and make noise, this guy needs to get super action movie status, and he should get it now! <br /> <br /> What else can I say about the movie? This is Van Damme taking a step forward in some of his latest works. No Oscar is definitely not here, but you already knew that. But, nevertheless, he has a good feeling of a small town, and I could find the worst ways to spend time. Thus, I give it 7 points out of 10 in my genre.
