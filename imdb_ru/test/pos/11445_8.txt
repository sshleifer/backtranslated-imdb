Kevin Tenney's The Night of the Demons is a pleasant horror film that reminds me a bit of The Evil Dead. On the night of Hallowen, a group of teenagers are having a party at Hull House, an abandoned funeral home on the outskirts of the city. Led by Angela, they conduct a seance-like ceremony and occasionally awaken the evil spirits inhabiting this place. One after another, the uninvited force of evil seizes teenagers, turning them into bloodthirsty demons. "Night of the Demons" - a perfect horror movie. It's scary, bloody and rather atmospheric. The characters are well developed, and the blood of Steve Johnson is pretty good. Awful piercing, bitten off tongue, fingers tucked into the eye sockets, etc. The scene where Suzanna (Linnaea Quigley) pushes a tube of lipstick through her nipple is a scream. Give this look. It is followed by two continuations.
