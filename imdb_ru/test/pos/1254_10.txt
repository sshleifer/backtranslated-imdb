Now for sure, this is one of the most carefree stories in which Bruce Willis was still, and yet - she is still touching. I really like Bruce’s style and personality, I didn’t like everything he’s ever been in, but he brings it to “Big Time” for me in all his films. <br /> <br /> The story begins ..... He is the strength, confidence and style with a capital of 'S'. He drives a Porsche, he lives well, in a luxurious estate with a magnificent view of the fair town. This is Russell Duritz. He is an image consultant for those on top or rising to it. His confession is Russell Duritz, he knows what it takes to do this. It just seems that, as life goes quickly and thoroughly, there is a problem, an intruder in his house, the alarm has been activated! <br /> <br /> Russell cannot understand (at the moment) what is happening to him. This is different, and yet it is somehow familiar. A little boy who looks just like him. As their lives hit each other, it seems that there is a reason that shouts to him: “Now you have an unfinished business that you need to take care of!” <br /> <br /> Amy, supporting the young lady from history is probably the best balance he has seen and has in his life. She works with him, puts up with his ego, and yet, she is smitten with Russell. Even more. With Rusty, his past "I", which is now depicted in the picture, and he speaks a mile a minute, sings too late at night, everything that was fundamental turns into jelly! <br /> <br /> Willis is cheerful, self-centered, and sometimes ill at ease in this cute modern Disney classic “The Kid”, and, adding his own small super-powerful side impact, Spencer Breslin is the perfect complement to this sparkling childhood story for an adult back to the kid's adventure. Chi McBride is an inspirational support character, as he is a heavyweight champion, teaching “little” Rusty how to box to protect himself from the bullies on the playground. <br /> <br /> In general, this is the real winner of the film, in which even Lilly Tomlin is Russell’s secretary and assistant. Initially, I saw it back in 2000, and then years later, with equal pleasure. This is a brilliant family comedy with a super-final that will warm the hearts of any Disney fan. Highly recommended (*****)
