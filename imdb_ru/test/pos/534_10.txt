When I was 15, I enjoyed this movie! I treated character Ann August more than most. My mother is not as eccentric as Adele, but her feelings of loneliness are the same. This film is perfect for pleasant moments, and the performances of Natalie and Susan are so interconnected that this is the best screen counterpart I've seen in recent years. Their chemistry animates the characters, they become real people! I would recommend this movie to anyone who hopes to leave. Because there are a lot of people who want to be "anywhere, but here," including me! and if you can, watch this movie with your best friend or mom. These are tears that blend everyone around you more !!
