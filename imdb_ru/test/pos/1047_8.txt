A journalist who writes about life in her farmhouse, when she actually lives in an apartment in New York, should come up with a plan when she finds out that her publisher and war hero will spend Christmas with her. After a slow start, he turns into a funny little comedy with baseball balls thanks to the wonderful cast. In a large deviation from her previous role as a femme fatale in "Double Atonement," Stanwick demonstrates a good comedic talent. Morgan is a good-natured war hero, and Greenstreet is a publisher. However, Sacall steals the film as a cook trying to master English by talking with an almost incomprehensible European accent.
