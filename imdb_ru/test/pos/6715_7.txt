Lifeforce begins in outer space, where HMS Churchill tracks comet Hayley, and her equipment detects a 150-mile-long spacecraft in the comet's head, unable to communicate with Earth due to interference Col. Tom Carlsen (Steve Railsback) decides that this is the only chance to investigate it. Going out in spacesuits, Carlsen and some of his crew enter the mysterious spacecraft and find the remains of a bat, like a race of creatures and three perfectly looking humanoids, two men (Chris Jagger and Bill Malin) and a beautiful woman (Matilda May). Whom they take aboard Churchill. Thirty days later, Churchill was found on the radar and back to Earth, the rescue mission is sent only to discover that the spacecraft has been burned and the entire crew is supposedly dead. However, the rescue team finds three aliens, humanoids, and returns them to Earth, where, at the center of space research in London, they return to life and literally suck the life force from human sacrifices, which then, in turn, must do the same to stop turning into dust, everything looks gloomy, as the epidemic spreads throughout London ... <br /> <br /> This English production was created by the notorious Menahem Golan & Yoram Globus, which in the early 80s were responsible for a lot of cheap low-budget action videos under their production company Cannon, which usually starred Chuck Norris, and they wanted to go over a long time and signed a contract with director Tob Hooper, signing a contract for three films (it was a remake of Lifeforce, Invaders from Mars (1986) and The Texas) Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986), a continuation of Hooper's classics) that failed and bankrupted Golan, Globus and Cannon. In any case, despite the commercial failure at the box office, I must say that I think that Lifeforce is a very pleasant, albeit rather stupid, sci-fi horror. Originally released in theaters in the 85th year, Lifefore was shortened to 101 minutes by Golan and Globus, but over the past few years, a longer 116-minute cut has practically replaced it with DVD, VHS, Laserdisc & TV, although, apparently, the original Hooper's cut The film lasted 128 minutes, so there are still frames somewhere. I will base my comments on a longer 116-minute cut, the scripts of Dan O'Bannon, Don Jacobi, and Michael Armstrong and Olaf Pulley's uncredited rewrites based on the 1976 novel Cosmic Vampires by Colin Wilson, and there are many unusual ideas in it really ambitious, and everyone felt that in the end it was a bit of a mess, but damn interesting. It moves like a rocket, and in the depths of the soul there is a really interesting story, although the film is confused. There are also some funny moments in Lifeforce, when a security guard tries to convince a naked female vampire to give up, offering her half-eaten cookies, these are real classics of the camp, horribly overloaded hypnosis scenes, including a scene in which Reilsback kisses Patrick Stewart and many, many others . I don’t know, call me strange, but I just thought that Lifeforce was incredibly fun and very exciting in almost every way, from the stupid nature, the strange dialogue, the strange ideas that never come together, and from some of the amazing visual images of Lifeforce, Of course, not a movie that you get bored. <br /> <br /> Director Hooper had a little more money here to play than ever (twice as much as Poltergeist (1982)), and he uses everything to bring this exciting movie to the big screen, John Dykstra, the guy responsible for Star Wars (1977), Star Trek: Cinema (1979) and, most recently, Spider-Man (2002), was involved in visual effects processing and, generally speaking, they look fabulous. The sequences installed in space with space ships, in particular, look great, there are some really good visual effects on Earth, including the destruction of London, when hundreds of blue souls fly everywhere. There is a nude, but not much blood, there are withered corpses, several gunshot wounds, the skin on someone's hand exfoliates, blood splashes from someone's eyes, nose and ears, a severed hand and a zombie. The special effects of makeup are also usually very good. I would not say that Lifeforce is so scary, because it’s more a sci-fi film than horror, I liked how Hooper shoots space shots while he rotates the camera to effectively capture the feeling of weightlessness and that there’s no “solid” floor . <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 25,000,000, it is two times less than in a theatrical production, and did not set the world on fire with a video or DVD, which is a shame. because although it is a bit of a mess, it is very pleasant to watch. Shot on location in England. Well shot in widescreen 2: 35: 1, cropped image 4: 3 is awful and cuts off huge pieces of information on both sides of the screen, this is especially noticeable during the opening scenes in outer space, where it is sometimes difficult to make out what is happening and the feeling of huge space and alien ship lost. Acting in a very stupid film is normal, Patrick Stewart replaced Sir John Gilgud, Nancy Paul replaced Olivia Hussey, Frank Finlay replaced Klaus Kinski, and Anthony Hopkins abandoned the role of Kane. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a strange film. There are no two ways about this in fact, and anyone who is looking for something simple and straightforward should search elsewhere. Anyone looking for something a little different in the science fiction genre than Lifeforce can give a chance, because this is one of those bad movies that are good with some impressive effects, and this is by no means an ordinary film about the mill.
