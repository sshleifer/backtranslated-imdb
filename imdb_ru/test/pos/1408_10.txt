William Haynes ignites this story about a daring cadet who thinks West Point will really be something like that when he arrives. His distinguishing feature was Haynes's amazing comic presentation, which made him the star of the best box office of 1928-1932 and one of the biggest MGM stars. Joan Crawford and William Bakewell are fine too. And although this storyline may now seem trivial, it became a huge hit, putting Heins and Crawford in the history of college football (a national passion in the 20s). After Haynes tears off his big mouth once too often and almost shies away from other cadets, he turns into a wonderful performance when he swallows his pride and enters the big game against the fleet. Even with a broken arm, he wins the game for the army and regains his place at West Point. From this film and The People's Show (with Marion Davis, always underestimated), it's easy to see why Billy Haynes was a huge star of that time. He needs and deserves to be remembered!
