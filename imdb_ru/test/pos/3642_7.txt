The quality of the animation is clearly below IMO, regardless of the age of OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters do not. <br /> <br /> This may seem picky, but given that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines, would you feel there as a person? Can any machine imitate human arrogance, myopia and greed? I doubt. There are some indications of this in the film, but only when the team can bother inserting them, by and large, the “bioids” (or whatever) are interchangeable with human characters. It seems to me sloppy. <br /> <br /> The main characters seem to have some kind of emotional entanglement, although no light is shed on this. A bit of light is shed on prehistory in general, very sorry. The short length of the film combined with an emphasis on furs and crimes means that we do not see the depths of the character. The basics are all downstairs, but we have no finished product. A cropped version of this OAV would be a great TV episode as soon as some plot plots were created. <br /> <br /> The highlights of this short film are mech projects and action / espionage. <Br /> <br /> Disadvantages really start to show up after you have a chance to digest everything that happens, so I can't recommend it for owning, but it is definitely worth a watch or two! Although this review is mostly negative, I really think it is worth seeing it, but this is not something to rush into and buy. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: an opportunity to see wasted.
