One may wonder about the state of society in which such a father appeared, like Albert T. Fitzgerald, whom we first met on the plane, when he was going to the place he left a long time ago, and where he left his wife and child, who are now accused in the murder of a mentally retarded boy. When we first see him, he saw the headline in the newspaper that the woman in front of him was reading. Rather rudely, he asks her if he can have a newspaper, and the woman offers other sections. Well, this is not what he asked what he wants a woman to do to give him the front part she reads. <br /> <br /> Matthew Ryan Hoge wrote and directed this disturbing film, which reflects in many ways our society today. In fact, Mr. Hoge points out exactly whatâ€™s wrong with him. <br /> <br /> The film tells about Leland, a teenager who cannot even distinguish fantasy from reality. Obviously, killing a man, even a sweet and innocent boy, who did not deserve it, will lead to fatal consequences not only for himself, but also for his own family and the family of the killed boy. In fact, Leland seems to have no idea what prompted him to commit a crime, since he shows no remorse for this. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that Leland was injured by his parents' divorce. His own father is an estranged man who doesn't care about him. This is Pearl, a teacher in the center for minors, who sees the unrest within the young man and wants to help, but, unfortunately, he has no chance. <br /> <br /> The best thing in the film is Don Cheadle, the great actor who always delivers. The cast ensemble does a good job under the guidance of Mr. Hoge. Kevin Spacey has a good opportunity to play the selfish father of the accused killer and makes us hate him for being an arrogant idiot. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film is rather long, it leaves us with more questions than was given.
