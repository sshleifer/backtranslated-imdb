It is hard to believe that Fritz Lang directed it, since he mainly directed criminal dramas and mysteries. In this film, Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and John Carradine starred. Scott plays a criminal who tries to go straight and leave his old gang and eventually saves Jagger's life. Jagger works for Western Union, a telegraph company that plans to telegraph west. Jagger hires a lot of people to make sure this is done because they have to worry about the attacks of the Indians and the bandits. Scott is responsible for the men, and Young is a telegraph expert who cannot fire a gun, but can drive. Scott is dating his old gang, who wants to stop them, but Scott can't tell anyone. This is a pretty good western, and Lang should have sent a few more westerns.
