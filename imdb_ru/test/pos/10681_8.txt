Journey to the far side of the Sun is associated with the discovery of a planet on the other side of the Sun, which has the same orbit as the Earth, and therefore was not detected until a space probe on the opposite side of the Sun photographs it. Of course, two astronauts (Roy Tinnes and Ian Hendry) go to investigate it, but because of a malfunction they crash and end up on the ground only 3 weeks after their six-week journey. Of course, they are scolded (at least Tinnes, Hendry is seriously wounded), grilling and asking why they returned to their mission, but it is argued that they did not. Until Tinnesse seems to have noticed some very strange things about returning "home." This is excellent, although sometimes a little talkative, and the scenery and sensations are not far from the territory of "Thunderbirds", but this time they will be living actors. This is not a big staging of the Star Wars type, but a quieter science fiction that needs some thought. Worth seeing, and criminally, that the DVD is out of print. 8 out of 10.
