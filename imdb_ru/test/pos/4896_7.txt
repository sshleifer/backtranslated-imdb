For many, the hit series was a ten-year-old black humor, filled with tender parodies of classic films, and a cheerful assortment of more than a hundred characters with instantly recognizable phrases. Only a few shows survived the transition from radio to television to a stage show for the film, but the League of Gentlemen achieved this with suitable aplomb. <br /> <br /> A talented writer / performer initially suggested a medieval adventure in the style of Monty Python, but as soon as the letter began, they soon realized that the characters with whom they lived became very real and deserved better. With this, the people of Royston Vasey realize that their very existence is under threat, as the writers have decided not to pay attention to the fictional city and are working on a 17th century game instead. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Michael Sheen, who plays a lot of the invisible League, Jeremy Dyson, a member of the League, plays rather incredible cartoons of their real characters, as well as Tubbs' familiar faces (“I made a little brown fish”) causing a nightmare the sexual predator Guerra Lipp, the butcher Hilary Briss and the unlikely hero - anger businessman Jeff Tibbs. New faces appear when a third reality appears, it is here that we are treated to charming and funny cameos by veteran actors and popular TV stars. For many, it will be a really pleasant 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> “Not everyone will like the apocalypse. Work on this level of postmodernism has been done several times before this point and may seem too familiar to the audience, raised on the ironic teenage successes begun by the likes of Wes Craven, who has the New Nightmare. The audience also needs a lot of confidence to keep up with conceptual history, so there are moments of presentation and dialogue that serve only to confirm what the majority in the audience already know. Comedy as a genre is formulaic, but the British film is now unheard of not to refer to the huge back catalog of TV stars to fill a small amount of screen time. It is also hard to believe that the creators ever wanted their offspring to be killed, and perhaps that is why some role changes do not always reach their goal. Would Hilary Briss want to try to save Royston Wasie on the show? <br /> <br /> However, despite the fact that the delightfully dark vein of the series has almost disappeared, but perhaps it is more accessible to her. Much will be said about character development and efforts to humanize similar incarnations of one joke, such as Herr Lipp. It is here that it is impossible to find an impossible level of depth, along with a sharp strip of biting satire and ejecting decadence. Feeling there with a lump in the throat, but not covered with sugar, dense enough to disrupt the action. The music is good, exemplary performances, and the animation is wonderfully seamless; a good return to the work of Terry Gilliam and Ray Harryhausen. In short, the Apocalypse has something to love. As in many television and film programs, it will never be easy to find the line between the sermon turned and the presentation of the uninitiated to the smooth and distinct voice of the League. But no matter what you prefer, this last trip to a city that “you will never leave” is strangely filled with hope and, ultimately, very, very touching.
