I only watched this film because I didnâ€™t want to leave my 9-year-old girl alone in the theater. Honestly, I expected to be able to take a good nap, but I was fascinated by the film. I would recommend this to anyone who asks! Roy's mom was on one of my favorite TV shows many years ago, playing a mermaid (Maximum Bob). She was very pretty in this movie. All three main characters were great young actors. I also liked to see and hear Jimmy Buffett. The film itself was quite beautiful, showing off some of what makes Florida so great. I'm glad I ended up going to this movie. And, I think, I was disappointed that I could not take them to see "Stick" - I think this is MUCH better!
