When you sit down to watch this movie “The Gun for Cordoba”, you have the feeling that it will be great. Cause? The film begins with the inspiring score of the famous composer Elmer Bernstein, who presented us with such memorable themes as “The Great Escape and the Magnificent Seven”. In fact, when you read the opening credits entitled by the actors, this is none other than George Peppard in the role of captain Rod Douglas, you know that he will have action, and a lot of it. In addition, when you see actor John Russell playing General John J. Pershing, you know that a heroic saga awaits you. This story is taken from the annals of the Mexican revolution and involves the US in a border dispute with Mexican gangsters crossing the Rio Grande in the early 1900s. Among the most arrogant rebel leaders are General Cordova (Raf Vallone). With his army of Mexican revolutionaries, he attacks Pershing, kills his people and steals some valuable artillery. Since the United States Army cannot legally enter Mexico, Captain Douglas is sent to a suicide mission without orders and without the help of Pershing. His mission is to restore the guns, destroy the rebel stronghold and return Cordova alive. Selecting the toughest, toughest, most experienced, and certainly the most impudent people out of all possible, Douglas enters Mexico and attacks an almost impregnable fortress. This is followed by a dramatic action, as well as many explosive unrest. If someone asks for criticism, I would say the choice of weights. Walloon and John Leach are not very threatening. Not so with the men who are on Peppard's side. Pete Duel and Don Gordon (Who's great.) However, this movie is recommended as a good preview. ****
