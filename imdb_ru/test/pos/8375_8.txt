In Vienna, a good movie about a taxi driver, Tony (Donald Buk), who steals a passengerâ€™s identity when a passenger is shot dead while sitting in the back of his cabin. This gives him a personality because he is an illegal immigrant, but he needs to play the role of a victim, until he gets on a flight to the USA with a ticket in the name of the victim. Mrs. Manelli (Joan Camden) rumbles at him, but her husband Claude (Francis Lederer), a concert pianist, blames her for mental disorders. As a result, Tony is off the hook. Claude does not want to part with his wife, but she runs away from him. There are several plot twists, and in the end, both Tony and Mrs. Manelli run after him - they both try to escape from their lives in Vienna. There is a tense, exciting preparation for the final. Are they going to leave ..... ?? ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the image quality is not fantastic, and for some time a line passes in the middle of the image. All the actors are very good in their roles, especially in the role of Francis Lederer in the role of Claude. Also important to the story are Heint (Manfred Inger) as the owner of a taxi company, Marie (Inge Conradi) as Tony's girlfriend in her hometown and inspector (Herman Ehrhardt). <br /> <br /> This is a good movie.
