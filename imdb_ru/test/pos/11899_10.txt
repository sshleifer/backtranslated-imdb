I finally watch the film “El Padrino”, from what I see, this is an incredible film, and many actions of Damien Chapa are a good director, but I must admit that I like his best game. <br /> <br /> I also saw backstage that she was edited by a woman named King, she needed to go back to school and learn how to edit. <br /> <br /> However, El Padrino is a pure epic epic epic. Why do most people who make films make you think about the plot? I'm so glad that someone I know as a real great actor has also become a great director. <br /> <br /> I’m one of those people who like to see artists do it. <br /> <br /> BS
