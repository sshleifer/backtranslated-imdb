A good entry in the series, in which a lot of military propaganda, but the sincerity of Rathbone and Bruce makes me happy. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty fantastic story from start to finish, how many McGuffins are there? Holmes (and Moriarty, independently of each other) spun the code of Dancing Men, encoded so quickly - it was Amazing Watson - so why aren't you surprised! The post explaining the scope / bomb magnifier, tickled me, it was just a cheap trick that Universal would play - reminding me again that they didnâ€™t expect people to look at it critically more than 60 years later. This (and I think that all the rest of the Universal potspotplayers during this period) should have been viewed once or twice and forgotten. Perhaps they should understand that basically people do not change, that what occupied ordinary people in 1942 would still entertain the chosen group now (2005) and tighten the script and scenery! <br /> <br /> Lionel At around this time, Atville was reviewing his case in a Hollywood rape court. I wonder if this particular or particularly effective makeup made him look as exhausted as Moriarty? that this was Holmes's first film, directed by Roy William Neill, I think that he shot everything else and produced everything except one, thereby creating an amazing continuity of surroundings.
