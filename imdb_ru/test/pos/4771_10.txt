This is the 1920s. And a man named Walt Disney had a mission: to satisfy families and children all over the world with one thing: entertainment. What did he do? He made cartoons! Wow !!!!! And he created a character who is as good as a mouse ... Mickey Mouse. Ha ha! Oh boy! <br /> <br /> Mr. Disney himself shot two films: "The Plane is Crazy" and "Steamboat Willie." In this review, we will focus on the 1928 film Steamboat Willie. <br /> <br /> Since I learned about this film as a child, I always wanted to watch this movie. Well, in 1997 I rented an old VHS, which had a lot of old Disney cartoons with the mouse in the lead role !!!!! Mickey Mouse!!!!! And guess what? This short was there, and I liked it !!!!! Shortly after I picked up the tape, she played on the old Disney channel (note: “Old” Disney channel) early Saturday morning. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a great cartoon; this paved the way for a greater Disney material from 1928 to 2002! <br /> <br /> 10 stars really !!!!!
