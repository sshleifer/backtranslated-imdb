As a scuba diver, I can appreciate the incredible physical exertion that operators must have gone through to take pictures underwater. This series is MUCH more than that, though. The narrative is perfect, the scenes border on the implausible, and the subject is fascinating. The daily struggle for a life out of sight of our earthly inhabitants is staggering. This DVD set opened my eyes to another planet right here on Earth. I encourage everyone to watch this show.
