I first saw it in the theater in 1969, when I was 9 years old, and immediately fell in love with it. I am sad that Sony did not consider it necessary to release it on DVD (“but once, once ...”). I recently received a VHS copy of this on eBay and sat down to watch it 39 years later. I am pleased to report that he still stands the test of time. The acting on the stage, the orchestration of John Williams is magnificent, and Leslie Brikuss songs are remembered (“When I'm older”, “You and me”, “Fill the world with love”, “London - London” are just some of them). and little can be said about Peter O'Toole, Petula Clark, Michael Redgrave and actor Michael Bryant. Terence Rattigan deserves A + for his update on the James Hilton story. There really is nothing in this movie that doesn’t like it. This is a good choice for lifting the mood. I am glad that they released the original soundtrack in the form of a three-disc set with a large number of additions. I would like Sony to hurry and do the same with the movie.
