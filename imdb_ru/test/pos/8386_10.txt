I had the privilege of attending the premiere of Inglorious Basterds in the UK this evening! When I saw the trailers, I had high hopes, but I doubted because of a whole series of indulgent films (let's be honest, dedication - his second name is tarantino) <br /> <br /> I was surprised to find that with this he pulled the cat out of his bag . The film is full of interesting dialogue, the perfect comedy and brutal murder. <br /> <br /> The crown of this film is Christoph Waltz, in which there is no fault or error. He manages to create real tension in the audience, while remaining quite “theatrical” (he could not come up with a better word). He definitely deserved his prize in Cannes and, without a doubt, goes to the Oscar !!!! Hope to see him again in something soon!
