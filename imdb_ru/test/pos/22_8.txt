It is worth mentioning that in other reviews that I read here, it is missed - this is a subtext of how the law shaped the life and behavior of gays in the era presented in the film. Although the character of Courtney is clearly gay, he is not the only one: they often talk about Mr. Davenport-Scott, and the reason he was never seen, the reason he disappeared seems to be that he was detained by the police for homosexual activities - then a felony in England. <br /> <br /> We can read below the surface that this recent event excited Norman, character Courtney, and we can also see in the Occurring Note of Oxenby, character Edward Fox, a quick renunciation of any connection with such a person when the law : The fear of association affects many characters and is part of the portrait that draws the film of the time and the people who inhabit it. The refusal of Sortney at the end of Sir was expected until the end, if this subtext is included: it also has a meaning as the inexplicable otherwise unjustified exclusion of his Dresser from the list of those to whom he thanks. Brightness, combined with the fear of exposure, creates melancholy and fear that Courtney must “step into the headlights,” as he does when announcing upcoming air strikes, a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous, but it is a symbolic and literal internal torment of man. <br /> <br /> So, although the drama is about the fall of Sir Finney, most of the tragedy of the film and the play comes from a “fatal mistake.” 'Gay Gay Courtney, and makes this movie about him, as the name suggests. <br /> <br /> The artistic direction, tempo and cinematic style of this film seem to have come from a different time, more distant than in the eighties and, in a sense, even the second world war. An implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an older moral order, and the sympathy of a character destroyed by the atrocities of that order, by necessity trapped in the closed world of the theater; and knowing how much of this will be swept away after the war makes this film even sharper, despite all its flaws.
