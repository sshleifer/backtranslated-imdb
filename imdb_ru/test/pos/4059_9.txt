Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy, what a team. While Rene Rousseau, William Shanther and the guy from the video for every day are close by for the trip. This is a funny and great movie. Not only is it, but it is a good film mate. <br /> <br /> Tom Day (Shanghai Noon) directs this hellish movie. From start to finish it was a masterpiece. There is no humor. But the good old time is laughing. Making fun of all the other police films (name a few “Lethal weapons”, “Beverly Hills”, “Fifteen minutes”, etc.) <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie, watch this You will like it. He has a great team and team. So, remove your ** from watching “COPS” and watch “Showtime” for a movie about cops. And remember, they will scroll your neighbor in ... uh ... oh! Friday night at 8:00 (dude, everyone says I'm a bad writer).
