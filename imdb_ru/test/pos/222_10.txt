The funniest television show, although humor is not for everyone. I understand that it would be difficult to keep the show fresh if it lasted longer, but it’s a shame that only six episodes were filmed. The gags fly quickly from the initial credits to the very end, when you see Drebin and his boss, Ed Hocken, pretending to be in still frame, when the captions are closed, during which the criminal (still moving) will see everyone else fixed and try to escape. In another episode, the building collapsed around them when Drebin and Hocken remained in freezing mode. <br /> <br /> Was Leslie Nielsen a comedy glitter of Frank Drebin and perfect for this show ?? the way he managed to endure it is beyond my power. Since jokes and shows have come so often and quickly, you can watch episodes 2 and 3 times and catch things you missed the first time. If you are like me, you can watch them again and again and still laugh. Even jokes that made no sense and seemingly made no sense to them, such as the label "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln" in the introductory announcement, somehow worked ?? perhaps they were thrown there for precisely this reason. <br /> <br /> Policemen who deftly defraud detectives and policeman Quinn Martin in the 1970s will return from a commercial with the words “Act Two” appearing on the screen, immediately followed by “Yankee One” or some is another joke. On the opening credits, the title of the episode will appear on the screen, but the announcer will say a completely different title. My favorite jokes and lines in this series are too numerous to list them, but one of my favorites is when Drebin asks a boxer who was not lucky who had previously participated in fights: “What do you think, can you beat the champion?” Boxer replies: “I can take him blindfolded!” To which Drebin answers, he answers: “And what if he is not blindfolded?” After a minute, referring to the boxer's little dark apartment, Drebin says to him: “I will help you get out from this sewer. " The next thing you see, Drebin pops out through the hatch on the street! In another episode, Drebin and Hocken question the alibi of the suspect in the explosion. Drebin, not believing him, says: “Well, let's say you went to the cinema.” After a short pause, Drebin, Hocken and all the suspects all look at the camera and say in unison: "You went to the movies." A few moments later, when Drebin was forced to release the suspected bomber due to lack of evidence, he leaves and angrily shouts: “Tell this bomber to take off!” right by the building! Although there were a lot of classic quotes from Drebin, one especially remembered: “Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Twice. We would have come earlier, but your husband did not die then. " Another classic was: "I am a fitter, and I am a fitter." When the father of the kidnapping victim shakes noticeably, Drebina asks: “What should I do?” ?? Drebin, in the classic unabashed style, replies: "Well, as far as I understand, you are in the textile business." As I said, humor is not for everyone ?? many simply won't get it. During the short series of the show, I remember how the reaction was very mixed. Some people thought it was absolutely hysterical and one of the funniest things, while others thought it was stupid and not funny. For me, a police squad, even after more than 20 years, is the most fun thing I've ever seen on TV. I highly recommend young viewers who like this type of humor, but who have never seen a police squad because they were too young when the show was first shown. I found that six episodes were even funnier than in the next Naked Gun movie. .
