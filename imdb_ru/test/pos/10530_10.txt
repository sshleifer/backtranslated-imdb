Brilliant job. Amazing actors dissolve like bold and bold characters. All the unforgettable roles in more than intriguing and exciting action movie - thriller. Casting is perfect. Both from the side of stars like: Armand Asante, Bernhardt, Kier, Denier. But also for new faces. I was very impressed with the young actor who plays the boy’s gang member Mustafa. You trust each of the Turkish gang. Very convincing is Michael Barral and all followers of white power. I admire the musical beat of the main theme “Children of Wax”. This sound track is a charming mix of Turkish, hard rock and tune Udo Kiera ?? And at the same time, Children of Wax talk about racial conflicts. Intolerance and cruelty between skinheads and Turks.
