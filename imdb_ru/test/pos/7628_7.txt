Stupidly beautiful. This film embodies the genre of "so bad, it's good." <br /> <br /> There are only two talents in it - Richard Boone and Joan van Ark, and only Boone is good. It is sad that a man who became famous as a Paladin, fell into this ugly pile of celluloid. Although it turns into a fantastic performance, I could not help but feel that he had so surpassed all his fellow actors in this film that it should not even have been. <br /> <br /> The effects of this film are ridiculous, but fun. The idea that a dinosaur is buried in a cave wall and suddenly comes to life is the B-movie gold. When a triceratops is killed, see how it falls. It is clear that the trick in the FRONT of the suit knows best the time. It falls to the ground long before the back half of the dinosaur follows it. <br /> <br /> Speaking of “costumes”, this film has nothing to say about the purple tyrannosaur. It seems that he has some kind of stealth technology, because the Riot (considered the best tracker in the world) does not notice this twice until it is within reach of him. I do not know what all the prints are, but in the version I own, the roar of Tyranno contains the Godzilla trademark. <br /> <br /> Watch is really fun if you like bad movies. I love them, and especially bad monster movies, so I consider this the pearl of my collection. If bad movies are your thing, definitely get it.
