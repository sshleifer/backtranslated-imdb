I found the film quite good for what I expected. Although I am tired because I am afraid of injection needles, I kind of expected them to come. So, if you donâ€™t need needles, blood, a human body and some good medical entertainment, bring this movie back and rent another one. As another user commented, I also liked the Germans attempt to make a movie. I am an American who just moved to Germany to stay with his family, and saw that it was on the shelf. I love psychological thrillers, and I would say that it is somewhere like that. The character falls into place and feels misinterpreted. When trying to dig up her way out and find some truth to the situation, things get a little sticky, and others are not so sure that she is on the right path. Thus, throughout the entire film, you will always be aware of which of you represents anatomy and who looks into the next corner.
