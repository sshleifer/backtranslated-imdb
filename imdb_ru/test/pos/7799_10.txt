The Andaz Apna Apna film in my books is the top 5 intelligent comedy films ever made in Bollywood, perhaps even in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> When the movie came out, I was 8 years old, and I heard that this is a failure, but still did not understand why this is a failure ... but let me tell you one thing ... this is a Film will get more money selling home cassettes and DVDs and showing on television channels than any popular movie in theaters. This film has been shown countless times on the Kino channels, and I think that even now the public loves and television producers continue to repeat the film again and again. Personally, I watched the entire film more than 80-100 times, and I still love it ..... <br /> <br /> Aamir Khan’s performance as Amar and Salman Khan as a premiere is amazing, but I especially liked the performance Amir Khan as a street smart guy .... his dialogues in the film are hilarious ... the story is simple, and this is how it happens ..... <br /> <br /> Amar and Prem they are poor, lazy guys and come from poor family of tailors, and father Amar is a hairdresser. Then they both get the news that the millionaire’s daughter from London is coming to India to find the right couple ... and Amar and Prem think this is a great opportunity to become super rich ... so they both go to Ravina Tandon .. (the daughter of millionaires) ...... in their journey, they both hate each other, and each of them tries to deceive the other in order to marry Ravina ..... the comedic scenes between them are so much fun that you will need a glass of water, to stop the pain in the stomach from laughing ....... and then there is Uncle Ravinas (similar to Lioner brother) Teja, who wants to take revenge on Ravinas's father ..... because he is ruined, and Pope Ravinas is a millionaire ... his plans include kidnapping Ravina to blackmail Ravinas's father, for which he hires 2 butlers ... <br /> <br /> but later we learn that there is a turn in the film (see the movie to know) ....... then there is Shakti Kapoor as the master of crime Gogo, who is also incredibly fu nny. ..... <br /> <br /> What stood out for me was the dialogues in the film, which became a kind of legend ..... Aamir Khan brilliantly uses his “email”, and Salman goes like “OOima "........ and for Gogo there is "Jab Raat Ko Bacha Suta Naha Hay Ma Ma Bolti Hay Ki Suoja Naha Gogo Aa Dzhega" ...... each scene is so funny ...... <br /> <br /> I especially liked the one in which Amir Khan and Salman leave for Ravina from Teji, and they both go to the Moon with “chiller’s” money in a bag .... this scene is so funny ... <br /> <br /> I recommend to everyone, who understands Hindi or Urdu, watch this movie ...... this is one movie that I would recommend to have on DVD, and you will never regret it. ......
