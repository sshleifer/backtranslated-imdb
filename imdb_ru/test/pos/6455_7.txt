This gangster film, one of the best I have seen, is clearly visible after the first gangster films shot by Warner in the same year, Little Caesar (1931) and Public Enemy (1931). Although she is not quite in the same league as the previous classics, she has a powerful game for young Sylvia Sidney. She is gorgeous and conveys her lines more naturally than anyone at that time. Gary Cooper is better than usual at this stage in his career and shows signs of what will follow in the next few years when he rises to the top. There are several fascinating villains in the role of Paul Lucas (who never saw him so disgusting) and Guy Kibby (what a shock when he saw him as a bully). Directed by Ruben Mamulian is very inventive, probably the first voice-over, which will show people the thoughts appear in this film. If you have the opportunity to see this little gangster movie, do not miss the chance.
