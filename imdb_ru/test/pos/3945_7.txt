Another turn around when the monkey king goes west .... sort of. <br /> <br /> Starting with some action, the movie begins with the first frame. <br /> <br /> A monk and his three disciples go to the city for holy suras who will bring peace to the whole world as soon as they are translated and told to the world. But the evil force intervened and kidnapped all the children of the city. An evil force wants a monk, because if you eat it, you will live forever. The servants fight the forces of darkness before forcing the monk to a safe place (the monk thinks he can win, just talking with the bad guys). The monk ends up with a bunch of lizard demons who plan to eat him at some point ... but the bad guys arrive, and he is on the odyssey with the ugliest of them all. <br /> <br /> Can a movie that starts on the rails go off the rails? Don't get me wrong, I really liked this film, but it is so scattered, and everywhere that the plot and logic just disappear, as some scenes just raise the middle of the action, not knowing how we got there (the final battle with the rescue of the students is completely out left margin). This is one of the dirtiest films I've seen lately, but it made me laugh and smile, as if I didn't get out. The film begins, and you have no idea where that is, and then what is interesting or funny on the screen, and you just go with it. How do we get from things to things, often for me. It is full of strange sides and strange references when we go from heaven to the ocean, into space, to the chest of some mythical beast, and God knows where. This film floats everywhere, which helps him to be fun, because you do not know where he will be (and therefore I try to keep the details to a minimum). And this is fun. Sometimes very, very funny. <br /> <br /> And the action is very good, even if there is a lot of CGI animation in it (which provides several cool images, a golden staff, the formation of a spider attack, an angel in flight ...) And its very touching. Beware, away from comedy, this is actually a wonderful love story. This is a story about an ugly demon and a monk who falls in love (and has other complications). This is an interesting look at the nature of love and what is true love. You will be touched. <br /> <br /> No matter how much I like it, I was still annoyed at how he was building point shots. The inability of films to combine their ideas and tell the full story really hurts the film and shoots. away from pleasure every time we get to bumps in the road. irregularities take you out of the film itself and make you understand how much you need to extract from other sources. <br /> <br /> Absolutely worth seeing, because he has many moments of choice, just be prepared for some shots and you will have a good time.
