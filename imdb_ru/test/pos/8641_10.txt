Spoiler alert - although this story is almost as impossible to spoil as its full explanation. <br /> <br /> Mulholland Drive is by far the most successful expression of David Lynch’s cinematic style and vision since the first season. from his Twin Peaks TV series. As Lynch enthusiasts know, his style and vision are uniquely combined with film noir, horror films, surrealism and parapsychology. with a healthy dose of postmodern self-awareness and black humor added for good measure. All of these elements work richly in Mulholland Drive, creating an exciting, awesome and very enjoyable film. especially if a person does not become overly obsessed with trying to bring all the plot plots into a logical, mysterious whole. <br /> <br /> In the film, the spectacular performances of Naomi Watts and Laura Harring starring young women whose lives intersect in different ways in a Hollywood setting that is itself a hallucinated blend of modern reality, retro nostalgia of the 50s and satirical self-praise. Their seemingly random first encounter takes place after the opening scene of the film, in which the character Harring avoids an attempt on her life due to an accidental, not to mention terrible, car accident. Going down the hill from Mulholland Drive to Sunset Boulevard (the two most archetypical Hollywood boulevards), she finds her way to the apartment Betty (Naomi Watts) is going to rent out from her "Aunt Ruth", supposedly a successful actress who is traveling to Canada to start a new movie. As we will find out later, Betty herself came from Deep River, Ontario, shortly after winning the jitterbug contest. <br /> <br /> A very energetic and stylized flashback to the contest forms one of two pre-credit prologue sequences that frame Betty's origin from a bright innocent cliché future star to a depraved madness of a rejected mistress and the actress has not gone anywhere. It’s impossible to memorize your own name, the character Harring takes the name “Rita” from a movie poster for the classic movie “Gilda” that decorates Aunt Ruth’s apartment. (Actually, it turns out that Aunt Ruth died a long time ago, and whose apartment is actually in us, this is a good question that needs to be resolved in future views.) In any case, Betty decides to help Rita find out what happened and discover the source of the money pack and the mysterious blue key that women find in Rita’s purse. Two women begin to put together the keys, which would seem to lead to the true identity of Rita. They also, by the way, become lovers, at some point radiating such incendiary chemistry, that I cannot recall its equal in the main interpretations of lesbian love affairs (if the Lynch film can ever be called "mainstream"). <br /> At the local restaurant Winkies (a repetitive location, fraught with fabulous meaning behind its dirty realistic facade), Rita’s attention is drawn to the waitress reading Diana. This brings her to the memory of someone named “Diane Selvin”, whose apartment is soon visited by two women and, at the insistence of Betty, will break in. I will not reveal what they find inside, but suffice it to say that the scene is visualized with vintage Lynch eeriness. Subsequently, Rita wakes up in night sweats, speaking Spanish, and hurries with Betty to a night magic show / theater called Silencio, where the art of illusion and lip synchronization / instrumental tools is practiced with manic intensity and where Blue-haired lady as she marks at the end titles, rules as presiding Muse. Framed by the blue Silencio theater illuminated by the red curtain, the blue-haired lady takes the last frame in the film, perhaps a symbol of control of the artistic imagination ?? more like Stephen's “man with a blue guitar”, “bad drug” filtered through surrealism. <br /> <br /> During the Silencio episode and when Rebecca Del Rio's cameo performs in her own powerful Weeping Roy Orbison Spanish ”), crushing insight occurs when Betty opens her own wallet to discover the blue box with a keyhole that obviously fits the key in Rita’s purse. Even if we do not delve too deeply into the Freudian sexual symbolism of the wallets, this moment is extremely Hitchcock in the sense that the coincidence of the key and the box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew, and into a completely new set of relationships of character and meaning . Not the least of these changes is the discovery that Betty is wanted by Diana Selvin and the rejected mistress of Camilla Rhodes (that is, Rita). Camilla, in turn, is a film star of a Latin femme fatale, to whom Diana is obliged for several minor roles that she managed to get, and, more importantly, to those whom she emotionally conquered. <br /> <br /> After these and other discoveries in the last third of the film, the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the film is not so easily solved as in “Vertigo”. While pieces of images and dialogues suggest that much, if not all, of the earlier material is projected and moved from Diana’s inflamed subconscious, other pieces and pieces suggest, perhaps, supernatural intervention from a group of characters drawing direct inspiration from Twin Peaks , Including Michael J. Anderson, replicating his unearthly dwarf force, and the Bob version, which hangs behind Winky and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its identical associations. <br /> <br /> However, one connects the parts together, although the entire Mulholland Drive is much more ?? and more mysterious ?? than the sum of its parts. Lynch takes us on an amazingly inventive, provocative and pleasurable journey of the mind. Moreover, the cinema of the film is stunning, the soundtrack is filled with an impressive atmosphere, acting excellence and directing / editing skills. It may have been the unrecognized Best Picture 2001 among the major American releases.
