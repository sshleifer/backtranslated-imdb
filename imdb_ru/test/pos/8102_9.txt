When the Nazis came to power in Eastern Europe in the late 1930s, Charles Chaplin turned his attention to the reaction to this. The catalyst may have been a propaganda publication citing Chaplin as a Jewish sympathizer. In The Great Dictator, Chaplin created a parody parody of Hitler, amusing and sometimes scary. The film traces the experience of Hitler in the German army from the First World War to the present day. At the same time, Chaplin plays a Jewish barber, who dresses like a tramp who leaves the hospital after a long time, only to find out how much the world is different under Nazi rule. <br /> <br /> Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife At this time, a young Jewish girl plays, whose family is oppressed in the Jewish ghetto. Jack Oka has an excellent, Oscar-nominated supporting role in the role of Mussolini’s twin (Benzini Napaloni), which gives Chaplin Hitler and Adenoid Hinkel a lot of seizures. Henry Daniel, as usual, is Garbatsh, chief advisor to Adenoid Hinkel. Chaplin wrote and directed the film and received an Oscar nomination for his script and his actions. The film was also nominated for the best picture. <br /> <br /> Chaplin made the film under immense pressure for a number of obvious reasons, and some are not so well known. He financed the entire film at great risk because of the plot, and there were no other major films about Nazi Germany before that time. The film spent about twenty one months in production, and Chaplin even rebuilt the set and re-shot the scene so that everything was correct. By the time the film was released in October 1940, the war in Europe was in full swing, and Hitler conquered one country after another, so the film became much more relevant when it was released than when production first began. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, there’s not so much to look at the film; the film is more like a series of comedy sketches and / or setbacks connected together to achieve a goal independent of the film itself. A few examples of this occur in the last third of the film with the meeting between Hinkel and Napaleni. The scene is very, very funny, but it leads nowhere from the point of view of the plot. Similarly, the escape of both the barber and Schulz simply results in an erroneous barber identifier for Hinkel, in order to give Chaplin (through the character of the barber) the opportunity to understand the audience at the end of the film. On the other hand, what could be better if we talk about inappropriate narcissism of Aryan supremacy, than to accept a Jewish barber for Hinkel? <br /> <br /> However, the film contains many bright comic moments, such as talking about rally, new military events (bulletproof form, etc.), the scene of a dancing ball, a coin on the pudding scene and the whole scenario between Hinkel and Napaloni (including the barber scene) highly recommend the film. You can also not forget about the risks that Chaplin undertook, creating his first talking film, an anti-Nazi film and financing the film itself. *** 1/2 of 4 stars.
