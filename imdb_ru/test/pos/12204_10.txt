This is the first sci-fi series I have been seriously addicted to since Star Trek (and I have not watched Trek for many years). He accepts the topic of invasion in several different directions, but he does it very fascinatingly. It also borrows from the format of a soap opera, where it continues to arc throughout the year, managed by the series. CGI definitely does not overcome the plot or characters, with the exception of Neem, a young creature that is a pet with a certain attitude. (All that could show that he was actually thinking about a doggy dog, this is A-1 in my book.) It was a stroke of genius. <br /> <br /> I stay at the end of the final, asking questions (smart, I hope) and crossing my toes that NBC or someone else (perhaps Sci Fi) will continue the series and answer these questions. <br /> <br /> A really cool show.
