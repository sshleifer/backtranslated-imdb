This film was very funny with a bit of blood. We are talking about two robbers who, as usual, are engaged in business when they discover that there is another client whom they can serve. This changes the direction of the corpses they collect. The film is told by the youngest of two when he explains the case to the priest before he is sent to be beheaded. His partner has already been beheaded. The priest is obliged to remove the last confession, and it takes the form of history. Added animation that gives the feeling of fairy tales from the crypt. In this story, we meet another group of grave robbers, whom everyone fears, but at some point the youngest of two is offered a job for execution, so this calms some enmity between the groups. When a woman joins two men, she crosses her borders and gives them trouble with the terrible grave robbers. The story leads to a meeting of two groups, which led to the arrest of a man who confesses and a man who has already lost his head.
