No, this is not an Ed Wood movie. “Angora Love” is the last silent film by Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. The end of an era! In the 1920s, Laurel & Hardy left a real mark in the genre of silent cinema with films that are still popular and are watched and regularly broadcast on this day. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this film, however, is not among their best. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film sounds good and good. At this time, the guys combined with the goat, which, of course, leads to trouble, and we have to watch some funny situations. However, at the same time, it is incredibly stupid and just incredible to watch how boys make comedies with a goat. Most of the jokes in the film still work well, but the film, however, never becomes really fun or memorable. Sometimes comedies and stories are really not enough, and in most cases it is too simple and predictable. <br /> <br /> Of course, she is still good and fun to watch the fans, but still slightly disappointing, the last quiet recording of Laurel & Hardy. 7/10
