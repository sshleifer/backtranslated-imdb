I saw it (video 2000) years ago and would like to see it on DVD. A good movie, but I would love it even more if it included the legacy of The Beatles, The Hollies, etc. I also don’t know exactly how true the story is - were there any What changes has made to dramatize the story? <br /> <br /> I was only three years old when Buddy collapsed, and I didn’t wake up from his music until the late 70s. Much later, I learned that our family moved to our new home - yes, February 3, 1959. <br /> <br /> Well, the little things that you say and do ... His songs will always be remembered - always ..,
