This movie is powerful. I watched this movie at 3 am and was supposed to be at work at 6 am, of course, I was late for work. I could not bring myself to get out of bed and go to work. This is the most powerful movie I've seen in a long time. And it made me cry and feel the pain of the family. I think that Emilo did an excellent job with directing this film. I agree with previous comments by other people that this is the only film that I saw that brought the war home and showed what the family had to go through, what the veteran went through. It's almost heartbreaking - to think that then people just thought that you could return home from life-changing experience and become the same person you were before you left. Kathy Bates reminded me of my mom in some way. I believe that she really showed that women felt and acted then. I am surprised that this film has not received more awards.
