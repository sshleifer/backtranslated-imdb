“Heaven's Gate” is not a masterpiece, which, apparently, should have been the first release in order to justify its high cost and, more importantly, Hollywood’s constant difficult dependence on the author’s filmmaking model. However, Heaven's Gate, seen today, finally, on DVD for 229 minutes, is an excellent film. It is light sluggish in pace. But at least it's a pace. In addition to the incompetence of the design, which is noted in many films today, there were many films that, deliberately in shape, were seriously damaged by being hacked without rhythm care, so the films become formless and confusing. In addition, the criticism directed at the film, in retrospect, became rather lame. If the good guys and the bad guys are too pronounced for a serious movie, and yes, the mustache, the fur-clad villain Sam Waterston is a comic opera (and not in the multi-level style of Bill Butcher from Gang of New York)) and yes, the townspeople sometimes seem frivolous "Fiddler on the Roof", and then since then dozens of serious films have been made, including "Titanic" and the incomparable "Cold Mountain" (which has a certain similarity and noteworthy Failure in convincing qualities compared to this film) can be subjected criticized by the same reason. <br /> <br /> Also, despite the accusations, the film has a plot, and a fairly well-defined plot. He simply does not obey the "epic" quality of the standard form, providing the heroes of Titan, the rafts of auxiliary scenes and confusion. He is experimenting with a story similar to much smaller, modest films, meticulously caught moments of character interaction and well-structured theatrical explosions of collective action, both with the opening at Harvard and, especially, with a wonderful scene. where residents of Johnson County, following the example of a brilliant violinist, arrange a holiday on roller skates. <br /> <br /> “The Deer Hunter” was a critical and commercial success, but left an inspired mosaic of the first half. like a bunch of details, and I think it looks like a criticism of Robert Penn Warren’s novel All Men of the King and his dictionary of Jacobin tricks, if Cimino didn’t have such a strong understanding of the conventions of Hollywood epics, he could have done a special rare piece of art, based on honest visualization of people in their environment. On the contrary, “The Gate of Heaven” succeeds in spinning its narrative impulse and tension up a slowly expanding arc until the finale explodes, without giving up the mosaic approach. <br /> <br /> The central romantic triangle, for example, opposes standard kinks; a decent, intelligent, but mentally overwhelmed man, James Averill (Chris Christopherson) competes with a hot, but challenging personality, the young fighter Nate Champion (Christopher Walken) for the hand of young Madame Ella Watson (Isabel Huppert); there are no shy jumps from bed, no slaps, no accusations or typical sad moments, but Ella’s more sad and distant decision is to choose a younger man whom she loves less because he is ready to make a commitment. Ella plays the role of the film’s true hero (Huppert’s performance, although initially embarrassing, really quite excellent, balancing an emotional and emotional attitude with a solid spirit), tries to save Nate and then put the immigrant resistance group into an entrepreneurial defense. Subsequently, when friends die, Averill begins to act. Indeed, in the process of overcoming so many traps of cliches and style, “Heaven's Gate” successfully and deliberately rejected the defeated graceful nature of the heroes-outsiders of many westerns of the 70s and portray the possible, energetic, uniting the rally heroes. to a compromised, but still vague victory. <br /> <br /> The social conflict of many westerns of the 70s finally develops into a full-fledged war; where capital is trying to crush the final victory over the scoundrels who stand in their way, they suddenly discover an army of massive and more powerful people, led by a man who played for Billy the Kid completely destroyed ten years ago. This is what led to the fact that the film was named the first Marxist western, but in fact it simply deprives of the meaning of the theme of the genre that existed long before the 60s. Such diverse and classic works of the old school as William Wyler's “Westerner” and even “Shane” tell horribly similar stories. Just here the romantic myth of the arrow replaced the romantic myth of the popular uprising. In a thrilling, thrilling, but realistic and, therefore, chaotic finale, the camp of marauding pastoralists is attacked, surrounded by dust clouds, interspersed with fallen horses, wriggling bodies and shooting. Averill forces his classical education to finally work, stealing a Roman trick and putting herders on the brink of annihilation before being rescued by cavalry (another distinctly seditious touch, but certainly not so offensive after a relentless description of a small, large Indian man) massacre) . In fact, it is difficult to come up with a more heroic American vision of mass resistance. The only real dead point of the film is an unnecessary crack, indicating a possible relapse of Averilla, a rather heavy fragment of tragedy. <br /> <br /> Despite some shortcomings and a slow middle, “Heaven's Gate” is the highest part of the work, a real attempt to create a modern western and new type of epos. If someone still has to join the choir, who believes that Cimino was absurd in his behavior on the set and the costs, then this is unfortunately. When today such flops as "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" and "K-19 - Widow" see that almost a hundred million dollars fail, and yet the bad reputation still hangs on this film, you might think what a gloomy death meant. The attempt of the original style, obscene sexuality, a very hard-won sense of detail, the rigorous severity of filmmaking and what is being filmed - all this contrasts with what is so lacking in such a modern Hollywood product.
