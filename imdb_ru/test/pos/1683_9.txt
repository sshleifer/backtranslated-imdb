I was amazed at the quality of this film, especially after seeing the pictures of a barely adult director - only 140 (?) Pounds! Truly, the boy makes a film about a boy. I'm looking forward to the new Luke Eberl movies. <br /> <br /> I really thought this movie was too long. There was too much time to show that Connor had failed (and did not want to) take a step on Owen. Caleb didn't try very hard. Owen, being so young, could easily get closer to Caleb and later decided that this was not his preference. And Owen would still learn a “valuable lesson” about corruption and politics. Instead, he did not give himself a chance to learn about his sexuality. What about poor Caleb? Owen could have a good effect. <br /> <br /> Although the film intends to show Owen as a hero who overcomes perverse corruption, I was sad for Owen. He was offered the opportunity to have fun with Caleb, who was extraordinarily beautiful. Owen should not accept political distortion, as suggested. But he could try to have fun with Caleb and leave whenever he wanted. It was clear that Owen was responsible - no one forced him to do what he did not want to do. But he could have more fun with a very hot guy. <br /> <br /> I hope that Luke makes more films where attractive young characters are more fun.
