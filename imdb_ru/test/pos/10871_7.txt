Martino, a young teacher on Elba, was educated by Maestro Fontanelli, an excellent teacher, to be his own person and say what he thinks is what causes him trouble at the school where we first meet him because he teaches revolutionary ideals. The island is frantic because of the arrival of one of the most influential people in 19th century European history. Napoleon comes to his exile, which is not the highest point in his life. <br /> <br /> Martino was surprised to be accompanied by Napoleon, who is writing his memoirs and needs help for his own project. The young man comes from the family of the sea merchant. His brother and sister want him to go on a commercial expedition, but Martino decided that his place belonged to Elba, because he would try to kill Napoleon. It scares him a little after his mentor, Fontanelli, is tried for treason and sentenced to be shot by a squad shot. <br /> <br /> Martino finds solace from a much older Baroness Emilia, a beautiful woman. In his own interaction with the overthrown emperor, another type of person appears. Napoleon is considered a more humane person who really likes Martino's company, unaware of the youngest manâ€™s plans for him. Unfortunately, Martino cannot bring his vision to life, because Napoleon has other plans. <br /> <br /> Paolo Virzi, director of Caterina va in citta, shows why his early promise still remains. Mr. Virzi also collaborated with the script, which is based on the novel by Ernesto Ferrero. The director shows that he is as good in the intimate drama as in this spectacle. Alessandro Pesci, a cinematographer, does an excellent job with the images he was able to get. <br /> <br /> Elio Germano, the young Italian actor, is the best thing in the film. He plays against more experienced players, but he manages to convince us that he is an idealistic young man who is trying to get justice for what he believes is a noble cause. The great Daniel Otei is more subdued than Napoleon than one would expect from any interpretation of this greater one than the life of man. Monica Bellucci - Martino's love interest, but she can do little. Omero Antonutti plays Fontanelli.
