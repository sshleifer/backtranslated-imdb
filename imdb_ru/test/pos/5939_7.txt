In fact, it was a remake of "Diagnostic Murder" minus Victoria Rowell, Scott Bayo and Charlie Schlatter. Dick plays a college professor who teaches Criminology 101 and can't even find his own class. Barry is now a private look, not related to Dick. This allows Barry to shoot the guys rushing from him, which the cop can't do. Barry still gets the girl at the end. Tracy Needham portrays a girl. She is the prime suspect, and Dick and Barry believe she is innocent and prove it. That's all you get is a spoiler. The final is quite unexpected, so you still do not know him in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> Don't take it seriously. Do not criticize it. Just relax and enjoy Dick and Barry Van Dyke.
