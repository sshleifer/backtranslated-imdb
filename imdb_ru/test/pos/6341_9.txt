I just watched “Return from the Lonely Pigeon” and it was very good! I have seen a lot of negative comments about this, and I don’t think the viewers are true! In the television / film business, it is difficult to get all the actors back to the second or third episode. We are fortunate that we have other ministries that are associated with lonely D. This production was top notch with an original musical score, and the actors put their hearts into it (you can tell). If you want to look lonely d. with Robert Duvall and Tommy L.J., then look at the original. Return to L.D. there was no such wit and acquires a more serious tone, but nevertheless it is completely mesmerizing. From touching moments to villains, this winner! "Wonderful!!!"
