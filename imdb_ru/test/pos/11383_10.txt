Sometimes the Academy does not recognize the potential of some films or does not nominate them, because they are contradictory or strong. Sometimes they are nominated, but gain nothing (I hope this will not happen this year with “American Beauty”). This is exactly what happened with Boogie Nights, which was the best film of 1997. The Academy chose to give the best picture of Oscar to "Titanic", a purely commercial and empty film, and other awards of the overestimated "Goodwill Hunt." And the annoying "Full Monty". Other photos that were nominated in the main category were “The Confidential Life of Los Angeles” and “How Good That Comes”, great movies, but “Boogie Nights” are still better and should be remembered in other categories. <br /> <br /> This amazing film tells the story of Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg, at an amazingly great performance), the 17-year-old bartender who takes on the attention of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds, in saving action), directed by porn movies. Eddie has a special "gift", and it helps him to enter the world of porn movies. He changes his name to Dirk Diggler and begins to achieve great success. But glory ... is not eternal. Other characters also have their own parallel stories — Amber Waves (Julianne Moore, perfect), Buck (Don Cheadle) and others, including Rollerdzhearl (Heather Graham), an actress who agrees to do anything, rollers. <br /> <br /> What could be a banal, trivial film turns into a beautiful, memorable film in the hands of Paul Thomas Anderson. What makes Boogie Nights such a wonderful film is its performance, adding to a smart, well-written script, a great soundtrack, etc. Each character is very well developed, and each of them has its own importance in context. Every feeling, weakness, fear, emotion is explored, and the result is a masterpiece of modern American cinema. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights is a strong, impressive picture that should be seen by anyone who truly loves cinema. Under the plot, which at first glance seems trivial, there is a wonderful story of ups and downs that we encounter in our lives. This is an amazing portrait of the late 70s and early 80s, like an era of ups and downs. That's what makes this movie such a special and real masterpiece. <br /> <br /> 10/10
