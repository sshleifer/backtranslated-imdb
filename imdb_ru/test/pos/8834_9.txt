Obviously, the answers here were written many years after the film was released and cannot be viewed in context. Back in 1980 in England after giving birth, this film was pretty darn funny. We were excited about something to laugh at, and Rising Damp, with his sympathetic mockery of whole social strata, was one of the best British sitcoms of his period, if not ever. This caused a response from almost everyone, and in true British fashion, we laughed at Rigsby in ourselves. America had nothing to do with this type of humor, because self-deprecation was not funny for our foreign cousins. Leonard Rossiter was one of the best actors in England, on stage, on television and in movies. His commitment and professionalism are unmatched. Richard Beckinsale was, although young, the perfect comedy foil for Rossiter and should, by right, be considered great at all times. If he had not been taken so young, I am sure that by now he would have been classified as one of the greatest comedians in the UK. Frances De La Tour found her best TV moment in the movie “Rising Dampness” and, for me, never rated her undoubted abilities in the following roles. If you have not seen the film at the time of its release, you have no right to comment, simply because you can not understand why it was funny, the humor of the moment.
