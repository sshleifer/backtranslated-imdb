I should no longer be surprised when critics miss the most obvious things in works of art, because they are people, and the vast majority of people are inherently lazy. Nevertheless, the simplistic idea that the great film by Ingmar Bergman, “Shame” (or “Scammen”) of 1968 is just an anti-war film, does great damage to the reputation of this very complex and very nuanced film. Compared to his more dramatic, ostentatious predecessors, Persona and Hour Of The Wolf, Shame seems to be a more classic movie in terms of storytelling. But, apparently, the key word is that, although it lacks Persona's bravurae pop psychologisation and the bright horror films Hour of the Wolf, it is one of the best war films ever created, not an anti-war film. no pro-war movie. As such, it should be counted among the Wild Strawberries as one of his greatest films, as well as one of his best scenarios, if not for the better. <br /> <br /> Although supposedly more psychologically exterior film than the films preceding this, it does say a lot more realistic things about the human psyche and the desire to survive. In it, Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman play Jan and Eva Rosenberg (perhaps the bow of the famous American spies, whom many European intellectuals considered innocent), two musicians who played for the local philharmonic orchestra before the start of the war, and they retreated to live on a small plot of land on the island, content with work in the greenhouse. The country in which they live is not named, as is the island on which they live, although the film was filmed on the small island of Bergman Faro, near the northern tip of the Swedish island of Gettland. It appears that their country fought against the occupying country for several years, or perhaps participated in a civil war with rebels from another province. This is all deliberately vague, as this war should symbolize all wars. This is enhanced as the film begins with various military quotes on the screen, and the captions roll. These include quotes from Hitler in the era of Vietnam American military leaders. After the early scenes, which depict the prosaic nature of their rural life, and then the onset of war, when even old people are involved, an air attack destroys the land of Rosenberg, when enemy planes fly overhead, dropping bombs and something that chemical nature. One plane is shot down, and the skydiver jumps out and ends up hanging on a tree. Yang, who starts the film as a cowardly coward, refuses to go and help, so Eve leaves alone. Jan joins her and they discover that the pilot was shot dead. He seems to be really part of the invading or perhaps rebellious force. A bunch of government soldiers soon stop at their home and ask questions about the dead pilot, and then advises the couple to leave their home, since the invaders are nearby. there are misinterpretations of the film at the micro level, such as that of the Bergman scientist Mark Gervais, who gives a commentary on the film on the DVD of the film. Like many other critics, he claims that Jacobi is Quisling, who collaborated with the invaders. But this is clearly and obviously wrong, since Jacobi belongs to the original fascist government. As evidence, first, the invaders repel after they invade the land of the Rosenbergs and film their interview with the propaganda campaign. We know this because the government, which later puts them in doubt of the fake interview and words inserted into Eva’s mouth, sees the film as supposed evidence of their betrayal, and Jacobi is clearly working with them, Big Brother’s Fascist statisticians. Secondly, Jacobi is responsible for deciding which of the townspeople are sent to concentration camps for cooperation with the invaders, and Rosenberg, again, are among those who were spared. Thirdly, in his seduction of Eve, Jacobi tells her that his son is on leave from the military, and it is clear that if he were an aggressor, he would not so happily say that his son serves the state. In addition, the rebel forces are not official armies and do not provide official leave. Finally, Philip is clearly with insurgents or invaders of the Organization, and why did he kill a colleague? <br /> <br /> That Gervais and other critics have so blatantly and senselessly misinterpreted and overlooked such a key, and the obvious meaning of this film calls into question their ability to distinguish any aspects of all Bergman films. This is a wonderful and wonderful film, very high in the Berman canon, but it is disappointing when you read how very few critics and viewers really understand his complex message, choosing instead cheap, lazy and easy statements that it is. just anti-war, and quite simple film compared to his bright predecessors. And this, in the end, is a real shame of shame.
