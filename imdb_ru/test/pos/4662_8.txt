Well, I just discovered IMDb from my twin sister, Carol. Carol and I played Tolstoy's Identical Twin in Midnight Madness. We did not have much to prepare for the fat part that came with us, and well, and the rest was natural. ;) It was our first major movie role, and we had a blast doing it. At that time, we were 21 years old, and we lived about an hour and a half from Disney Studios in Burbank and Hollywood, California. We grew up in front of the TV and, possibly, among the children of the first generation. Twenty years later, we are still very fun, and we are still “heavy” or something politically correct these days. We no longer strive for action, but, as we know, we “return” when a suitable opportunity appears. Carol is a chiropractor in our hometown in Southern California, and I work in the field of information technology in Georgia. <br /> <br /> I may have been biased, but the film seemed sweet, clean and funny. We knew that this was not a masterpiece or an Oscar nominee, however it was and remains a film that the whole family can watch and have fun together. It's nice not to worry about your small children watching videos without fast-forwarding certain parts. And no one was more excited when he was released on video, like Carol and I. Carol found it at Kmart for $ 6.99! Now this is an inexpensive way to capture your memories and share them with others. <br /> <br /> Regards, Betsy Lynn and Carol Gwynn; Twins Thompson
