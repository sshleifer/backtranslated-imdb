He may not have had big budgets, celebrities, or Scream, Urban Legend, or "I know what you did last summer," but in The Tales of the Bonfire was what these three films lacked: real horror. <br /> <br /> This film took up the theme of urban legends a year before the successfully named and less fascinating Urban Legend did. It was an intriguing, expertly written and logical way I know about, what you talked about last summer. Finally, he concentrated and ended in a flurry, while Crick lost consciousness and died. <br /> <br /> The most exciting thing about the film is the variety of horrors that screenwriters and directors have achieved. The campfire’s teenagers ’comprehensive story was a classic fear of the unknown (but surely expected) death that awaited them in the forest, but the stories themselves are where the film really shone. <br /> <br /> The first sequence is a clean, impetuous urban myth. It is based on a popular legend, and the director plays it with style and pace of action, making it more fascinating, because we know what will happen. <br /> <br /> The first story about the fire - a forward forward thriller. Based on another popular myth, we are not really aware of this until the end, because it fits so well into history and because action holds our attention. Being a trilogy thriller, it removes our fear of the unknown and includes several well-made sequences of “jumps” that don't seem so cheap or contrite, like in films like Scream or Urban Legend. <br /> <br /> The second story is more intense. This time, although the characters still do not know what is happening, we understand, and this creates horror. It does not need cheap thrills. <br /> <br /> The latest story contains elements of the supernatural and uses a creepy / tripty atmosphere to scare the viewer. Since we can relate so easily to the characters and their situation, our fear stems from their intensity and what they cannot explain. This is the true story of the ghost trio. <br /> <br /> I didn’t expect me to like Fairy Tales by the Fire when I rented them. I thought that if I do not like his more famous, more budget colleagues, how can I like it? <br /> <br /> The truth is that this film was successful when others were far from reaching their goal. ,
