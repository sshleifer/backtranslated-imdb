Another Raquel Welch Classic! This picture appeared in cinemas on November 10, 1969 with Raquel Welch as Michelle, James Stacy as Joe and Luke Askew as Alan Morris. Nikki is going to meet her friends Michele and Jackie. On the way there, she encounters her ex-husband, who wants a second chance. Nikki walks away from him, walks to the table where he sees Michele and Jackie. Alan approaches her again, and she starts to leave when Alan shoots her in the back. Nikki is taken to the hospital, and Michele and Jackie go to the police station. Michelle goes to the hospital where she meets up with Jackie, only to find out that Nikki is dead. Alan goes for Jackie, whom he knocks down with a machine, and then tries to knock Michel down. Michelle jumps into his car and heads for Los Angeles. When she gets there, she calls Lloyd to her boss in Las Vegas to tell him that she is all right. Lloyd tells her to go to a club called losers to see Jerry about work. However, there is one problem! The bartender has a drug problem, and Alan knows this, so Alan and the bartender talked a little. Back in Los Angeles, Michelle not only gets a job as a dancer with Jerry, but also contacts Jacky Jeri Joe. Now a few thoughts about this picture! This picture was much better than in the past of Raquel, and this one was non-stop. Luke Askew played great with Nikki, her ex-husband. He was your typical murder with that look. Regarding Raquel Welch's speech, the only word that comes to me is fantastic. She was awesome in this film, and her beauty stood out and shone like never before. The costume she wore on stage to dance was breathtaking. In fact, all the outfits she wore in this film were breathtaking. Of course, it doesn't matter what Raquel was, because she looks good in all or nothing. I give this movie 10 affection stars for two reasons. The first and most certainly is Raquel Welch, who is a leading actress and deserves 10 stars. The second reason is that this film was from start to finish with excitement from wall to wall.
