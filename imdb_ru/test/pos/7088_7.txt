The DVD wrapper in which this movie appeared appeared to describe it as “inspiring and with a sense of humor.” These are not the words I would choose - not too far. I would choose the word "gloomy", sometimes even "depressing." This does not mean that it is a bad film. In fact, this is a pretty good film, showing good presentations of the presenters, with enough uncertainty about what will happen at the end, which you continue to watch. The uncertainty stems from the structure of the film — it seems that she revolves around Ellen's memories of her mother’s slow death from cancer when she is interviewed by DA. So we know from the very beginning that something suspicious happened at the end - “what?” Questions and who? ”<br /> <br /> Renee Zellweger was very good as Ellen is a somewhat offended daughter who is forced to give up living and working in New York to go home to care for her sick mother. Ellen develops through the film — more than any other character — when she learns to cope with both the strengths and the weaknesses of her parents. Father (William Hurt) is quite interesting. My initial impression was Lo, they were pretty close, but the warts in relationships begin to manifest after a while. ways. Finally, Meryl Streep, as Kate was struck with cancer, was very persuasive in this role, trying to live what was left of her life, in the most satisfying way, and then cope with the anger she is experiencing in . In a sense, viewing a family agreement with such a crisis reminded me a bit about Ordinary People, although this film was much less emotionally intense. Thus, not "inspiring and humorous" (with all due respect to whoever wrote the synopsis on the cover of the DVD), but very good in its own way. 7/10
