This is a worthy effort for the martial arts thriller B-Movie. Ian Jacklin, a former kickboxing champion in the cruising race in North America, plays a leading role and performs well in battle scenes. Muscled Mathias Hughes gets a chance to add more to his “Bad Boy in Martial Arts” character in this film than in many of his many others, and if you're a fan of “Teutonic Titan”, rent this movie now! <br /> <br /> René Griffin is also notable as a romantic interest in this film. She starts from a position, but soon becomes a hero, and they very stylishly make “Monster with two backs”. <br /> <br /> The fight scene is good in American traditions (NO acrobatics of Hong Kong). here!) with added realism from the fact that Benny "Jet" Urkidez plays himself as a coach John Larson (Jacklin). <br /> <br /> In general, this film has more plots than most in its genre, so you get more history.
