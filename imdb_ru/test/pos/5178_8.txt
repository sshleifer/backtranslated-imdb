My whole family enjoyed this movie, including 2 small children. Great values ​​without sex, violence, drugs, nudity or profanity. There were also no million-dollar special effects added to try to knock viewers off a poorly written storyline. Simple little family fun movie. We especially like the songs in the movie. But we need to hear only a part of the songs ... Mostly during the final credits ... I would like to buy a CD with a sound track from this film. This is my fourth film by Bill Hillman, and they all have the same rules as above. With all the movies you don’t want your kids to watch, this Hillman guy doesn't have a risk rating. We love his movies.
