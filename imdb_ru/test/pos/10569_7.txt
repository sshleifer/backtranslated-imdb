Historical drama is one of the areas where the British simply cannot be defeated. So, although I'm not a big fan of the genre, I can usually be persuaded to see something light if it's British and with decent actors. <br /> <br /> Sarah never read anything from Sarah Waters, which of course is something that I have to do. Consequently, I really did not know what to expect from this. I heard that there will be a lesbian love story, but not by much. While watching, I found it to be much more interesting than I expected. Not to mention that the plot twists are unexpected, as well as well thought out. Despite the fact that somewhere there were too many turns, it took me a minute to figure it out. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are good, the actors are very good, and the pace is decent, although I found it a bit slow in the last half hour. It can only be me, I usually have a problem with delaying films after the plot is more or less finished. In general, it is a rather pleasant three hours. I recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas.
