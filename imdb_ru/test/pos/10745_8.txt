Sequels - this is a capricious lot, most of which are far from the growth of the original. Sometimes you find a sequel that is considered better than the original, some critics (for example, John Charles) claim that A2 is better than the original, I don’t agree with something, but this film still deserves attention and fits well with the release of a brilliant racing cinema in Hong Kong in the 1980s, as well as Jackie's own creativity. I really wonder how with such a stunning release of great films that his later films were not so good. He made only two films in the 1990s, and neither of them passed by, but he had a great influence in many films where he is not officially a director. <br /> <br /> Earlier, in 1987, Jackie had an operation on his brain after the operation. catastrophic fall on the set of the Armor of God. This prompted him to work on his next film not far from home. This did not lead him to stop risking his life and a team of tricks for our entertainment. The result was a loud hit at home, which eclipsed the original at the box office (31 million Hong Kong dollars, compared with 19 million for the original). <br /> <br /> Jackie Chan is once again an extraordinary police officer, Dragon Ma, and he is ordered to work with Superintendent Three Wan Chun (Lam Wai, Royal Warriors), who is the only Chinese police officer allowed to have a gun, but it is believed to arrange arrests in order to look better and ignore the crimes of the Lord of the Triad. by the name of Tiger Ay (Michael Chan Wai-Man, Lord of the Dragons). Obviously, Chun has too many forces to be killed directly, but he is freed from the Sai Wan district (now he is “Two Vans”), which captures the Dragon Ma. This inefficient and corrupt office will soon get a new look, and there is a great scene where three officers who don't know who they are dealing with are trying to attack Ma in order to teach him a lesson about police complaints. Soon he received this area of ​​the ship and Tiger Au took care of him. The choreography of the fight and the stunts with Tigre and his men are pretty cool. My favorite trick was a beautiful cruel fall from the second floor into a large vase, and this vase did not seem soft. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, there are a couple of side stories. There are pirates who survived the first film, who seek revenge and food. In addition, there are revolutionaries, including Maggie (Maggie Chung, “In the mood for love”) and (Rosamund Kwan, “Casino Raiders”) who are trying to raise funds for Dr. Sun Yat-sen to overthrow the Qing government, and also government operatives who are trying to find these rebels. Add a mixture of corrupt Hong Kong and British cops, as well as legitimate ones, and you get a stew containing too many ingredients, but it nonetheless seems to merge. This works well when there is a scene influenced by the Marx brothers (the Marx brothers did this type of scene several times with Cocoanuts (1929) being the first) in Maggie's place, where everyone is looking for someone, hiding from someone else. Only on this stage many weeks have been spent, and efforts, certainly, show. <br /> <br /> There are several flaws in the movie. Is there some didactic nature that creeps in a film that seems a bit out of place ?? especially one small speech at the end, which Jackie makes when dealing with mainland revolutionaries and the extremely easy handling of pirates who survived the first movie. Female characters are again underestimated and underestimated, especially Maggie Cheung. I was not so pleased with the continuation of the plot, as the first film. Separate scenes dominate my feelings for the film instead of thinking of this film as a single whole. I don’t blame the film for not being able to make Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao the same as the first one (although I heard that the main reason for this was that these two were shooting Eastern Condors, but I wonder if Jackie wait a little while, to get them to perform in this, they will work together for the last time next year in “Dragons Forever,” but they are not enough. <br /> <br /> I found it quite enjoyable and made a good film and is rightfully considered one of the best comedy fighters of the 1980s. This film is also pretty good at A few unexpected places. The artistic direction is superb (Eddie Ma Poon-chiu), the costumes are elegant, the cinema is good, and the film looks quite authentic. But the tricks, comedy and action are what I remember this film. The dragon and Chun are handcuffed (part of the ax throwing scene will be used in Shanghai noon.) The last twenty minutes are full of impressive hits, falls, chili pepper as a mouthpiece (Jackie writes in his autobiography how he used real peppers in this scene; You can see it during a strong pain in the mouth (when it comes off at the end) and is a worthy conclusion to this film. The most famous trick of this sequence is his reverence to Buster Keaton of Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928), except that there is no hole in it and there is only a weak section through which its head slips. <br /> <br /> Jackie fans and / or the cinema in Hong Kong should consider this a must and watch. I certainly do.
