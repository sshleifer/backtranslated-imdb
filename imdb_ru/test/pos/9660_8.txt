This is perhaps the best film of 2002 about the Romanian cinema. I recommend that it be an intense drama without a lack of action and thrill. The film focuses on teenage life in the suburbs of Bucharest through the protagonist, paying not so much attention to the shape or definition of the character as to the anger that he and other characters experience. The name “Fury” means rage, not anger, but in the film it can be viewed in both senses from the behavior of the actors. A rather strange love story (not a typical romantic, but rather a modern suburban concept) is well formed by the end. This is a fascinating picture, and the cinema catches the suburban nightlife very well, which makes it a good movie to watch. <br /> <br /> You will not get tired of a minute, I promise!
