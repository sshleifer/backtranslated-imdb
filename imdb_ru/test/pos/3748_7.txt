Is this a good movie? It is hard to say, but in 1953 for many it was a surprisingly effective film, alarming, scary, and then, amazingly, touching, when the “old gentleman” meets his unfortunate death at the end of the film. /> <br /> Yes, what is hidden in the Labyrinth turns out to be something unexpected and fun for many. But the basic idea (ontogeny sums up phylogeny) was very real at the time the book was written, and indeed it has some basis. Not that this ever led to what we see in the film, of course. <br /> <br /> But working on what should have been with a very small budget, one of the greatest designers — and a person for whom the term “production designer” was invented — creates a very creepy mood that was strangely compelling. Sometimes, of course, the film is very stupid, but it has its moments.
