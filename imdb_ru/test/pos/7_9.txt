Our family (and all sold out pre-audience) enjoyed the "The Guardian". Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave compelling insights into the role of the fictional helicopter rescue characters Ben and Jake. Having seen this film, you cannot fail to imagine how difficult it would be to finish the USCG helicopter rescue school and one day take part in real rescue. <br /> <br /> Even if this is a fictional film, he demonstrated the rather convincing merits of team spirit, dedication and courage shown by all members of the US Coast Guard. <br /> <br /> The special effects used to create escape scenes were incredible. You really felt you were taking part in a real rescue. <br /> <br /> I feel that the film could have been made without a scene in the Hollywood bar (when you watch the film, you could agree), since the real Coast Guard does not justify this behavior. <br /> <br /> Very interesting, very rich, definitely worth a look. Thank you, the US Coast Guard and REAL rescue helicopters, "So others can live." I highly recommend this film to everyone.
