I just can't watch this bit too many times, it’s full of the true enthusiasm and cunning that Mickey Mouse experienced in his first 30 years. Nowadays, Mickey is a smart beggar when he compares this. Steamboat Willie always makes me smile, at least in the final, where Mickey laughs after hitting the parrot with potatoes. The animation is very good, and although Willie’s steamer has no dialogue, there’s enough music for him. <br /> <br /> IMHO, if this bit doesn’t deserve 10/10, then any cartoon is not only because it’s a real Classic, but also because it’s full of joy, and it’s always fun to watch.
