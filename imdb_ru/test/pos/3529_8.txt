One of the many horrors of wilderness that appeared in the early eighties, and, fortunately, one of the best. Yes, it has a stupid plot, but I was pleasantly surprised by this film, because I thought it was really good and really interesting, although the killer could have been made a little more frightening, it just looked like fat sluts. <br /> <First, we have a local sheriff or whatever it is who warns them not to go into these mountains, because they are very dangerous. But when teenagers arrive, it doesn't seem at all dangerous, in my opinion, anyway. It is a pity that we no longer have such films, and if so, then usually this is some kind of boring horrible film. <br /> <br /> This film is more based on tension and horror than blood, because the blood factor is really low in this film, which I was not pleased with, but except that it is still a great movie. <br /> <br /> in general, youâ€™ll have to search long and hard to find this film, and if you find it, you will like it, and also beware of ending up with the last girl, and the killer is not at all what do you expect.
