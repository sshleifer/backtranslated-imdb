Here is a much less well known science fiction of the 50s with a slightly different twist. The son of atomic energy researchers is kidnapped and held for the ransom of the atomic secrets of the Father. <br /> <br /> This is a closely related atomic sci-fi thriller with great performance and above-average play, even from a child. Atomic City, in fact, has a sense of film, unlike many other sci-fi 50s of this time, which have become more like an episode of a television show. <br /> <br /> The nuclear city was also actually nominated for an Oscar for best screenplay - how many other science fiction figures from the 50s can advertise an Oscar nomination? <br /> <br /> The excellent pace, tough direction and superb shooting in the “real” nuclear city of Los Alamos, New Mexico makes it worth seeing. The circulation of collectors in the circulation is above average and makes an excellent double function with Atomic Man !! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
