I saw this movie some time ago and I cannot find it. Anyone know where I can get this? I feel worth seeing again. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I haven't heard of Chloe Nicholl before this movie. Yes, she can act. When I first started tracking this movie, I took it after another, Sex Spa. The plot seems to me similar, but the roles are reversed. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I saw Drew Barrymore. I watched some of her other films and I feel that she looks better like blonde. <br /> <br /> I agree that this is a good introductory film. Not too soft Not too hard. You have to start somewhere.
