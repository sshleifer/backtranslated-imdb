WARNING: there are potential spoilers ahead! <br /> <br /> “Steven Spielberg presents the adventures of Tiny Toon” has always been one of my favorite cartoons that grew (damn it, it is). And this film perfectly reflects everything that I like in this show, and turns it into a full-length form. <br /> <br /> A beautifully animated Tokyo Movie Shinsa studio (WB outsource every Tiny Toons project, and it was the best studio to handle the show), the film begins at the end of the school year at Acme Looniversity, a famous cartoon College, where Buster and Babs Bunny (whatever) and their teenage peers learn from the masters of animated insanity, Looney Tunes. After the last call, the film is divided into five different plots. Buster engages Babs in a water gun battle, which ends with a bursting dam and tidal wave, sending Buster, Babs and Elmira Byron's dog down an inverted picnic table in search of adventure in the deep south. Plucky Duck tells Hamton Pig and his family to allow him to go with them to HappyWorldLand, “The happiest place in the Western Hemisphere,” but he has to put up with an agonizing car ride and the threat of a hitchhiker who owns a chainsaw. Elmira's cat, Furball, is finally running away, but she is not discouraged ... not when Acme Safari Park has a lot of Amines to play with. Fifi la Fium devotes his summer to hunting his heartbreaker, movie star Johnny Pugh, in the hope of getting an autograph. Of course, the hotel where he stays is almost impassable. And Shirley MacLoon sets up a fortune teller on the Acme Acres boardwalk ... and allows her to be alerted on her day off when Faulmut takes her to watch the horror film "Schoonfobia". <br /> <br /> All these stories The lines are very funny, and in the end some of them even overlap. The only complaint I have about this film is that it does not fully use the Tiny Toons list - Dizzy Devil and Mary Melody have only one scene, Gogo Dodo only appears at the beginning and end of the film, and Montana Max, Sweeties, Calamity Coyote and Little Beeper are not found anywhere. However, they are apologetic flaws in another perfect movie. This film is quite rare today since it is over 12 years old, and as far as I know, it has never been released on DVD, but I strongly recommend that you find it - anyone who is a fan of Warner Bros. animation, classical or modern, NEEDS watch this movie
