Beautiful little film about the introduction of movies in China. It captures the amazement of the first movie viewers in much the same way as it has been described all over the world, and uses the real Lumiere films for most realities. I disagree with other people about the bad game from the British guy - I thought he was fine, but the Chinese leadership really stole the show. In any case, for most of the movie, I smiled on my face. People who are afraid of subtitles may notice that most of the film is written in English (which for some reason is equipped with subtitles, as well as Chinese on DVD).
