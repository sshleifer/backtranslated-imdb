I liked this Western starring Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford. It has almost everything that should be in a western style. There are gunfights, action films, horse racing. There is a bit of romance hinting at it. There is a pleasant comic relief in the form of Edgar Buchanan, who plays Uncle Willie MacLeod, a character who pretends to be a stupid old fool, but actually knows everything that happens. Randolph Scott plays the sheriff in town, and Glenn Ford plays Cheyenne Rogers / Bill Smith, the persecuted criminal, who eventually tries to change his image. I liked the different combination of characters in the film. I didn't always find him fast, but I never found it boring. Even if the film is 1943, it is colored. 8/10
