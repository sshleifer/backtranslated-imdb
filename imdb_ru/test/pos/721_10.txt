This is definitely an iconic classic! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is difficult to trace, but, again, the same film as "Jacobs Ladder" or even "Fight Club". If you want a standard fare, then I will rent a Care Bears Movie or maybe an old Disney classic. But if you want to “look at the world differently,” I would say, open yourself to Enigma and, for that matter, to a film that challenges what we see and think. <br /> <br /> For me the key is that the film was original and made me ask questions. So, although I have seen some complaints, in general, I would say, take the film for what it is and enjoy it.
