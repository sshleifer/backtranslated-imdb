People were often uncomfortable because of the "Venetian merchant" because of its anti-Semitic themes. Fortunately, this film avoids this by deciding instead to show how anti-Semitism prevailed in 16th-century Europe. The story, of course, is that Antonio (Jeremy Irons) needs money so that he can help Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) ask Portia's hand (Lynn Collins) in marriage. He receives money from the Jewish usurer Shylock (Al Pacino), who demands a pound from Antonio's flesh if the latter does not repay the loan. When Antonio cannot repay the loan, Shylock is determined to get what he owes. <br /> <br /> We expect that the cast will do a good job and they will not disappoint. This is further evidence of the great actor Al Pacino.
