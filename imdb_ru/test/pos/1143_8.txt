I agree with msinabottle; This is a great film. Here are some fragments of the dialogue: <br /> <br /> Raysouli (Sean Connery) Eden Pedekarisu (Candice Bergen): “You see a man at the well, how does he draw water? When one bucket is empty, the other is filled. ”So much for the world. You are currently full of power. But you spill it wastefully. And Islam is picking up drops when they spill out of your bucket. ” <br /> <br /> Raisuli: In the past, the British paid very well. Pedekaris: Well, you can't do it with the Americans. President Roosevelt will have a head for this. Raisuli: Roosevelt. This president Roosevelt - would he try to take it himself? Pedekaris: He certainly will! He is a man of strong character and strong morality. He does not abduct women and children! Raisuli: What rifle does he use? Pedekaris: Winchester! Raisuli: Winchester. Winchester. I do not know about this rifle. Pedekaris: You will. <br /> <br /> Teddy Roosevelt (Brian Keith): The American grizzly bear is a symbol of the American character: strength, intelligence, ferocity. A little blind and reckless, but brave beyond doubt. Oh, and another trait goes with all the previous ones. Newspaper Reporter: And what, Mr. President? Teddy Roosevelt: Loneliness. The bear lives its own life alone. Indomitable. Unconquered. But always alone. He has no real allies, only enemies - but not one of them is as big as he. Newspaper Reporter: Do you feel that this could be an American trait? Teddy Roosevelt: Of course. The world will never love us. It can respect us. It may even grow afraid of us. But it will never love us. Because we have too much courage. And sometimes we are a little blind and reckless.
