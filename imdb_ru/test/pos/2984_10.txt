Well ..... I would not like to lecture anyone, but I feel the desire to say something that I think is important about this BEAUTIFUL film. I first saw it in 1976 (I was 14), and then again a year. That was it. Otherwise, it was a pink disc of Elton John's soundtrack, which penetrated deeper and deeper into my heart. How deep? A week ago, my cousin gave me a copy of VHS as a gift. (No DVD yet). Boy .... I was surprised !! Poets have always experienced that deep childhood and youth experiences of beauty, love, God, idealistic activities remain with you forever. Since they are found mainly at the level of the heart (as long as there is no intelligence!), They determine the contours of your soul, as the sculptor will do with the stone. If sometimes we are not inclined to forget how right they are, perhaps we can better understand the meaning of every minute, every decision, every turning point in our lives. <br /> <br /> I admit, I feel nostalgic. But the exciting part of it is watching the movie again, and thanks to this trip into the past, a richer understanding of why we, the people of the 60s, grew the same way as we did. The spirit of that time is all here: Being, created far from the official world of consumer and economic success, make love, not war, beautiful pop ballads, poetry of lyrics, a completely romantic look at teenagers' uprising with awakening sexuality, carefully wrapped in tender and chaste love, these two lonely spirits, still full of childish innocence, grow together when they learn mutual commitment and turn into "adults." <br /> <br /> I showed the film to a group of schoolchildren, and they were full of such simplistic and cynical comments, considering it naive and stupid. Guys, be serious !! Cinema is an art, and as art it reflects not only human emotions, but also historical moments. And this is exactly what Friends is doing virtually. This reflects the idyllic idea of ​​rebellion and a new beginning, which we all dreamed of when we were 15 years old. Now I'm a musician, and I feel that some of us artists are still dreaming about it !! How else can we live? This is “Friends”, this is “Brother Sun Sister Moon”, this is “Hair”. These were times, still alien to AIDS, alien to explicit and vulgar texts in pop songs, without any melody, pornography, presented as “sexuality”, to this barbaric new “world order” growing after 11 September. <br /> <br /> What a joyful experience to see again Paul and Michel, timidly and tenderly exploring the new fantasies of their romantic world. What a journey back to the heart of our hearts: to Paris, to Elton John at his best, to that urban scenario, surrounded by 2 CV Citroëns and VW Beetles. What fresh air from a quiet cottage in the Camargue, surrounded by fish ponds and wild horses. They made us as we are, like Serrat in Spain, Brel in France, Peter Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, Luther King, The Beatles, the early Bee Gees, Spiritual Belafonte, Gandhi, the Gospel of Elvis. <br /> <br /> People still hope: get this picture. Start with innocence and evolve from there. You will find out what this is all about. And from there you will have a solid and more truthful foundation; some ideals to look for in life, a way to solve personal and world affairs. We need so much today! Give yourself a chance, and maybe sometime the time of the cynics will end. (I have an extra copy of VHS) <br /> <br /> Santiago Zuleta. Bogota, Colombia.
