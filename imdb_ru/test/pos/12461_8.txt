Don't let wildly changing movie reviews hold you back. You will love it or hate it according to your own tastes. However, if for any other reason, watch “Greystoke” to experience the excitement of a great actor who captures your heart when he breathes life into his role. Ralph Richardson was not a great actor because he did a great job with Shakespeare; rather, he should be remembered for his sensitive attitude to each character he portrayed. He was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor. His reading of the part of the Sixth Lord of Greystoke, his last performance, should be loved by all who love theater.
