I saw this step, being in Paris in May 2006 ... I argued between this and the impossible mission ... I am very glad that I chose OSS 117 not only because it was funny, but I could just as well watch the french movie in france. I had a great time ... would recommend it. It is important to have some insight into French society today, to truly enjoy the humor of this film ... I can’t wait for the DVD to be released ... I don’t know how some of the pun 'jeu De mots' will be translated into English, I will definitely buy him when he comes out! Postscript I saw in “BRice de Nice” - a film with Dujardin in the title role, which all the children talked about in France. this film is a comedy, but more stupid than you can imagine ... comparing both films, I must say that Dujardin did a good job at OSS 117.
