A bit of “cinema in the movie”, or, since the topic here is a virtual game that is reality, or even more frightening, which reality is “real.” Like any Cronenberg, there are organic things, such as a pod, a great idea: an organic gun, a bone and cloth weapon that shoots teeth. If there are some slower moments, sets, projects and ideas are there with some thoughts about revolution. May not like it, because the way the movie is going on is rather unusual and sometimes alarming, but worth it.
