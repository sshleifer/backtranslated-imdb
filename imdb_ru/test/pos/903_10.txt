This is a well-made action movie. There are many fight scenes, acting is convincing (for this genre), and RS1 is awesome. I donâ€™t know why people feel compelled to throw out the RS1, I thought its effects were very good and its design looked great. The plot was acceptable for a martial arts film. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I have to say that Richard San is one of the worst Hong Kong actors I've ever seen. At least the RS1 had the right idea by killing him. Now, for all of you who thought that Sam Lee (the Alien) was a bad actor ... he should not be taken seriously! I just had the pleasure of watching Gen-X Cops (a prequel), and Sam Lee played the same character the same way! <br /> <br /> Now, please, all of you guys who watch the highly acclaimed Oscar winners: DON'T JUDGE THAT THIS IS A THINKING FILM! MUST NOT BE THOUGHTS! Just for pleasure, that's all. I hope they make another one soon.
