Amateur camera work, I thought that this film was very different, and, unlike all the blogs and posts I read, I got something completely different from the ending than others. The premise of the story revolves around a very religious family and their ties to their church. How they should adhere to all the hard and fast rules and norms, but her daughter seems to have problems finding herself on the path with unpleasant thoughts about others and her use of a bad language. And yet she prays a lot, like her family. Then one day they go to a church picnic and have an accident. From there, the parents and her brother change; that with being beaten out and "saved" by Jesus. ATTENTION: BASIC SPOILER ALERT. Or so we are led to believe. I think that if you watch this film only from the point of view of your daughter, then really pay attention to the fact that at the end you will see that what we, the audience, think is an actual event with parents and son, in fact, everything dream and from the daughter from the first person. This explains many of the actions that parents and son portray, which are completely opposite to how they used to live, especially gender, and also explains why Peggy got away with murder, etc. Look at how perfect this cake is. eat, but go back and look at the cake that Betty makes. This is if Caroline did not remove all the evidence that the cake was filled. As well as the fact that the scene where she sees her dead parents lying there in each otherâ€™s arms, and her brother, all of whom seemed to die very peacefully, even when poisoned, correspond to the sequence of sleep.
