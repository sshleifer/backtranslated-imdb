Climb my crazy horse, And drive, and drive, and drive. <br /> <br /> What is the name of the song, Explosivo! I do not know what it is about, but go well. What is the name of my girlfriend, I do not know, But it is built as the best And it’s good to go, go, It’s good to go, It’s good to go <br /> <br /> We eat Satan, Yes, we learn from Satan. Dressed by Satan! We write these delicious riffs as fast as we can. Learned from Satan! <br /> <br /> We were the inventors of the cosmic astral code. We came to blow you up, We came to blow your nose. We came to hell of a blow, We came to blow the show. We have come to a terrible blow, You know it, you know it! <br /> <br /> What is the name of the song, Explosivo! I do not know what it is about, but to think well - oh! <br /> <br /> I'm not one of you. I come from antiquity. I am known as the Kicker Elves.
