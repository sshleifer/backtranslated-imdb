"Art for teachers of children" Jennifer Montgomery - a stunning, exciting masterpiece. Harsh cinematography and cinematography of Montgomery, combined with the brilliantly unemotional actions she evokes from her cast, reinforce the sense of shocking, crude realism in this autobiographical story of seduction of 14-year-old Jennifer of her boarding school. The scenes between the amazingly strange actress playing Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifer's mother (actually voiced by Ruth Montgomery) on the phone are among the most intriguing and powerful I have ever seen in the film. The lesson learned ultimately here? "There is nothing more dangerous than a boring person who creates bad art." Well, I highly recommend this wonderful "Art" to anyone who is interested in independent cinema, which makes you think.
