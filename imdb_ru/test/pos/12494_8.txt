And I love it !!! Wonder Showzen will bring together a cult audience, and as soon as it is canceled, DVD sales will go through the roof. This is a very funny show in its own way. This is a parody of children's shows, namely Sesame Street. Our puppet characters consist of Chauncey, a yellow fluffy monster in a hat whose master is ours. Clarence is a blue lizard that makes its segments when it goes out. He is a strange dog, like a thing that treats itself in the third person. Wordsworth is smart, whose brain always shows. Then there is a speaker and a pink puppet. This is a very fun show, not as unpleasant as you expect, but more situations. They take 7-year-olds to the street, tell them what to say, and force them to make cruel jokes that they do not understand. My favorite segments are Clarence's video, especially when someone doesn't want to be filmed. I prefer TV Funhouse, which was like a show, but it is still a very funny show, which I hope will last for many years. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** 1/4 of *** *. 30 minutes of TV MOM.
