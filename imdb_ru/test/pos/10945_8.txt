With the film featuring Gemini, Ekin Cheng and Edison Chen, no one should expect a masterpiece of cinema. However, what you get is a funny film, easy for the eyes and brain. There are many Hollywood-style vampires (there are no jumping Chinese bloodsuckers here), cute girls, beautiful heroes, and sometimes a very funny moment. And Jackie Chan. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kung Fu is highly dependent on wired work and computer graphics. Of course, the script reminds you of Blade. And, of course, all this will be instantly forgotten. <br /> <br /> But for a really nice piece of cinematic fluff, it will be difficult for you to find the best.
