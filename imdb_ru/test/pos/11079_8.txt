Take, for example, the young liberal idealist Christopher Beuys (Timothy Hutton), who was classified in the state secret company because of his father’s position, combining him with drug dealer Da'ton ​​Lee (Sean Penn) who is wanted by the police You have a recipe for spying. Sean Penn played the role of a drug dealer with some kind of singing, probably because of such plausibility with such crude types. The gall that Penn carries with him in every situation is unique; he even proposes that the Soviets launch drugs for him. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie again and again, and every time I see something new. It seems to me that the main problem of American spy organizations lies in their inbreeding, which leads to hiring a clearly inappropriate candidate because of their temperament and inclination towards the state front company. <br /> <br /> I remember when Falconier escaped from prison and led the authorities in pursuit of the wild geese. I see that, despite the escape, he is now released. It is a pity that the Soviets are no more to accept the villain! Cheerful Cherio!
