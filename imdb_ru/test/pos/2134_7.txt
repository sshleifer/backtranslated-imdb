This wonderful film was never shown in my city, so in fact I did not have the opportunity to watch it until the end of the 80s when I saw it on German television. I was expecting something catastrophic and found instead a well-functioning grand western with a great location. The tiny tube couldn't really hurt it, and thereâ€™s almost no boring moment in this 4-hour film, so I hope to see it again on the big screen. What a sight it would be! Do not miss if you have this opportunity. Unfortunately, the harsh attitude to the "Heavenly Gate" at their opening destroyed Michael Cimino's career, and he moved from a tolerable ("Year of the Dragon") to a dullly absurd ("Sicilian") and shrilly dull ("Desperate Hours")
