People criticize NSNA because it’s a low point in the career of god Bond Sean Connery, and because it’s unofficial. *** CAN CONTAIN SPOILERS * Firstly, this film is better than any other Bond film, which depicts any other actor, except Connery. Sean Connery is the only true Bond, no one even comes close to his stamina, good looks and sex appeal. Yes, this film is the lowest point in Connery Bond's career, but it is still definitely the best Bond film of the 80s. Sean Connery is the only Bond actor who is good at older age. he did not become a baggy disorder, like Moore, but retained his appearance and endurance, but acquired some gray hair. So what? he is still the only real 007, and he is as tough and strong as ever. Sean Connery is the only and only 007. And this film is definitely worth seeing, no matter what they say. No trunk, but you can not have everything, is not it? great song theme though.
