First, I loved the documentary. It presents a new school history / theory in which the subject can reflect a wide range of social and historical issues. <br /> <br /> First I’ll take the camera and the dogs out of the way. I hate the quality of the Blair Witch camera, but I also understand the advantage of this random approach. In fact, I agree with another reviewer that this gives us unprecedented access. <br /> <br /> Dogs: Attention, I have a doctorate in literature, which I DO NOT use as a profession, so some of my classes can filter into: Dogs are an excellent metaphor for complex relationships of great human efforts and our need to find work to achieve them. Dogs may reflect their owners, as suggested by one reviewer. But they also serve as a substitute for the workers we see in the film. Although this may indicate a Marxist problem raised by a single reviewer, I think it also shows how difficult it is to globalize the problems of labor. No Mondovi in ​​Italy can be transferred also in other places. (Yes! Deep down, I am a Marxist, and I hate to hear my cynical resignation prevail!) This is a wonderful bait. Family dogs, family workers. But in the end, the dogs are the workers (the last scene with the poor farmer). Although you may disagree with politics, the artistry of the analogy, combined with the more open policy of the film, is remarkable. <br /> <br /> If only Faulkner (I'm from Alabama) had the power of a film beyond the Hollywood market, what interesting tales would be told.
