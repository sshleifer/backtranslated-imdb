Crackerjack is a simple but enjoyable film, where the good guys are very good, and the bad guys are very bad, and the central character is seduced by both sides. <br /> <br /> The combination of the central character played by Mick Malloy and the central setting - local clubs on the lawns - attracted an unusually wide crowd - from a large number of teenagers to a large number of elderly people - and everyone laughed at the comedy. <br /> <br /> As you would expect from a movie with Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy, there were a lot of curses, but this was not an exaggeration, and the audience I sat with enjoyed it very much! <br /> <br /> Mick Malloy did an excellent job of working as a lazy guy who joined Bowling Club (three times) just to get parking spaces (one for himself and two for renting to others at a premium), but whoever falls for him when he has to play or lose his membership. <br /> <br /> Judith Lucy works great as her local journalist / love interest, and there are fabulous pe Rollers from Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson, Monica Mohan, Lois Ramsey and many others. <br /> <br /> The harsh role of John Clark as a bad guy is not one of his funniest, but he gives a solid job. <br /> <br /> Not very subtle blows in pokes give a bit of a serious note to this bright comedy. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m sure that those who liked The Castle and The Dish will also love this movie. ,
