Four drug trafficking stories in Europe are intertwined during this 6-part mini-series. In Germany, a businessman is arrested on drug smuggling charges, while his wife is trying to save her family by continuing her husbandâ€™s illegal trade. Meanwhile, the British Home Secretary is going to Pakistan to negotiate an assistance package, which he hopes will stop the flow of drugs from this country. Even when he does this, his own daughter succumbs to heroin addiction by separating their family. This is the miniseries on which the American film and miniseries were based. The original far exceeds its two descendants. The poverty and despair of the third world are portrayed very well. It is harsh, uncompromising and cruel.
