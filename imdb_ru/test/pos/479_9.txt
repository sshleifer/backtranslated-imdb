Jessica Bol plays Daphne, a sex child from a suburb fighting the hell of high school. Neighbor Daphne - Buddy (Richard Brundage), a depressed middle-aged man, still angry because of the loss of his wife. Daphne attracts the world of prostitution because she promises to cure her of barely legitimate boredom and loneliness. As soon as Buddy deprives Daphne of her secrets, he hires her to help him accept the loss of his wife. The entire film takes place at the Duncan Hotel, but the details of each character’s story are revealed in dialogs and memories. Their appointment ends with a final plot twist. <br /> <br /> Both actors really understand and become their special character, showing a convincing and sincere performance. Their screen chemistry, important for the whole film, is genuine. <br /> <br /> The dialogue of the film is natural, real to life. The author, Gorman Beshard, undoubtedly did his homework, because all the links correspond to the industry and the age of the character. Daphne is smart, and yet she is clearly eighteen years old. A friend may be middle-aged, but still not a beaten naive type, usually depicted in a film. The conversation between Daphne and Buddy is primarily concerned with their despair and frustration in life, but it’s still funny at the right time. Although the general mood is very relaxed, the dialogue has its liveliness, forcing the audience to be sensitive to the conditions of the character and feel uncomfortable because of their simple rudeness. <br /> <br /> An incredible soundtrack really conveys the essence of the film. Each track evokes feelings, contributing to the scenes and characters. Even existing independently of the film, the collection truly expresses the central theme of “You are one” - loneliness. <br /> <br /> “You are One” is a less common play, which deals with concepts that are not usually spoken about. Definitely worth a look ?? This is a thought-provoking film that makes you doubt your own loneliness threshold.
