Roy Tinnes and Joan Hackett are great in this 1970 melodrama. Magnificent setting, haunting music and plot twists make this film really interesting. I saw it when he first appeared on television. Once again it sounded when I had a VCR, but I did not have the opportunity to record it on tape. Would love to VHS, if someone has a copy. Apart from waiting (which works great), I feel that the story is unique, and pretty much true to the book of MRS. CASE OF MAITLAND Margaret Lynn. I would say that it was one of the most misunderstood best films of the 1970s from films made for television. I gave the film number 10 rating, because it is made with such originality. There is real pathos and romantic atmosphere, the viewer sympathizes with the culprit.
