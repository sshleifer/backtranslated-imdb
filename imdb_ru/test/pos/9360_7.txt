“Crossfire” is supposedly a mystery of murder, but what sets it apart from other similar films of that period is the killer’s motive, that is, anti-Semitism. The history gives examples of this kind of ignorance, which feeds fanaticism and contains references to "village" and Irish immigrants who also suffered from ill-treatment because of their ethnicity. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is based on the Richard Brooks film. A novel called “Brick Fever,” about hate crimes when the victim was gay. The irony is that this story about the form of intolerance was met with intolerance by the censors, who indicated that for the on-screen version the type of fanaticism should be changed to anti-Semitism. Another irony is the behavior of a soldier who seems very proud to have participated in the war against the Nazis, and at the same time maintains his hatred of the Jews. The director and producer of this film also underwent a different type of intolerance when they were blacklisted after they were called to appear before the "Committee on Non-American Activities of the House." It seems that all these moments underscore the deep-rooted and intractable nature of the whole problem of fanaticism, as shown in this film. <br /> <br /> When police captain Finley (Robert Young) investigates the murder of Joseph Samuels (Sam Leuven)), he discovers that on the night he was killed, Samuels spoke with a group of soldiers, and one of them, Corporal Arthur "Mitch" Mitchell (George Cooper), was quickly recognized as the prime suspect. Additional information was also received from Montgomery (Robert Ryan), who is another soldier who was present that night, and from Sergeant Keely (Robert Mitchum), who is a friend of Mitchell. Quiley, with the help of some other soldiers, then searches for Mitchell and, when he finds him, hears his story about what he did on the night of the murder, including his meeting with the mistress of the dance hall named Ginny Tremaine (Gloria Grame). <br /> Keely helps Michella avoid arrest and tries to identify the killer. Ginny Tremayne is being questioned, but her information is not enough to prove Mitchell’s innocence, but Finley’s investigations make him admit the motive of the crime, and then he sets a complicated trap that leads the real criminal to uncover his own fault. <br /> "Crossfire" is a movie with a message, and the identity of the killer is revealed at the earliest stage of the story. The “message” is transmitted in a way that is undoubtedly suitable for the period in which it was made, but seems to be quite tough by today's standards. The cinematography of J Roy Hunt is simply superb, thanks to the discreet lighting and creative use of numerous strategically placed table lamps that combine an image that is perfectly compatible with the dramatic plot on the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite this being a low-budget production, Crossfire had a big box office success and benefited from an exciting and very topical story with an amazing cast, two of which were nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor Men ( Robert Ryan) and best supporting actress (Gloria Graham). Additional nominations for Edward Dmitrik (Best Director), producer Adrian Scott (Best Picture) and John Paxton (Best Screenplay, Adapted Screenplay) are another proof of the positive recognition this film has rightfully received.
