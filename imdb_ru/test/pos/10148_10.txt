“The Man Who Knew Too Much” of 1956 is exceptional entertainment. Those who prefer the original in 1934, I will say that it is faster and sharper. However, although the American version was (God forbid!) A big budget blockbuster, I believe that the British version is flying out of the water. I think this is one of Hitchcock’s best of 10 best performances, considering that he has made more than 50 films, and many of them were among the best of all time. I find so many things to love: <br /> <br /> 1) James Stewart, the man he loved in America for many years, plays a hapless father well here. He can make any movie enjoyable, and working with such a cute character in such an exciting story, he made me rooted for him very much. Leslie Banks in the original is nothing in comparison. <br /> <br /> 2) Doris Day. Yes, Doris Day. Despite all the criticism directed at her, I think she makes a loving wife / mother an extremely responsive person. I disagree with the negative comments about her nature; just because she is quiet and gentle, it does not mean that she is obedient and helpless. I do not want to spoil anything, but she makes an important discovery herself after her husband failed. It gives history a level of warmth that was simply not there in the first, and for those who are not indifferent, this version is the way. And I loved Que Sera Sera; I think that this is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard and deservedly won my Oscar. This raised the film to another level. <br /> <br /> 3) Albert Hall sequence. I do not think it was too long at all; I think the wait created all the time for that amazing crescendo, and the Hitchcock leadership in this scene was absolutely brilliant. And the killer was really scary. <br /> <br /> 4) The end really made me smile; even after the above scene was over, I found the rescue scene exciting, and it was great to see the charming family together again. The last line in the film is very funny. I do not think the film began slowly; Hitcock tried to make us know and love McKennas, and he did a great job. I was not a big fan of the child playing Hank, but I had no problems with him. Since Hank was a child of Ben and Jo, I also took care of him; it is not as if he were a boy or someone else. <br /> <br /> In this film I did not find any serious flaws and many major and minor advantages. Way Hitch!
