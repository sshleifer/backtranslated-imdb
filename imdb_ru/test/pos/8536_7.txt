First, to make or watch this movie, you expect something in the horror range. What this film offers for the discerning fan of this genre is a pretty fun romp through the Nordic flavor. At times reminding me of Jackson's Dead Alive humor and others about the Stuart Gordon film, this little find was supposed to laugh everywhere. <br /> <br /> F / xs reach several heights really creepy (for the first time Ed meets his sworn enemy), but, as a rule, it seems that this film was created by the af / x team who decided to use any details at their disposal from other films ... gremlinov, devils, slashers, etc. to a fairly good effect and worked with the help of hallucinations. <br /> <br /> The filmâ€™s pearl is humor. The mountain works most of the time, but more for laughter. In fact, this is a parody and fun.
