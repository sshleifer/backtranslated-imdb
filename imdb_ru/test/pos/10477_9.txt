This film is almost unknown, but it is very good. In a lonely Danish city, two older sisters live, recalling a distant youth, when, because of the strict Puritan education, they had to give up happiness. Lonely means to live in decent austerity until Babette arrives, flying from Paris, frightened by the horror of war. After a while, she will be able to transform the kindness and love she received when she arrived. A good lottery prize allows her to organize a great banquet, following the best rules of French gastronomy. All quarters are invited (all fanatically puritans). They accept, but they contract to show no trace of pleasure or pleasure, for that would be a sin. However, the seductive power of the delicious food they eat is that they are seduced by the sensuality of French gastronomy. The banquet ends in a very tangible, albeit quiet happiness. Love between people is awakened. The miracle of raising human kindness through the pleasure of feeling began. The film is surprisingly good, but not for every taste. For most of the film, nothing happens, everything is so quiet and peaceful that for many minutes you can only see the life of the cityâ€™s inhabitants. But as the film develops, it becomes more valuable when Babette gets a prize in the lottery (after a 30-minute film), the show begins. An author in excellent direction can show us how Babette prepares a banquet, how she mixes all the ingredients with the most wonderful (Love), everything is told in a quiet delightful way, with excellent knowledge of photography and acting, Then, as the banquet passes, the quality , showing us how the mood of all eaters changes because of food, only from the first shots, with impressively shot scenes one by one, is simply amazing. In addition, the beat with colors and photography is also excellent, almost every scene of the film is like a picture, so work is required here. If you know how to admire a good movie and understand that sometimes it is important to tell you something, and not what you are told, this is your movie. If you like good food and just love good gastronomy, you might be surprised, since most of the feelings of the movie are familiar to you. Oscar is fully deserved. The only problem is the slowness in creating the plot, but I can forgive it (I hope all too)
