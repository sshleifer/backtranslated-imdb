It was a great movie. I deal with the child I raise, whose FAE, and watching this film was more than a word can explain. I also bought a book and it was great. I would like to have a copy for my own use, and therefore I can ask my son's teachers to see it. someone where I could buy it. Thank you, Myra. I would recommend this film to anyone who deals with children / adults with special abilities. This film should be shown again on TV. The team of doctors who monitored my son would also like to receive a copy. His special teacher, Ed, also asked me to try to find a copy that he may have or that he can take. <br /> <br /> Thank you
