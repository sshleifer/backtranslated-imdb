As soon as you cope with Nick Cage, playing an Italian soldier who loves opera and believes in making love, not in war, you can start watching this beautiful film. This can be used as an advertisement for tourism in the Mediterranean. John Hurt is great, and Penelope Cruz is not bad, as expected. Christian Bale's character is somewhat one-dimensional, and that's a shame. <br /> <br /> The main drawback of this film is an adaptation from the book - they told me that they later told me about the differences between the book and the plot of the film deceived from a much better and more convincing storyline.
