I came out of Rendition with a list of mile-long flaws, so why did I have the general impression that it was a pretty decent movie? This is definitely a film whose sum is better than its parts. <br /> <br /> Celebrities play in these roles, none of which you remember (you, Omar Metvalli, a relative unknown to you). I will remember); serviceable, if invisible direction; and a script that is both too complicated and too simplistic. Metwally is an American citizen of Egyptian descent who is kidnapped as a result of a US government program, also known as the process by which America tortures suspected terrorists to confess information, regardless of whether this is a distant truth. Reese Witherspoon plays his pregnant wife, who calls on an old college friend (Peter Saarsgard) who works for the senator (Alan Arkin) and helps to track down her husband. Meryl Streep plays the chapter of the playback program; Jake Gyllenhaal is a young interrogator appointed and whose conscience interferes with him. Meanwhile, the whole parallel storyline follows the daughter of a high-ranking Egyptian official who is associated with the American issuance program, and her boyfriend, who is preparing to become a suicide bomber. <br /> <br /> Ay-yi-yi, this is a lot of plot to put together in a two-hour film, and I was going to wash my hands of it all, especially from the plot of "Egyptian Romeo and Juliet", which seemed nothing but a distraction . But then, closer to the final of the film, the turn of chronology unites all the plotlines in such a way that you want to overestimate everything that you thought about the motives of various characters and make “Presentation” a much more interesting movie. what it seems. <br /> <br /> Witherspoon, Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard look like schoolchildren playing adults twenty years older than they really are - in particular, Gyllenhaal, usually a good actor, looks so boring that you wonder if you are going to he gather energy to deliver his lines. And the screenwriter must be arrested for having actress Meryl Streep at her disposal and she did not give her anything more than this one-dimensional lady dragon. The film, of course, seeks relevance, but instead of turning to the intricate web of disputes related to the issue of national security, it predictably drags the argument into the middle of a debate. There are times when you think that maybe the film will turn in an interesting direction - what if Witherspoon really starts to doubt her husband's past, for example? What if Metvally was in contact with terrorists, as the investigators accuse him of? But no, the film follows the path of least resistance. <br /> <br /> But as I said, I recommend this movie. I know that I did not do anything, I just listed a bunch of his flaws, but he has a head in the right place, and this is entertaining, or at least as exciting as a film about torture and interrogation. <br /> <br /> Rating: B +
