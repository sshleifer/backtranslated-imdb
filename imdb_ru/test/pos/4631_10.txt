I think this film is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. I think Debbie Reynolds is fun, and the chemistry between her and Glenn Ford is perfect. There is no boring moment in the film, and Debbie, as always, looks beautiful. <br /> <br /> The story of the dancer Maggie (Debbie Reynolds), who meets the penniless Joe (Glenn Ford). She instantly feels hostility towards him, but after he accidentally tears off her dress, he returns it to her, provided she goes on a date with him. They end up marrying at night, they have their date after just one kiss. Joe and Maggie move to Spain and find that they have nothing in common except physical attractiveness, so Maggie suggests that they live for one month, but not as a man and wife, which means that Joe is not allowed to kiss or sleep with Maggie, much to the disappointment of Joe Jolly story and a wonderful movie. Do not miss.
