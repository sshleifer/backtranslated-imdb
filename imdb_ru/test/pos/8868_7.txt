It was very funny, even if at the end fell apart a bit. Not overdoing Hitchcock - Owen (Danny DeVito) was honored to have been playing “Strangers on a Train” at a local cinema, so the film tells you what inspired it. <br /> <br /> DeVito is very funny, but a bit sad. He has no friends, and all he wants to do is write and have someone as he writes. His teacher, Billy Crystal, passes through some serious bloc of his writers, and his wife stole his book and succeeded, which also upset him greatly. <br /> <br /> The best roles are Mr. Pinsky's book proposal (“One Hundred Girls I Would Like to Have Pork”) and all the scenes with Ann Ramsey, which is so terrible that even Mother Teresa would like to kill her too!
