This is one of the most unusual scenes that I saw in the horror film, but it is based on a good and solid Universal Studios board: lots of monsters, a pretty heroine, villagers carrying torches. But my favorite part is Larry Talbot (Wolfman), who is looking for a cure for his lycanthropy. After death in the original "Wolf Man", he resurrects and wanders around "Frankenstein meeting the Wolf Man" and "House of Frankenstein", looking for a way to end his suffering. I think that for the first time, viewers will find his search in this particular film very interesting. <br /> <br />
