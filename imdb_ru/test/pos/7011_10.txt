It's funny how time passed, and I never saw this movie ... ‚Äùuntil last week, when I was under a spell. I saw it twice a week, and that still wasn't enough. This is a great movie and I will be glad to see it again. The story is wonderful, and it really touched me. I would like to live such a story. The actors are great, the music too, and you can dream of your own love story. I just hope that someday I will find an opportunity to learn how to dance like Johnny and Baby. I feel that dance unites people and unites them. I think that people should learn to dance ... it helps a lot, especially in relationships. It's nice to feel the dance in your blood and in your body.
