This is the only Pauly Shore movie youâ€™ve ever seen. OK, this is the only one I've ever seen, and I think I made a good choice. I usually find something like Shore's fatigue, but he is very funny in this film. Actually, the script is pretty funny, and Shor doesn't hit other actors of his ... what do you call that? Tomfoolery? In any case, this is a funny, but ultimately forgettable film. --Frink-3
