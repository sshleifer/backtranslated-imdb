First of all, I was a fan of the show when my PBS station began to show it back in 1981. I learned a lot about the show and the people who participated in it or participated in it. <br /> <br /> This latest edition of Doctor Who made a huge impression on me. The original series, or the classic series, was ridiculed by bad special effects and / or wobbly sets. Well, this is no longer true. The special effects are awesome, but what's even better is writing. You have a chance to learn more about our beloved Doctor and, perhaps for some reason, why he loves planet Earth so much. Without giving away too much, this is a very useful series to watch. Christopher Excelleon led the Doctor's side, which we will never see, bitter and evil, but at the same time attractive. <br /> <br /> MUST SEE!
