I loved this thing. The most remarkable thing about Pink Flamingos is that he desperately wants to have a terrible taste, but really gained a cult by following around the world. Says a lot about us (that we are people), is not it? Pink Flamingo succeeds because Waters made the film he wanted to make. The film does not have to be disgusting to succeed, but it can be. When you watch this movie, you see things that are disgusting, but ultimately brilliant, because they are freely displayed. What we have here is an honest example of personal creative expression. This film should be watched by anyone who wants to become an artist, whether in the cinema or in other media.
