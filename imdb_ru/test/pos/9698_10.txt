All you could ever hope for if you're a Jackass fan. As always, Knoxville and his team risk their lives and health just for the sake of our entertaining viewing. If you are a fan of the series and the first film, you will not let you down, as many sequels often do. The jokes they attract to each other are twice as funnier, harsher, rough than ever before, and the stunts and blows are twice as rough as in any episode with Jackass you have ever seen. If your fan doesn't waste time, watch it yourself, because by Jackaass standards this film is an easy 10 out of 10 only for initial credits, I can't go into details without spoilers, but you have to see it to believe it.
