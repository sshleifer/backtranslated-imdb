Back in the mid / late 80s, an OAV anime debuted called “Bubblegum Crisis” (which I think is the term military slang when technical equipment loses popularity) debuted on a video inspired by “Blade Runner”, “The Terminator” and, perhaps even RoboCop, with a small splash of Batman / Bruce Wayne - Iron Man / Tony Stark and Charlie Angel's girlish strength added for good measure. A total of 8 episodes reported that in Tokyo, Japan, in the 21st century, in 2032–2033, living machines, called boomers, performed manual labor and sometimes caused problems. A special, spetsnaz-like branch of law enforcement, the Advanced Police (AD Police for short) was formed to cope with the boomers, but they were mostly ineffective, prompting millionaire scientist Celia Stingray, the scientist who created the boomers, to create four enhanced combat armor (tight suits) that women must wear to fight boomers and fight an evil boomer corporation, GENOM. This group is becoming known as the Knight of the Sabers, and in addition to ring leader Celia, her group of rebellious women includes Priss Asagiri, a struggling rock and roll girl with a passion for motorcycles and contempt for the police, Lynna Yamazaki, an aerobics instructor with money and the desire to break through the guys, and Nene Romanova, a young ADP officer and an experienced computer hacker (the first in a long line). Meanwhile, GENOM is represented by Quincy, a tall, gaunt old man who owns the company, his junior assistant, Brian J. Mason (killed in episode 3), and an annoying bummer named Largo. Other characters included Leon McNichol and Daily Wong, two detectives from the AD police (Leon appeared in the video with the proquel / movie "Police Files AD", which I heard was very dark), their balding overweight boss Chef Todo, Celia Mackey's younger brother and a funny little mechanic, known as Dr. Raven, who obviously helps Celie in maintaining the costumes. In addition to the general storyline of Knight Sabers & AD Police VS GENOM, there was also another storyline telling about Lynn's girlfriend, who apparently was the daughter of a large criminal family, an annoying Largo trying to usurp GENOM, and various Priss-Want -Venge- story for a minor character. Oh, and I mentioned that there were hints that Celia herself could be a boomer? <br /> <br /> Well, it was a great clock, full of chaos and chaos, and even some very good pop songs, but it was not without flaws, some of which, unfortunately, were related to the fact that the series It was discontinued after the 8th episode, when only 13 episodes were originally planned. Thus, some storylines, such as the Largo scheme (s), the family of Linna's ill-fated friend, and the origins of Celia, have never been resolved. Another problem with the show was that Priss was the most popular character at the time, so much of the show focused on her, and, unfortunately, most of the episodes focused on Priss focused mainly on what Priss self-confidently justice / revenge for some. a minor character who never appeared before, but turned out to be her friend, but she rarely tried her best for her Knights-saber, who always saved her from trouble and for some reason took great care of her well-being. to be (although, to be fair, she went to save Lynn in episode 7, and her boyfriend was killed by a boomer, and the ADP acted wrong in the investigation). This meant that we could not focus on the more interesting story of Celia, or even on the daily antics of Nene and Lynn. Lynna had two episodes oriented around her, which concerned her friend from a mafia family, while Nene managed to capture the last episode, which showed that her eternal good mood is really good mood, not dizziness. Nana also had to use her computer skills quite often, or she sometimes simply acted as attractive nonsense, which put her time on the screen and character development a few steps above poor Lynn, who was often thrown into the background only with her. greed and her tendency to eat guys to get her attention. Don't get me wrong, I like it, and I like the overall concept of all this, but it annoyed me a little. In addition, it is one of those who finished second in the category of the worst English voice dubbing of all time, which means that you better stick to Japanese. Some voices were fine (some really matched the characters of their characters), but others were just flat and passionless or, in the case of Priss, really outplayed. <br /> <br /> Well, Tokyo 2040 comes in and pretty much throws it all out the window. A few years before, the story here is that after the earthquake that destroyed Tokyo, the GENOM boomers turned the city into a big old paradise, except for the fact that boomers still have a tendency to fly out of control, which makes the AD police take shape, and then the Knight of the Sabers is formed. Thus, the general story is the same, but the background of the characters, the appearance and attitude of the characters have changed a lot. <br /> <br /> 1) Initially, Celia had short purple black hair and brown eyes, usually dressed as a strict, regular business woman and was far away from others. 2040 Silia looks like a super model: she dresses more defiantly and has white hair and blue eyes that seem to change color depending on the light (the color scheme changes from blue to purple to silver, and the eyes sometimes look purple or gray) also 2040 Cilia - more likely an emotionally unstable woman who flies out of control when she is not in public and may have more secrets than before. Celia is also not at great risk on the battlefield, as she is more of a “stay in the mobile pit” type, but she does fight when she should. <br /> <br /> 2 Initially, Priss was a short woman with an afro and very bad temper, always fought with people who offended her, always bit off more than she could chew, and so on. 2040 Priss, however, went Clint Eastwood’s lonely path is very cold, very persistent and emotionally distant (one might say, more like the original Celia), so she’s not tied to anyone. In addition, her hair became sharper and feline (a big improvement), and she was covered in skin, like Trinity from The Matrix (although much less annoying than before, unfortunately, the authors at the end cut into her when they reveal her reasons for hate ADP). <br /> <br /> 3) Linna originally had large black hair, but now her hair is shorter, browner and, well, in general, more than in the 90s. 2040 Linna is also an office lady who is unlucky with sexual harassment. As if apologizing for the way the OAV authors treated her, the authors of 2040 actually dedicated the first 6 episodes to Linn, writing her as a village girl, a newcomer to the city, but deciding to meet with the Knights with Sabers and win a place with them that she eventually and does. <br /> <br /> 4) Initially, a short-haired girl who often became a victim of ridicule and ate a lot of candy, now Nene is a blonde with short hair who likes to tease and take blows at ADP detective Leon MacNichall (revenge for played with her in OAV?) and other characters, even her surrogate elder sister Lynne and Mackey, Celia's “brother”, with whom she becomes madly passionate. Rooster and arrogant, she still eats a lot of candy and is an experienced hacker, but she is eventually let down and goes beyond her comic relief status. <br /> <br /> 5) Nigel Kirkland is a new character, tall, sturdy, rudely handsome man with long black hair (he looks like Adrian Paul from “Highlander TV”), he replaces Dr. Raven from the old series and now serves a man who is supporting Celia's tight costumes. Nigel is also Celia's lover, but you won't know about it by his behavior. He's kind of a father / older brother / tutor Mackey. <br /> <br /> 6) Leon and Daly returned, but, of course, in different ways. Leon was originally a tall, handsome boy, built like a baseball player, with combed back brown hair, blue eyes, a black leather jacket, tight blue jeans, and always carried a revolver that could magically collect more rumble than a howitzer if necessary; although in his heart he was not really a bad guy, he was a bit of a jerk, but he served mostly comic relief because he tried to chase Priss romantically (exactly what he saw in her is a mystery) sometimes he and Daly served as an information guide to important plot points. Daley also had a rather muscular red head, dressed in pink / purple costumes, as he was a bright homosexual character who always fought with Leon when he did not give important information. In 2040, Leon is no longer a cute boy, but rather a typical rude, strong guy with pointy black hair, brown eyes, tall and athletic big muscles, a brown leather jacket and blue dockers (in fact, he looks a bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger) or, maybe a pumped-up Colin Farrell or Hugh Jackman), and he still has a revolver, BIG, but he's not as powerful as before. Although in 2040, Leon still has some relationship problem (especially in approaching Priss), he is not such a jerk as in the old series, but he has a bad temper and is easily annoyed by Nene and Daly. (he also drinks too much coffee). Oh, and Leon is still pursuing Priss, but this time he was more fortunate. Daly, meanwhile, was taller (but not as tall as Leon), a more likeable boyish guy with red-rimmed glasses, a white suit, green eyes and light brown hair, and he has a big machine gun (in fact, he looks like James Marsden from the X-Men movie); Daly is much smarter and more insistent in 2040 than OAV, and although this is not entirely clear, his homosexual tendencies have almost completely disappeared, except for the moment when it seems that he is jealous when Leon finds out about Priss's email. . <br /> <br /> 7) Brian J. Mason (which means “J”?) returned, like Quincy, but Mason is much more the main villain here, and Quincy is like a villain since he is no longer a tall figure of horror, a vegetable with a bunch of batteries and wires connected to it. Now Mason splashes brown hair instead of black, like in OAV (in fact, he looks like an OAV Leon in a suit), and he looks a lot like Alan Rickman’s villain school. <br /> <br /> 8 Although McKee was a pervert in the first series, he was no longer a pervert in 2040. Of course, in 2040, Mackey changed a lot, but here they will not be revealed. <br /> <br /> 9) Celia now has a companion, a type of Alfred Butler named Henderson, who cares about her and the gang. <br /> <br /> 10) In the original series, the boomers were like Replicants in Blade Runner, armed with their own thoughts, feelings and ambitions, but in 2040 they are more like stupid monsters. Most of the time they are just big robots that do everything they programmed (hard work, fighting, cleaning, etc.), and they have this tendency to “become a rogue,” which means trying to evolve and become a monster. in the process. <br /> <br /> What remains unchanged is the theme of technology against humanity (do the machines have souls?). Unfortunately, this series, although it is well animated and well written, contains only 26 episodes, so it moves faster than we would like, especially to those of us who are used to more than one season of our favorite characters, and, unfortunately, it still ends on a cliff hanger with unresolved baseline bits (which I will not discuss here. What saves this show and makes it what it is, however, these are the characters, the colorful worms that they are, from Stoic loners, psychos, Enocides are crazy, coarse-necked policemen, sardonic intellectuals, wise old wise men and lovely innocent people, much more diverse than before, and with far more opportunities to play, they are enough to make you want this show to last longer. < br /> <br /> This is not very good, but it is a good watch. In addition, English dub (from ADV) is not bad, although not without a few flat spots, but certainly better than dub on the original.
