Recently released on a British DVD, this is a good film (assuming that you have concentration and IQ more than a fruit fly). Not as depressing as it could be, this is a kitchen sink in the dirtiest form. Terrance Stamp is good at it, the music is pleasant, Carol White is very believable, like a lonely cake with a mother who can't stop loving criminals. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where Carol and her friend, who works in a pub with her (the one who has a huge haircut in a beehive going down one eye), sits outside of herself and gossips about all the men passing by . <br /> <br /> The only thing that overshadowed this, this shaky behavior is Carol's first husband, but if you can do it, you're fine. And Donovan offers some of the most lethargic, soft, bitter-sweet texts that appeared in the 60s.
