This film is similar to "Better Off Dead" because it has the same stars. This one, however, is not so good. Of course, this is quite funny and pleasant, there is something in “Better ... what I like, well, better. This guys go to Nantucket to spend their summer holidays there. There they meet a girl who is trying to save the house here. ” from this guy who wants to turn him into a lobster restaurant. This guy really doesn’t like lobsters, because in one scene he shoves him in boiling water and inserts a stethoscope so that he can hear his scream. The protagonist is torn between this girl and the girl of the boy's son who wants to arrange a restaurant. Anyway, this leads to a big battle on the boat races, such as in Summer Rent, although here she works a little better and fits the story a little better. Although, what is the situation with the races on boats at this time? Did they have any strange hobby? For the most part, this movie delivers a laugh over a good clip, but "Better Off Dead" was still better because it was the first one, and the jokes worked better.
