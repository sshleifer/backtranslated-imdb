There is no doubt that this version of Tarzan is closest to the Burroughs vision. Although he happily collected his fees from films made during his lifetime, he often made it clear that they were little more than the bastards from his fairy tales. The filmâ€™s ridiculous obsession with casting Olympic swimmers in the role of Tarzan was simply ridiculous. I think we should consider ourselves happy, because they are not aiming at the pushers of the core. <br /> <br /> Before this film, the most true changes were in comics and comics. No matter how good some of them were, we had to wait seven decades for the creator of the film to honestly respect the hero he was made.
