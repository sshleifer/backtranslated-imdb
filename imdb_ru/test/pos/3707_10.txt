This film was made right where I grew up and now I live. I personally know most property owners from different places used in the film. As a teenager, I worked in the fields surrounding an isolated road shown at the end of the film with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Ferr and the car. I was told that Jonathon Ferr and Ben Allison are NC natives. I was lucky to see it at the local show. At that show, there was one of the people who helped select locations and safe props, such as the bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the film. The bus didnâ€™t have a backstop, and the driver missed his stopping point several times during the shoot, and he had to drive a few miles to get back to the right point. These details about technical issues added me pleasure. The film accurately describes life in this area during World War II. Well done movie, and I look forward to the DVD.
