After a rather slow start, I thought that this film about the Italian occupation of the Greek island during World War II had risen and became quite a pleasant time for a couple of hours, primarily from two points of view. <br /> <br /> The love triangle is interesting and seems plausible to me because I know that it happened in different places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek woman who is engaged to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the very beginning, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went to fight. After German intervention, Greece was conquered, and Pelagia Island lives under Italian occupation, during which Pelagia meets and begins to fall in love with Captain Corelli (Nicolas Cage). This, of course, was a dilemma that arose among many young women in the occupied lands. Having become acquainted with their occupiers, they began to see them not as enemies, but as real people, and sometimes fell in love â€” often to the disapproval of their neighbors. I just finished reading an interesting book about the German occupation of the British Channel Islands, in which it was a serious problem. As soon as Mandras returns to the island, Pelagia is torn between them. <br /> <br /> The second background problem is the Italian occupation itself, which, it seemed to me, quite realistically depicted. At first there was the contempt with which the island treated its Italian occupiers. Greece defeated Italy (quite true from a historical point of view) and was really conquered by the Germans. The refusal of the city to surrender to the Italians and instead insisting on surrendering to a German officer impressed me with something that might well have happened (and in fact it was quite funny. I loved the line), we would rather surrender to this German Dog than you Italians. ") The image of the Italian troops also seemed believable to me. The Italian army was never fascinated by its German ally and was never enthusiastic about fighting them. Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends, their soldiers treated each other with contempt. Here the Italians are more interested in singing than in battles (which the German troops on the island simply cannot understand) and delighted when Italy makes peace and comes out of the war - until they discover that the Germans could easily make them prisoners. "Everything was done ano very good "- I thought -.. <br /> <br /> In the end, he stumbles a bit too predictable, but still worthy of praise <br /> <br /> 7/10
