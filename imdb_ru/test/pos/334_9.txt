This is an incredible film that starts slowly. It makes you think of it as a typical Maudlin family drama. Then, in the second half, there is a plot twist that completely turns it into a deep story on a global scale. <br /> <br /> If you are not used to films from India, with song and dance procedures, it would seem that there is no reason to stick to this film. Especially since the second half, you will find this film an amazing experience. <br /> <br /> *********** Minor Spoiler Here ************ * I have only one complaint with the film. The dialogue at the end (between Amudha and MDS) seemed very weak and missed the opportunity to enter war as a force that transforms people's lives. This was implied all the time, but there had to be something about the importance of fighting for MDS.
