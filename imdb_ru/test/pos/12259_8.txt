Spunky journalist Holly Hunter releases journalistic investigations for major news networks. She is a crazy mother who does an excellent job with her job and has little time for a romantic relationship. Meet William Hurt and Albert Brooks, two men who are fighting for her love. <br /> <br /> Brooks is an old school journalist who loves Holly because she is a good journalist. They both believe that the media exist to test the gods, educate the public and fight for the truth. Children of the sixties, they embody the values ​​of hippies. They are advocates of the public good. Knights who valiantly fight with a pen and a camera. <br /> <br /> William Hurt, on the contrary, is a much more complex character. Initially awkward, clumsy and self-deprecating, he gradually shows himself as a sexy and manipulative highly qualified specialist who can climb the corporate ladder. Unlike Holly and Brooks, it symbolizes the values ​​of modern media: news as a spectacle, journalism as entertainment, news feed as a celebrity, truth as a subject for editing. We want to despise him and his unexpected journalism about junk food, but we just can't handle it. He plays the game by his own rules. Do we condemn him for not having enough of a moral basis? Do we condemn the game? Can a game exist if its rules are not respected? How did these rules evolve? <br /> <br /> This is not the “Network” of Lumet and Chayafsky, and therefore the film never bothers to answer or raise these questions. The content, to keep things at a light comedy level, ends with Hurt being promoted to the London branch and Brooks uploaded to the tiny community network. Holly, rejecting both men, stays between them. The last stronghold of media integrity, this pompous reporter remembers his roots, mourns the loss of Brooks and warns himself to be on guard for the future William Hearts. <br /> <br /> This is a cute ending, but compared to “The Network, the film seems positively trivial. The vision of Chaefsky is one in which global media, despite its ubiquity, offer less relevant information. It foresees a world in which globalization led to the homogenization of cultures, information has become the object of corporatization, and a handful of media monopolies control all international news, a world in which truth depends on shareholders ’meetings and economic interests, a world in which audience ratings determine content, and societies The main news dictates this opinion. <br /> <br /> Perhaps that is why Broadcast News, which craves for the glorious days of journalism, ends on such a bitter and sweet note. He knows what he expects in the future. Created in 1987, he lived it for at least ten years. <br /> <br /> But today, in the digital age, things are even worse. Mergers and acquisitions have led to the fact that a very small number of large companies dominate the field of communications. With this came the hyper industry of content, the barrier between the creative / editorial side and the commercial side was almost destroyed. Today, everyone can create their own blog or website, but this is normal. As the communication coverage of a person expands (due to technical progress - e-mail, Internet, electricity, air mail, etc.), the size of the individual world also increases. He must project his voice further and louder, futilely struggling with this deafening white noise, incessant verbal static, which is the world community. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, according to democratic theory, you need two things. First, you need a strict coming of people in power and people who want to be in power, both in the private and in the public sector. Secondly, you need a wide range of informed opinions on all the important issues of the day. In a democratic society, the media system as a whole should create such a culture. Unfortunately, the structure we currently have in the global system works directly against the needs of democratic journalism and a democratic society. <br /> <br /> 8/10 ?? This is light material, but a witty screenplay, a few funny moments and a short cameo of Jack Nicholson put him above most other films about journalism. Interestingly, unlike most media films, he never plunges into satire, but instead plays things like a straight love triangle. <br /> <br /> Worth a single viewing.
