One of the best comedic films for Indian television along with Dekh Bhai Dekh and Idhar Udhar. Great acting, good tempo and extremely funny script made this series truly memorable. A fun initial installation (performed by none other than the inimitable Kishore Kumar) gave a very accurate picture of what could be expected. I used to take it from the local video library after Doordarshan stopped showing it. I would like Indian television to return to such series, and not to the soapy asinam-saas-bahu and reality show, which is good for our days. Anyone who has found a really good comedy should go and get this show. You might also like a couple of Pakistani sitcoms, such as ups and downs and aik aur aik, which are certainly comparable to the best in India.
