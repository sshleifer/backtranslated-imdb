Despite many shortcomings, the 1995 Hallmark version of Gulliver's Travels is still the best adaptation of the satirical classics of Jonathan Swift - largely because it includes not only ALL of Gulliver’s many journeys, but also satire out of sight. Unfortunately, the dual problems of the episodic structure of the book and the television budget (even quite generous) remain ambivalent. The book is a somewhat incoherent collection of stories of travelers, just moving from one surrealistic landscape to another, but the adaptation of Simon Moore is trying to restore some order in the chaos, providing a parallel story that shows that Gulliver returned to England clearly deeply injured and trying to prove that his way out of an insane asylum, where he was committed by an opponent for the feelings of his wife. The scenes of England immediately reflect and comment on the journey, elements of which sometimes flow into the real world. The problem is that for the first hour or so, it acts more like a distraction, constantly pulling you away from the story as soon as it starts to get interesting. Liliput scenes here suffer worse, with the feeling that home scenes are too often meant to save them from filming more expensive scenes - this should be the only version where we don’t see Gulliver pulling the Blefescu fleet behind him. br /> <br /> However, as soon as Gulliver escaped, the tone becomes more consistent as he discovers that his situation is turned upside down, and he himself is the pet of the giants of utopian Brobdingnag, a guest of the sages of the floating island of Laputa, who are so passionate about science that they lacked common sense, the guest / captive historian who relies on history directly from the source, offered immortality with all its terrible consequences, before finally finding the world to which he wants to belong, if only he will be able to convince the lofty speaking horses of the Hounhms that he is not uncivilized Yahoo, every new destination convinces him of what absurd and petty humanity is. For the most part, this is a darker set of Journeys than expected, only Gulliver’s curiosity, common sense, and disappointment prevent him from plunging into irretrievable gloom — and even this is compensated by scenes in the shelter, where it becomes increasingly obvious that even if he is telling the truth, this may have infuriated him. It is in these last scenes that Gulliver Ted Danson really shines, and no more than in an unusual speech in which he turns his ordeal into a disappointed judgment about the whole human race. <br /> <br /> Created for television, Yahoos is literally less scatological here than on the page, but for the most part it is a more mature treatment than you might expect without experiencing a sharp discouragement. The star cast is certainly impressive, and for the most part well used (although somewhat briefly in some cases) - Mary Steenbergen, James Fox, Peter O'Toole, Edward Woodward, Omar Sharif, Shashi Kapoor, Edward Fox, Ned Beatty Alfre Woodard, Christine Scott Thomas and Isabel Happert are among them. It’s hard to imagine that the upcoming version of Jack Black will be as impressive as this one.
