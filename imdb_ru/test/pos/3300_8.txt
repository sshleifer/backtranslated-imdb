I just saw this wonderfully made film that captures the essence of New York City with high eyebrows or any major American city of the mid-century. Colors, cars, <br /> <br />, clothes and the appearance of the Women's movement. It reflects the established relationships between men and women in the corporate world <br /> <br />. In some respects, everything has changed, and in others they have not changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but now they have all kinds of laws and equality mandates to get them for them. In my opinion, <br /> <br /> beautiful women will still throw themselves into men, pursuing their goals! The laws that we have now against the persecution and all the others were passed by unattractive women who wanted an equal chance to compete with more attractive women who could hold good positions based on their views and extinguishment! This competition is not between men and women, and women and women! I liked the look of the movie, but the world has not changed as much as it is real.
