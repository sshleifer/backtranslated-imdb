Having finished the “Zero Woman” series, I was looking forward to the TV series “Scorpion of Women Prisoners”; both based on Toor Sinohara's comics. Unfortunately, I could not see them in order, as this is the third in the series. <br /> <br /> It all starts out great because the Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) runs away from the police. Detective Kondo (Mikio Narita) managed to handcuff her, but she continued to cut off his hand and leave. If this is not so bad, later the dog digs out his hand, and she is noticed as she runs down the street before finding a place to enjoy his treatment. <br /> <br /> Scorpio can return to prison as life on the street does not have a picnic. First, the local yakuza Tanida (v) threatens to bring her back if she does not put out; and then the gang leader gets her when she gets rid of Tanida. But they do not hold her for a long time until she escaped and is not looking for revenge. <br /> <br /> Soon they fall like flies. Some, of course, deserve it for wearing bright clothes with shirt collars, so large that they reached the shoulder. Madame (Reisen Lee) surrenders so as not to be killed. <br /> <br /> Police come to her for the last time and catch her in the sewer. She has been there for a week, and the police find out that a friend (Yayoi Watanabe) supplied her with food. (The story of Yuki (Watanabe) and her brother is a plot that is very interesting, but only episodic for the film.) They try to burn it out, but this is Scorpio, and it has some unfinished business. <Br /> <br /> Not the usual mixture of sex and violence, it is a slow story that is beautiful everywhere.
