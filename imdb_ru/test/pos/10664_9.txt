"Battleship Potemkin" - a milestone in the history of cinema. This is one of the few great films that are adequately called classics. It was thanks to this picture that Sergey M. Eisenstein was then head of the film industry. And today it is still remembered as the wonderful cinematic film that it has always been. <br /> <br /> “Potemkin” is a film that needs to be seen as a whole, and not choose. Don't just watch these clips, where they only represent the sequence of “Odessa Steps”, and then go to “Citizen Kane” or “Godfather”, watch it all in a magnificent 75-minute length to truly understand and enjoy it. Do not expect every infinitesimal detail to be perfect, I mean, because of the 20s era, “Scooby-Doo” looks like a master of restrained realism, some storylines may seem illogical, and some battle sequences look obsolete but it is still a very nice movie. <br /> <br /> The most memorable moments in the film are insurrection on the battleship, Vakulinchuk’s body falls off the ship, a sailor under a tent at the end of the pier, the mother holds her dead child, a baby carriage on the steps of the Odessa and a lion climbing bawl when the next slaughter follows. For each new pair of eyes that look at this, the Battleship Potemkin revives again.
