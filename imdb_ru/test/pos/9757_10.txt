I don't know where this film was made, but since it was shot on the spot, it has the authenticity that this story deserves. This is a story about a young Englishwoman who at the beginning of World War II was captured by the Japanese in South Asia along with a group of other Englishmen. For women, there is no prison camp, so they have to go from place to place for months, because the Japanese do not know what to do with them. The courage and resilience of the English women, as well as the courage of the Australian soldier who is trying to help them, is the essence of the film. This film is very long, maybe 10 hours, so you can watch it, as it was shown on PBS, as a series that actually adds to the feeling of endless travel that this woman makes from England through this remote island and, finally, from Australia, The plot, cinematography, location and actors combine to not miss this film. My only question is why it was not released on DVD!
