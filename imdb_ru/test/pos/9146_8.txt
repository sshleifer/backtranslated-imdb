If you love the knowledge of vampires and are a fan of gothic horror, then you can check out Soul's Midnight. I didn’t know much about this movie before watching it, and I didn’t expect much, but I found the film to be fun and interesting. <br /> <br /> Starring Armand Assante as vampire leader Simon. Soul's separate themselves from other low-cost vampire films, intertwining in the mythology of St. George and the Dragon in a new way. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what the budget of this film was, but I feel that if it were a little more, they could really hit the house with blood and consequences. <br /> <br /> If you wake up late at night and have a low-budget vampire movie to cheer you up, then Soul's Midnight is a good choice.
