Terry and June were one of the classic British sitcoms, in my opinion. You knew what to expect - and this is not so typical! :) Unlike modern sitcoms with completely contrived plots, this show is still a breath of fresh air. How nice it is not to see or hear remarks about the functions of the body or not to see a family, DEFINITELY late for breakfast, or a family with impossible teenagers. And this is the secret: Terry and June were based on a middle-class couple living in relative harmony instead of today's tense conspiracies with de Rigur's dysfunctional family (created to look fashionable). I rate the episode "The Bridge to the Far" as one of the best. In a sense, Terry’s antics remind me of Basil Falti — both sometimes become almost incredibly embarrassing! <br /> <br /> Terry and June are highly recommended. Make tea and biscuits!
