No matter what country you are in, you have to buy this show, of course, this is Australian, and if you have ever seen any attempts at our comedy, they pretty much sucks, but with the pursuer they are not boring men of 40, making bad puns, they are a team of people who talk about current affairs (mainly in Australia), make fun of our crappy advertising, make fun of our politicians, etc. <br /> <br /> In 2002, the guys also had a show under Cnnnn, which was not as successful as the war that began lko this year, so all of what they say is the current news that are really good, considering how boring or they are tragic, they are trying to shed light on some humorous light.
