In the changing world of computer graphics and other animated animations, etc., D. Fayre were welcomed, at least, by me. I think it is important to show these films from time to time to save them and to help remind us where the originality and fun of cartoons actually came from. People talked about how boring it is for graphics and stuff, but hey! Think of films that will be considered boring if each film looks like a new level of technology that everyone and his mother are doing these days. Call me old fashioned, but I liked it. This is a wonderful story about supernatural beings and people, and all that is really needed from the audience is their imagination.
