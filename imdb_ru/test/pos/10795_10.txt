I saw it several times and each time completely stuck to it. It is very tense and tense. To describe it sounds boring, but it is amazing. This is a movie in which you do not need to miss anything, but if you absorb it, it will stay with you long after it ends. Now, thinking about it, I don’t even know that I was trying to make us see the Stone. Just the story of Alan Green? I do not think so. It was a look at ignorance, stupidity, immersion in yourself, and the guy just lost his hold. Perhaps he had more power than the audience. I didn’t like Barry, but for some reason I was still worried about him. I was puzzled why I couldn't get it out of my head when the movie ended. I wish I could see Olive Stone in my head for this.
