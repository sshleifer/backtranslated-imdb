Yes, I give him 10, because I compare him not only with others of his kind, but also with the garbage that is bombarded daily in what is ridiculously called today's "popular culture." In addition, as was said elsewhere, the film is superbly filmed and gives us a pretty good look at the popular theater of the late 18th and early 20th centuries. A considerable coincidence lies in the fact that in many plays in which Alcott played, there was a similar plot: a boy meets a girl, someone objects, (usually a father or an authority figure), a boy fights, a boy defeats a girl. At that time, it was known as the “Chauncey Olcott Law”. It is also not by chance that John Ford was the director. He called it the "Quiet Man." And "My Wild Irish Rose" itself is "an act of Chauncey Olcott." Great stuff, no? Anyway, great songs, great stuff. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> ps. After watching the movie, I would like to know more about Bill Scanlan. I found that as a result of insanity (replaced, as in the film Chauncey Alcott), that he left Mauvornin and died a few years later in the asylum. But he himself seems to be a very big star who wrote songs and plays and wrote plays for him. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know more?
