One of the wonderful things about “The Best Years of Our Life”, which, despite the fact that it dates back quite well in the era after World War II, the problems she talks about are as real today as they were on VE or VJ 1945 of the year. There is as much about how to assimilate the returning war veterans, like the written history of our planet. <br /> <br /> And although we don’t often learn from history, we can be thankful that this time the United States did it. learn from what happened to his veterans after the previous world war. Bill of Rights G.I. incidentally mentioned in "The Best Years of Our Life", perhaps, was the greatest legislative act of the last century. So many veterans took advantage of this, as did veterans such as Fredrik March, Dana Andrews and Harold Russell, whom you see here. <br /> <br /> All three of these actors played veteran archetypes, characters who, at every corner of the United States, can identify with. All of them are found on a military transport plane flying to his hometown of Boone City, Iowa. <br /> <br /> War is a great and versatile class. Bank clerk Mart, asshole Andrews and school football star Russell would probably never have met in real life even in a small town like Boone City. But they are found, and war creates indestructible bonds that cannot be broken. <br /> <br /> March is the oldest, a man with two children and the ideal wife of Hollywood, Mirna Loy. He settles in the first and best. He has some great scenes, he is drunk on his return, and then with a little bit of alcohol in him, unequivocally tells the bank officials at the banquet. <br /> <br /> I also like his scene, where another returning veteran, a fireman, wants to get a bank loan on his plot of land. See the expression of March, as he listens to the presentation of a man for money. You can feel him reading the soul of man. This is what his second best actor Oscar brought him for this film. <br /> <br /> Harold Russell was a real veteran who lost both hands while serving in the Pacific. He received special recognition from the Oscar for his work. Because of this, it would probably be unfair to nominate him in the category “Secondary Actor”, in which he also won. His performance, especially his scenes with Katie O'Donnell as his lover, who loves him with or without hands, goes beyond anything that could be described as acting. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is the only officer of these three, a scorer in the air force corps. From the group, perhaps he should have stayed. He also comes from the poorest strata of the population, and he was an officer and gentleman in that uniform. This uniform and these monthly checks for money were what interested Virginia Mayo to marry him. The problem is that he is significantly less in her eyes than a civilian. <br /> <br /> While Mayo was fooling around with Steve Cochran, Andrews was very lucky that Marsh’s daughter Teresa Wright was interested in him. They are the main story of the film, Andrews' adaptation to civilian life and the adaptation to the fact that he married the wrong woman. Not all the problems of veterans were resolved with the help of GI. Bill <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy gets little recognition for "The best years of our life." I guess this is because her role as a wife was too similar to the stereotypical roles of the wife that she patented in MGM. Being the wife of March and Wright's mother, she really sticks together this family. <br /> <br /> The best years of our life are won for the best photo for Sam Goldwyn, the best director William Wyler and some others. others but two acting Oscars got it. It was a critical and popular success, possibly Sam Goldwyn's best film. It remains to this day a sweet and durable classic and will remain so for centuries. It's almost three hours, but your interest will never decrease. <br /> <br /> The best tribute to this film came from Frank Capra, who this year had his own film in the Oscar lottery in several categories. In his memoirs, he said that he was disappointed that he had been bared at the Oscars this year, but that his friend and colleague William Wyler had created such a masterpiece, he deserved every award he could get for it. By the way, the film that Capra hoped for was “It's a wonderful life.” The bit years of our life can not get better praise than this.
