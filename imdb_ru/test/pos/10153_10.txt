Am I the only person who believes that this American version is much better than the English film of 1934? The English version does not cause concern, looks antique and very modest, and has an exceptional acting game (except Peter Lorre). The 1956 version, in addition to high production figures, shows James Stewart as the ideal “innocent” American abroad and gives Doris Day his best role in history. Particularly noteworthy is the music - the music of the American film is almost classical; compare the Albert Hall sequences of both, and you will agree that Bernard Herrmann’s music is much more exciting than the original version (even though it’s basically the same music!). The only flaw in the 1956 film is the funny meeting at the Taxidermy Store. I would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the English version is better.
