A group of cats hopes to find their way home after being kidnapped by a greedy butler. <br /> <br /> Aristocats are considered to be one of the best 2D animations of Walt Disney with their charming script and cool characters, but this is not true. We don’t have the magic that created Snow White or The Jungle Book. <br /> <br /> A slower opening will have younger eyebrows raising eyebrows, but as soon as cats establish themselves in history, fun and entertainment will begin. /> <br /> Young cats create the greatest pleasure with the charming youthful rivalry with which a special kind of communication can be associated with any brother or sister of any age. <br /> <br /> Not the most funny Disney movie out there, but there are some great comic moments, especially with cats and dogs. The idea of ​​gangster cats is very impressive and equally funny. <br /> <br /> The story, after a boring start, is invariably fascinating and exactly what a family film should be. There are almost no mistakes and boring moments. The journey to find the house is interesting, and you have a feeling that you are interested, not to mention two very strange British swans. <br /> <br /> With Disney, you always get a strong, meaningful message. With the Jungle Book is where you are, with Beauty and the Beast you explore the importance of inner beauty. However, with this picture of 1970, it seems, something is missing. The film has the importance and relevance of the house, but is not sufficiently fixed; it seems that it is very far-fetched and irrelevant. <br /> <br /> My sister and I watched this very strangely, because some of the main characters were voiced by actors from the Jungle Book. <br /> <br /> Despite a bad start and confusion in the preaching message, it is always a fun family movie with good music and a few cool crazy characters, which can include viewers of any age.
