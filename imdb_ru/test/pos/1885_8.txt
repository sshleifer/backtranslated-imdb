Ah, the classic comedy. At that moment in a film where brains are mixed up, a two-minute scene in which Bruce Campbell partially beats himself reminds me of how simplified films and ideas can capture you and wrap you up in an entire movie. <br /> <br /> For many years, Bruce Campbell knows what films we want from him. We want to see weird movies like Bubba Ho Tep. We want to see starring roles in Sam Rayme’s films, and we want to see “The Man with the Screaming Brain.” With only one title, he knows that he borders on such a completely stupid type of film as "Army of Darkness", only with more stupid and less monsters. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is simple. Bruce sees the doctor. The doctor has a new idea. Bruce gets bad things happen to him on the way to the doctor. Coincidentally, this is what the doctor wanted to show him that he was saving him. Fun comes. <br /> <br /> With the addition of Ted Raimi in the role of a strange Russian guy and apprentice Stacy Keach in the role of doctor Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov, it’s funny what is being shot in this film. Complete joke Never scary. <br /> <br /> If you like the stupid Bruce Campbell, you'll like it. Again, why would you watch this if you do not like Bruce Campbell?
