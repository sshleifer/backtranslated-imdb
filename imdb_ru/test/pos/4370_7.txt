In hindsight is a wonderful thing. When he first appeared (inspired by the famous “Me No Leica” review), much was offended, now this predecessor “Cabaret” can be compared to him, and he is not half bad. This, of course, is not a classic, but it has its own wayward charm (this storyline is followed by the version of the film "Cabaret", while the stage version has somewhat changed the plot). You should certainly not resist the temptation to giggle when Christopher Isherwood Lawrence Harvey (he retains the original name of the original author; God knows what Isherwood thinks about it), describes himself as a “confirmed bachelor”, and although Harvey is completely inadequate “hero”, ( he is practically sexless), and Shelly Winters sadly plays for Fraulien Landauer (the role that Marisa Berenson played in The Cabaret), Julie Harris is absolutely amazing Sally, (this is a wonderful part of a comic game), and Anton Diffring is a first-class Fritz, he is not a Jew, in love with the character of Shelley. Of course, if the "Cabaret" never appeared, you could ask yourself if it will ever see the light again? The fact that it was revived may not be the occasion for a holiday, but it is still quite acceptable.
