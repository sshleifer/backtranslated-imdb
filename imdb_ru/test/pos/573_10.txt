I absolutely adore this movie. For me, the best reason to see this is a contrast to legal dramas like Boston Legal, Ally McBeal, or even LA Law. This is reality. The law is not BS, won in some final dispute or through some ridiculous protection that you pull out of your ass, for example, “Chewbacca's defense” in South Park. the work of GOOD lawyers is not a stereotype of a shooter who uses all his skills to correct it. He will do more to restore your faith in humanity than any Frank Capra film or Kill a Mockingbird. And most importantly, I cried. During the movie, during the show at the end of the DVD, it's awesome. Wonderful movie; wonderfully done. Thank God, the filmmakers did it.
