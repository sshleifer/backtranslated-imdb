No, I have not seen the original series, and I will not compare them if I had seen. This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well written in a different story every week. Some of them are few, but in most cases this is the quality of storytelling. I liked the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Jerrick, as well as the Deprogrammers episode with the compelling Brent Spiner as the Deprogrammer in a world where people became slaves of the reptile-like lizard. It's funny that lizards and reptiles are our favorite evil aliens, such as V, but in any case he has three days to program a fully brainwashed person to serve alien species on earth. Stories are usually a bit there, but very interesting to watch.
