I really liked this film because of the sharp scenes (humorous as well as ironic, some even “tragic”), believable performances, witty dialogue and sincere transmission of what it looks like or rather can be like to be hetero and homosexual and in search of fulfillment of your desires. I know about the paradox here: homosexual and heterosexual .... this is what the film finally decides, but never uses for a caricature. if you are as open-minded as the people who seem to have made this film, in the end it will not matter to you whether those who are on the hands of each other belong to the same sex or not. <br /> <br /> “Mr. Smith” from the matrix gives a wonderful twist as the seller of houses for gays with “strange” appetites here, but this is not the only thing to be surprised at. enjoy.....
