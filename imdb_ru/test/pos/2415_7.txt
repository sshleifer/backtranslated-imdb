Another story of "good overcoming evil", but with a difference. This includes the study of self-discipline. When Julie goes with her teacher to a Zen monastery, she learns about herself. She also sharpens her karate skills. <br /> <br /> When Zen monks visit the city, awkward and funny moments come. Not noisy, but nonetheless interesting. <br /> <br /> The next child in karate can say a lot about how to look into yourself and improve what you have, and also use what you have.
