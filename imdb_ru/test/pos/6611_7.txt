This film deserves great praise for me because, although I am not a surfer or a speed skater, I remained inspired throughout the documentary. <br /> <br /> The depth of the history and development of these two extreme sports emphasized that they could do for two groups of people. The dedication that these people had / had really inspires, and it is thanks to them that others can now enjoy and do what these guys started. <br /> <br /> Unlike most other documentaries, this one was cleverly compiled, the number of videos that were recorded and preserved for decades is amazing, and that is why some of the greatest editing work I've ever done saw, were brought together, and as a result, the topic remained focused. Without prompting them to protest recent shots with better-known surfers and skaters who remain popular today. <br /> <br /> The film deals with areas such as success, such as performing new stunts, winning competitions and collecting fame. As well as failures such as injury or burnout. <br /> <br /> It was also nice to hear that the experience comes from the skaters and surfers themselves, and not from second-hand information. This resulted in a better picture. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is truly an outstanding effort.
