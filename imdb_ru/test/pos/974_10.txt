I could watch this movie all day! I like it. Probably my favorite movies of all time. But, by the way, “badger1970” has several parts with a bad language, not too bad, but this is not really a grade G. Excellent movie !!!!! I recommend this to everyone. In any case, it makes me print 10 lines of text, so I will continue typing until I leave this comment. Well ... Still typing ... It becomes annoying. Ugh. I have four more left. In any case, watch this movie! Even if you have already seen it. I don `t care! Was it 10 lines yet? Nope There are only 2 more lines left. I don't even know why he wants me to do this. I think I did. Wait, I haven't finished, sorry, folks. I know this is torture, listening to me. Well, I suppose you should not read this comment ... But you should, because I wrote it. I probably did now. Finally, bye.
