I never sat down for six hours on end to watch a mini-series, but Changi changed that. I'm not going to lie, I know that some Australian films can be pathetic and boring (in fact, I really like Australian clicks, but maybe I'm biased), but Changi is on a completely different lane. Although this is not historically accurate, as we are constantly reminded, the show combines an excellent game, an excellent script and the addition of humor to provide us with an interesting and emotional perception of life in a prison camp in World War II. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that the show was not supposed to be documentary, so do not let any actual mistakes disappoint you. <br /> <br /> This series tells about such works of John Doyle (aka Roy Slaive), who is known for his comedy more than anything else, and an excellent director and actors promote this work well. If you want to see how much hard work has gone into this series, visit the official website, this is really interesting, and you will learn a lot about the true stories about Changi. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen Changi yet, make sure that you don’t do anything all day because you’ll want to watch the whole show.
