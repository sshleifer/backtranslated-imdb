Synopsis: Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) finds himself alone on a carriage, falling on deserted land, which seems to be the last stop on his journey. He does not know how he got there, but a welcome sign was established for him. After an instant reflection on his whereabouts, he is met by a man who takes him to his new life. Then he enters a world different from the one from which he came. <br /> <br /> Andreas quickly becomes acquainted with his new job as an accountant, and he feels that his environment is too unified for his taste. When he takes his first lunch break, he immediately notices that everyone in the city is walking in gray suits. On the same day, he sees his fellow businessman, who died on some spikes of the fence, which is similar to an act of suicide. It is strange that the inhabitants of the city do not pay attention to this terrible act and go, as if it never existed. It is quickly seen that these people are genetically deprived of sensitivity, and their ability to distinguish between something humane or inhuman is absent. <br /> <br /> In order to help Andreas settle down, he is invited to go out with his colleagues to a local nightclub. The club seems to be one step away from becoming as exciting as a night in bingo ... and Andreas drinks his sorrows, he realizes that no matter how much he drinks, alcohol does not affect him. When he tells these rites to a stranger in the men's room, the man in the toilet begins to utter the words that Andreas always had in his head. Realizing that this person is thinking about who he is, he follows him to his home and notes where he lives for future use. The plot is predictably evolving, and Andreas wants to escape. He is looking for a man whom he once followed ... hoping that he can become a man again ... but isn't it too late? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: this Norwegian film is something that everyone should watch Since it contains the answer to a big question! What is a sense of life? (well, close enough). The film tells about the gloomy realities of what happened to today's working man (or woman). The only goal is to make people understand that life is too short to be materialistic. He is trying to show that small cliches, such as the sound of children playing, should not be taken for granted, because the moment you stop hearing this sound, you are one step away from becoming a robot. The end of the film repeats what happens when it is too late to avoid the mundane routine you are used to. You begin to accept the saying “if nothing is broken, do not repair” and become too comfortable to risk change. <br /> <br /> Even if this film is not shot as part of realism ... its message is more than real. The lack of sympathy expressed in the film, and what Andreas sees, is a bold statement about what life can be. Director Jens Lien made a film that, in the hands of any other director, would have failed. This is a wonderful piece of cinematic genius, and I look forward to what he will do next. <br /> <br /> The main role played by Trond Fausa Aurvaag is well played. Representing the average Joe, Trond is a good catalyst for making this picture of dark humor. Actors also do an excellent job with their task, and for some reason, I feel that Keanu Reeves would be perfect in this film, since most of the actors played a role for their acting to be non-emotional. for this film was beautifully composed. The recurring theme was always a pleasure to listen to, and she gave a very dark but pleasant feeling in the film. <br /> <br /> On the release date in the UK on May 25, 2007, I will definitely re-experience this experience on the big screen. This film has entered my top 10 ... now it is quickly becoming my best 20! It has some shocking scenes, and darkly humorous all over ... MUST -SEE
