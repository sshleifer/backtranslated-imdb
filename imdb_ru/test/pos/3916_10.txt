Ok, so Paris Hilton sucks (typical of Malibu Barbie), but the rest of the cast are great! I watched the movie last night, and he fully supported me throughout the film. Chad Michael Murray SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO: HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT, and he is just an actor. Whole hero man. The main girl, who is the sister of Nick (Chad), is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think that nowadays films are so different, most of them come with psychopaths, possessions, ghosts, but here you have a topic about wax! I had completely lost the creeping wax patterns in the house, although they looked so real. I still don't have a story with twins, I'm just waiting to get a DVD and then watch it again. Thumbs up to such a wonderful movie! 11/10. All those people who do not like it, please do not worry 2 to criticize my opinion, since basically everyone thinks it's cool. I also think that the Parisian scene, when she strips down to her underwear, is completely uncomfortable. Why not just get the dog to fuck some kind of cat ... be more interesting than this one. When the scene of the death of Paris came up, I thought it was bad, because she was still running, although the knife had just risen to her feet. HM interesting. <br /> <br />! CHAD ALL WAY!
