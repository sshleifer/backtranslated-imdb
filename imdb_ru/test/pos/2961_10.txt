When I was about 7 or 8 years old in the States, I always woke up early, just to watch it along with a whole bunch of other cartoons, such as HootKloot, The Road Runner Show, Pink Panther. But it was probably one of the most memorable and fun animated works, and I still find it very funny today, I will never forget episodes, like where two aardvark fought for a can of chocolate ant pudding? or the one where the aardvark tries to get to the island, where all the ants are located, and my personal favorite, the one where the ant, the aardvark and the dog go to the animal hospital, which later becomes the basis of the similar cartoon Looney Toons with Sylvester, Tweety and Bulldog. This is one of the most memorable cartoons in which everyone would like to return, I would have done so. Great series.
