From the very beginning I was watching the “King of Queens” and felt that he was not noticed at the awards. This show has the best humor, you can identify it with characters, we talk a lot about it at work, because I work for a company like IPS (DHL), and we just like Teamster plugs !! Carrie is my hero, she is the best, she just shows it, regardless of what we are talking about. Arthur, what can I say? It just hacks you and really spins things up. Doug, well, he's just so cute and funny, three characters, and all the friends just finish the show. This is the best comedy on TV !! I would say there with Seinfeld, and hey, there is nothing wrong with that ... Excellente !! as doug would say.
