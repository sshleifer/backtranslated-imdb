I am not a film director, but I know that it is difficult to tell a story in seven minutes and attract an audience to a character. Horses on Mars do this and more. When you watch a good movie, you do not want it to end. That's how I felt watching this movie. It expands visually, and the microbe acquires such human qualities that you feel that you are traveling with it. <br /> <br /> Really looking forward to see what exciting adventures Mr. Anderson is waiting for us in the future. Well done.
