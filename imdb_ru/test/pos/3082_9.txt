Like many children born in the 1980s, I grew up on Mel Brooks films, which were not necessarily “more racist”, like “Burning saddles” and “History of the World”, part 1 (I saw them, of course, although not as often as they are now), but those intended for "the whole family", Spaceballs and this film. I knew that at that time I did not see great art, but I was just stupid, stupid, although always worthy of laughter to shoot Robin Hood and / or adventure films. But to call it a family movie in quotes means that a) adults can really enjoy it just like children, if not more because of little jokes and stupid vulgarities, and b) when a child sees him, when he comes back to him, as I have done this several times, it is still as fresh, but with some things that are not quite clear for the first time. This is a comedy that is filled not only with jokes in films about Robin Hood and other films (of course, the godfather, as well as small references to other films of modern times), but also with reference to Brooks’s own films; This is a director who does not fool even his own style. <br /> <br /> Main story - Robin Hood (Cary Elvis in one of his best turns) returns home from crusades to see the threat of King Richard disappearing, and therefore he tries to regain his land and, naturally, rob the rich to feed the poor. On the way, he meets Asha (Dave Chappepel), butting his head with Prince John (Richard Lewis) and the sheriff and, of course, still craves love for the maiden Marian. This is, of course, the usual rope for Brooke, which allows comedies to run backstage, and although sometimes the joke may not work or may become stale when re-viewed, so much of it is stuck that it is hard not to laugh. It also helps that the pair of bits are some of the best in any Brooks movie, such as the Godfather's Bit (House of Deuces at its best), Brooks’s own cameo as the turns of Rabbi, Lewis and Shappel, and an infinite number of quotes. lines and a pair of mocking songs. This is partly obvious, yes, partly it comes straight from the pages of Blazing Saddles, of course, but is it a good time for the right crowd? Definitely - and for parents who grew up at the work of Brooks of the 70s, this is a fantastic way to acquaint the young with his work through this (even suggestive sexual jokes and the like are not rated R, all in good fun).
