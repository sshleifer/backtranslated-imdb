I was glad to know that at least this film is now starting to get the grade it deserves (just watch these voices). Not a first-class action, such as Die Hard or Lethal Weapon, but still something like a solid 7 out of 10: a good script, good actors with working chemistry and a director who knows what he wants (unfortunately, was the director of Harlin’s last good film. “The Deep Blue Sea” managed to achieve the status of “OK on a roller coaster”, but “The Island of Thugs, and especially“ Managed ”- these are well-deserved failures!) be the theme of "Woman as the star of the militants." Well, give her a chance, because Davis does demonstrate superior performance. And in the end, this film is not so much focused on “female” “from the outside, but instead on good old action, Buddhism (Jackson as an assistant has plenty of space here, plus his share of action - and about a thousand wise killers!) and on the plot (from Shane Black, the author of "Lethal Weapon" and "The Last Boy Scout." : if someone else has not seen it, remember to rent it for the next t i have a saturday night!
