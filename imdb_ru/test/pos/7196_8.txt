I just managed to find a copy of Cleopatra’s Mission, which is not as simple as you think for someone living in the United States. So far, I have watched only the first 10 minutes of the film, and I can say with confidence that during these 10 minutes I laughed more than when I watched the entire first “live” film Asterix. <br /> <I’m watching the dubbed version, and although the job of rewriting is a bit embarrassing, I found the film to be very funny and true to the book. I see that people here said that the dubbed version is very inferior to the version with subtitles, which may well be true, and after I watch the version with subtitles (also on my DVD), I may have to come here and change my overview. However, in my opinion, this is a very interesting film, and it more than compensates for the mess they made in the first film.
