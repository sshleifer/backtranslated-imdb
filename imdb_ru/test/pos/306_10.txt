During the Vietnam War, Captain Willard (Martin Shin) was sent to Cambodia on a secret mission to kill Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) because he was completely insane and no longer accepting orders. And since Kurtz is one of the most prominent men in the armed forces, it is hard for Captain Willard to understand how Colonel Kurtz could go to the bottom, killing him without permission and taking the war into his own hands. What could push this great man to the top? Through Willard’s long journey through the jungle to find his goal, he tries with some success to understand why. But what does he decide to do when he finds him? <br /> <br /> Any film that can start with The Doors The Doors is a great movie in my book, especially if it can be combined with a mood. and the images shown with the song. Apocalypse now does it perfectly. I can’t think of anything better for this, the Vietnam War and the madness in the minds of the soldiers that it created. AN is a dark and cruel story about a long journey through the funniest jungles in Vietnam, whose ultimate goal is murder. Through the use of music and musical score, we are immersed in a dark world of mystery, violence and madness. A great example of how to set the mood with the help of one music - this film is right here. <br /> <br /> In general, an excellent cast, with the exception of Lawrence Fishburne, from which Shin and Brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread through our film about the desire to bake bread. I just do not like Fishburn, since I learned that he is a Curtis Cowboy in the TV Theater, my contempt and hatred for this man increased tenfold. I understand this pettiness, but I do not care. We need to root for Gary Oldman on him. Brando is great, like Colonel Kurtz, and I can't remember a single other actor who could play a good man who went crazy and kept such a presence on the screen. Sheena is also interested in watching Willard, and we can identify him with the question of his mission and the war in general. My favorite character in the film is Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore, Robert Duval. Before this film, I had never portrayed Duval as a wartime cowboy, but to be honest, this is my favorite part of his role today. He just nailed his character, who is one of the best in the whole film, as the commander of the air cavalry, who likes to surf. Maybe a little higher, but still brilliant. I also like the smell of napalm in the morning. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple and does not require too much mental ability to understand what is happening. Willard's mission is to kill Kurtz, plain and simple. But the journey of the film is his heart, as well as the difficult situations of the war itself. In the Redux version, we are forced to sit through the extended French plantation scene and the Playboy rabbit scene, which really adds nothing to the fullness of the film, except for making it a longer journey. I do not feel that they are taking something away, it’s just a question of whether you want to watch a three-hour film or an original. In this journey, the film points to the absolute futility and futility of war for the Americans and the enormous effect it had on the soldiers who fought in it ... in fact, that’s the whole point. On top of that, the troops were not supported by the public, and this could well lead to the fact that a character like Kurtz was completely insane. <br /> <br /> A big fan of war films, this one with the local platoon and the Deer Hunter, they are all classics. Sometimes I try to compare films of the same genre with each other, but in the past I had problems in my reviews, because I had to go back to what I said. All three have their strengths, and they add their own flavor to the Vietnam War ... so, in truth, one is better than the other, rather pointless ... even if after a recent viewing of NA, I think this is a bit it is better. In the end, Apocalypse Now is a real classic in any version and worthy of the status it was given. As a reviewer previously reported, AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made.
