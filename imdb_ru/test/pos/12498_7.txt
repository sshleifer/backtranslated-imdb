I'm torn over this show. While most parts of it I found funny, other parts I found stupid and just shocking for the sake of shock. A parody of some of the cartoons is simply gorgeous, like many scenes with children. However, I don't think it's silly to force small children to say rude things. The point is not that I think “oh poor children, they are exploited” - it’s just really not smart !! This is what ANY could do, so it’s as simple and meaningless as to make a paper airplane. To make this show better, they will have to adhere to the natural responses of children, which, I think, can be funnier than the script of that time. <br /> <br /> By far the most fun part of the Wonder Showzen is Clarence, the blue puppet who wanders the streets, talking and annoying strangers. It's really fun and mostly improvised. To see him in a long scene about the importance of patience to test the patience of an EXTREMELY patient man, in my opinion, was the funniest scene. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this show, because overall it’s very funny, even if it’s stupid from time to time.
