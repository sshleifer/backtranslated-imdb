One of the earliest films of Starevich, made in France, is probably his only political satire. The story of the “frogs that are looking for a king” reflects his name, since a group of tall “crooks” believes that democracy has declined, so they demand that the king of Jupiter rule his land. When he sends a stump, the frogs ask for another king, saying that the stump is just "political timber." This time, Jupiter sends a hungry stork, whose frog's lustful eyes devour the inhabitants of the city. When the original "hunchback" is about to slide off the stork's beak, he says about his moral: "let's go it alone." This film presents several beautiful crowd scenes from dozens of puppet frogs. Starewicz is deceiving the audience by making her believe that they all move at the same time, keeping the background in constant motion and animating only about six frogs or so at a time. A slightly banal dialogue and problems with lighting in some places reduce the quality of repeated viewing, but its historical significance in the life of Starevich makes observation important. His feelings for the government immediately after his flight from Russia are probably expressed in this film. In addition, the technical achievements of the animation of so many characters at the same time in the film “Stop” are striking.
