This film is absolute gold. If you have not seen, do it. Mani Ratnam surpasses himself again. This film introduced me to Nandita Das, although everyone in this film shines. My only regret is that I have never found a copy with subtitles for the lyrics. We are led from the jungle of northern Sri Lanka to the serene beaches of South India, as well as from the horror of war to the final conquest of the human heart by love. Beautiful, thin, witty, with several hidden surprises awaiting the viewer, this film is worth seeing again and again, and the plot in the story, The Umbrella, is done so well when we watch the scene unfold from the drawings in the book. Beautiful. Watch it
