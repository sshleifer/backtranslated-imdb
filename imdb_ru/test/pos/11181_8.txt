Due to the fact that I, unfortunately, could not find them anywhere, I could not try any of the other entries in the series, although I certainly would not have objected and, believe me, I looked. For those who do not know, this is an adventure name. This means that the mouse is what you use to interact with everything that you can do in this, although in this case there is one particular case where it is inaccurate. I will not spoil it here, for those who have not tried it yet. However, no matter how little computer experience you have, you can sit down and try it. There is not even so much that is needed to be quick or have quick reflexes. Damn it, you can adjust the speed of the text (if it has subtitles), and therefore conversations in it, and it is not very awkward or forced when slow. Accessing your inventory is easy, as well as combining or using items. Pressing and holding the button in any place that you can affect gives you three options for what to use with it (be it a person, a certain part of the environment or an object): a hand (push, lift, open, etc.), eyes (explore, look, etc.) and mouth (eat, talk, etc.). All this creates a hospitable, friendly environment where you can approach numerous puzzles (their number varies depending on which of the two difficulty settings you try on) at your own pace, as well as explore and study dozens of individual, creatively made characters. and areas in it, to your heart. The duration of this will depend on how much time you spend on it (you will not hear any fault from me, they are worth it) and your ability to find solutions. There are several moments in this when you decide whether you want to go through a difficult path or not. This may appeal to anyone from any age. There is no material that is not suitable for children. This is one of the products that helps to prove that this fact itself should not mean that it is unacceptable for an older audience. Animation is quality work, smooth, everything moves as it should, and, frankly, the 3rd dimension is not so missed when trying to do it. Storytelling is well done, and you never know what is going on. There are many well-directed scenes stored in the same colorful, mostly vibrant 2D world as the rest, with well-made camera movements. “Animation” is the right word to describe this, and not just the visual style. It can be applied to all this. This whole world is very similar to ours, but not quite the same as ours, with a mixture of past and present, inhabited by people and filled with things that we can either recognize or understand in at least parts, but makes them ridiculous by absurdity. This should be one of The greatest strengths of this, right here: it's fun. Much of this is due to the words expressed (what is said and how it is), and those who dig up British efforts with an emphasis on literature, such as Allo Allo or the BlackAdder franchise, will want to test this sucker. However, there are several different types of jokes, including but not limited to: Satire, cunning, darkness, parody, irony, rough comedy (not quite my favorite aspect of this) and much more. There is self-awareness, with leadership appealing to you personally, and, for example, explaining why he is not going to do what you just asked him. There are references to pop culture in a couple of decades. Almost all of this works, hardly any jokes will work, and if you do not whip up during this, I think the reason is that it is simply not compatible with your sense of humor ... a situation that does not require Judgment , and if someone suspects that this may be the case, and wants to find out, I offer a demo version, where you can see for free if you care about the brand of the game and / or laughter. The plot is well written (almost all of this, in fact), it develops well everywhere and well supports your interest. The sound is all great, crisp and well done. Sound effects are accurate. The music is well composed without exception. The voice acting is flawless, with a celebrity or two. Armato is fantastic, like Guybrush Threepwood (must love this name), which you control. Boen is incredible as LeChuck, the deceased (and still threatening) zombie villain. Projects are very well made, very creative and all fit. Despite the relatively limited nature of our hero, when it comes to pirate deeds, you can participate in some. Drive the ship, get on the ship of others and pick the blades in a rather unique and amazing way. Reproducibility lies mainly in the choice, during dialogue, etc. This is linear, with little freedom, as far as order goes, so the pirate sitting down with it, at least the second time, did not get so big The amount of opportunity, as far as it is challenging, goes if he or she has not forgotten what to do at the same time. Ah, there is nothing perfect. Anyone who wants to penetrate the carefully thought out and fascinating fictional universe and smash countless times should get a real boost from this. Good looking, not those that hurt and potentially leave bruises. Do not forget, children, do not * eat * books ... it is just begging. I bet that those who like others will appreciate it too. And they are not the only ones who can enter it. I recommend this, in addition to members of the aforementioned group, to any fan of this genre of VG, as well as to everyone who likes this review. 8/10
