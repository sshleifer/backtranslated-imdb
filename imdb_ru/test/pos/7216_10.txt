This movie is awesome. It's ridiculous, sexy, cruel, and painful, but all of this together for the brilliant performance of Trom Romeo and Juliet. If you donâ€™t mind having a bit of a fight (good, but it's funny), watch this movie. It's worth it! There is no level at which it does not work. I have seen it three times now, and this is still amazing. I recommend it. Go! Take it
