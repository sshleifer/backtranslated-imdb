... the last time I laughed so much. This is testimony to Rowan Atkinson’s talent that he managed to create a comic character with several layers and a distinct personality - almost without a word. The entire success of the program lies on the shoulders of Atkinson, but he carries it with ease. Despite the fact that the show lasted only one season, anyone, even vaguely familiar with pop culture, recognizes social weakness with a rubbery face, so great is the talent and effort invested in the performance. At times annoying, at times attractive, Mr. Bean is an innocent, unhappy guy who also turns out to be evil incarnate. The brilliance of this character can not be expressed in words, you have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> At times, the show becomes too depressing, like on the notorious New Year's Eve or when Bean celebrates his birthday. Walking alone to a restaurant, offering himself a greeting card signed by him, and receiving a stake, he does not like very much. However, there are times when you cannot help but be impressed by the inventive methods by which Bean gets rid of trouble, for example, when he gets rid of a specified stake in many clever ways or when he turns into melting without taking his pants off ! Whatever your reaction to Binah and his unorthodox lifestyle, you will certainly laugh while you watch. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to point out that, although Bob is classified as a program for children, it is equally pleasant for any adult with a sense of humor. Since more “adult” jokes will go over the heads of babies, and a clever farce (yes, it happens) is fun, no matter how old you are, Bob is the surest definition of a family show. This is a fair classic, and it always decorates my day.
