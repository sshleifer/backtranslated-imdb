At first I played the second game on Monkey Island, and I liked it, despite the poor quality of graphics and sound. Then, a few months later, I learned that a new game had been made. I tried it and I really liked it. The first thing you'll notice is great graphics. The areas are huge, colorful and detailed, with plenty to explore. The game requires you to use your brain, a lot, as always. The game is difficult, with all the points and clicks, disappointing. Jokes do not age for the third time. Animated scenes are also a great addition to the game. This is the best MI game, possibly the best P & C game! If you like cartoon games in which you play like a movie, purchase this game!
