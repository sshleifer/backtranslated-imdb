This is probably included in my Top 5 funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this film was very different! This made fun of Robin Hood and was fun! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well it worked! Beyond Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire and Houseguest, it was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love this song; "We are men in tights!" If you have a good sense of humor, you will love this movie!
