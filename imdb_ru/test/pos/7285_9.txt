I was pleasantly surprised by how good the film is. Are you a fan of blood or a fan of suspense; You like it. Before, I didnâ€™t like horror movies, I thought they were stupid. But, in any case, I make exceptions. I find something really unusual in this film. Rarely have I ever seen a movie that scared me to shit, but I tell you the truth, this movie made me shiver my neck. Unlike most horror films, this film takes care of character development. I highly recommend this film, and I am glad that Asylum finally releases good horror films these days. <br /> <br /> I recommend! Enjoy!
