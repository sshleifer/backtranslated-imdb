... The reason why I like this film so much is in its spirit. This is a brilliant film about the summer camp, so the jokes have no mean intentions, which turns one character into a constant mockery. Jokes happen, but you have the feeling that the corresponding loser guys can look back and laugh, being stupefied enough to fall in love with them - and, not being too stupid, it's actually quite nice that they still remain friends in the end! <br /> <br /> This is an extra special bonus when Bill Murray is the master of the ring of all these fun games. For me, he is still considered the god of a peerless comedy when he gets a chance to free himself. No one is able to create a sense of stupid anarchy without harming anyone. The tone of the film has the same style as his host, with a magnificent opening scene in which Murray prepares for this day. Yes, everything is stupid, but more important than behaving like an adult - is to have a lot of good-natured fun. "Meatballs" promise such and ultimately deliver a satisfying clock.
