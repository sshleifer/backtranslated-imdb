Putney Swope is a unique, low-budget gem from the late 1960s that would probably have been forgotten in time if not for two things: Paul Thomas Anderson (who called Don Chidle's character in Boogie Nights, Buck Swope , after the eponymous hero of this film) and a limited edition DVD. Watching “Putney Swope” is like listening to hardcore punk rock: it may not make much sense (at least for me it was not the first time you watched it), but you must respect the movie for its passion and shamelessly rebellious message. . I understood little in Putney Swope, but for the most part I liked it. The more I think about the film, the more it grows for me. <br /> <br /> The film is advertised as a parody of Madison Avenue in New York, known in the 1960s as the world advertising capital. Members of Generation X and Y may be lost due to this concept, but fortunately, “Mad People” on television to provide us with this otherwise lost piece of US history. Before watching this movie you need to know that these advertising agencies were mostly male, and even more white. <br /> <br /> Based on this premise, the film begins with a meeting of the board of directors of an advertising agency. The members of the club are predominantly white, with the exception of Putney Swap (Arnold Johnson, who in this film is very similar to Dick Gregory), the symbol of an African American on the board. Council members are so self-absorbed and soulless that when their chairman is dead in front of them, their only concern is who will be the next chairman. Even without removing the body from the meeting room, they begin a paper vote to elect the next chairman. <br /> <br /> Putni Swope is elected by a landslide, but not because other members think that Swope has the right. Voting for Swope was an unsuccessful attempt by these board members to sabotage the chance of any other member being elected chairman. With their plans failed, Swope assumes responsibility and “drowns in the boat”, dismissing all but one of the original members, and hiring all the colored people in their place. <br /> <br /> After this point, the film became (for me) very strange and difficult to understand the plot. Perhaps there was not even a plot. The whole idea of ​​the film seems to be a “what if” scenario, with the result that the new “Truth and Soul” company would be unconventional, but nonetheless successful. As a result, the company earns so much money that its members build a huge glass cabinet to keep money for inexplicable purposes. This may be because Swope does not trust banks, although this point is not affected and is not explained in the film. It may also be metaphorical in some way, but who knows. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place in an ad agency, with episodes in the White House with a president who, for some unknown reason, is a dwarf. My guess here is that some kind of political joke was made, but I can’t understand what. The filmmakers said that the president is a small, insignificant part of American life? Did they say that the last elected officials (at the time of Nixon) were minor candidates? I dont know. However, it seemed to me a bit creepy that the man playing in the president had a striking resemblance to the future president Ronald Reagan. It's funny to establish such a connection 40 years after the film was shot. <br /> <br /> This film may have won a demonstration of how consumers outside the ad agency reacted to new advertisements. Of course, ad staff had a strange, funny call for their non-standard creativity, but did this adverts convince people to buy a product? If so, how? The film hinted at the idea that the new advertising campaign was successful thanks to the interaction with customers and calls from the White House. Nevertheless, it would be revealing to see ordinary people, since this demography has always been the most profitable for advertisers. <br /> <br /> Although the parodies and political messages that this film may have made, probably did not stand the test. At that time this film still had many unique qualities. Arnold Johnson had a magnetic X factor that brought him great benefit in this film. Swap's harsh voice was actually directed by Robert Downey, the voice of the elder is dubbed, sometimes bad, but fits so well with the character, being a reputable outsider. He hires and dismisses employees at random, but earned the respect of all employees, except one, for the revolution in an advertising agency and the search for new ideas. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film was and remains incredible. risky, especially since the film was written and filmed by a white man (Robert Downey Sr.). However, this film will not fall prey to negative black stereotypes that can lead to the rise and fall of the blasting genre over the years. Although some of the sex scenes can be a bit unpleasant for some viewers, the basic idea is that a black business that is owned and operated can flourish through innovation and risk taking. Many people may not accept the positive message from this film, but I just did it. <br /> <br /> “Putney Swap” remains an unnoticed film from a strange era, and Downey Sr. (even despite his son’s recent return) never received the recognition of the director he deserved. However, if you find a DVD with this movie, buy it and take a look. If it is on Netflix, the same. This is a film that can sometimes be confusing, but it is worth watching for his passion, ambition and non-conformist status, even by today's cinema standards.
