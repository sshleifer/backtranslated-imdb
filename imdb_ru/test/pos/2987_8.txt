Most of these reviews are dead, so I’ll go to another chase and answer a couple of questions I’ve seen here. <br /> <br /> Although the characters look and look young (hence the contradictions) the actors / actresses themselves were 17 and 18 years old at the time, and, obviously, behind the 16th barrier. Here, in the USA, this is still somewhat controversial, but the simplicity and innocence of the film largely compensates for it. <br /> <br /> Sorry that Sean did not see more; in this film, his expressions are at least demonstrative and obvious; You know exactly what the character feels, whether he is angry, afraid, or confused. Enisi had a healthy career, whose life, unfortunately, was cut short by cancer at the end of 2006. She was a wonderful and talented actress. <br /> <br /> VHS tapes FRIENDS can sometimes be found on Amazon.com, but usually for a significant price; I saw him for only 60 dollars or so and up to 152 dollars (at the time of this comment there were two of them at this price). The continuation of the PAUL & MICHELLE video is not so expensive, and it can be purchased (if available) on Amazon from an average of 16 to 70 dollars.
