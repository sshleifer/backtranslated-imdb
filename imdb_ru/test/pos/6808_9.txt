Sentimental, heartbreaking family film, filmed in England of the 1920s. Young Elizabeth Taylor wins the horse in the lottery and decides to enter it into the Grand National; Fortunately, ex-jockey Mickey Rooney is going to help Liz. Director Clarence Brown demonstrates remarkable control with material that could be too offensive in the hands of others. He and screenwriters Helen Deutsch and Theodore Reeves pay great attention to the creation of authentic characteristics and the natural development of history. True, there are one or two scenes that seem a bit forced, but in general this is quite spectacular and superbly filmed in Technicolor. The race itself is quite exciting, and, like many great classics, at the end of an amazing disappearance with three noses. Liz proves that she was a real soldier from the very beginning, and Rooney, whom I usually find rather annoying, is surprisingly depressed and very good indeed. Donald Crisp is terrible as the rude father Liz, and Angela Lansbury as her eldest, crazy sister. However, most of the acting roles are owned by Ann River, who won a deserved second-aid Oscar, who played the wise and caring mother Liz.
