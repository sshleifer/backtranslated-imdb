This short topic has gathered fame from all kinds of places for its request for religious tolerance. <br /> <br /> After a session in the recording studio, Frank Sinatra leaves and confronts a group of children beating up another because he was Jewish. He lectured them, as soon as the American icon, on the meaning of prejudice and on what we had just fought against the Nazis. The meaning could not be clearer. <br /> <br /> Both songs from this short story were recorded and sold for Colombian records. If you are just a dream and a song written for the film “The House I Live In”. The latter is one of the best songs about an idealized version of America that we all would like to strive for. <br /> <br /> Sinatra actually recorded The House I Live In again in the sixties for a joint album, which he did for his label Reprise. The album is now a rarity and should not be. His collaborators were Bing Crosby and Fred Waring, as well as his Pennsylvanians with an orchestra conducted by Nelson Riddle. <br /> <br /> Axel Stordal was the main music conductor and arranger of Sinatra in the 1940s. When he died, this position eventually fell on Nelson Riddle. Stordahl orchestrates for the short and Columbia, Riddle for the Reprise record. <br /> <br /> Sinatra fans and other people should listen back-to-back as well as compare. And catch this decent movie when it is shown.
