“Kramer vs. Kramer” is an amazing drama about an unhappy woman who walks with her husband and young son. Now the husband has to take care of the boy. When he does, they get to know each other better. But then the mother and wife return, and she wants custody of the boy. Cramer vs. Cramer has a lot of drama with some great comedies added for good measure. Dustin Hoffman received his first best actor Oscar for his brilliant performance here. Most people say that his performance in "Rainman", which brought him the second Oscar, is his best. He was great in this film, but I disagree that this is his best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career in this film. The scene behind the scenes shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American actors working today. He is also sometimes funny. Also amazing was Meryl Streep, who didn’t know so well when shooting this film as she did today. Streep, like Hoffman, also received his first Oscar (for Best Supporting Actress) for working for Cramer vs. Kramer as his wife and mother, who is trying to find herself after leaving her family. Justin Henry, who was only 8 years old when the film was released, is beautiful as the son of Hoffman and the Strip. He won an Oscar nomination for his role here, and so far he is the youngest performer to receive an Oscar nomination in the competitive category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also good as a legitimate friend of the family. She also received an Oscar nomination (for a supporting actress, where she lost to a colleague Strip.) Cramer vs. Kramer is a great movie from start to finish. Screenwriter Robert Benton made a completely unforgettable film. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
