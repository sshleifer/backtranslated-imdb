I have not seen so many people packed outside the theater since Star Wars Episode III. Both shows are sold out, and for good reason. "The Man with the Screaming Brain" was the best film that can be seen with a crowd of fans. (Hi, I'm a dork too.) <br /> <br /> Bruce Campbell was there, and the whole crowd was in stitches! The film was cheesy at its best. This may be the funniest movie that Bruce made. Ted Raimi steals the show with his Bulgarian hip-hop itud and crazy expression, he is a riot of laughter Who knew that Ted can rap? <br /> <br /> I changed my mind, the person who stole the show was actually a robot. There is nothing funnier than a robot ... makes a robot. <br /> <br /> With regard to Bruce's speech: “I take the 5th.” Thanks, Bruce. Thank you for being cool, thanks for taking the time, thanks for all the fun.
