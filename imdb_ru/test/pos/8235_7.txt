During World War II, several billion films created by Hollywood were created, and after watching many of them, they begin to look alike. However, OVER 21 is unique in many ways, because it shows a side of the war that you will not see in other films, which makes it worthy of attention, even if you have already watched millions of other films! <br /> <br /> Alexander Knox plays a major role, but the real role in the film is Irene Dunn, which looks amazing for a 47-year-old lady (yes, I checked - she really was so old when she made the film) . For 21 years, the couple plays a husband and wife. He is enrolled in the army, much to the dismay of his father (Charles Coburn) and the owner of the newspaper, where Knox works, and most of the film occurs when he goes to school as a candidate officer. The film shows Knox a little at school, but instead focuses on Dunn, as she lives in the nearby Spartan housing for spouses. During this time, she (as the British say) retains a “hard upper lip” and does everything possible, although she is not really a housewife, but a well-known professional writer. From time to time she receives very brief visits from her exhausted husband, but most of the time she spends doing housework duties and not allowing Coburn to interfere. In the end, she decides to prevent the annoying Coburn from making continuous calls (he ALWAYS complains that his newspaper cannot survive without his son), pretending to be Knox - he writes wonderful articles that everyone thinks were written by him. <br /> <br /> Although there is nothing amazing in this film, this is a very interesting part of the life movement. In addition, everything is very good. Interestingly, this film is a fictional adaptation of the experienced Ruth Gordon (famous screenwriter) and her husband Garcon Kanin (also known script writer and director). When Kanin joined the army during World War II, Gordon soon wrote and starred in a play that became this film. <br /> <br /> By the way, I noticed that some reviewers really liked the speech at the end of the film and were inspired by it. Although it was very good, it was also very sad, since all this hope for a better world after the war was short-lived.
