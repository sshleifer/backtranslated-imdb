The team of doctor husband and his wife Carol and Niles Nelson modestly succeed in their careers, but Niles has a problem with gambling. His luck changes when he (unknowingly) saves the life of the gangster from the mafia Joe Gurney and gets a big bonus from the gangler himself. Loving his fortune shift (and a smart new apartment), Niles continues to receive rewards for correcting other injured gang members. Unfortunately, his dubious deals are revealed during a police raid, which also casts a shadow on his wife's career. <br /> <br /> At this point, the plot comes into focus, because Carol Nelson must save her career until her license is suspended. This involves bringing the gang to justice more or less alone. <br /> <br /> This is not an uncompromising gangster picture, but a plot that might have been suitable for such shows as MATLOCK or MURDER SHE WROTE. Some tension, but the mood is maintained by Bogart's derisive gangster's derisive mocking behavior, who considers himself a "Napoleon of Crime". His other gang members also function more like puppets than bullies. And between Bogart and Francis there is some lively dialogue, especially when she heals his wounds in his hideout. Of course, as in all gangster films, there is a big end of the shootout, but with a humorous twist. This is a good short film showing Bogart on the road to fame.
