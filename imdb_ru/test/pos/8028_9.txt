This film is about Carlos "The Jackal" (Quinn), an international terrorist who, according to CIA agent Henry Fields (Sutherland), seems to cripple women and children for all this. At least, this is what he says to blame US naval officer Annibal Ramirez (again Quinn) for impersonating Carlos and disguising him as a traitor in the eyes of the KGB. Ramirez seems to be physically identical to Carlos, but mentally he is his opposite. He carries order, and Carlos - chaos. <br /> <br /> The film is not only an action shootout, and that’s good. In his first half, Ramirez is being trained to act and think like Carlos, and it is in this film that the difference from other mediocre fighters is achieved. An Israeli agent (Kingsley) joins Fields in training Ramirez, and together they seem to take on the role of parents in the birth of a new character Ramirez. Ramirez is taught not to love what Carlos doesn’t like, act for a split second, like Carlos, and even make love like Carlos (courtesy of Carlos' former girlfriend). Naturally, everything that he is taught will be useful in the second half of the film. This is a bit contrived, but Quinn shows an exciting performance as a wannabe to Carlos. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I liked about this film was that it didn’t use a very overworked storyline in evil twin films. the one in which the evil twin sneaks into the family of the good twin. Ramirez's family really comes into the picture, but instead they emphasize how his new character destroys his family life. <br /> <br /> This film is inspired by good funny humor, often causing a sharp duo of Sutherland and Kingsley. The exception is an abused and obviously useless joke with the name Ramirez (Annibal, Annabel, you understand?). It was also exaggerated the duo's constant dissatisfaction with how powerful, clever and clever Carlos is. In my opinion, during the final showdown the winnings could not be compared with the initial one. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was enjoyable. I'm not a big fan of action movies, but this film was smarter and more exciting than a regular action movie, and it supported my attention in everything. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10
