I watched this, expecting to see the usual British stiff stereotypes of the upper lip, and was surprised to find that the dialogue is remarkably natural and colored by black humor. It was more like how the Dogs went out to sea than we serve in. The scenes during the approach and attack are amazingly realistic with their portrayal of the warship and the ups and jokes among the ship company (well, at least based on my service in the 1970s). Some of the unambiguous lines are very witty (“I don't join the“ Group of Hope ”just to please the fat fish!”). My only complaint is that they didn’t show what happened to Irish Roulette and his bride or tattooed software and his "I Love Arabella" tattoo!
