* THIS COMMENT WILL BE A PROBABLE SPOILER !! I checked the spoiler box just in case, but it may not have a spoiler, but be careful if I say something that you might consider a spoiler, and I am not! Wow ... the best game since Super Mario 64. I got it. On the very first day, when I left, I went to several gaming sites to see its ratings (yes, they already looked at it before it came out) and I was shocked. I was expecting something like the Sunshine, because lately all the Mario games have gotten worse and worse. But this one is completely ahead of other games. Points in this game even beat Halo 3! This is just awesome. <br /> <br /> STORY: Not the best Mario games are ever known for their stories, and there is not much difference. Bowser again abducts Peach, but this time he invades the Mushroom Kingdom for a holiday celebrated once a century, and gets a flying saucer, shoots lasers on the ground, and then they anchor the ground and tear the castle and its foundation into space. <br /> <br /> GRAPHICS: Absolutely gorgeous, best graphics on the Wii. Water effects are also very good, if you ever see water, it looks so real, because the effects they put into it. MUSIC: Simply amazing, the music in this game is organized. Not all, but even those that are not organized sound very good. <br /> <br /> GAMEPLAY: very entertaining, makes you want to play more and more, and for me, since I usually tend to play to be very disappointed with games, if I die a lot, I mean, I definitely donâ€™t The only one, but this game for me did not have this much. Now it still happened, but not to the same extent as in Mario 64, when I completely lose my mind and end up turning off the game, because it drives me crazy, this one never did. <br /> <br /> Difficult: these are two types of difficulty, because you can technically beat the game for just 60 stars, which, in my opinion, is quite simple, but to complete the game 100%, you have to get 120, like always, and this quest is much more difficult, but at the same time still very fun. <br /> <br /> LENGTH: Good length, definitely not too short. It took me about 15-16 hours to surpass it with just 60 stars, but 120 took more from me, like 45-50 hours. Now I did not play all the time, I played first a lot one day, then the next couple of days, just a couple of hours every day, and then the next two days I played all day. For me, however, I think the 60-star quest was a bit short, so if you want a long game, I suggest getting them all. <br /> <br /> PRESENTATION: Now the cinematic scenes in this film are excellent. The way they are, just looks like I would have seen in cinemas. For now, they broadcast the best cinematic scenes in any Mario game. <br /> <br /> GENERAL INFORMATION: This game is definitely a great game, and I advise you not to wait until Christmas, to get it as soon as possible. This game is also a good combination of old and new, you will have several levels of side scroller in which you will move from side to side or up and down, because they will vary depending on gravity, but even in music there is some something old classic. So this game seems like a masterpiece. For me, this is my favorite Mario game of all time, but others may disagree. But it is still a great game. I recommend every gamer who wants to have fun in the game to get it.
