I'm not sure why I chose a favor for Mom for Nurse Betty. I think just because I heard a little about this movie. But I'm glad I did. "Nurse Betty" is an original and intelligent film with humor and a dark side. <br /> <br /> It was one of the first games of Rene before she became the main one in Hollywood. I understand why she is an incredible actress. In a scene where she finally realizes what happened, and she is on the set of her favorite soap opera, you can see pain, confusion, fear and embarrassment on her face. Just to show you a movie, she plays Betty. A shy and insecure woman who supports her abusive husband, she is a waitress and loves soap operas, especially the one in which some nice doctor, Dr. Dave Revell. When she accidentally sees the murder of her husband in a separate room, the murders that she notices are her two clients, Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. Then she just goes crazy and leaves the city after talking to the police and says she needs to find her former bride, Dr. Dave Revell. So, she travels across the country to California to find Dr. Revella, and wants to work as a nurse to work with Dave, she watched the show many times, anyway, she is simply amazing being a nurse when she rescues a woman’s brother. Despite the fact that everyone tells her that she is delirious, she just looks at them as if they are crazy. When she meets an actor who plays Dave Revella, George (his real name) thinks she’s just a crazy fan trying to get on the show. She just looks at him embarrassed and believes that he and she belong to each other. <br /> <br /> Rene was awesome, she was so believable that she lost her mind in the film. She has come a long way, and, whether you want to admit it or not, she is a delightful and excellent actress. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays one of the killers, Charlie, the father of both. He is so fascinated and amazed by Betty, and in pursuing her all over the country, he almost just falls in love with Betty to such an extent that he almost falls in love with her. He and his son Wesley must find Betty when they find out that she was there at the scene of the murder and could have betrayed their identity. When Charlie sees Betty and finally catches her, she first suffers from a scar, but calms down, and they know that they have a real connection. It was a beautifully played stage, my opinion is that Morgan was stronger. He's just great. <br /> <br /> An amazing performance by Chris Rock, son of Wesley. He is such a "gun" - just to do the work in a hurry and take care of the business. I liked his comedic performance at the end, when he and the gang he holds hostage at gunpoint just watch the soap opera together. Classical. "Nurse Betty" is a great film that I would advise to laugh and just in all good, honest, small film, which, I think, can please anyone. <br /> <br /> 9/10
