When the bicentennial was held, I was in Hershey, Pa., And was part of the skateboarding team in Middletown. We did nothing except skating, trying to find out what we read in the pages of Skateboarder magazine. Several local hills provided all the speed fluctuations you could handle. At that time, Mike Weed was a hot guy, along with Russ, what is his name, with Z-boys hot on his tail. I had a plastic GT board (GrenTech) with Power Paw urethane wheels (movable bearings). <br /> <br /> My parents told me that we were moving to California that same year, and that they went to the house, hunting. That summer I was a very good son and asked if I could be rewarded with a REAL California skateboard. They are delivered. It was a fiberglass deck with Surfer Magazine logo printed on it. Wide trucks and big red wheels (precise bearings, I don’t know). They got it on Oak Street, at a surf store on Laguna Beach. <br /> <br /> When I got to California (all 13), Anaheim had a “Concrete Wave”, and Carlsbad had a great park. Soon, the Odyssey Skateboard appeared in Mission Viejo. Indoor park with all possible scenarios. All this time I read about Stacy, Segu, Tony and Jay. This film was right on the money and a wonderful experience to watch.
