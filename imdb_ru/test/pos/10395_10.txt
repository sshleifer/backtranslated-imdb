I was stunned by this movie. Subsequently, I did not even want to watch any films for a long time - any other film would be so unsatisfactory by comparison. <br /> <br /> For many, this could be the worst of Antonioni — a very slow, not fascinating traditional storyline, microscopic examination of human emotions and interactions — and the worst of Wenders — verbose, intricate transcendentalism. It consists of short separate episodes connected by the stream of consciousness of a typical wandering hero Wenders, so he does not produce temporary oblivion in escapist cinema. <br /> <br /> But for fans, the worst is the best, and the Scattered storyline is a sketch of a single poetic image that stretches throughout the film. Wenders and Antonioni create discourse between their segments, which seeks the essence of things. <br /> <br />
