The surface is one of the best shows I've ever seen. NBC are so stupid that they cancel such a great show, and, even worse, leave it half full. NBC or someone else must give the Surface at least one more season so that it can be completed. As if NBC gave you a book to read, and halfway there they decided to take it from you, and then you will never know the ending. I just want to see what happens to everyone, and most importantly, see what happens to Him. I think I can safely say this about the majority of Surface fans that we want to save Nime! Nim took all our hearts, and then NBC just cut them in half. Come to NBC, just give the Surface another season!
