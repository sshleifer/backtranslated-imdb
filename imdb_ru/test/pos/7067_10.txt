I'm not American, but the Meatballs still really hit me. Maybe because it's a cute, cute movie. Watching him today again, I felt sentimentally for a while, when I couldn't figure it out, and a place that I can't remember. <br /> <br /> Meatballs are just a great movie. It reminds me of innocent days, when in fact nothing mattered and anything was possible. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this, you probably understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> All that I can say from above I have already said that meatballs should be even more nostalgic if you are American. <br /> <br /> I think you also understand what I mean.
