May contain spoilers <br /> <br /> This historical film was so refreshing. Although this may exaggerate real events, it reveals the heartless nature of Emperor Kui, whom he later dishonored. And there was not a single person generated by a computer. I think it's great that such an epic film was made in China. The costumes and furnishings were beautiful, the performances were also excellent. Dignity against death is the main theme in this film, and I think it reflects Chinese history and culture. I also liked the little hint of terracotta warriors, a 3d map cut from the conquest of China with individual soldiers. Emperor Kui, of course, was later buried in life-size terracotta warriors. <br /> <br /> I also liked the scene with the dwarf, he was a very interesting character, even if he had only a small scene. <Br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
