The story of how the (communist) leader who liberated Congo from imperialism of Belgium was destroyed by the Western powers through the hand of Mobutu. History of struggle and injustice, hope and search for freedom. The story can be a story of any African country. Very touching film with images full of symbolism and beauty. If you need to watch only one foreign film this year, watch this one.
