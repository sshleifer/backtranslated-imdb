The Twins Effect, which starred some of HK's most popular stars, provides one of the most enjoyable movie experiences ever made in HK. There is something for everyone, an action movie, a comedy, horrors, romance and a bit of drama. This film should not be taken too seriously, otherwise you would be disappointed, but if you leave your brain behind the door and just watch the movie for fun, you will definitely like it. <br /> Gorgeous special effects, great action films, cute twins, cool HK actors, funny movie! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone!
