I am new to games, but I would have started MUCH earlier if this movie were next! I caught him at Gen Con last year (the trip was made only for the benefit of my husband) and LOVED it! Even for a non-player player, as I was at the time, this is ridiculous and accessible - so much so that I finally softened and started to sit in the playgroup of my husband. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to distribute the plot details, but if you are a gamer, you MUST see this movie - and if not, you will have a great time despite yourself. Of course, there are “in” jokes, but the vast majority of films are accessible to everyone. <br /> <br /> My only complaints are: I would like them to be longer and to be available on DVD. Maybe soon? ...
