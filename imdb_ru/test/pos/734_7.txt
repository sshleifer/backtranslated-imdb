"Do not look in the basement" is actually a very clever and well-thought click of exploitation, which gets a bad reputation because of its poor quality and bad behavior. Of course, this is not a masterpiece by anybody’s standards, but it’s a very funny little B-film that can offer many and even many creepy scenes that will remain in your head. <br /> <br /> As I said, the acting could have been much better, but this is the case with most of the exploitation, so I can't complain. The story is smart and has some great plot twists that make you guess. I thought the blood was very fun too. Simply, there is something remarkable in the old grief films, because then they did not have computer graphics, so they had to customize everything. See it for a good time!
