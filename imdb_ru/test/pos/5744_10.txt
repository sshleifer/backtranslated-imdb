So, we will go, you, probably, read in the previous reviews of this film, that it is awful, badly played, avoid at any cost. Well, I suppose that in a certain sense it is true, it is fair to say that you could not write a spoiler in this comment, as there is no plot to spoil. However, there is a fine line between simple, terrible and absolutely ridiculous, and believe me, this film is the last. The acting is so bad, the plot is so unimportant, and the final is so confused that you will laugh until the end. In this film, there are scenes that take comedy to a new level. Do not expect the Oscar winner, but believe me, for the small price you pay for this disaster, it is worth every penny.
