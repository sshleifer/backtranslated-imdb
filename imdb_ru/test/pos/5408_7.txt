When I watched Imaginary Heroes, it occurred to me that any screenwriter trying to make a drama about family relationships should seriously consider killing one or two children in the opening, as a way to make their characters open up and open. There must be something in this storyline, because it seems that any other family drama that comes out of the pike uses this device in one form or another (Paradise and Moonlight are just two of the more recent examples which arise immediately). to mind, although it would be possible to return to the golden elder, like “Who is afraid of Virginia Woolf?” to make a point as well). The point is not that the death of a child is an illegitimate topic for serious films. Not at all. Just like any topic, it can be so overwhelmed that it becomes just another cliche of the film, a convenient piece of narration that allows you to spin the ball and give the heroes something to fight for the rest of the time when we get to spend with them . <br /> <br /> The last such work is Imaginary Heroes, a film that is largely borrowed from what is one of the earliest and possibly most well-known examples of the “family coping with the death of the children's“ genre ” , winner of the prize "Ordinary People". Like the characters in this earlier film, Travizy, at first glance, seems to be the perfect suburban family, until one fateful day their eldest son, Matt, who is an athlete of the "golden boy" and thus kills himself without an apple reasons (one minor difference is that the son in “Ordinary People” dies as a result of an accident, and not suicide). This is Matt's younger brother, Tim, who finds the body and takes on the role of the protagonist in the film. Each of the remaining family members in their own way cope with the tragedy. Matt, who always lived in the shadow of his older brother, is becoming increasingly alienated from his father, who has ignored him almost all his life and begins to resort to drugs for consolation. Ben, the father, is absorbed in a sense of remorse and guilt, turning away from his work and his family. His wife, Sandy, is the most difficult character in the film, a freedom-loving child of the 60s, who feels strangely drifting in the role of mother and wife, as she tolerates a mostly useless marriage in a sterile suburb. She spends most of her time after the tragedy, trying to reunite with her past when she smokes marijuana. <br /> <br /> As written and directed by Dan Harris, “Imaginary Heroes” appear as a wildly uneven film. For every scene that seems real and authentic, there is another one that seems arbitrary and unreliable. Sometimes there is a feeling that Harris would like to cram every possible life situation he could come up with in his script, perhaps a remarkable goal, but one that makes the film unnecessary melodramatic in the process. Instead of identifying ourselves with the characters and being dragged into their plight, we often think, “Well, come on, what next?” For teenagers, suicide is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hot topics covered in this film; The scenario also involves drug and alcohol abuse, physical abuse, sexual identity conflict, life-threatening illness, even occasional incestual gays. It is this “everything but the kitchen sink” mentality in the letter that deprives the film of most of the credibility it needs to really make us care. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that “Imaginary Heroes” is a bad or unprofitable film. Much of what he says about family relationships and values ​​in the 21st century is insightful, original, pointed, and deep. The main merit of this success belongs to the actors Emile Hirsch, Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels, who give sharp, sensitive actions in their respective roles. It is they who triumph over narrative surpluses to stimulate our brain and touch our hearts. In addition, Harris, in his direction, reaches effectively a melancholic tone, but is often amplified by some much-needed flashes of a bold dark comedy. <br /> <br /> “Imaginary heroes” may not seem focused and derivative at times, but his wonderful actions and subtle mood changes make him a movie worth seeing.
