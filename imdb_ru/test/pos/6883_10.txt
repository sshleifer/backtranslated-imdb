It's very simple that those who call this film something lower than “decent” do not know their cinema. “The Doll Master” creates a sense of fear and suspense, rarely seen in films outside of Asia. <br /> <br /> Think of a mixture of "manga" and "ring", combined into one, and this is the essence. <br /> <br /> First-class action, first-class direction, first-class sets and effects. <br /> <br /> This is the best of an Asian horror movie; Ringu, Dark Water and The Tale of Two Sisters. <br /> <br /> Absolutely necessary. <br /> <br /> Take it from a guy who knows his films.
