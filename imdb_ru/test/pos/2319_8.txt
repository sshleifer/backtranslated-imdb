The first few minutes of this movie do not do it right! For me, this is not funny, until they board the submarine, and these funny characters start to turn into a gel. I was born and raised in Norfolk, Va., And met my share of “different” sailors — I even married one! Most of my favorite films are just funny, not relevant, do not depend on sex or violence and are ridiculous every time I see them. Groundhog Day, Bruce Almighty and Down Periscope are still fun even after I know the dialogue by heart. Grammar Kelsey with his "God, I love this job!" Was sincere, sincere and sweet. Rob Schneider is hysterical, as the team is responsible for what he is annoying. I'm still amazed at the size of this fishing boat next to the submarine! I can understand why people who live this life will notice “aaaa”, but this is not a documentary, because this is a comedy, and I just love it!
