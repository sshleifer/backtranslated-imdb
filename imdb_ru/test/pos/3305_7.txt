This is an exciting female drama that men can enjoy. The plot tells about a young woman (Hope Lange), who after college goes to work in a publishing house. We can forgive her the transition from secretary to editor (hey, this is Hollywood) and several other shortcomings. Here is one of the few films in which producer Robert Evans (once beautifully depicting a rat with women) appears. It also features mature Joan Crawford and a terrific cast. Check this.
