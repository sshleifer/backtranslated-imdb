Well, what is wrong with the name “Separate lie” (in other places it is accused of not “exciting”). It is cunning, subtle and a little poetic. (Of course, there is a song by Phil Collins and a film about James Belushi called “Separate Lives” that are mentioned here.) <br /> <br /> But the real point of view is the ethical dilemmas of lies at different levels, film probes. Well, this is not a funny headline “in your face”, but then this is not a funny film in your face. Please give British films such a chance. They are trying to get people to think about important things, like here: how far you go to protect your life (even if it's a bit rotten) from an unexpected disaster. Maybe you're lying. Maybe you ignore the lies of your loved ones. This can tire many people. <br /> <br /> There are many American films on this subject, but they usually go much further, using firearms, which are not part of everyday life here in Europe. <br /> <br /> We may not be so “exciting” here, but we don’t expect film titles in the style of slogans for films that are not aimed at the general public.
