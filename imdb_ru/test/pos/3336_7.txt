This record is better than the average in the “Saint” series - it interests you and, as it should be, makes you guess to the end and has several suspects to choose from. <br /> <br /> Many films from the Golden Age are not for every taste, especially for young viewers. They have dates for clothes, cars, settings, etc. Who asks for a highball today? Or wear a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was much simpler - it must have been, then there was a shortage of lawyers. Honestly, in those days a lot is missing. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it anyway. It is good - in the old-fashioned sense.
