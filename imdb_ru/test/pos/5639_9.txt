Okay, so I'm a fan of a good documentary, especially where he tells the modern story of Don Quixote. Caution: I met Mark Borchardt in the winter of 1995/96, when he was still working on the Coven. But I will save this story for later. The American film, which began production shortly afterwards, accurately depicts a person I knew, although in more depth than I expected or believed existed. This is both a very funny and very sad film, and it is brilliantly executed. Mark seems to be his worst enemy: his childhood ambitions and optimism, which I admire, are undermined by his obvious artistic ineptitude, as well as his strange financial expectations. But he is also a charismatic guy. His loyal assistant Sancho Panza is equally cute: loyal, if exhausted, to the depths of the soul. Like Don Quixote, American film represents the often neglected, ineffective aspect of freedom — people will strive for professions that they don’t particularly approach, regardless of repeated setbacks. This is a great movie.
