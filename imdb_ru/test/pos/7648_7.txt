I really did not know what to expect from this film, and was pleasantly surprised. I picked it up because I recently stumbled upon Norman Reedus and am trying to find more films in which he starred. <br /> <br /> I'm not too keen on movies and fraud, but I have to say, This struck me in a few minutes. Probably because I could not quit in order to understand exactly who was pushing whom. This film is stylish and fast, with a story that is believable thanks to location and fantastic performances. <br /> <br /> Although most of them impressed me, I must say that Dagmar Dominchik was just gorgeous. <br /> Give him a chance - this is a really funny movie.
