This is a movie that will surely decorate your day. Kermit the Frog, just an ordinary frog in his swamp, when the talent agent stops and tells him that Hollywood is looking for frogs to be in the movies (laughs). On the way, Kermit meets Fozzy the Bear, Miss Piggy, Gonzo and his chicken Camille, Rawlf, Electric Mayhem, Bunsen Hondiu and Glass. But, in addition, Kermit is the owner of the Doc Hoppers French Fried Frog Legs restaurant chain. However, all things considered, Kermit and the dolls end up in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This film is recommended for everyone, young and old. <br /> <br /> There are some great musical numbers in it, for example, “Rainbow Communication”, “I am going to return there sometime” and “Moving Forward.” In this film, the dolls also use different types of transport. Kermit drives on a bike, Fozzy drives a studebaker and another car, Gonzo flies with a pack of helium balloons (this is, by the way, one of my favorite moments;)), and Kermit and the rest of the dolls finally pass the rest of the way on the Electric Mayhem bus Floyd, Janice, Scooter and the Beast), who meet them in the desert after how Fozzy's car breaks down. <br /> <br /> Even some Sesame Street dolls appear in cameo (for example, the Big Bird is on the way), on the way to New York to get into public television.) The end is also very a touching moment. Each created Muppe is in the final scene, alo And finally, with the last reprise of "Rainbow Connection". <br /> <br /> But these poor dolls worked so hard on their own film that everything collapsed and the camera exploded in a huge ball of sparks. You might think that everything is destroyed and destroyed, but a rainbow shines through the roof at the end, and all this sums up the magic of this film, and you know that everything will be fine. <br /> <br /> Perfect 10/10. Watch it and you will be fascinated by the fun and sadness of this film.
