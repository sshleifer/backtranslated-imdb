"Tagetes" - certainly the best "outsider" view of Bollywood, which I have ever seen. (I did not grow up in Bollywood, but I saw a few hundred of them now.) I would say that Gurinder Chadha, Mira Nair and even “Merchant and Ivory” (from Bombay Radio) almost remained in the dust. Willard Carroll, the director, really loves Bollywood, and he has self-confidence so that we can know this - there is humor, but there is no arch, ironic removal, no, of course, I did not mean that. As Jerry Lee Lewis would say, he “gets it,” and therefore he can allow us to have it too - the joy of a Bollywood film, as well as the touch that a Western person gives when he enters the role of narrator. <Br /> <br /> This is a story about a biting, bitchy, beautiful American actress from the movie “B” (she starred in films with only numbers in the title, for example, “Fatal Attraction 3”), which turned out to be in another Bollywood movie from the one she took to India (Kama Sutra 3 laid down her tents while she was on the road, apparently because her producers are now in prison). Salman Khan, in real life a Bollywood mega-mega-star, is a dance master of a delightful film written on the fly that she is now involved in (“is it before or after I go blind?”), And through the sweetness of his slightly mentally gifted character, she learns more than to find her inner ecstatic dancing ability. <br /> <br /> A strong beginning gives you both Bollywood - a super-energetic troupe of dancers in front of the Taj Mahal (both funny familiar to western audiences and having a high-speed musical thrill that we love in the Hindi movie) and Salman on the screen with the very beginning - 20 minutes of Bollywood are not waiting for the hero. He wears an Indian costume, decorated with a fringe of Western movies in the style of Keith Carson (all in white). <br /> <br /> The character of actress Ali Larter pleases the western viewer - she is blonde, who is “traditional” for a “white” man in a Bollywood film and visually understandable cast - but she is a strong girl, and not an impartial looking blonde, with whom we usually go, and she is more or less a three-dimensional full bitch, who behaves in a defamatory and insulting way, talking on a cell phone with a guy and an agent in the USA. <br /> <br /> We also have scenes when women have problems with each other, they go to a bar to deal with them - people's ability to not get socializing and emotional talking is a traditional phenomenon in Hindi movies, but we rarely see anything happening between women (other than the discussion between the mother and daughter about the choice of the groom's daughter), not to mention the "strangers" - not connected people - not to mention the bars. So the spirit is the same, the details are fresh, and I was delighted with this. <br /> <br /> I saw it only once, at a preview in which the director, a wonderful speaker and questionnaire were present. The defendant - he and Salman became "fraternal" good friends during his creation, he loves India, he has plans to make the film "The Wizard of Oz" in India. I can't get too detailed information about the songs when I saw them only once, except that I liked them all. They range from a happy parody of Bollywood numbers in the film “in the film” - women's costumes with leggorn hats and bodices to sea shells (this is a beach scene) on flowing dresses — cost a ticket alone — to a beautiful, multi-colored romantic song serious part of the film. <br /> <br /> A combination of Hindi and English in music, and it works. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan receives a lot of thanks from me for being open to unusual projects - this is also Jaan-e-Mann - and a good judgment about which ones will be. Carroll said that he was full of proposals and ideas all along the way, and completely normal (that is, not at all narcissistic), regardless of whether Carroll accepted or rejected them - clearly just a professional who likes to be involved and collaborate.
