Morris and Reva Appelbaum were Broadway toast in its prime. At ninety, Morris is a widower. He calls his sons - a psychotherapist and a BMW auto dealer - and his daughter, a television writer / producer, to attend a party in his honor, after which he himself will undergo euthanasia. Creatures are literally thinking that they, they take what he says at face value. He leads them, his grandchildren, and several others, including an Afro-American-Jewish psychiatrist reminiscent of Godfrey Cambridge, in a merry chase through Manhattan when they try to stop him or dissuade him. <br /> <br /> The comedy fully works. The performances are great. Peter Falk is in great shape. This film not only deserves the audience, but is also popular.
