“Blind Date” is one of three stories created by the author Vida Hearst. Many familiar faces in this old-fashioned 1934 film. Mickey Rooney in the role of a little fat punk. He seems to be in the film for comedy and home "family values." Jane Darwell plays a strong-willed mother again, just as she played in the film "The Grapes of Wrath" and "Oxbow Incident." Ann Sauterne is Kitty, who meets Bill (Paul Kelly), but meets the rich Bob Hartwell, played by Neil Hamilton, who may or may not be better for her. Of course, you can say that it was done at the very beginning of the Hays production code - one day Kitty says that she cannot be there alone with him if there is no one in the house ... what to change from one or two years to when everything and everything was fine. Good solid story, but a lot of talk and tender love talk. There is a question that a girl should look for in a man; Should she seek an honest man who treats her well, or just find a man with a lot of money, as most films have promoted over the previous 20 years ...? and how do men change when their situation changes? Beware of violence in the strange scene of a dance marathon. 1960s TV viewers will recognize Commissioner Gordon from the Batman in Hamilton. In addition, a strange drama for some actors was shot in the off-screen film - Paul Kelly went to prison for complicity in the murder of a love triangle. Mickey Rooney had an affair with Norma Shearer, who was 20 years older; Rooney was married eight times. Tyler Brooke (Emory) and Spencer Charters (Pa) are confused in real life. The title Blind Date has been reused for movies, TV shows, and even cartoons, but none of them seem to have the same plot as this one.
