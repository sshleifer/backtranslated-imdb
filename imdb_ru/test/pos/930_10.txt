Valentina, a model in France, is separated from her lover, who is abroad, they plan to meet in England, but it seems that as the film progresses, they are moving further away. One night, refusing a pass made by her colleague, she beats a dog named Rita. The dog survives, and it returns it to its owner, a hostile retired judge who lives as a hermit and eavesdropping, listening to the conversations of all his neighbors. She is intrigued by the nature of this person and often visits him, often becoming part of his listening games. Nevertheless, one conversation that the two listen to is extremely important, a conversation between a young man who will soon become a judge, and his wife, who, as we find out, corresponds to the life of a person who overhears them. When we learn more about the couple, the man tells more about his story, then continues his story, and we will find out whether the two men will continue to go to the same fate. Valentina knows little how her life, this meeting and the fate of the young judge will be confused together. Her blow to the dog that day seemed destiny, the dog's divine sacrifice for its owner, allowing Valentine to be the savior of a young judge who follows the same path as her dear friend to prevent him from having such a gloomy future filled with solitude and solitude. It seems that the old manâ€™s dream will come true, and he can sleep with a smile on his face for the rest of his days. <br /> <br /> AMAZING finale, perhaps the BEST trilogy of all time! Kislovsky never ceases to amaze me. He is one of my favorite directors and one of the most talented directors in film history. His use of the colors of the French flag in the three films was incredible, every shot, every scene was a work of art. Three of the most visually appealing films I've ever seen. And his subtle connections between the three films are amazing. Usually indicated by a small pause or late focus in the scene, see if you can notice it. I have to mention this, and this is a huge SPOILER, I liked the final, as all the characters of the three films were still alive after the ferry accident, when Valentine and the young judge were together, and the old man was watching her TV, strengthening his happiness over suffering, with which he dealt for those many years. I couldn't come up with a better way to finish the movie, but a smile on my face is a great way to complete the amazing movie and trilogy! I recommend this for ALL who love movies, movies, whatever ... Artwork! 10 out of 10 for the film and the trilogy.
