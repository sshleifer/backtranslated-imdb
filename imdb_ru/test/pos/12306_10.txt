John Houston made many wonderful and memorable films. Most often and easily recalled were released long before his death in 1987. However, this year reminded us that Houston was still at the top of his game, as evidenced by his faithful adaptation of the famous story by James Joyce “The Dead”. "<br /> <br /> Once upon a time, a very wise man by the name of Doc asked me:" Doesn't the "Dead" seem surprisingly brighter and brighter than any other story in Dublin? "I tend to think that this Both in the story and in the film there are some comments and criticisms of Joyce, but for the most part they paint a warm and loving portrait of Ireland itself, which Joyce so often insulted and soon left. <br /> <br /> Houston’s work with the protagonist Gabriel Conroy, who realizes that the world is nothing but an illusion, is simply wonderful. to assert that there is no plot in the film is to miss the point. As with any of Dublin Joyce, the plot - although most likely present is not the center. Little dialogue for the director. Houston's ability to translate what Joyce puts into words in visual effects is quite possibly the greatest triumph of the film. Feelings, thoughts ... Gabriel's discomfort while dancing ... all these intangible assets come alive and come to the attention of the viewer in the image of Houston. <br /> <br /> To say that Houston has softened public criticism from its writer is again not true. While the “Dead” can be colored with a cheerful shade, the complacency and pretense of the film’s characters is just a comment on society on a smaller scale: we are old aunts; embarrassing drunk; tenor with sore throat; a wife with a sad, rain-soaked secret; even a self-styled middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> But the “Dead” do not believe their name. This is not a dark story. Nor is it so cold. Forget for a moment the snow falling on the living and the dead, and the innate symbolism in it; Forget about the ruins of life, to which Gabriel wakes up at the end of the film: only with the destruction of Gabriel's illusions about himself and his world, can he really go forward. This is the focal point of the movie. Such is the central point of our life.
