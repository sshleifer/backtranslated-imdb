Biodock about a mysterious singer / composer who, according to friends, has spent the last 15 years of his relatively short life, apparently on a self-destruct mission. He died at the age of 52 years, overweight and scattered from cardiovascular diseases, after a long rampage of practically nonstop self-indulgence with alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and cocaine, noisy parties and outrageous abuse of his voice instrument (he confessed to a friend that he shouted his lyrics one performance with such force that blood splashes remained on the microphone). <br /> <br /> All this, despite the fact that he: (1) is considered the most gifted pop singing abilities of his generation; (2) successful, after many years of effort, in terms of industrial recognition - Grammy, Oscar, a decent recording contract with a top label and at least two star albums - 'Nilsson Schmilsson' (originals) and 'A Little Touch Schmilsson in the night "(standards); and (3) married very happily (for the third time), with a lovely young family, whom he seemed to adore archived video recordings and many photographs of Nilsson; editors work particularly well in moving shots. We learn about his close ties with John Lennon, and then with Ringo Starr (Lennon often said that Nilsson was his favorite American musician). <br /> <br /> Speaking heads are often more impressive, often the weakest aspect of a documentary. Here we meet people like Perry Botkin Jr., Ray Cooper, Mickey Dolenc, Terry Gilliam, Mark Hudson, Eric Idle, Rick Jarrard, Randy Newman, Van Dyke Parks, Jimmy Webb and Robin Williams who tell amazing stories about Nilsson? ? many ridiculously ridiculous, others deeply pretentious - and all express their deep affection for him. No less informative and touching interviews with the wives of Nilsson? Annie and Una, his son Zach and cousin Doug Hofer. The best set of heads that I can remember in a biopic. <br /> <br /> The most glaring lack of a film is that it supplants Nilsson's music. Even the execution of his greatest hit "Without You" ends after about 8 bars. Arrrrgh !! There is no excuse for this, except that the film lasts a full two hours. Lose a few shots to the head, and we could hear at least that song to the end, and maybe another one or two, like, for example, “One,” or his Oscar-winning “Everybody's Talking”. "The filmmakers are just too interested in understanding the psychological behavior of Nilsson." Mysterious and insufficiently attentive to his music. My ratings: 7.5 / 10 (low B +) (When viewed in the NWFC's Reel Music series, 01/07/07)
