I saw this film through one of the actors' agents, and it certainly corresponds to many things that come from Sth. Australia in terms of the general * tone *, which is fairly dark and capricious. <br /> <br /> I thought the little boy in the film was superb. Mostly child actors * are scared * and confused, but not in this case. He was really very good. From the point of view of the “surrealism” mentioned by the jingo, I just think that this film is just “strange”. This is a real strange film, with strange locations, plot, strange things happening all the time. But "good" is strange, not "bad." <br /> <br /> It’s hard to come up with other films like this, but not at all like CARS ATE Paris, maybe more like REPULSION, but actually I think it’s more like a Hummer film from the 60s. Behind him, of course, is an interesting mind. <br /> <br /> JINGO, I also have a question about the title. Why modern love? Anyone? Besides the jingo, what did you mean by the "God of the Forsaken" when you spoke about Australia, mmm? Just curious
