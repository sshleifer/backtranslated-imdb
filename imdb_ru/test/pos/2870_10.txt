Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this burnt old hotel, where eight teenagers are sent for cleaning. Most of them die, except for 3 of them. In my case it was not the best or best essay. I still thought the murder scenes were really well done. For example, when one girl ate hungry dogs. Best of all was when he put the phone in the mouth of the blonde. Kane was a really great actor in horror films, he watched the whole movie seriously, and he will never change. This was his only look at the entire film. Great action and kill scenes, I don't think I can give him a full 10 out of 10, but 6 seems good.
