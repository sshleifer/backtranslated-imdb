“Test Freedom” was one of the first films I saw in my childhood. It was also one of the first VHS tapes I owned. I have not seen the movie for years, so yesterday I decided to insert a tape and watch it. Wow. This story is as strong as the first time I saw it. I think that now that I’m older, I can better appreciate the values ​​inherent in the film. (Self-confidence, the value of freedom and love of nature) This is a film “B”, to be sure, but this is a film that you will remember for years, especially if you see it in childhood.
