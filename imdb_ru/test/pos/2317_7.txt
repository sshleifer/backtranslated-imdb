This film is about a bunch of losers who should be assigned to a task that is expected to fail. Failures rally to successfully complete their mission. <br /> <br /> Fun comes. <br /> <br /> Similar to the Police Academy films, humor comes from strange characters on the ship. I thought it was a fascinating film, and I would stop watching it anytime on TV. No, it does not make you think about your relative role in space or inspire you to do great things to serve humanity, but this is quite fun entertainment for more than 90 minutes. Plus, Lauren Holly looks hot in a marine form.
