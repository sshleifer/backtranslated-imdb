My second favorite film of 1970 (after Five Easy Pieces) was completely rejected by many idiots, who caused a slice of seductive audience. Peter Boyle, a well-known liberal, is incredibly hardworking, he has problems with the younger generation. He is a frightening dude, but he has a great imagination and he is very funny. I was a teenage liberal when it was released, but no matter how awful Joe seemed to me, he also infuriated me! Susan Sarandon, in her first role, is beautiful and mixed with a rich stone fox. Queens dinner is fun and insightful for all participants. <br /> <br /> This film was NOT exploitative, and the script (which was nominated for an Oscar) was to win this year. The director simply did not spend enough money to earn trust in Hollywood. Regardless of your political persecution, then and now you will like someone in this film. Specified 9 out of 10. This is on DVD and video. Check this!
