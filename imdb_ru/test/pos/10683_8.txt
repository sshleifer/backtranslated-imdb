Fans of Jerry Anderson’s productions will recognize a few actors and UFO techniques (which were made after Doppelginger), as well as sound effects from various Anderson series. Barry Gray's superb music (mostly unique to this film) adds a sense of familiarity. For these reasons alone, I think that any fan of Jerry Anderson will find Doppelgänger worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Judging just like a movie, I must say that Doppelgänger is flawed. It is known that in the production process there were serious problems, and I suspect that this is why there is a labor-intensive story flow that suddenly ends and seems to have nothing to do with the rest of the story. Presumably, time / budget constraints did not allow relevance to appear! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the special effects range from incredibly good — better than any 1960s film I know — to disappointingly bad ones. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, even despite these shortcomings, the main story of the Doppelganger is well told and supports the viewer (or at least this viewer) in everything. The end is probably not at all what you can expect from Anderson, but at the same time it is typical for Anderson and is certainly appropriate. To understand what I mean, you have to see it for yourself. :)
