Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom that brought the instrument / or channel that opened the young minds of Black Culture. Focus and perspectives were a positive message for our people and hope for change. I advise this choice for every American family to experience struggle and reward. The show has never been given the opportunity to embody the idea that middle-class negroes become business owners. This problem was so compatible with the real life situation that it affected the lives of many people. I sincerely hope that the entire volume can be restored and put on a DVD for Americans so that they can enjoy their families. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
