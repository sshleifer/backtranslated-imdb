The real case of the innocent leader of the first nations (Indian) from a city official from Winnipeg (cowboy) lies at the heart of this television film. The actual case caused his fair share of racial tensions in Canada, the small-scale thing of Martin Luther King. The injustice of the people of the first nations becomes central to the Canadian diet film. What makes this film worthy of attention is the attention to the reaction of the family. The father, played by Gordon Tootoz, demands forgiveness, and the brother, played by Eric Schwaig, demands justice. Stars Gordon Tootoz and Adam Beach (WINDTALKERS, SKINWALKERS) have minor, almost cameo, appearances. Soon, future star Eric Schweig made a big impression in this film with a powerful performance. The commendation goes to veteran actor Gary Choku, who has recorded over 100 films. His portrayal of the restless soul of Inspector Dawson was worthy of the Gemini Award (Canadian Emmy) along with Eric Schwaig. Special effects (sudden jumps, sequences of dreams) are random and not powerful. Combine this with some of the beautiful landscapes of northern Canada and recent events involving police and First Nations people, such as the Neil Stonechild affair, and you will have a very useful and relevant viewing experience.
