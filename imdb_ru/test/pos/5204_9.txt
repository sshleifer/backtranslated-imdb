I just recently saw this film in the hope of seeing an exact depiction of the bloodiest battle of the 20th century. I got what I expected and more. Just to think that I came across this film by luck, before I even heard about it. This is a German film, filmed in 1993, so I would not be surprised that it is almost completely unknown to modern American audiences. This is a shame, because this is a truly wonderful film, I dare say that it is good, if not better, than Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now and Everything Is Quiet on the Western Front; all of which are iconic war movies. <br /> <br /> 1942: World War II is in full swing. Nazi Germany seized continental Europe and parts of North Africa, then Adolf Hitler ordered a full-scale invasion of the Soviet Union. The fatal movement that ultimately dooms Nazi Germany to defeat. In the early stages, the invasion goes well, and the German armies conquer large areas of Soviet territory, but the critical battle begins at Stalingrad, a city that is of great symbolic and strategic importance. The battle soon turns into a bloodbath of epic proportions, a nightmare for battling German and Russian soldiers. On the threshold of the capture of the city, the Germans suddenly counterattacked the Russians, who ended up cutting off the entire German 6th Army in Stalingrad. Worse, the Russian winter is coming, which brings immense suffering to the Germans. This whole battle is visible through the eyes of several young German soldiers fighting for survival not only against Russians and harsh winter conditions, but also against their own sadistic officers who care only about medals and fame, and generals who care little about ordinary infantrymen. <br /> <br /> This film will haunt me for a while. The German soldiers, on whom the film concentrates, are so young and naive that they lose their humanity and sanity, and you really feel sorry for them because they are not often depicted in the film by the demonic Nazis. Everything they fought for is no longer important, and everything they believed was broken, and after a fierce battle with the Russians at Stalingrad, we see that they deteriorate further with the onset of winter, causing many to freeze. The scenes of “Battle and Winter” looked like a terrible nightmare, but it also seemed so real. It is surprising that in the beginning we see young people in their prime, and in the end they expose their old shells. After these people witnessed so much bloodshed, they lost the desire to live on, it was really sad. When finally there comes a moment of hope, they are betrayed by Hitler, who ultimately betrays these people to a horrible death, which is another of Hitler’s crimes, as a result of which the people who fought for him were killed by the Russians. <br /> <br /> A good anti-war film tells about the horrors of war, and that is exactly what this film does. The battle for the tractor plant series is the closest thing that goes to hell on earth, but in fact it was the battle for Stalingrad. German and Russian soldiers were depicted with humanity, only bad apples (especially on the German side) were doomed to defeat. The bottom line is that this film is amazing because we see people getting frustrated physically and emotionally during the war. We all have our limits, and these people were driven far beyond them in the most deadly battle of our time. What the average infantryman endured at Stalingrad was beyond imagination. Even if they experienced everything they saw and did, it could traumatize them for a lifetime. <br /> <br /> Stalingrad shows us why war is hell and exactly how hell looks.
