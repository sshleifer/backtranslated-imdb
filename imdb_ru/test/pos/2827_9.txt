Best Robot Romantic Comedy Ever using robots as romantic characters, which excludes Short Circuit from this category. It was the best effort of Andy Kaufman. Bernadette Peters demonstrates its versatility here with amazing performance. Despite the fact that the film is not very good in many areas, I awarded him 9 points and resourcefulness.
