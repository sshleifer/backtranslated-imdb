If you think that piano teacher Eric Kohut (Isabel Happert) in Michael Haneke’s movie "LA PIANISTE" is the ultimate personification of insanity, perversion and darkness, I have news for you: piano teacher in the novel Elfriede Jellinek "LA" "PIANIST "(On which the film was based) doubled" repulsive "," disgusting "," abnormal "and even more fascinating - although there can not be words sufficient to translate the level of artistic mastery that Isabelle Huppert achieved here, above all, other mortal actresses in activities Today. And who else could have played this character with such emotional power, combined with the best piano / dubbing performance that an actor could play? <br /> <br /> In the novel, as in the film, there are two big opponents of the heroine “Kohut”: her own mother (wonderful, voiced by Annie Girardot, in the part originally intended for Jeanne Moreau) and Austria itself. Mother personifies Yelinek's perception of his native Austria as a country that deceptively and perversely encourages racist / fascist (or, at least, authoritarian) behavior, sexual and emotional repression and, say, übermensch ideals that cannot be preserved without mental disorder today. <br /> <br /> "La Pi Aniste "also deals with a very powerful and sensitive question: how dangerous is it to disclose your most intimate fantasies to someone you think (you think). We tend to think that our own sexual fantasies should be as exciting to others as we are themselves, which can be a huge, embarrassing and sometimes tragic mistake. Here Kohut learns (?) the lesson in the most painful and humiliating way. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that Elfriede Jellinek is one of the most famous and recognized authors in Austria and Europe (well, now she won the Nobel Prize!) and these autobiographical passages can be derived in her novel, since she herself was a pianist and reportedly had a difficult relationship with her mother. The novel also includes long passages about Kohut’s childhood and adolescence, so that you somehow understand how she turned into who she is now. Haneke decided to hide this information in the film, making us wonder how she did it (don't we all know Erica Kohut there?). But he retains the structure of the book in his film very much: intolerable honesty, right up to the moment when the most secretive, “terrible” feelings arise painfully - envy, cruelty, violence, jealousy, hatred, suffering, sadism, masochism, selfishness, perversion and etc. All of them are unmistakably human. <br /> <br /> I thought that “The Pianist” is a deeply touching film, very exciting and thought-provoking, with a few unforgettable scenes, and this is all I ask about films. It also made me buy and be delighted with the book, find a fantastic author, whom I had not read before, and again and again listen to Schubert - so I thank Haneck, Jelinek and Isabel !!! On the other hand, if you are looking for light entertainment, please stay away. My vote: 9 out of 10
