Before I continue the new millennium, I will once again return in time, because I completely forgot about these precious stones !!!!! <br /> <br /> In 1987, Disney, although it remained a “weak” company in the 1980s, was able to launch a television series of films on television called “Not quite a man” about a challenging teenager, who, like in Inspector Gadget "Looks like a man, but actually a robot! Now this SCREAMS 80S, along with other films, such as “Tron” and “Darling, I squeezed the children”, because it combines all past years with the technologies of tomorrow !!!!! <br /> <br /> My parents remember seeing it on TV when I was just born or something like that. However, my very first meeting with this film was on the channel “Old Disney” (I once saw this and other parts on my 12th day of May 99th year !!!!!) <br /> <br / > “Not really a man” is a very good series of films to watch, if you can ever find these films again. <br /> <br /> Has it been shown recently? If yes, give me an email or a personal message. <br /> <br /> 10/10
