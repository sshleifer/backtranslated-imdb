This is a plot film and very interesting. Nothing striking or original in the plot, but most importantly, it moves at a great pace and therefore keeps your attention. I really did not notice the acting game, which, I think, is a good thing. John Mills was all right, but he seemed to take everything with his steps, considering how his life was falling apart around him. He will fall on his head, rise in 20 seconds, shake off and continue as if nothing had happened. Minor chatter in the film with a strong history, authentic locations and storyline, which constantly makes you guess until its completion.
