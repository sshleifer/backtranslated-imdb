I think this is a movie that you either love or hate, and I really am not one of those who are fond of feature films. My mom rented "Mullhuland DR" last night, and I almost ran out of the room, ha. But I like this movie. <br /> <br /> We recorded "The Beat" one evening when we just released a tape and accidentally got a great movie. Saved this tape and watched a lot. In the end I got a VHS to add to my collection. I watched it many times and once copied the verses. I even tried to prepare one scene for a school drama lesson. She said that we can do any scene we want and just cut out the bad words. She refused to let me do this. If this can upset my drama teacher, then it should be good :) Honestly, she never treated me the same after that. <br /> <br /> I liked the game, it came out very truthful and honest. It was not clean and polished, but it was better than that. It was true to life, how everyone would behave truly and show emotions, not Hollywood. It was a great game, especially with Rex. <br /> <br /> The story was original. Not only the characters are drawn into his world, but you too. Not your typical person meets children inside the city and generally saves them through the film of knowledge. Just care and friendship make things a little better. <br /> <br /> The only thing was that even in the 1980s there was more violence with the use of firearms and less simple things like throwing stones, but this little innocence did not harm it. film. <br /> <br /> I think this is a must see. you will either love or hate, but in any case it will have an impact, and it will create a good film, which you will remember and which we will talk about later.
