Others commented on a few strange video arrangements. I think they tried to capture what you would watch when you see a live performance. Legs, faces, general appearance. Unfortunately, this is a bit lacking. But, having said this, it is still pleasant to watch Colin Dunn. This is an interesting contrast with Michael Flatley in the original video. The progress of the show is obvious, the changes from the original Dublin products are obvious. <br /> <br /> “Trading touches”, in my opinion, are the highlight of the video. Tarik Winston is incredible, as is his playmate. <br /> <br /> I think the sound in this version was better than in the original video (1995). Dolby 5.1 on DVD is great. <br /> <br /> Despite incorrect videography, it is mandatory for Riverdance fans.
