When in the middle of last year they showed dirty dances on TV, I was not there, and I did not see them, my mother swore that I saw them and had something on the tape. Anyway, she couldn't find her video, so at Christmas I bought her a DVD, well, she did not watch it. He sat around for a while, one night I decided to take him upstairs to look, and I fell in love with him. This is a great movie with lots of beautiful scenes! I love the plot and enjoy every moment! This is definitely not for everyone, but if you love a love story, you will want to watch Dirty Dancing again and again! Dirty dancing is the way of love!
