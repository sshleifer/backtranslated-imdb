It's a mystery to me why I didn't catch up with this masterful film of the 50s? still pondering, but I, of course, am pleased to report that this did not disappoint. I have not seen one of the American films of Jules Dassin for several years, but based on this, I will most likely come back and look again at Brute Force and Night in the Big City. <br /> <br /> Jean Servé, a name unknown to me, but a rather familiar face due to his tiredness and coldness, recently completed a long stay in prison, as in these films (hey, otherwise there would be no history) does not cope with direct by life. It is possible: an easy robbery of a multi-million-dollar gem, which can be done at night without fear of discovery by several people. Close shooting of the robbery, half an hour of complete silence, this is what people remember most about the film, of course, and this is really wonderful; but I liked the incomplete location of the final shootout, when the robbery burned down due to the large mouth of one of the thieves; excellent image of the sandy sides of Paris in black and white; and the transmissions of Serviam Eddie Constantin and Humphrey Bogart in his free, but brutal performance. <br /> <br /> It may be too sentimental in the end, but this is one of those classics who truly fit her reputation as pure entertainment, even if what he says about a person’s condition is not very deep or thought-provoking. ; Modernist, romantic and jazz points of George Aurick - another highlight.
