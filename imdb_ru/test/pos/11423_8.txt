Stan as a bullfighter, and a good, quite a surprise. This clouded short film, clouded by Oliver Hardy, allows him to take the lead and be the center of attention. <br /> <br /> One can only conclude that his character “Rhubarb Vasilino” was a parody of many of Rudolf Valentino’s films of this era. <br /> <br /> Get ready to laugh at some of the dialogs and watch out for special effects. <br /> <br /> I watched this on DVD in volume. 1 & 2 collection.
