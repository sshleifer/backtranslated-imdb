Late on BBC1 I went to bed, but curiosity flared up in a modern Irish film, so I stayed to watch for a few minutes, and then I stayed until the end. I have to admit that the main attraction was the only English actress, Kelly Reilly, who is amazing to look at. <br /> <br /> This is announced as a black comedy, which is one of the most difficult things to shoot, It must be the perfect combination of horror and terrible laughter, so that, after all, you do not understand why you are laughing - for Me “After Hours” by Martin Scorsese (1985) is the best example. “Dead bodies” are more black than comedies, but the plot thunders and descends down to further darkness. I did not notice the last twists and turns in the story, as some other posters did, so I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> As a snapshot of the Irish film industry in 2003, it all looks pretty dignified; they did not seem to have spent too much on it, so he had a chance to get his money back. The scenario could have been much sharper, but overall the game was pretty good. I am glad that I looked at it, the flaws and all that, although I don’t think I learned a lot about Ireland today, especially their policing methods!
