I have just read what I consider to be the analysis of this lyrical Irish. Nice to read. <br /> <br /> However, a brief analysis of this film is that it is an interweaving of the seven deadly sins with four types of justice. <br /> <br /> Envy, greed, pride, laziness, anger, etc., and justice in the form of punitive, distributing, blind and divine. <br /> <br /> I could demonstrate three examples of each, one for each of the three main characters; however, it is much more interesting to mark them for yourself. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Don't miss.
