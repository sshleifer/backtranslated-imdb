What can I say about this film, which has not been said hundreds of times before? This is an American classic. This spawned dozens of imitators. Or not. Midnight Madness is one of a kind. From ridiculous initial montage / music to Bonaventure HOtel, I was hooked. Leon made us all feel so young and carefree. One question, however, how did he have these two hot prostitutes with him all the time? And how was the time / money to arrange such an event? The cast is top notch. David Naughton is at his best here. His tight yellow sweatshirt is troubling. His younger brother Michael J. Fox (in his first leading role) is a real child. There is also the love interest of Nothon, the jerk and the obligatory black dude in the hat of the fisherman in the yellow team. Michael J. Fox commits bad deeds, for example, trying to steal a cup of beer at the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery and flees into the Flounder van. Team Flounder gives us the most comedy. What exactly is happening with the blond in this team? Is she dating Flounder? Or melio? Or the blade? Yes, the Mexican gentleman is called Blade. The other guy from the Flounder team has the best lines of the film, I won't be faking them here. The Meat Machine team is a group of drunkards. My personal favorite is the armpit. But the silent black is great too. The other two teams are 4 nerds and 4 lesbians (two of which are 450 pounds twins). <br /> <br /> You know the final right from the start. But it does not matter. This is the best genre of the 80s. Do not hand over, buy. and buy it now.
