You can't watch a movie like Peter Watkins's Privilege, the story of how big business, the state, and even organized religion exploit a pop artist without thinking of creatively degenerate products like Michael Jackson or Britney Spears who sell corporate giants like Pepsi or some other poison for money. Or any number of artists in music or movies who become instruments of political parties or commercial religious interests, such as Scientology and Kabbalah. A film like Privileges was supposed to be almost science fiction when it came out in 1967, so fantastic was its premise. Today, we tend to take celebrity endorsements for granted, without thinking about its more disturbing consequences. The vision of Watkins not only became a reality, we silently accept this reality as "normal." <br /> <br /> Now consider the Park of punishments. As the privilege challenges the viewer to find out what is being sold to us and why, Park of Punishments requires us to consider what is taken from us and why. <br /> <br /> Heaven helps America and the world if modern politicians get their hands on this film. This is so close to reality that with a recent viewing I experienced a genuine nauseous feeling of anxiety. <br /> <br /> Watkins once again skillfully uses documentary narrative. While in the Privilege some rough edges of this technique were obvious, in the Park of punishments it was perfected. A sense of realism is enhanced by disarmingly unpretentious, economical, believable images of the entire cast. This is the type of acting behavior in which Hollywood has completely turned away to the detriment of cosmetically perfect images. The actors have first-class material to work in the Watkins script. <br /> <br /> Many visionary filmmakers tried to save the viewer from a smug false sense of security. No one has ever achieved this result with such absolute and frightening accuracy as Peter Watkins does. <br /> <br /> â€œIt now seems perfectly clear that instead of trying to attract alienated and excluded Americans such as these People, returning to the national community, the administration decided to accept and use the existing division within the country and take the side of that she considers the majority. Instead of a policy of reconciliation, she chose a policy of polarization. " <br /> <br /> To paraphrase one of the characters, we do not need to call them pigs, because they know who they are. Better than us.
