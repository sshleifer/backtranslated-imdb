The film certainly was believable to the real story on which it was based. It was hard for me to find newspaper articles about real facts, but when I discovered them, I saw that the truth in this case was unfamiliar, but made up. Judith Light was frighteningly angry in her role as a mother in this film, so much so that it was difficult for her to separate her from the role - a mark that I consider an excellent presentation. Rick Schroeder was accordingly ignorant as her son, who also defended her in court, is an example of how difficult it is for a child in some circumstances to accept the actions of parents, no matter how criminal they may be. You can find fault with the film, but not with its interpretation of the reality on which it is based.
