One of the most famous of all TV series movies! Today it is still interesting, although it has an “old film”. The second series looks better, but just does not equal this. The actors have a good time, especially Middleton and Lipson. Excellent editing by a universal group of experts. The music was taken from "Universal Destination Unknown", "The Invisible Man", "Black Cat" and "Werewolf of London". And what a great action music it was! If there was a choice for the best TV show of all time, it should (probably) be # 1.
