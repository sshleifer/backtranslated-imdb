Fantastic music film starring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth. He owns a nightclub where she dances. She is not yet a star, but she gets a big break when she was chosen as a cover for Vanity, whose owner was actually in love with his grandmother. When he sees a resemblance, he immediately selects it to participate in a competition in which his manganese is participating. Hayworth's newfound fame first works wonders for the Kelly club, but its star rises so fast and so high that its grip begins to fluctuate. This is not the most original plot, but two leads really make it work. It also helps that the script is great. Kelly is not yet at the peak, especially at the peak of the actor. His dances, however, are wow. Hayworth is a star, but Kelly claims that the most memorable moment of the film is a passionate dance with its own reflection. This is obviously the take-off of Fred Astaire's shadow dance in Swing Time, but I think Kelly prevailed, which is hardly believable. In fact, this must be the most amazing dance sequence in cinema history, with the possible exception of the finale of the film “American in Paris” a few years later. The rest of the songs are also excellent, and the music numbers are even better. It is a pity that Rita did not sing her own songs (well, she may have a couple of them, as her singing voice sometimes seemed different). Her dances are beautiful, like the rest of her game. It's hard not to love her in anything. She is truly one of the few truly beautiful women of the classical era. Not plastic, like many of them; no, you can really see the heat in this woman. Her smile is so disarming. Phil Silvers plays the role of Kelly's best friend, and he is also very funny. The Kelly-Hayworth-Silvers trio is obviously the nucleus that became the Kelly-Reynolds-O'Connor trio in Singin 'in the rain eight years later. One of the biggest musical numbers in the film seems almost stolen with the 'Good Morning' number in Singin '. I think Singin 'in the Rain is the best movie since Cover Girl is a bit rough. This rudeness, however, only adds charm. There are aspects of this film that beat "Singing in the Rain" and even "American in Paris." For example, central relationships are more emotionally involved. Instead of the dominant elderly man chasing a little girl (after all, Leslie Caron and Debbie Reynolds were just teenagers), we have very good relationships with two people who seem more equal. There is no chase here - an aspect that, unfortunately, turns many of the best musicals into sour, I must admit. Kelly and Hayworth are a couple right from the start, and when it starts to wear out, I really feel it. 9/10.
