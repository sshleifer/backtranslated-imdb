In Brooklyn, nightclub dancer Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) leads a simple but happy dance at McGuire, owned by her boyfriend Danny (Gene Kelly). Grow, Danny and Genius (Phil Silvers) arrange a Friday night ritual: they order oysters at the bar, trying to find a pearl. Growing life changes when she participates and wins the cover competition for Vanity magazine. She is invited to work in a huge theater on Broadway, whose owner offers it. She loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new lifestyle, missing the love of Danny and her old friends. “The Cover Girl” is a delightful romantic comedy, very naive and with magnificent roles, such as the beauty and talented Rita Hayworth dancing, singing and playing on stage; Gene Kelly, especially in two scenes, dances with herself and with Rusty and Genius on the street; songs and choreography of dances are also spectacular. Danny, the character of Gene Kelly, is almost disgusted with his chauvinistic behavior. Rita Hayworth surprised me with her talent: I found her amazing in Gilda, but she is amazing in The Cover Girl. According to the information on the cover of VHS, "The Cover Girl" was the first musical where the songs were part of the story, giving the continuity of the story, and not just "thrown" into the movies. My sixteen-year-old son saw this film with a friend of the same age at the recent Gene Kelly festival, and they really liked The Cover Girl, so I dare say that this classic is recommended for any movie buff, not just the older generation, My voice is nine . <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “Modelos” (“Models”)
