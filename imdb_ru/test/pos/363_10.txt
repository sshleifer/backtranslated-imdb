This movie was great. This is definitely the top 5 Hitchcock movie. The guides and camera shots are almost flawless (except for the scene with the dog when he licks the guy's hand, obviously in slow motion). The plot is well written and realistic. It was very plausible that an innocent person could fall into such a trap. <br /> <br /> I would rate Bruno as a minor character of Hitchcock (of course, Bates is the first). Robert Walker plays a very believable maniac. He didn’t beat the part that made it believable (almost as much as Perkins didn’t beat his part). In general, this is a great film that must be seen by hitchhikers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
