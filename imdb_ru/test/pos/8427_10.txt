I finally found a version of Persuasion that I like! In this version, Ann is not like a maid, but a very thin, aging, beautiful woman, just as she is described in the book. Captain Wentworth does not look as if he is 50 years old, nor does he look forever evil, rather, as he described in the book, he is not as old as Anne, and rather handsome. And they play their part with such conviction and realism ... that's what acting is. They were believable. They created real characters, and it looked like the characters in the book came to life. If you have not seen this version yet, I urge you to find it, order it or request it in a bookstore or library, if necessary. It is worth the price and worth the wait. <br /> <br /> I watched the 1995 version, and the 2007 version and this version towers over the other two. Why it is not rated higher, beyond my understanding. The book conveys the tenderness of their relationship, and this film makes the book come alive.
