Probably the best Royal Rumble in recent years. <br /> <br /> In a match, 1 Edge fights with Sean Michaels in a good, but very long match. Then one of the worst fighters on the list - Heidenreich takes the Undertaker in a dull box match. In match 3, Bradshaw defends his WWE title against the Big Show and Kurt Angle in surprisingly good competition. In the next match, Triple H will defend his 10th heavyweight champion title against Randy Orton in an excellent match. <br /> <br /> Next comes Royal Rumble, in which there are 15 raw superstars and 15 Smackdown! the superstars hit the ring to try to win a crash and meet the champion, whoever it was at Wrestlemania 21. Highlights included the winner of Tough Enough 3, Daniel Puder, who was kicked by Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero and Hardcore Holly! All superstars beat Muhammad Hassan, and superstars against Smackdown! Super stars! <br /> <br /> Quite good PPV. <br /> <br /> Edge vs. HBC - 8/10 Tucker vs. Heidenreich - 4/10 JBL vs. Angle vs. The Big Show - 7.5 / 10 Triple X vs. Orton - 8.5 / 10 Match Royal Rumble - 9/10
