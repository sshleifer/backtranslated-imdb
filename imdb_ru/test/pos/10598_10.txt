Haggard: The Movie is well written, well directed and well played. There are many laughing high-profile moments and some amazing skateboarding scenes featuring Margera. The scenes of West Chester, Pennsylvania, are beautifully filmed, and the script is just ridiculous. What I like about the film is that instead of being another juicy love story or another version of "Jackass," it takes darkly funny looks at breaks from a different perspective. Most films about parting show a naive woman shot down by a cheat. She then goes in search of Mr. Wright and tells her former cheaters that they are lost. This film tells about an emotional rollercoaster, as if an abandoned man ... not taking himself too seriously. Ryan Dunn does an excellent job with his work, and Bam Margera and Brandon Dikamillo are your best friends who are trying to help you in this difficult time. How can you take something too seriously? Obviously, Margera and Co. are incredibly talented, both behind and in front of the camera. I look forward to their future films and beginnings.
