Well, where do I start ... <br /> <br /> As one of the other reviewers said, you know that you will have real pleasure when you see the first frame - minutes and minutes of the film spent on the guy standing on travolatore. <br /> <br /> I will not repeat Rubin's excellent resume. However, I would like to say that this film captured me more than any film that I can recall. I sat with my mouth open and on the edge of my seat the whole time. Working with the camera, the sound track and * fantastic * performances (especially with Tony Servillo) attract you to the screen and do not allow you to look away. <br /> <br /> This is Italian, so, of course, everyone looks fantastic, but this is by no means just a classroom exercise. This is a film that talks a lot about luck, loss and love. <br /> <br /> Go and see.
