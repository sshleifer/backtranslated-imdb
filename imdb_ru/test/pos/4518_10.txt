Kite Runner must win an Oscar! It is beautiful in every sense: history, screenplay, acting, cinematography ... No one would have thought that this was filmed in China. The story of two childhood friends and what follows in their adult life will leave a lasting impression. The image of life in Afghanistan under the Taliban is too real and terrible. I did not read the book, but I saw comments that bring the film to life, because “the book is always better” ... It does not matter. Nobody recorded "Gone With the Wind", because this is not true! In fact, it won the Academy Award for Best Picture and several other Oscars. I think this film is great - BRAVO for the writer, director and actors!
