It can not be much more creepy than the Flatliners. This deep, dark film made my heart beat all the time. Illumination is dark and literally give you a mood that challenges death. Kayfer in great shape, as today at 24 years. He is an excellent actor and plays a very convincing and shocking role that you will not forget for many years. And what can you say about the rest of the composition? Star composition, Julia hotter than ever, Will, Oliver and Kevin illuminate the scene in this thriller, which will keep you in their seats. This is a refreshing sight to see a real thriller with top-level professional actors. You will not regret seeing this 2-hour seat. -Jl
