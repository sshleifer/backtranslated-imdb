Those who do not like this film seem to think that a loved one somehow "belongs" to them and should be discarded if they leave with someone else. Fortunately, human nature is much deeper; love for someone deeply inevitably brings suffering - although if we are lucky only after their death. <br /> <br /> This film is truthful in the setting, atmosphere and dialogue with Nigel Balchin’s original novel (“The Way Through the Forest”), and when a seemingly irreconcilable dilemma is revealed, quiet despair is hidden, , idyllic lives (and the image of the English country life of the upper class is very accurate). <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the movie soon DVD compatible DVD
