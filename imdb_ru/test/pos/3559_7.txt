Hitman George Hilton, sleek Mexican gangster Gilbert Roland (who is great) and banker Edd Byrnes each try to outwit each other by looking for a large amount of gold from one of the robberies of the Roland train, which was hidden by a cunning member of his Gang. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the best that this genre can offer, it is still quite fresh with a lot of carefree, action-filled fun and a satisfactory ending. <br /> <br /> Any Gun Can Play is mainly remembered by the fact that his debut opens when George Hilton easily shoots three criminals, like Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Django. <br /> <br /> The following year, Hilton and Roland reunited with Van Heflin. and Klaus Kinsky in the Ruthless Four.
