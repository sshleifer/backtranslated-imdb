Uh-uh, impossible, not so bad. <br /> <br /> Good, exciting movie. A fairly good knowledge of French and knowledge of modern France (and history) is recommended. I do not think that this film really works in any other language. The film is incredibly much better than the previous one (In search of ...). In addition to great actors and skillful control of the camera, this is the wit and fireworks of allusions, word games, etc., which make the movie really great. Cartoon Voronezh is recognizable, but the film is very liberated. The cost of the film is used with benefit. Indeed, all the special effects fit into the film “naturally” and you will never feel their suffocation. <br /> <br /> Bref, oui, les 2CVs, “tra tra un un peu mais”, partially village, Imhotep! <Br /> <br /> - Neighbor on the other side of the Rhine
