I really liked the film, especially the performance of exceptionally beautiful Gong Li as a concubine. <br /> <br /> However, it was a little distracting dialogue in Chinese PLUS English subtitles PLUS voice-over emphasized in American language, although voice-over was very well synchronized. <br /> <br /> The last name of Qin Shi Huang Di (the first emperor of Qin) was Zheng, and his name is Yiong, so in English it should have been sent as “King Zheng” or “Emperor Zheng”, and NOT as “King Ying Zheng, ”since in those days two surnames / names were not used together. <br /> <br /> The state of Qin is pronounced "Chin." “not a shin” - it’s a pity that the researchers didn’t get it right. <br /> <br /> I forgave it, but I was alarmed at the end when the comment announced that he was buried in “Zai-an” along with his terracotta warriors. The city of Xi'an is pronounced "CNA", and not "ZAI-EN" - of course, American offscreen speakers could do it right!
