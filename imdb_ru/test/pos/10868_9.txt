I found it charming! No one except Kiarostami can do so little and, nevertheless, get so much. You may think that I am strange, but I was so fascinated that I could not speak during the film. Although during other films I comment a lot. A short film he made for Lumiere and company, a film with eggs that is unbeatable in my heart, but this is also wonderful. I liked more than ten. Kiarostami is probably the best director in my opinion, because he can see things! He does not need to use a lot of things “brought from home” to illustrate his images, he just takes a camera. Not many can do it. Maybe I don’t know too much about films, but I don’t care about complicated things, all I have to do is touch my soul. Kyarostami
