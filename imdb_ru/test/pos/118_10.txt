one of the best films ever made ... Fire ... it’s not so much a sociological description of modern India ... it’s a breathtaking use of light that never stops, it never becomes ... normal ... even when .... in this sense, the film is almost unique ... both videos are of very good quality ... the origin of Das as a street performer is pretty obvious ... her performance is excellent "cammeo" ... but using light ... I looked at it and watched at him, again and again ... still astounding after centuries ... nothing terrible in history ... rather a "pure" way of looking at the subject ... In a sense, it is sad that in the strange world in which we live Today, the main artistic work is commonly known as the gender film ... Fire can stand individuals Come to face with Giner D'Arc from Dryer's or Biruma no Tategoto Ichikawa or some of the main Kurosawa films, just to name "some." I would like my contribution to help this film a little to earn its fame.
