The film tells about four friends from the 1950s (when they are in high school) until 1981. This is Danilo (Craig Wasson), a Yugoslav immigrant; Georgia (Jodi Thelan) - "free spirit"; David (Michael Huddleston), who has no personality, and Tom (Jim Metzler) - a big, strong, handsome, rude guy. All three are in love with Georgia, but she loves only Danila. The film mainly focuses on these two things - it tells about their life, love and attractiveness to each other for many years. It is also included in Danilo, who is trying to win the love of his tough immigrant father. <br /> <br /> I like this film, but it is not without flaws. Telan's high, raspy voice is annoying (but you get used to it); the story jumps very fast; The life of Tom and David is never explained (Tom appears with a Vietnamese wife and children, and David has a wife whom we never meet to the end); some important scenes are poorly written, and there are some obvious pre-releases (probably for a film to stay for 2 hours). <br /> <br /> But everything else is so good that you can easily forget about the problems. The story is exciting - you really will know and understand the characters and will always be involved in life. With a few exceptions, the script (Steve Tesic) is good - in fact, Tesic himself was a Yugoslav immigrant and based most of the script on his own experience. All acting skills are superb - especially Thelan and Wasson - also Reed Byrney demonstrates a strong, enjoyable play in the role of Louis, roommate at Danilo College. And Lois Smith is very interesting in her role. And take care of the Mercedes Ruehl and Glenne Headly! <br /> <br /> In fact, this is a really great story about immigrants, coming of age, love of America, and it covers beautifully the 50s and 80s. <br /> <br /> This film was (unfairly) defiled when it was released. The studio did not know how to advertise it (this is a heavy film for the market), and critics put pressure on it (Polina Kelsâ€™s review in The New Yorker was especially harsh). He barely played in cinemas (I was fortunate enough to catch him in 1981 in his short production) and just disappeared. It's a shame. This is a film that is just ripe for re-release. I don't bet on it - but you never know! Definite 10 completely!
