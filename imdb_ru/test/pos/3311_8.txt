Is it a bad, rough, predictable, sticky, obscene soap opera? “Best of all” is such a pleasure for me, something like “Valley of Dolls”. I mean, Best has it all. Someone gets pregnant out of wedlock (when was the last time you heard this phrase?), Everywhere there is business, drunkenness, stabbing in the back, jealousy, and even a tragic, but not entirely unexpected death. <br /> <br /> Carolyn Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (adorable Stephen Boyd) are the main characters of this. Their chemistry is immediate and is the glue that keeps this film from excessive fragmentation. <br /> <br /> Susie Parker, an extraordinary model of the former fashion, appears in the role of Gregg Adams, the beginning stage actress, a role that, according to any biography I have ever read about her, was clearly not too taut. But Parker does an amazingly trustworthy job here, more than holding it in a couple of scenes with Louis Jourdan, who plays David Savage. Jourdan probably took this role for money and for special merit on the screen, because he was clearly heading for an aging star / former road. <br /> <br /> Diane Baker is good as a naive, gullible April Morrison, Martha Hyer Wu Barbara Lemont has a particularly juicy storyline, and the film's legend Joan Crawford is chewing her usual scene as Amanda Farrow, another role, such as Jourdan Savage ”, Which Crawford, most likely, took for a salary. <br /> <br /> dated dialogue and plot devices (this is IS 1959), and the predictability of the series genre. But if you like good soap, like me, “The Best of All” will more than satisfy you.
