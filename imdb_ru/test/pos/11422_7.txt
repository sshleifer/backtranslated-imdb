This short film by Stan Laurel is a cute little parody of Valentino's film "BLOOD AND SAND." If you've seen BLOOD AND SAND, you will probably appreciate this movie and laugh at several scenes that mock Valentino's movie. However, if you didn’t see this movie and just watched this movie, you probably won’t be impressed - although I really liked the title cards, we often repeated the word “bull” in very funny ways. <Br /> <br /> Stanley plays Vaselino in a bullfighter, who looks pretty dumb and wins only because the bulls seem lazy and non-aggressive. Even that bull at the end of the film, which allegedly killed ten people, is obviously just a domesticated bull. <br /> <br /> Not a very good movie, whatever it is, but still a sweet and harmless movie.
