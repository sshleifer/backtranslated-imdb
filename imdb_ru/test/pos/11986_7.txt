We must take Martin and Lewis as a drop of salt and pepper. Why does Martin put up with Lewis? Again, why are all the women in this film like Jerry? Because he is innocently cute! Martin sings some good songs (at least once with lip sync), and Jerry manages to kiss more girls than in all his other films combined. I usually find that I can take so many tricks of Jerry before they get worse. BUT .... in this movie, see when Jerry gets stuck in a Navy submarine! FINE! Buster Keaton should have been proud. I give the film 7.
