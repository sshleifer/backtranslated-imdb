When I watched this movie as a child, I did not understand the prerequisites for Hitchcock’s films and the dark comedy. Now that I’m in my twenties, it seems to me that this makes more sense. <br /> <br /> I think I like this film so much because the comedy duo Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito makes an interesting comedy and farce (frying pan and car scenes) and verbal (arguments / talk about murder and writing). <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Larry Donner (Crystal), a struggling writer who stole his masterpiece from him from his wife Margaret (played by the amazingly radiant Kate Mulgrew, who is also Captain Janeway from Star Trek: Voyager). <br /> <br /> While he switches between the writer's bloc and teaches the creative writing class, he meets with student Owen Lifts (DeVito), an aspiring writer and an overgrown sissy who unfortunately still behaves like a child. He has toy train tracks, should I say more? Think about the failure at startup, only Matt McConaughey is short, fat and bald. <br /> <br /> Owen is stuck in his own life with a demanding evil mother (Ann Ramsey), whom he hates. He seeks Larry’s advice on how to get out of this, and when he says to go see Hitchcock’s film, Owen misunderstands that if he kills Larry’s wife, he will return the favor and kill his mom for him. Fun comes when they try to solve each other’s problems. Owen goes to extremes to kill Margaret, while Larry, who refuses to accept her “part of the plan”, is crazy about Owen's mother. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Larry and Owen are slowly but surely forming bonds of friendship, which are rare in the dark comedy of our time. One part of the film that I really loved was where Owen showed Larry his collection of coins, and let's just say that this is a more sentimental collection than anything else. <br /> <br /> Two main stars aside, the late Ann Ramsey is very funny. Mom, and deadly its cane. She is much more comedic in oral and physical form, in contrast to her role as Mother Fratelli from Guni. Therefore, she swears like a sailor and humiliates her son at every turn, but this makes her character so bright. She makes her character the kind of person you love to hate. <br /> <br /> Another pleasure in this film is the music of the great jazz Brandford Marsalis, who plays neighbor Larry and his girlfriend Lester. There is a wonderful moment in the film when he plays jazz for Larry, who is depressed and needs good melodies to ease the pain. Jazz can do it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would like Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito to make another good movie together, but they seem to be too old to play, I'm sad to say. This is one of those rare films where both stars shine in their own way. DeVito's children's comedy and Cristal wit made this film for me. 5 star comedy.
