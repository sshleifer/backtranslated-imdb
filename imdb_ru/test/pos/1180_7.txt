Although this film is not the most interesting film in the world, I think it is better than most of all. I mean, it was a bit of a laugh and just around a good feeling. Not so often we see two old cranks who just have fun with their age and honestly spend time with jokes. Walter and Jack had such wonderful chemistry as friends / son-in-law. Just watching their novels with these women was fun, and you supported them all the way, because, to admit it or not, they still had a game for their age! : D I really liked the whole plot: I can move on and have fun, no matter how old you are. I would recommend this movie for a good laugh, if you want. <br /> <br /> 7/10
