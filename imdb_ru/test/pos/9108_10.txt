Probably the best comedy in a long time. makes you laugh without interruption! The game is good, and there are a lot of funny cameos, like Ben Stiller as the guy from the guitar shop. The plot wasn't as good as I hoped, but the comedy makes up for it. I can only hope to continue, because it seems that they can still do much more. Although it was 1 hour and 40 minutes, I still wanted more at the end :) there is also a scene after the credits, which is actually one of my favorite parts of the movie !! I offer this to anyone who loves a good comedy, and definitely recommend it to The D or Jack Black fans. You should also buy an album, the songs are so damn memorable and funny, the music on it is also Top Notch.
