This is an excellent Anderson performance, worthy of comparison with the best episodes of UFO or SPACE 1999 (first series). Of course, this is not some kind of SFX extravaganza or the pseudo-musical festival “Star Wars”, but a thin film with a slow pace, but at the same time it conveys the eerie, eerie and strange atmosphere of the best Anderson's productions: . Lynn Loring's voice is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. SFX are good for this type of product, and the game is good too. Two astronauts visit the planet on the opposite side of the Sun, but instead crash to the ground ... or not? Ah, videophones! From time to time he acted as the next “gadget of everyone in the next decade,” but it should still happen 40 years later. The device of the Earth's twin planet on the opposite side of the Sun also returns to “Gamer tai daikuju Giron” (1969), so who copied who?
