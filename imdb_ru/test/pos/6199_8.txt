* WARNING ABOUT POSSIBLE SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> A friend told me to check out this series, and I'm glad I took her words for it. <br /> <br /> I read the synopsis on the DVD cover and I was immediately intrigued. The main character is a Muslim? No, this is the first! We are talking about an FBI agent who is under cover to penetrate a possible sleeping camera in Los Angeles; and get it - he is a practicing Muslim. At first I was a bit skeptical, expecting some hero or antagonist to vomit, maybe stupid, impartial and meaningless fanatical chatter ... let's face it, many shows were guilty of that. /> <br /> But then I watched the first three episodes and thought: well, that is good. This continued until the fourth episode (“The Scientist”), when I was well and truly impressed. I would like to commend for the great composition, as well as for the great performances of the actors. I just love how complex each of these characters is - it's not just a two-dimensional cardboard cutout of good guys / bad guys. Michael Eli gives a remarkable and believable job as an agent for the Muslim FBI Darwin Al-Sayid, laying a fine line between being a good Muslim and a person with disabilities. Oded Fehr gives his character Farik an interesting depth - Farik is not a typical oily Middle Eastern stereotype, but simply a person who sincerely believes in his work and does not consider himself a fanatic, but a person who is ready to take any extreme measures to justify his beliefs. He is very charismatic and authoritative. But I would say that it was Alex Nesich’s performance that impressed me in The Scholar. His depiction of the emotional struggle of his character was striking - torn between the quiet words of a Muslim scholar, encouraging him to return to the non-aggressive path, because this is the only acceptable way in the eyes of God and Farik’s belief to believe in the opposite. <Br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing more of these shows, rather than some ridiculously high-octane TV shows for one person. This is clever and unbiased.
