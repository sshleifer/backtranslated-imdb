Perry Mason: Perry and Della Street in New York find the case of fatal fashion, receiving an award from the American Bar Association. An unbeatable court record should get a confession, I think. In any case, Della's friend, fashion editor Diana Muldaur, is arrested for killing her rival, Valerie Harper, and in fact Raymond Barr and Barbara Hale witness a clash between them in a chic dining room. <br /> <br /> These two opponents have something going on that makes Hedda and Luell look like schoolgirls. Of course, Harper has a number of other people who loved her equally strongly. <br /> <br /> The same criminal also shot down a fashion designer who could expose that person. This leads Perry to his trusted investigative attorney, William Moses, in an alliance with some of the bandits. It seems that the designer was a cousin of the mafia boss, who also wants to achieve justice in his usual manner. <br /> <br /> One thing I couldnâ€™t understand was when Moses and the bandit Robert Clohessy were looking for a criminal. I can not believe that the police also did not insist on it. Of course, Clohessy has some access to sources that the police simply do not have. <br /> <br /> But the best part of this Mason entry is Scott Baio, because he is quite full of assistant district attorney, who represents himself Raymond Barr, telling how he studied all his cases and was looking forward to defeating him. Foolish Boy. <br /> <br /> Actually my favorite scene is Barr and Bayo on the side panel with the judge. Bayo wanted to reopen his case and add a witness, and was ready and prepared with precedents. Barr takes him by surprise and says that he does not object to the new witness, and then proceeds to demolish the witness during cross-examination. Absolutely priceless. <br /> <br /> Scott Baio is the best thing in this particular Perry Mason film, and it should be seen only for him, if not for anything else.
