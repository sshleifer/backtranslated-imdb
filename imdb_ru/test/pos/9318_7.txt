Nothing could be better than an android with the technology of the 80s and the storyline of adulthood, which will pull your thoughts from the depths of your mind and center to be captured by a lovely cute character. Growing up in the 80s gave me an invaluable opportunity to see reports about the “not quite human” in many special cases. Considering the fact that my parents were never present during the viewing, I guess that I most likely will not like it as much as in childhood. So perhaps this is a film that can be dug out of your VHS collection and passed on to your children, it can be found on the same tape as Apple's Dumpling Bandage, and in the episode "Debt Tournament", that is, if You recorded in LP mode of course.
