I can not believe that I have not yet added my two cents about this film! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies of all time. Many critics and moviegoers talk about John Carpenter’s “Halloween”, which sets trends and is “his best work.” These people have not seen this version of "The Thing", because it is right there with "Halloween". <br /> <br /> John Carpenter’s work shines in this film. He took the film, which had already been shot, and instead of “remaking” the film, he made the book on which the first film was based! Sumptuously. <br /> <br /> The cast of each person was great, the tension between them was real, it made me scream, made me afraid, made me think, made me laugh, made me ask questions, even until today there?" in this film. There was no Hollywood sweet cake or ridiculous finale in this film, and what a bold move was not in 1982. Another brilliant move. <br /> <br /> I was on the screening of this film when I was on vacation in Southern California. The audience at the show went berserk! I carry these memories for years, it was so much fun! We all thought that in God's green land there was no way for this film to become a hit. But it was stupid for cash checks, because “ET, The Extra Terrestrial” and “Poltergeist” two very good family films were shot at the box office in 1982, when the movie was released. <br /> <br /> This movie was what I, as an adult horror movie lover, was looking for, a horror movie / thriller with an adult script and real adult actors. Not kids playing adults. Not the little miss "big breasts", the screaming queen of the day, running around, screaming at titles, BUT the real guys with real problems deliver some of the best monologues you have ever heard. Damn, being a feminist, I didn't even miss the women in this movie! And it’s good for Mr. Carpenter, if you don’t put him there, it really wouldn't make sense! (Unless “The Thing” was actually female! What to think about!) <br /> <br /> I saw special effects of that time that I had never seen before, I saw makeup that made me sit for a few nights This is something that today is not enough horror / thrillers. Today the Directors are weak. Today Studios is a wimp. Too much CGI and not enough faith, too much CGI and not enough history, not enough imagination. You leave the theater and after a week — or less — you forget about the film and go on to the next grand opening of the film. This one stays with you. This is one of the hallmarks of a great movie. <br /> <br /> In many reviews that I wrote, it was terrible to pay now $ 10 per film. For movies like this, you would pay and not feel slighted. This film is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> I find it terrible that they consider this film "cult." I find that the audience is wider than many might have made you believe, and although commercial success in 1982 was not successful, this is an example of how releasing a damn good movie at the wrong time can make a damn good movie bad. After the John Carpenter film, many people copied a lot of the techniques, makeup, special effects, and plot lines from this version of The Thing. <br /> <br /> Now I am pleased to announce that this film is one of the best films of all time, very undervalued. Please watch it uncut, please watch it in your inbox and listen to it digitally. You will be talking about this for years.
