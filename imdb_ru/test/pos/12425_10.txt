I first saw it on demand. Or on TV. I'm not quite sure. But this should be my favorite movie ever! I mean, in this film, blood, blood, laughter and chills throughout the film. I recently ordered a Monster Man from Amazon, and I have been watching Monster Man since I received it. Believe me, you will like this movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. The DVD comment is very funny. They also said something about "Monster Man 2" during the comment. Let's hope they make Monster Man 2! If you have the opportunity, rent a movie or buy it. You will absolutely love it! This is the best film released in 2003. <br /> <br /> 10/10
