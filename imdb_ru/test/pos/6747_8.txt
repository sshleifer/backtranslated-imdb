Since 1950, a neat thriller about a pair of smuggled diamonds from abroad, as well as a contagious smallpox disease, has been released. Evelyn Case is doing everything possible to become the main victim of this film-noir. Returning to the United States, she does not realize that she can spread the disease to everyone and everything she faces. In the end, it is haunted and must be stopped before an epidemic occurs. In addition to Case's lively speeches, there is good support from villain Charles Corvin, William Bishop, Dorothy Malone, Lola Albright and Whit Bissel. The finale is a bully with Miss Keese on the ledge of a building with spotlights and hundreds of spectators downstairs. Good film!
