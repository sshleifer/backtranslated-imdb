This film was awesome, it was very funny and touching. Damien O'Donnell and Jeffrey Kane have created an excellent film that will appeal to all ages. James McAvoy and Stephen Robertson made this movie brilliant. Their acting was excellent, between them there was a real realistic feeling that made you believe that they were the characters they played. Romola Garay is amazingly gorgeous and gorgeous in her role. The story of these two people with disabilities and their guardian is well laid out, and you really begin to recognize and feel the characters as the film progresses, at the end it was especially frustrating. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves a truly spiritual film, warning the more sensitive viewer that you have the napkins that you will need. <br /> <br /> An awesome movie again !!
