One of my favorite westerns and one of the best in my opinion of John Ford. No major stars, but Ben Johnson shines in almost everything that he appears, and here he gets a rare lead as the main character. Approaching him, Ward Bond, like a solid Mormon old man, leads his people westward. A variety of actor characters from John Ford, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Warden, provide ample support, as does the creepy silent James Arness, a member of Clan Clegg, who teamed up with a wagon. The Mormon Trail in Utah was one of the most difficult and demanding ventures ever undertaken. We cannot really feel it, but we see challenges that the pioneers on their way to the west had to overcome; river crossings, long stretches of dry, waterless desert, meetings with Indians, etc. â€” all this to the glorious song of the Sons of the Pioneers. Mormons were really digging trails with picks and shovels, as shown in the film. I regret that it was not made in color, but I believe that there is a color version. By the way, these rocky stones, depicted in various scenes, are called Fisher Towers, located near Moab. Watching is highly recommended.
