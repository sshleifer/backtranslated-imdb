I first saw this film when I was about 6 years old - my grandmother thought that it would be a good film for children to entertain me and occupy me ... however, every time I watched it, I had nightmares in one same night Yes, he is disguised as a children's film, but even now I find it really dark in some places, especially the obsessive music that sounds every time a guardian angel woman appears on the screen, and her rather hypnotic eyes and voice. The actual "villains" of the film, that is, the sharks, Mr. Grimes, etc., didnâ€™t scare me at all, I just always found the whole movie rather creepy and grim. Obviously, this is something that I can appreciate now that I am 21 years old, but, based on experience, I could not show it to my children!
