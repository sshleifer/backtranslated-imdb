No, this is not a citizen Kane. But do you expect it to be named like "Meatballs"? This is the best fucking summer camp movie of all summer camp movies. Does anyone quote "Little Darlings" line by line? Or "Whitewater Summer"? <br /> <br /> This is just one of those films that got into my brain when I was in high school and stayed with me all these years. Every time I feel provoking, I mumble, "Spas. Spas. Spas. Spas." Or when we travel through the forest, I say to my husband: "I am Woody da Wabbit." (He does not understand). “It just doesn't matter. It just doesn't matter. ” I mean, this is a classic! <br /> <br /> Disappointed DVD. I would like to have special features, perhaps a comment or inventing. But the film itself is the perfect snapshot of a teenager’s life in the late 70s. Maybe not my life ... You can't not want to run through the woods in short shorts and knee-high in socks, and every time you watch this movie.
