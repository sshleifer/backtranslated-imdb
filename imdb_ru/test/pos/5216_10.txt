I thought it was a great movie. Gary Cole played the role of a military man who feels trapped and unhappy with his wife, who pretends to be pretending his death! In general, I thought the movie was great, definitely not a boring storyline! Sad to say, but I think that many men might feel that way. I think that he should have just received a divorce and asked to be transferred, and not to the extreme to which he went, but he felt that there was no other way out, so he pretended to be dead. I thought it was great that Cole's real wife played a wife whom he was unhappy about in the film. I think what the guy did was a bit extreme, but the movie was great nonetheless! Would definitely recommend it!
