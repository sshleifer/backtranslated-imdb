This review contains what may be a spoiler if you have never read a book or seen the cover of a video box. Therefore, if you want to get close to the film, knowing nothing about it, except that I like it very much, stop here ... <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are not first-class, but the action between the hosts and they give the novel between them is more life than the Fool in his novel (although I usually prefer the novel). My very weak objections to the film, unlike the book, are that the film weakens some relationships with secondary characters, as well as between the leading characters in the scene by the end of the film, to provide some not quite realistic dramatic tension and as a general plot reception. All this is much better processed in the book, and as a result I find the end of the book more touching than the end of the film.
