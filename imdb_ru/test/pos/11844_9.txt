I caught this movie last night on one of the channels, and I haven't laughed for so long for a long time. This film was so funny that I went out and bought the next day. I love this type of comedy. It just seemed so real in the way the actors respond to different situations here. I was rollin. I have never even heard about it and just started looking because of the name "See other people." The name made me give him a chance, and I'm glad I did. I laughed so hard it hurt. Now it is part of my collection. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes smart comedy. I will watch it again and again.
