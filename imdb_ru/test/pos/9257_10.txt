For all who liked the series, this film will be something to see. However, it also leaves you wanting more. I liked how each character (detective) appeared. At least with the end of who is the fourth chairman, because they leave a reason for another film I think Bayless, of course. This series was very well composed of a series of scenes. This is a series in which I would like to live. Thanks to the actors for the great TV.
