To be honest, I was completely intrigued by the original “Sleeper Cell” concept. After watching the best part of the series on FX (UK), my Sky went bankrupt, meaning that I missed the decisive final. But what I REALLY saw, I assumed that it would be a great storyline, a good acting game, and since I don’t watch “24,” I thought it was great, and this was confirmed for the second season ...> <br /> One of the best TV programs I've seen. Much more realistic and believable than the "24". Excellent character development and storyline. It does not destroy Islam, but gives a thoughtful and balanced approach showing the difference between radical Islamic terrorism and true Islam. Everyone should see this show! <br /> <br /> Stringy xx
