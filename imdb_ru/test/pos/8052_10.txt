I am from the city of Phoenix, and when I first saw this film and read a book, he only confirmed the stories I have heard all my life. I asked my grandfather about the crowd, and he told me that when he returned from a fight in a quiet theater, he founded the company CPA, which is the largest in Columbus County. when he first started, the crowd asked him to do financial work for them, but he said that he carefully refused. even when the FBI and the army passed through the city of Phoenix and cleared it, my grandfather did not take it lightly when my mother, aunt or uncle crossed the river, but I assure you that all this is over. Phoenix city center needs restoration, and it has slums near the courthouse, where all the shooting is still going on at angry, uneducated, low-income people, and the 14th Phoenix-Orlyny Bridge Street has been closed for 15 years and replaced by more the new 13th street bridge, but on the fairer side of the city of Phoenix on Summerville. This is very strange, and the landscape is depressing. <br /> <br /> Another story told me from a family of my best friend from high school who lives in a quiet place on Highway 165 called Holy Trinity, Alabama, which is about 28 years old. Minutes from Columbus, GA. My best friend in high school was an uncle named Old Man Davis. no matter how the movie goes, the fact that there were 3 bosses, and Old Davis was one of them ... you can even read about it in the original book. Legend has it that he was so cool that he went to Phoenix downtown to make a deal with a man, but obviously the man refused the deal right in front of old Davis, so old Davis continued to take a sawn-off shotgun from his coat and shoot a man at a chest in the city center near the courthouse. They say he even casually left, because the crowd paid off every law enforcement officer in the city, so he had nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> Another incident involving a bridge rented from another friend of mine. home near to downtown Phoenix. this is the same bridge from which the mob killed and threw away the black man, and you can even read this part in the book. I would also like to see in many cities in Columbus and Phoenix civilians asked to become extras in the film. when Patterson's friend was killed and put on trial and proved guilty before a judge, but he was released, well, the judge is my fatherâ€™s partner in his law firm in Columbus, who, unfortunately, died.
