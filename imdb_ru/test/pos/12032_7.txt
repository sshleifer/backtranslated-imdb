Hollywood turned the mafia into a production line from the banal to the excellent, and despite a good game and a reasonable scenario (most of which - for a change - true!), This “home entertainment” effort should stop a slap in the middle. <br /> <br /> The script is not only obvious (all checkboxes are checked), but it also spends a lot of time to bring the fruits of the best of other people's work. , The Godfather is the most obvious, but there are other links. I will not call them. However, it is a good taste of the borrower! It seems the producer sets the quota for shots and murders (at least once every twenty minutes?), And the ending is weak and "so what?" I was told that there are different versions of this film, so maybe this is the version I saw. <br /> <br /> Gangsters do not earn, they take money. Usually from fear. Some seem to be more prone to murder and lawlessness than to making money. They were the first to go (in real life and here). “You can't make money with a gun in your hand,” says Charlie “Lucky” Luciano at one stage. One of the clever gangsters, although everything is relative. He was an experienced white slave trafficker and drug dealer before he was brought home to Italy. <br /> <br /> The old school “Usatiy Pete” was chosen by the new blood, who wanted power and money for itself and to be free from the direct cover of the Italian / Sicilian government (rarely doing business outside of itself). The young Turk knew that they needed to enter into an alliance with other groups (especially the "Jews" who knew how to launder money), and at least this is referred to and recognized. What is not so clear is that most immigrant groups had their own mafia groups, but most of them earned their money and became legal. And why not? Who wants to die in prison? <br /> <br /> Joseph Bonanno was a ruthless man, ready to kill if necessary, but not unjust or stupid. His story was tragic in the sense that he could make money in the terrestrial world, and he demonstrated a special skill in order to avoid death. Naturally, with a bit of luck. <br /> <br /> Despite the diversity of respectable names and three actors in the lead role (Bruce Ramsay, Martin Landau and Tony Nardi), there is no charisma or talent here. to lead us and feel anything. We are - simply - passive observers in life that we are glad not to lead. The people shown here were born in a cruel world, but their sole purpose was to make it tougher. <br /> <br /> If you cannot get enough of the gangster genre, it will be better than watching the Godfather 1 and 2 for the tenth time, and it is even better - as the main entertainment - than the terrible misfire that was Godfather 3.
