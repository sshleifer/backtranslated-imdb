A very good political thriller about the consequences of terrorism and the use of political torture to achieve targets against terrorists. <br /> <br /> History is intertwined when terrorist acts negatively affect two families. /> <br /> This is one of the best roles of Meryl Streep in recent years. She plays the cold, calculating, cunning director of the CIA, which allows these things to go on. She left George Bush-Dick Cheneyâ€™s school on the war on terror. If her role had expanded, Miss Streep would certainly have received an award during the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal is our hero. A CIA agent who really can't understand what's going on. <br /> <br /> We have a terrorist who really has a heart, and it cost him his life in this well-staged, well-paced film. <br /> <Alan Arkin briefly appears in the role of a cunning senator. Mr Arkin seems to get better with age.
