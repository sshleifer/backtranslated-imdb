I was born in 68, and I didn’t have as much parental guidance as I watched on TV (like a child in the 70s). I always liked this film (and “French Connection”), and I always tried to catch it when it was turned on (checking the guide on Sunday television in advance). I bought it on DVD a few years ago and have watched it twice since then, and I must say that I love it anyway !!!! Roy S. was a great actor of the 70s (“Jaws” is one of my all-time favorite favorites, “Marathoner”, etc.) And while “7th” is not an Oscar-worthy film, he puts you exactly at the right time in the early 70s, like French Connection), and gives you some tough characters and insight into cop life at the time. And yes, the car chase is one of the best of all time.
