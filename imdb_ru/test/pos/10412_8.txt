I think it's great that Chiller picked up this series and showed it for this generation. Filmmaking has gone a long way, especially with special effects, and in order to be able to watch archived shows, which they never knew, they will surely be able to see progress compared to today. MONSTERS are not lame and not spectacular, but interesting. Creativity is required for the types of storylines they come up with, and each generation seems to have its own horror series. This particular series was not as terrifying as Friday, the 13th, Serial, and not as adult-oriented as Freddieâ€™s nightmares ... it was something the whole family could watch, and at the same time laugh and get scared. I am happy that the channel Chiller shows this in its composition, I almost made up for lost episodes when I was growing up.
