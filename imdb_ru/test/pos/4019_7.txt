As in the first film of this series (SLAUGHTER, 1972), I think it would be a mistake to just call this film a “blacksplay film”. Undoubtedly, Slaughter is a tough, black man with a weapon in his hands, but this is more of a fighter, regardless of the color of the leader or the bad guys - and a very good fighter in that. <br /> <br /> The second and last time Jim Brown plays the title character. The film begins with one of the most stupid scenes that I can recall in the film. While Slaughter and his friends are enjoying a party in the fresh air, a biplane appears and begins to fire a group with a machine gun! No, Slaughter is not so strong that he knocks the plane with his .357! But Slaughter is noted, and no one is sure why this blow occurred - but Slaughter is going to deal with it! Well, it turns out that this blow was taken in retaliation for the last film. In this, Slaughter takes the mafia and kicks a lot of asses in Mexico. Now, in a terribly confusing and awkward attempt, the guys on the plane kill and injure quite a lot of people, but miss Slaughter. And, since the work was spoiled so badly, the Mafia boss (Ed McMahon !!) orders the pilot and the militant to be killed by his cruel killer (Don Stroud - in a very typical role for him). Stroud is great - scary and nasty to the core, but Ed McMahon is like a boss ?! Wow, this is an interesting twist! <br /> <br /> Slaughter is now at an impasse. He found out who the two guys were on the plane, but by the time he got to them, they were dead. So, to help him in his own private vendetta, Brock Peters (who plays the police officer) tells him who the gangsters are, who ordered the strike and made Slaughter agree to help, by doing some kind of illegal, secret work. So, Slaughter and his friend, a pimp, rush into the mansion of thugs and steal a paylist for key government and police officials. And, of course, in the process a lot of shooting and bloodshed. <br /> <br /> Stroud is not going to let Slaughter get away with abducting Slaughter's girlfriend. Now this confrontation - Slaughter has a list, but if he does not return it, the lady is dead. Being a tough but valiant person, you can just guess what happens next. <br /> <br /> The action of the film is very good, and Jim Brown is formidable and hard. The only drawback I noticed was that when McMahon played this nasty boss, in the end he just folded his cards — and too quickly. When Slaughter overtakes him, McMahon becomes a weakling, and all previous malice disappears - and this is too much cliché and inconsistency. Nevertheless, despite this minor joke, this is a fascinating film that is NOT intended for children because of all the violence and boobs.
