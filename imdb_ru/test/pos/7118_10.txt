I don't play video games at all, and my children play. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it a lot. I would like to see more of this type of film. “Very cool,” as my youngest would say. <br /> <br /> Interesting characters and storyline were interesting. As I said, I do not play video games, but I think my children will like it. It was not full of bad language, and it is a pleasant change. This visual concept was different, which caught my attention. Plus the sound track was pretty good. I might even try some of the games my sons play because of this movie. Who knows, maybe someday I will become a gamer.
