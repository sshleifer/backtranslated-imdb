This bitter-sweet piece of magical realism had a complex production story (director / writer replaced), and it was shot at the box office, but it's a damn movie. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazsello are preschool brothers whose children Mom (Lorraine Bracco) is bullied with a mean alcoholic (Adam Baldwin). During his drinks, Baldwin physically insults Madzello and forces him to keep quiet about his situation. But when Wood realizes what is happening, the boys fold their heads and carry a fantastic solution to the destructive Madzello dilemma. <br /> <br /> I love films in which fantasy and dark reality are mixed. They are rarely financially successful (“Lawn Dogs” is a similar example), but they are usually original and intriguing. <br /> <br /> Drunken Baldwin was shot from a low point of view of a child, and his head was deliberately chopped off below the top of the frame. This device allows us to judge him solely by his actions and as a fully physicized beast. Both Wood and Madzello are excellent, and they easily drag us into their dark, frightening world. <br /> <br /> The “radio flyer” in the title is small red vans in which children carry their belongings. dream. <br /> <br /> Seriously interesting things.
