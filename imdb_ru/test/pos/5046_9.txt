This film has just received an award for best film at the Cleveland International Film Festival. This is the American name, obviously, "Autumn Spring". The game is great. This story takes you into the life of an elderly person who takes what is given to him, and revives him a little. Incited by his best friend (and partner in a not so serious crime), he puts people at every opportunity, but still often opens his golden heart. His long-suffering wife came to an end and made a decision that will change life and be heartbreaking to watch. Resolving the story is fine.
