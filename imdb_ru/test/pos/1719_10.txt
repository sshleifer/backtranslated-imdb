I have some old videos and DVDs from Doctor Who. I played them over and over. I adore each of the Doctors for different reasons. But because of the man in the BBC hierarchy, Dr. Who was recalled, although it was still one of the pillars of the BBC. With the departure of Sylvestre McCoy, the Doctor survived thanks to the fans. BBC graciously allowed fans to write books and cartoons. The impulse of the doctor Who was steady even after 1989. Then they took a chance with Paul McGann. The film was wrong, but it gave the BBC an idea of ​​what we wanted. In 1999, the “man” disappeared, and newcomers to the BBC felt it was time to get the Doctor back. It was a complete success. Here in America, the sci-fi channel seized the chance, and it also became a complete success, although the authors had to start all over again and explain Dr. Who’s mythology to new viewers. It's incredible for me that they did it. In season 1, starring Christopher Eccleston, with Russell T. Davis as lead screenwriter and Phil Collinson as producer, the Doctor returned to us, and in each episode we learned more and more about who the Doctor was. . The Universe of the Doctor Who has always been about "Choice," "Love," and "Sacrifice." This is what they provided. It makes me want more, and it upsets me that Mr. Eccleston decided to leave the show. My first Doctor was Doctor No. 3, Dr. John Pertwee. Mr. Eccleston need not worry about his position in Dr. Who’s universe. It is as durable as the rest. He is the 9th Doctor. I didn’t know about Mr. Ecclestone before his speech at Doctor Who, but I know now. I wish there was some way, he might know that in the Doctor Who community there is an impetus to find his other work and enjoy it. We have already seen that he is a great actor.
