I could never imagine that I would begin to love such films. After watching “Hero” of Yimou Zhang, I decided to check out his other films, perhaps looking for something similar. Yimou Zhang’s second film, which I watched, was “Nobody Less”, after which I realized which cinema I am in now. No wonder why I immediately got "Keep Cool". This is a simple, touching and brilliant film, I respect the director. <br /> <br /> This film shows that it’s not so much money as a movie. The thing is that the director wants to show, and how successful he is in it. The story is very simple, a typical excerpt from typical everyday life, besides being shown in a very simple way, camera movements also reinforce the impression and feel of the film. I appreciate this film and look forward to seeing other Yimou Zhang films.
