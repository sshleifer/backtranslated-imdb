I heard news about this movie from the legendary anime Hayao Miyazaki, and I really wanted to watch it. But I was lucky enough to watch a movie online on YouTube; after watching the film, I realized that this is another classic Miyazaki / studio Ghibli. <br /> <br /> This film, inspired by my favorite fairy tale "The Little Mermaid", tells about a 5-year-old boy. named Sosuke and his relationship with a goldfish princess, whom he called Ponyu, who aspires to become a man and be with Sosuke. I will not tell you in detail, you will have to watch the movie yourself. In general, one of the best animated films ever made, with many fantasies, adventures and humor ... I really liked it!
