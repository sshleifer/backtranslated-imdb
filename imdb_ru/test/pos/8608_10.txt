Imamura's discovery of the masterpiece avoids simple sensationalism in describing the horrific events of August 6, 1945, when 90% of Hiroshima and tens of thousands of lives were destroyed in an instant. Instead, Imamura emphasizes the unprecedented oddity of the disaster, focusing on such vivid images as a devilish mushroom cloud, silently looking in the distance, and black rain that splashes onto the face of a beautiful young woman. The rest of the film traces the consequences of the last incident, as a result of which the atomic holocaust and its consequences (more than 100,000 people died from radiation poisoning) to an understandable level of distress Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka) and her small “associated bomb community.” <Br / > <br /> Survivors tend to a normal life and continuity, primarily trying to find a suitable marriage for Yasuko, but the inevitable possibility of radiation sickness overshadows every aspect of their lives. Yasuko's potential suitors naturally shy away from a young woman, no matter how attractive she is, who can suddenly fall ill and die. True love, when it finally appears, does it unexpectedly and ambiguously. We are still interested in whether love between classes is more a symbol of Yasuko’s status as a “damaged product” or of ordinary humanity thrown into bold relief because of harsh circumstances that transcends class differences. Classically discreet style enhances impact, spare, eloquent internal images remind us that Imamura began his career as an assistant to the great Ozu. Imamura's mastery is manifested, for example, in Yasuko's pair of bathing scenes, the first of which emphasizes her beautiful back and legs, the second how her hair falls out. The pictures almost resemble the trajectory of the narrative, revealing its tragic essence. Realism in the style of a documentary is violated for expressive purposes several times, perhaps most noticeably in a scene that reveals the troubled inner life of a veteran who has been shocked by a veteran. The score of the famous avant-garde composer Toru Takemitsu and the stunning black and white photography make a great contribution to the brooding atmosphere of the film. When Uncle Yasuko (Kazuo Kitamura), the laconic narrator of the film, looks at the empty sky in search of a rainbow as a sign of hope and rebirth, the black-and-white images suddenly become so sharp that they become almost unbearable. Few films from Japan (or elsewhere) can be compared to the great humanistic Japanese masterpieces of the 1950s. This film is one of them. When I first looked at it, I sat stunned, unable to move for at least five minutes, stunned by the emotions that should cause a great tragedy: horror and pity.
