Detective story is not typical for the Matrix Universe. This is a story about private noir films, with a strong storyteller and a very rich feeling. Rich in terms of its visual appeal. Snow scenes, grit - all this is staggering. <br /> <br /> But what about the story? This is interesting, even if it seems a bit out of place. Agents hire a private detective to track down Trinity. He learns that they tried the approach before, but with dangerous consequences for hired detectives. Nevertheless, he tries to find her and, eventually, succeeds, using Alice in Wonderland links, hackers and chat rooms. Then everything starts to become interesting ... <br /> <br /> In general, this is an excellent short cartoon. <br /> <br /> 8/10
