This may be the best film of 1999. No, I'm not joking. This documentary, shot by Chris Smith, reflects the very spirit of artistic coercion. Smith does the smart thing that any documentary filmmaker has to do: he remains invisible and refuses to judge his subject. <br /> <br /> While the viewer is watching Mark and his efforts, no matter how funny they are, until the end, to finish his films. He refuses to compromise and as a result suffers repeatedly. But lest we forget, remember that Spailberg, Scorsese, and others began just as modestly. <br /> <br /> And what a wonderful item he chooses. Mark, his family and friends are all exciting characters, much more than any other character created in the fictional cinematic products of last year. This film oscillates between comedy, tragedy, touching sympathy and ultimately leads us to inspire any viewer to create, despite the problems with talents, to go crazy and do something. <br /> <br /> A film about creative personalities and their hobbies. This also applies to families, no matter how interdependent and dysfunctional they are, and how unique and beautiful this organism really is. In this film, Mark turns out to be completely devoted not only to his dream, but also to his family, as well as to him. <br /> <br /> Why this film was not nominated for the documentary film of the year is beyond my means and criminal (that is, it is assumed that he had a right last year). This film must be sought and appreciated.
