If you asked me how the film went through the whole film, I would say it was great! However, I left the theater feeling unsatisfied. Thinking a little about it, I believe that the problem was the speed of the final. I feel that most of the movie was moving quite slowly, and then the final was developing very quickly. So I would say that the final disappointed me. <br /> <br /> I thought the characters are well developed. Costner and Kutcher both played their roles perfectly. Yes! Ashton Kutcher can act! In addition, the different relationships between the characters seemed very real. In addition, I thought that the various storylines were well developed. In general, it was a good film, and I would recommend to watch it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: good characters, great plot, poorly written / edited final. Nevertheless, go look !!!
