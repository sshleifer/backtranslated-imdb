There are too many people on this board who obviously missed the delicate wit of this series. <br /> <br /> This show is great because it's a fun parody of yourself. Guys who are self-proclaimed stallions are given a real opportunity to convince us of their seduction abilities, until they "come out on the field," just to show their complete absence of "playing" on national television is absolutely fun, and irresistible to watch, as they easily entice pretentious women who visit these trendy nightclubs! <br /> <br /> He celebrates a unique charisma when he deserves, and mocks delusional bags when he deserves. In any case, it is always interesting, because, unlike other dating shows, it perfectly reflects the true awkwardness and excitement of the pickup. I highly recommend this show to anyone who has a sense of humor.
