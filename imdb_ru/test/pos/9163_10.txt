Filmed less than a year after the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, the topic was fresh in the heads of the actors, the director and the audience. Most of the actors are real soldiers and officers who have just returned from the war. The Soviet army collaborated during the shooting, which is strange. <br /> <br /> Afghan intervention was a bloody and senseless war, in which even the generals forgot the causes of bloodshed. This film shows the tension and cruelty of military life, the emotional atrophy experienced by the troops, and the pain that shook a small nation torn apart by war and civil war. <br /> <br /> There is no shortage of powerful scenes. One of the first is the frames with steel coffins loaded on transport going to the USSR. The soldiers go about their business, and the officer calmly notes the destinations: Moscow, Rostov, Donetsk, Baltic. <br /> <br /> The previous commentary describes the last scene with Major Pandora as illogical. This is completely logical in the spirit of the film: the only human relations that Bandura maintained were with an Afghan family, which he accidentally killed during the assault. Having lost his only buffer against the senselessness of war, Bandura turns his back to the boy (and his gun) as a sign of humility with his fate. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the last scene: a flock of the 28s rise above the mountains, when the pilot's voice shouts: â€œWe're leaving! Get out guys! (We are leaving! Boys, we are leaving!) With a tone of sincere relief. <br /> <br /> Afkhansky Break A great movie - ruthlessly honest and ruthless.
