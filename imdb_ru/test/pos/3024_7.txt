I remember seeing the trailer for this film when it was first released, and it looked pretty cool. I never managed to see it. When I went to Blockbuster to shoot a few videos, I decided that I should watch it. In the end, I really liked The Silence of the Lambs and Se7en, and if you liked these films, you could enjoy Cage. The whole concept of the story is very interesting. Entering physically into the killerâ€™s head, I cannot imagine the world in which they live. Acting is actually pretty decent. Jennifer Lopez is the only one who has to say that it was not so great, but she does a believable job. I would recommend a scary action movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
