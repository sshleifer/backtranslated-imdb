I have to rate this movie at 10. Sorry, but I think this is a classic comedy. then if you rate it on other Madonna films ... well, what? Do you want to tell me that this was not her best movie? Didnâ€™t Mira Sorvino get an Oscar for almost the same performance, not ten years later? Please, this film deserves much more respect than it receives. In addition, I like to think of this as a sociological study of the lifestyle of the 80s. Remember when you could steal in the store from Sam Goody and Cartier one day? Remember when women proudly wore thick eyebrows? so it was not the "Last Emperor", it was still good. There are certain films that I would like to watch every day. three, in fact, that liven up my day and make me smile. if you like "Who's that girl?" then I would also recommend "Party Girl" and "Reunion of Romy and Michelle High School".
