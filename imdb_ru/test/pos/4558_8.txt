I saw this film without knowing absolutely neither about him nor about his stars, Chris Farley and David Spade, and I must say that this film is a comic classic. Sometimes he is so stupid that he can only be cheerful. Farley is great as the awkward idiot who is walking along the road with his father's right hand (as excellent Spade) to find funding to save the family car parts business. Relax, turn on the autopilot and enjoy the fun. The magnificent cast includes such favorite films as Brian Dennehy (Cocoon), Rob Lowe (Wayne World) and Bo Derek (“10”). It is highly recommended to laugh.
