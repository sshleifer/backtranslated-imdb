Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford were once criminal friends, but now Scott is the sheriff, and the young Ford is still hiring a gun. He is hired to work in a bank, but he is delayed to get to the city, and those who have hired him get someone else. This leads to all sorts of complications, especially for a film that does not last even 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Randy and Glenn have girls here. Claire Trevor plays his usual pastime with a heart of gold. And Evelyn Case - the daughter of Edgar Buchanan, who falls in love with Ford, not understanding who he is or why he came to the city, where Scott is the sheriff. <br /> <br /> This is a western city, but unusual for Columbia Pictures time and was given a full technical color treatment. "Desperate" celebrated the first Glenn Ford film in the style of "technicolor", a process intended only for some of the more expensive films of larger studios. Harry Cohn, of course, was not one of those who forked him. And definitely not during the war. <br /> <br /> The story gets a bit confusing, as both Ford and Scott are tested by friendship versus expediency / duty. The plot also involves high-class hypocritical skunks in the city of Randy, who are the real criminals against the film. <br /> <br /> Four characters do an excellent job with their work, and the best supporting role is Gwynn Williams in the role of Ford, an attractive explosive bastard of a sidekick. The climax is the stampede of cattle and the shootout in the city saloon, and this is one of the best films ever made in Western films. <br /> <br /> Fans of four leads and westerns in general will love this movie.
