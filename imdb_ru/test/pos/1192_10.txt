I will not say anything about music, because this topic can be so deep that it can become one huge separate review, so let's focus on a brilliant film ... Without a doubt, one of Foreman's best works. <Br /> <br /> A simple story about love, friendship, freedom and ideals ... oh yes, ideals for which even pacifists are ready to go to war ... <br /> <br /> There is not a single fake word , one fake character, one fake feeling in the story, because love, freedom and friendship are not difficult for film characters. These things are not something that "everyone can see from a different angle." This is not something that you need to think a lot to understand ... their love is simple, their friendship is simple, their ideals are as simple as the word “simple” in itself, and that is why these characters are so deep. <br /> <br /> Berger, the hippie leader played by Tit Williams, is the guy who lives to live, and this is his greatest happiness ... he has an ass - (he sings in one of the movie scenes) and this is enough to please him with his property ... <br /> <br /> Berger never recognizes that something cannot be done ... and it is right ... If he wants to go to a banquet a rich guy in his dirty old clothes and huge long hair, he will do it ... if he wants to go to another state just to see his friend, he will do it ... he never thinks twice ... he just does it. <br /> <br /> How? why is he so strong? The answer is simple: because it is FREE. <br /> <br /> Just see how the wind makes a wave of hair in this film, and you will understand it all, you may even free yourself.
