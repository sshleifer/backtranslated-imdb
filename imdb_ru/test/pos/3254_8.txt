After seeing this film in Australia and loving it, I really wanted to be given copies. I got one on a dvd in the uk just to find it was a completely different editing. <br /> <br /> Inner Australian editing, which I saw, is faster. Great Britain, and I believe that the European edits spend much more time on the narrator played by the dead brother Jimmy. And, in truth, this and some other points do not provide any real benefit. <br /> <br /> This is not serious criticism, but Oz is more lively, and I think itâ€™s more confident. <br /> <br /> I cannot say why they felt that it needs expansion for the overseas market? <br /> <br /> one you go. <br /> <br /> I went to both.
