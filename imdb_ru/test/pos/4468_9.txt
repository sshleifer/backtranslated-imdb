As far as I know, I have seen most of Lucio Fulci’s films, with the exception of some later ones that now appear on DVD, and I would have to say that this was his best offer “before the zombie.” In fact, it beats his later films. This is a story about superstitions and suspicions in a small Italian town, in the middle of nowhere, where young people die mysteriously. It's not a secret how they died, I think the point is who does this. Is this a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch? Is this a young woman who lives in a quaint modern house on the outskirts of the city who used a lot of drugs? This is a village idiot who was caught early because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time? You will only know if you look and see how you should, because this is a first-class mystical thriller, or, I should say, "giallo". I saw it before, but it was a long time ago, and after the second viewing it was still as powerful as the first time. For those of you who only know Lucio Fulci from his zombie films, well, open your minds to this, because it’s worth seeing, and although the “monsters” in this person are, they are just as vile as all found in his later films, 9 out of 10 stars, look! You are welcome....
