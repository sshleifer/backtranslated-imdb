“Greetings to a woman” is one of the most touching films I've ever seen in my entire life. I watched it twice in a row and sobbed. <br /> <br /> This silent film masterpiece deserves a much wider audience; unfortunately, the only remaining imprint is so badly scratched that most people will not look through it, and they will miss the precious stone shining under the rough. This film could use digital restoration to help uncover its beauty, but I doubt that it will receive it from anyone, since its main theme is “Spiritual restoration before Christ of the family”, and this is not politically correct today. However, this remains a strong theme for those whose hearts suffer from the pain of a broken family relationship. <br /> <br /> The cast is great, especially Florence Widor, who literally glows like Judith, a daughter; ethereal Madge Bellamy in the role of Nan, a poor girl who got pregnant and was thrown off; Theodore Roberts is like a capricious old domineering father who destroys everyone around him through pride; and handsome Lloyd Hughes, like the son of David, is afraid of his father, but in reality life itself. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, especially for Christmas. You will not regret that you are patient and are looking at it in its entirety, despite its deterioration.
