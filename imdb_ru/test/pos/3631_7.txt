Let's be honest: there are no rules for writing scripts, so I will not say that a movie MUST be something other than what it is. I just give my opinion. Well, I really liked the script, the way of telling things and representing the characters. However, I think that when a game is adapted to a silver screen, it may try to adapt this other medium. Since this film was shot by Joao Falcao, the same person who put on the play is not surprising that the film was too dramatic. This is the first film of this man, because he cries out loud! I want to say that there are roles in the film - for example, the city of Nordestin, which is a bit like the TV series Hodge and Dia Maria - as if we were not in a movie theater. We are in the theater! The lines are pronounced too formally, the characters move choreographically, and the lighting is clearly intended for the scene. Of course, perhaps it was an intention, but it was done. On the stage. Remarkable things were done in adapting the play to the film - for example, the beautiful “Closer”. When I went to see this movie, I did not feel that I was watching a movie. But overall, it was good, worth seeing. This is a good love story, funny at times and sad for others. My vote is 7.
