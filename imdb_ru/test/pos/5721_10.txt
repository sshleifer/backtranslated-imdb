John Leguizamo's one man show - hit or miss: Mambo Mouth showed its intense characteristics and a great time, but the material was average, Spic-o-Rama also performed the first one, but this time the material was funny, Freak is a classic of his disappointing sex o-naughty But his material in Freak demonstrates his genius, and when he is in the center of attention, he has no equal. <br /> <br /> Freak’s semi-autobiographical view of a young man’s journey has the power and resonance I don’t think even his creator knew about. By allowing us a chance to see his soul, Mr. Leguizamo gives us the opportunity to project our own life onto him, and the performer cannot give a greater gift. Willingness to drop the “Wall”, expose and share it is too terrible for most actors - they use characters to hide behind their backs - but J.L. is in full swing and happily smashes any pretense. Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor were our best cultural observers / comedians / actors because they spoke from the bottom of their hearts about what they noticed in society, and the truth gave a sharp humor. Combine this with the gift of the great actor of facial expression and instant presence (not to mention the feeling of humanity), and you will see that John Leguizamo has the power to do the same. At least in Fricke, he does it. <br /> <br /> From birth to his first big break and every life-changing moment, the viewer sees our host and other characters in their most solitary moments, all the time experiencing pain, hope and humor that comes with. Looking emaciated and lean, muscular, JL calls from the sweat by the end of the evening, offering his crazy life to the audience; Continuous operation of the camera Spike Lee captures the nuances of the actor until the last twisting of the lips and slow blinking. Scenarios range from drinking alcohol with his father's father (when he was 9 years old) to watching the line of the choir with his cheerful, deaf uncle; the cruel humiliation of his first girlfriend when he undresses, trying to have sex. The nightmarish first sexual encounter with a large German woman in the back of a fried chicken in Kentucky followed an unsuccessful attempt to pick up a "drunk Catholic" in a bar on St. Pattis Day. Completing a serious confrontation with his mother and father, it is here that he shows his real genius: he plays the scene between these two characters and himself and his brother with such strong dramatic / humorous intensity that you forget that only one person is watching. There are no costume changes, bad wigs, light tricks or makeup. Just the actor gives it all. This is just awesome. <br /> <br /> Other actors / comedians that stand out now are Eddie Izzard and Chris Rock, but they don’t plunge into themselves as deeply as John Leguizamo; This is not a criticism, not a single shot. I love their job, but the freak is different. He moves no-b *******. This is the best that a person can show, and no one can touch him for a long time.
