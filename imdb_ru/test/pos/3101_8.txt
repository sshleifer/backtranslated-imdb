Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost freely rise from the place where the Egg and I stopped. For the first solo adventure Dummies introduced a new team of writers and director. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of Egg and Me, was the producer of Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many characters played by the same actors and actresses, the focus from McDonald's to Dummies works very well. There is a mention that the mother beat Birdie Hicks for the first prize at the fair for her blanket, the import scene in Egg and Me. The prize money from the quilts competition was to be used to send Tom Kettle to college. In this film, Tom returns home as a college graduate. <br /> <br /> In this film, two stories are intertwined. One of them is the comedy of a simple mountain family moving into a modern home. The other is an easy moral game about how the environment affects children as they get older. <br /> <br /> Pa Kettle (Percy Kilbride) wanted to get a free tobacco bag for the competition and eventually won the house. His disappointment that he did not receive a free tobacco bag is often played out for laughter. When Pa is playing with dynamite, he doesn't notice the explosion at all. Kilbride did not flinch when the debris from the explosion struck him. He played his part to perfection. In his autobiography, Jack Benny mentioned how impressed he was with Percy Kilbrideâ€™s unpromising delivery. Kilbride brought this comedy device to a high level of perfection. <br /> <br /> Ma (Marjorie Mine) and Pa are moving to a new home with modern amenities that confuse Ma and Pa almost as much as they help them. Ma adapts much faster than Pa. Modern amenities include a TV, a very new household item in 1949. Moving walls, hidden beds and plumbing are used as comics, but attention is paid to Ma and Pa, never the details themselves. <br /> <br /> Tom Kettle (Richard Long) meets Kim Parker (Meg Randall), a journalist who believes hygiene and the environment are necessary for children to succeed in adulthood. Tom is a bright, self-made person who contradicts the theory that success can come only from the original environment. This topic is briefly discussed in several scenes, but remains afloat. It was also the only serious discussion in this otherwise bizarre film. <br /> <br /> Seeing the teapots coming out of their dilapidated old home and moving to a new home would be almost a disaster if the characters were not true to themselves. Mom was practical, just like she was in Egg, and me. Pa was the fish out of the water that gave the best comedy. He never felt at home in a new house, but the actual location of a comfortable bed will never bother him.
