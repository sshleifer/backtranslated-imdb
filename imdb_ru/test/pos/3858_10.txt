Aristorcats is a fun movie that not many have seen. It is clear that not so much, because he received only 6.8. There is nothing wrong. This is my favorite classic Disney, which has already made many fantastic films. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White and Peter Pan. The reason The Aristorcats is so high on my list is how funny the movie is. I hate to say it, but I donâ€™t blame Edgar for what he does. I would probably also take care of them. I would have been devastated by some old bag that I had worked with for so many years, just decide to transfer my will to cats. I would kill them too. I don't even like cats, so I don't give a damn. I think Aristorcats are so funny and cute. There are many funny characters like Edgar. Aristorcats is my favorite Disney classic, and it is final. The cat came out of the bag. <br /> <br /> Aristocrats: **** / ****
