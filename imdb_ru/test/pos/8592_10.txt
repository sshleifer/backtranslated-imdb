When it comes to political films, I usually feel drained. As a rule, they take some moralistic stance, and you have a clear good or bad storyline, as if this is some kind of film about Batman. <br /> <br /> But with Lumumba, this is the first film that I saw, which showed the policy for what it is, and the real problems of trying to rule the country of broken people who knew no other rule than violence. There was nothing good or bad, there were only interests and conflicts of interest. In my opinion, this is the only political film from which you can really learn. This film shows you, especially for those who look at politics as a career. You can not be guided by what you want for the country, but what the country wants from you. <br /> <br /> So I disagree with many of the reviews that say everyone is going bad, I think they are too idealistic (the Belgians want a perfect colony, Lumumba wants perfect unity, Congo, Tshombe wants wealth and wealth, America wants an ideal ally against communism, Russia wants an ideal assistant for communism). And the congolese? They give up used and offended (the best example in the film, when General Janssens tells his black troops that your government has deceived you, and this causes them dissatisfaction), they are always attracted and pushed to support this or that person. <Br /> <br /> This film shows in politics that a mistake can cost you dearly, and in this film everyone makes mistake after mistake until he escalates and destroys the country. Their intentions may be good (or, at least, according to the characters), but these are the mistakes of all that lead to the fall of the Congo. I do not think that someone is bad in this film, I just think that they want too much from people who are tired of giving, and want to start shooting. <br /> <br /> In general, this is not just the best political film, it is a great film in general. The acting is incredible (Erik Ebuyane, because Lumumba was the perfect actor, I really believe him), the script is flawless, edits the perfect tempo, and the production cost is higher than I expected for a Central African film. Must watch.
