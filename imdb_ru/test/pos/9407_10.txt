I thought this movie was excellent. John Foster is one of my all-time favorite actors, he was as beautiful as Michael Skakel. I found everything in it magnificent: acting, costumes, staging, directing, photography, script, music, etc. Spoilers are coming! <br /> <br /> Spoilers are coming! You have been warned! <br /> <br /> Martha Moxley, whom they told the story in the film, was beaten to death by her cruel restless neighbor Michel Skacel. Michel did it out of the envy of his brother Tommy, when Martha rejected him and took Tommy instead. Fortunately, they caught him a few years later, and he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Although, I think he should have been sentenced to "natural life" without the possibility of parole. <br /> <br /> Glory to the actors, film crew and directors. Two thumbs up.
