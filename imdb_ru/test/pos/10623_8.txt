Reading the comments seems to have a lot of nonsense about the emotional banality of La Pianiste. I find it hard to understand, given the outstanding game of Isabel Huppert. Huppert captures - she manages to perfectly convey a woman to the brink of self-hatred and delusion. <br /> <br /> The film is wonderfully drawn and appreciated. It would be so easy to portray leadership as a ridiculous figure â€” consider a scene in a porn store, for example. Anyway, Huppert can handle it, partly because of her brilliant performance, and also because the director makes her surrealistic life real and recognizable. <br /> <br /> Don't ignore this movie. This is one of the most striking and interesting films (and performances) I've seen. <br /> <br /> Trust Boris!
