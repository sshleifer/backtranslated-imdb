First, I really liked this movie. As a fan of Billy Crystal, I have to say that I expected more comedic situations than actually. Nevertheless, it was nice to see him in a role with greater depth and emotion. His image of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly executed and uniquely his. In addition, Gheorghe Mureshan (like Maximus) was great in his first movie role. When Sammy travels to Romania to visit his client on the spot, his world turns upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the only person who could change his life. Sammy and Max's journey is unique, touching and sometimes even funny. In addition, the place in the Czech Republic, where parts of the film were shot, was absolutely beautiful. I have to say that this dramatic comedy made me feel different emotions. I thought it was excellent and I recommend it to everyone.
