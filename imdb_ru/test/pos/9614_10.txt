Released in the UK as KING BOXER <br /> <br /> In essence, this film was the FIRST Kung Fu movie released in the UK. Many of us went through the amazingly tough and fascinating drama of Kurosawa and were used for oriental films. to be beautifully shot and lit, with a somewhat restrained rhythm, in general, like flipping through an album of very good still photos that have just been moved. <br /> <br /> Forward Run Run Shaw and co. with their wide-screen production values ​​of "home cinema", and the amazing duplication of "ripe for parody", and all the rules have changed. King Boxer was the first to pass through the door, leaving a clearly marked trail for others who stood firmly on the steps above the glittering steps. <br /> <br /> Despite the plot lines, the game of pantomime, cheerful jump-folders and spaghetti in the western style with a quick step, this film was amazing. Gorgeous, not rich and with the most brilliant battle choreography to decorate the screen. We liked nauseous violence, torment, testosterone. Masters of martial arts among us found some tricks to be fascinating, although bright and often stupid. It was very different from the Japanese material that we all knew, and he had a wonderful acrobatic grace that perfectly complemented the sickening violence and bloodied floors. Delightful. <br /> <br /> The KIng Lear scene was a rather important milestone at the time: “You are a cruel bastard .. My **** !!” Now it is a little less shocking, but still annoying. <br /> <br /> We did not notice that women in sight were absolutely one-dimensional. After seeing more films of this genre, he now stands out as a sore thumb, but at the time it didn’t matter <br /> <br /> This film determined that it would quickly become a kung fu cliche. All of them. Look at it and remember that until it flashed on the western screens, there was no genre into which to insert it. It was unique and amazing. It was the first Kung Fu movie, and for me and many others it is still the best.
