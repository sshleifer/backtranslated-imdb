20 years later, and this film still echoes its greatness. Never before has the film surpassed the incredible soundtrack for the film “The Girl from the Valley”. The film fully captured the 80s to such an ideal degree that it could be realized only after many years. Nicolas Cage at his best. The film, in which so many characters that it makes you realize how sad Hollywood has become (as far as quality). A special DVD edition is loaded with tons of add-ons and is worth buying because you’ll have a lot of stuff to watch. For sure.
