Summing up this story in several sentences: a teenage girl (Amy) uses her hot body and “presumed” virginity to seduce a young problem guy (Matt) with a potential football scholarship to provide her a “full trip” to the country, Come to find out that she has a good reputation and has slept with many footballers in the past, hoping that they will offer her the same deal. Both of these children came from dysfunctional and dysfunctional families. Matt's mothers are alcoholics who constantly confuse him in front of their friends, and Amy's mother herself had a bad reputation and became pregnant by Amy at a young age. Matt falls in love with Amy and tries to fix his life for her. Very predictable ending. The actress who plays "Amy" is actually 33 years old, she is trying to play a teenager!
