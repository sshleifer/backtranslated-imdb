Do not change your husband, on the one hand, the beginning of a series of light family comedies from Cecil B. DeMille. On the other hand, this is his first film in which Gloria Swanson starred, probably the greatest actress in the era of silence, and the film that made her a star. <br /> <br /> Although DeMill's old formula began to change, and his films became more verbose and less purely visual, with such an expressive performer as Swanson, we return most of this silent style of storytelling. Her character does very little, but conveys volumes through subtle gestures and facial expressions ?? with a special talent for the appearance of contempt. In real life, Swanson herself was nearing the end of her destructive marriage with Wallace Beery, and it is quite possible that this fact fueled her convincing performance. <br /> <br /> As if in the best way complements the talents of his lead lady, DeMillem's use of framing and close-ups are especially strong here. Does he use cinematic technique to show acting skills ?? often kept Swanson in long close-ups at key moments ?? and clarify the story visually. For example, when we meet a Toodles character, she is reflected three times in the mirror of the dressing table. Her character disappears from history, only to become important by the end. This exciting first shot helps us remember who she was. Later, at the anniversary dinner, Svenson and future husband number two Lew Cody were combined into one frame, and Elliot Dexter was isolated in his own frame. Also ?? and this is a sign of the growing sophistication of the movie in general ?? There are many benefits of reaction shots ?? for example, the bishop's disapproving gaze when Cody plays out his intentions with dolls for the wedding. <br /> <br /> Unlike the DeMille visual narration method, the more and more verbose text of his collaborator Jeanie MacPherson. As I mentioned in several other comments, MacPherson could have made up a strong and dramatic story, but, like DeMille, she tended to express her themes in a somewhat pretentious and bright style. And so we get these very long quasi-philosophical title cards about the pitfalls in family life, which, if they improve the story at all, just because they are unintentionally funny. For example, only Jeanie MacPherson could come up with a line like "Fate is sometimes hidden in Christmas shopping." Fortunately, although in this picture these headers mostly represent scenes, rather than break them. <br /> <br /> Although the pictures made by him at that time tended to be small, it was at this very moment that DeMill developed his taste for the spectacular. You can see how he begins to sneak up on excuses of a small number of razzmatazz like Swanson's little fantasy scenes showered with "Pleasure, wealth and love." Only in the early twenties, after the unofficial embargo on historical images will be lifted, will he get a chance for a grandiose spectacle. <br /> <br /> In general, do not change your Husband - DeMill's pretty decent silent picture, although, to be honest, only Gloria Swanson does raise her above average. Curiously, this is supposedly a comedy, and Swanson was played, at least in part, because of her experience in the farcical factory of Mac Sennett. She hated the comedy game, and here gives a dramatic, not a comic presentation. Then it makes sense that the only direct drama that she filmed with Demille, a man and a woman, was the strongest of their collaboration.
