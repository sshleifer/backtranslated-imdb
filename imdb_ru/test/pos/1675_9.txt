Or vice versa. <br /> <br /> This is a French film noir, shot by an American director (Jules Dassin), who had to leave the country due to the fact that Hollywood was blacklisted by HUAC. The essence of this story is quite familiar - the last treasure for Tony le Stefanua and his friends - and it also ends when everyone gets ... Well, there are no spoilers, of course, since this is a kind of film in which tension to the final is important. <br /> <br /> Dassin was shot in realistic black and white lighting on the streets of Paris using actors and actresses who are not adorable. Georges Aurick’s spectacular — and sometimes obsessive — score pleasantly enhances the film and will remind viewers of many similar points from American films of the forties of the forties and early fifties. Jean Servays plays a hardcore, merciless role in Fedor just as Humphrey Bogart could play. Tony was recently released from prison, after his heyday, but he is still cruel and decisive when he should be, his mind is still sharp when focused, that type of antihero whose eyes are watering, although tears will never fall. <br /> Dassin plays Italian fireworks and a potential lady who knows the rules, but becomes careless. <br /> <br /> In the film “Noir,” the logic and focus of the film force us to identify with the bad guys. There are often levels of bad guys, “bad” bad guys, with whom we identify ourselves, and “bad” bad guys, who want to work with our good bad guys, and maybe there is a really bad, bad bad guy or two. (Here we have Remy Grootter, played by Robert Hossain, a slightly sadistic junkie.) Then there are policemen who have nothing to do or almost like that. In a more modern film noir, bad guys are not even “good” bad guys, and they get away with it or something like that. In the old film “Noir”, which developed from the gangster films of the thirties, the usual motto, following the old Hollywood “code”, was “Crime does not pay” when each criminal had to pay for his crime before the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Probably the most impressive feature of Rififi is how well the movie is moving. The plot unfolds quickly and without problems, as did great directors, such as Stanley Kubrick, Louis Mallet and the best of Hitchcock. Some compare it to Killing the Kubrick (1956) and suggest that Kubrick stole a little. Well, the directors always steal if necessary, and there are some, perhaps, demonstrative similarities, such as the “last plunder” for the main character and the fact that the girl sticks together the works. The similarity can go deeper, because when this film came to an end, I suddenly thought, oh, no! the suitcase in the back seat will fly out of the cabriolet, fall to the ground, explode, and all the money will fly into the air! Those of you who have seen Murder can remember what happened to the money near the end of the movie! Which reminds me of another movie with something bad that happens with money: the turn of Oliver Stone (1997) with Sean Penn in the lead role. There, the money in his backpack was scattered like a shotgun. Ha ha ha! Obtaining a duplicate version of this film would be an act of blasphemy, since the dialogue (when it is: the robbery itself is done completely without dialogue, costs about 30 minutes) is brief and easy to understand, requiring only a casual look at the subtitles. Which, by the way, are very utilitarian and guide, and not prescribe every word. <br /> <br /> Another thing: all the cruelty is done as sex was done in the movies, that is, the camera. The guy cut his throat. We do not see this. I like this approach. We don't need to see blood. You could almost let your children see Rifi - almost. <br /> <br /> Catch it right now and look for a Hollywood replay in the lead role with Al Pacino under the direction of Harold Becker next year, in which you can be sure that the violence will be played out in full.
