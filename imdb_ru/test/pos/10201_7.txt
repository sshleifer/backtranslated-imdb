WESTERN UNION in a melodramatic manner tells about the location of the telegraph lines between two points in the west. The brothers and sisters Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore work at Western Union, and Randolph Scott and Robert Young work at Creightons. Indians and some bad white guys get in the way, but nothing can stop Americaâ€™s progress. This feeling of manifest fate is greatly enhanced by musical accompaniment and bright color photography. Scott is a bank robber who is trying to rectify his position, and he and Engineer Young vie for the attention of merry Gilmore. Many outstanding character actors help promote big production.
