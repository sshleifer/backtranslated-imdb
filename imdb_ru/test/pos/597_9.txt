This film is one of my favorite childhood memories. Seeing dolls (in the midst of their popularity), Hollywood heads, singing and dancing, with Miss Piggy watching in front of her beloved Kermit, Fozzy Bear does everything possible as a manager for everyone, and the generous cast of “extras” delivering the film that turned out to be “Okay Dukey”. <br /> <br /> Kermit's melancholic ukulele number “Rainbow Communication” was nominated for an Oscar the same year, but was knocked out by Norma Ray “It Goes Like It Goes.” I will choose Kermit's song any day! Get children and enjoy this timeless fantasy ... someday they will find her, bright connections, lovers, dreamers and me!
