When I first saw this film, I also expected that “our guys” would be cute and look more like an extended version of a TV show. I did not "understand" then. But years later, at a party YEARS later, in the PAR-TAY of the 70s, when some substances smoked, inhaled and with lots of tequila, “HEAD” was late at night. understood what a "HEAD" is. It faked their own show, as shown in one song that called itself a "fabricated image." As Davy Jones wrote in his autobio, “They made a monkey out of me,” he openly admits that everyone in the film smoked weed all night. They ridiculed themselves, society, everything! Great movie! That is, being a 52-year-old grandmother, I no longer “play around”, I STILL watch this movie when I want a good one LOL !!!
