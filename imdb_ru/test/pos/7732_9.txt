Just great. This is a long time. No climax. Do not wait for something to happen. Great for a rainy day. About a person experiencing a mid-life crisis who sends his family to a secluded corner of the Greek islands. I saw it as a teenager and still love it more than 20 years later. However, I could not find it in the video stores. Molly Ringwald is a cute average teenager who basically wants to go home, and then sort of settles in this place. There are no telephones, no TV, no boredom, from which, with such silence, a person should be bored and then pondered. And each character does it. Susan Sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to be sexually connected to the character of John Cassavetes, but he cannot, well, you know. Gina Rowlands, a wife who loves him, but is about to give up her marriage. He is demanding and upsetting everyone. In the film, there is another character, a Greek, who inappropriately talks to Molly Ringwald about sex, but about things she is curious about. But he is annoying and exciting, and I didnâ€™t like this character. The scene of the film is what makes this film so good. It wouldn't work if they shot somewhere else. I recommend this film and give it 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.
