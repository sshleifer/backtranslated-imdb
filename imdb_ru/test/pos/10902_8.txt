After reading the comment made about this film, and now watching it, I can understand how the person treated him. Decisions were made after listening to common sense. When the movie came out, I heard information about how it appeared. The storyline was made from a real event. During the awards ceremony, the actor, thanking all the people, attributed the award to the former school teacher, unexpectedly putting a person in retirement. <br /> <br /> Of course, many people come out of the closet more every day. Each departure is different for each person. In real life, the result of any person will be different. And being willing to accept who they are is the most important thing in life to achieve personal happiness. For others, joy and honest acceptance can make life much more complete. For a film, the result of how Howard came out is much more comedic than real life. And the acceptance of the community showed others that Howard was himself and nothing else. <br /> <br /> Overall, the performances were crazy. Memorable quotes and the use of music complement the stereotypes in the world, but are taken with language and cheek humor. This is a movie. Sit down, keep an open mind and laugh.
