This movie was incredible! It looked like a big budget, but it felt sincere and original, like indie. The most amazing part of this film was the amazing performances of David Beazley, Mark Hildret and Paul Anthony, who plays a major role. He carried this film with ease, humor and charisma, balanced with immense depth. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was really beautiful, although some of the plots were rather ugly. It was not very realistic, but it did not have to be more important. It was really great to see Alan Cumming in this. The script was tense and it went very well with some of the best actors Iâ€™ve ever seen. <br /> <br /> Go and see.
