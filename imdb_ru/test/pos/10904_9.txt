Kevin Kline offers a brilliant comic twist on the 1997 comedy IN & OUT. Klein plays Howard Brackett, a small town history teacher who enthusiastically sits down to watch an Oscar this year because one of his former students (Matt Dillon) is a candidate. He is nominated for his role in the film where he plays a gay soldier, and when he wins, he thanks Howard for his performance for inspiring him because Howard is gay. Now, this is Howard's word, because he doesnâ€™t know why, in this way, the guy would say that on international television. Howard is even engaged to get married (to Joan Cusack in an Oscar-nominated performance), so he has no idea where Dillon is; Cameron Drake realized that he was gay and thought he had to defend himself in front of everyone at school, but he was shocked that no one seemed terribly shocked by what Cameron said at the Oscars. Howard has a birthday party where he is presented with birthday presents, for example, the soundtrack for YENTL, and at the end he explains to his guests why Barbra Streisand should have made FUNNY LADY. His parents (Wilford Brimley, Debbie Reynolds) are shocked, but promise to support his son, even if he is gay. He is also visited by a reporter from the city (Tom Selleck) who wants to write an article about him because he is also gay. The moment when Selleck gets a big kiss right on Klein's lips is a classic. But all these little things make Howard question his sexuality and wonder if he is really gay ... much to the aggravation and disappointment of his bride, Cusack, who is confused. The scene where she leaves the bar in her wedding dress and stands in the middle of the street, shouting about the lack of single men in the world, is a classic. But what I like about this movie is how Kline fully invests in this role and was not afraid to look stupid or look gay. There is an incredible scene, probably the most famous from the movie where he buys a record, about how to be a macho, and the guy on the record talks about how real men don't dance, and a disco tune appears. SURVIVES if memory serves), and the narrator on the record says that no matter what you do, do not dance, but Howard cannot help himself, and he eventually shakes his groove all over the room. It's hysterically funny, and Klein plays with sincerity and pleasure. The film is not about or not against gays ... it's just a clever and funny character study about a man trying to figure out who he really is. Great movie.
