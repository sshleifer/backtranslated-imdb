I am tired of TV shows with young and ignorant people who constantly talk about their “problems”, self-centered, boring and completely annoying (“Popular; Dawson Creek; Beverly Hills; etc.) Hacking is a breath of fresh air, with a great actor (David Morse), a completely different story, trustworthy people with REAL problems (thank God !!) and very, very good stories. I just love it !! I hope that the “Hacking” will continue for a long time, because this is a great television series for adults, for a change.
