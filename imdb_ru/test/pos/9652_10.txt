This is the best French film of the year! I saw it twice, and I found it superbly both times. I did not think it was boring, although it is very long (3 hours). I am seventeen, so I clearly could not survive the events of May 1968, which marked an extremely important turn in French history, but this does not matter much, since I still really enjoyed the film. This is actually quite universal: people of the age of my parents can identify with the characters, as well as people of my age. Garrell seems to understand young people perfectly, their way of thinking and the complications of love, as well as the loss of illusions about the possibility of changing the world. Perhaps this is because the character played by Louis Garrel (his son) should actually represent Philip Garrel himself. Well, in any case, an excellent film, no action (must be honest in this matter), but such strong feelings that you can not remain indifferent to him. If you are looking for a relaxing movie on Sunday evening, do not waste time on this, you will be disappointed. But if you like movies, you’ll love Les Amants Réguliers, a fascinating film close to those made by Nouvelle Vague artists in the 1950s and 1960s.
