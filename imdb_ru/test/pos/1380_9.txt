I would buy it for a dollar !!! <br /> <br /> I bought this film for a dollar, and I saw much worse for so much more !! <br /> <br /> This is a Scottish sci-fi film from Mark Stirton and, according to “The Manufacture” (however, in hysterics), cost only $ 8,000. Eight great !!! It will not pay for half a minute in Hollywood! Nevertheless ---- This is the most interesting movie. If you like rude things, then a treat awaits you. This is some rude character with rough voices and harsh curses. I did not mind, but my friend did !! The actors do an excellent job, and it’s interesting to see people I have never heard of or seen before. This meant that I had no idea who would die first. <br /> <br /> If you are watching a movie about “the latest of the latest” visual effects, then see Star Wars. The effects here are fine, but a bit weak in space. But monsters are very well made, if a little anticipated. <br /> <br /> Stirton is not doing a very amazing job, and I would like to see his view of a real Hollywood movie. At least it was not predictable, and I almost fell off the chair when one dude tore his head off !!! Well, so this is a small derivative of other sci-fi, but for this budget it is an amazing attempt, and anyone who thinks that making a sci-fi film for the 8s is easy or happens, many obviously do not know anything about film industry. <br /> <br /> Good marks for a good film, additional marks for such hard work, additional marks for really interesting film making. There is no standard bull here, all production problems boil down to making it look like “Lost in Manche” only with a film at the end. But why no comments? Keep up the shot!
