William M. Thackeray once said: "A good laugh is the sunlight in the house." When I watched Take Away, I must say that the sun was shining in my house. This film was great, the discovery was made very cleverly, the story kept together, in a nutshell - the two owners of the fish-n-chip shop, who usually enemies have to create a kind of alliance to participate in the fight between David and Goliath against the fast Food Network, which builds a restaurant on its street. The ending was fun, although I found many who disagree with me on this. <br /> <br /> The film was very cautious, portraying contemporary Australian ethnic stereotypes, in particular clash or clash of cultures, if you are between traditional Anglo-Australian and Italian-Australian stereotypes and how they found a kind of “unity through trouble, very nice. <br /> <br /> I found the performance of Vince Colosimo in the role of “Tony Stilano,” an Italian-Australian fish 'The owner of a chip shop in his thirties, to be first-class, his acting was very sincere and convincing, thanks to his performance to really reveal the essence, or, I would say, the soul of the Italian Australian stereotype, which in fact is not too Italian, but not too Australian, Colosimo found this balance, breathed it into his lungs and gave him life. <br /> <br /> Cinematography could have been better, more pictures from this area would be nice, from what I see, it was in Melbourne, and where in Melbourne? for me it looks somewhere between Ivanhoe and Bullen, although I’m not 100% sure about that. <br /> <br /> I don’t know why so many people compare this film with “Castle”, although they have similar topics going through them, Take Away is in its own league. <br /> <br /> I think the film was excellent with a capital "E", it has it all, it’s funny, it’s great jokes, it’s dealing with modern problems facing Australian society, the story is going well, I’m liked! I highly recommend it.
