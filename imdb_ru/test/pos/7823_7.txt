This is a Hallmark TV movie. Hallmark has always made high-quality family-oriented films. Just Desserts is a boy and girl who are in love while working on a film. Two bakers compete for a $ 250,000 prize against professional bakers. It is fun and carefree. Desserts look great. In the film during the competition sounds catchy, cheerful song. I guess this is Roger Bellon's song created for the movie. Unfortunately, there is no soundtrack. I would really like to get a copy of the song. I donâ€™t even know the name of the song, because at the end of the film the credits are compressed to make room for hundreds of promotions. In any case, the cast is great. It's always nice to see Brenda Vaccaro. She is very playful and cheerful. Lauren Holly is always a plus, and Kostas Mandilor finishes the work of the good guys with a wonderful performance. Professional chef Wolfgang Puck appeared at a party. The film is worth watching.
