I liked the story of the guy who is trying to get his girlfriend back .... he was there, did it so that I could tell about her ... anyway, I love working with the camera, as sometimes the camera remains "on", and they just sit and talk about the scene or something ... or how the camera watches him to find the actors and what not ... I watched it on the IFC sometime last year and I liked it, so I told Few of my friends about it, and some of them watched it, and they loved it too ... check it out, if you can, curiously, but that's all Another good movie ... I gave him 10/10 for two reasons ... one: I can relate ... but anyone who has ever fallen in love and made a mistake can tie ... two: this is really creative a way to make a movie, as if you were always there, right in the middle of filming ... as I said, a great movie
