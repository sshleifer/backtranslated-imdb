A smaller thriller than a colorful adventure with strained elements. HUMAN, WHICH KNOWED TOO, can not really be compared with such masterpieces of Hitchcock, as VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW or PSYCHO; instead, it’s more like a nice joke like Catch a Thief and NORTH NORTHWEST. The film, made mostly in Morocco and London, tells the story of a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day), whose vacation is interrupted when they innocently fall into the plot to kill — and when their little son is kidnapped to make them silence. <br /> <br /> James Stewart and Doris Day are very effective in the role of an all-American couple, and the characters are given an unusual twist: Stewart, a doctor from the Midwest, sociable, but has a touch of “ugly American abroad” to his personality; Day, who plays the popular scene and the recording star who retired after her marriage, is suspicious. These qualities of personality and background fit very well into the story. <br /> <br /> THE PERSON WHO HAVE TOO KNOW contains many famous scenes; and the scene in which Stuart uses drugs the day before she tells her about the abduction, and Albert Hall’s very complex sequence of events, including what seems like hundreds of cuts, is very powerful. Less often noticed, though, in my opinion, equally, if not more satisfactorily, are more subtle scenes in which Hitchcock combines a margin of uncertainty with perverse humor, like when Stuart tries to find something in a taxidermist’s shop, and “The Day” shouts out “Sera” (written for this film) in an inappropriate manner at a party at the embassy. <br /> <br /> FOR A MAN WHO KNOWING KNOWLY TOO TOO, there is not enough depth and significance for Hitchcock’s greater work, it remains a pleasant film and one that compares very well with his work as a whole. This is Hitchcock Light, but recommended. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
