Imagine that episode of "Dragnet" in which Friday and Gannon fall into the typical den of hippie inequality in 1970, but instead of giving everyone a lecture, they "get a little bit". This is "Joe" in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> This film is about working class fanatics and the rich guy who just killed his girlfriendâ€™s drug dealer, is terribly out of date, and most of the supporting role is removed, but it's still fun to watch. Peter Boyle, who is about 35 years old, plays Joe (fanatic), and he looks like James Gandolfini. In her film debut, Susan Sarandon plays a daughter with blue eyes, and although she doesn't necessarily hint at her future greatness, you can't take your eyes off her.
