Moviegoers often say that there should be 3 memorable <br /> <br /> scenes in films to be considered really great. There are not three news broadcasts, but two more. This film is very well written <br /> <br /> by James Brooks. Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks have never been better. I love this movie for many reasons. It's great because it <br /> <br /> makes you laugh and cry. Albert Brooks has a few <br /> <br /> wonderful lines and lots of unforgettable scenes: # 1 (laughs) “I can sing and read, I sing while I read” from the Midnight Train <br /> <br /> Georgia plays in the background. # 2 (laughs) Speaking <br /> <br /> to William Hurt’s character that “You really ripped the hood off the nukes,” <br /> <br /> after seeing Hurt’s rape report. # 3 (crying) When Aaron <br /> <br /> (A. Brooks) finally tells Jane (the Hunter) that he loves her, and she <br /> <br /> cannot finish with Hert's character, because it represents <br /> <br /> everything about journalism Jane finds dispicable. Finally, No. 4 (laughs), which can forget the scene in which Aaron anchors the weekend news ... fun. This film was supposed to win an Oscar! It has everything that I love about movies <br /> <br />, great acting, intellectual screenplay and even Jack Nicholson's cameo <br /> <br />!
