RATING STARS: ***** Saturday evening **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> One day heroin addict Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) gets out of prison Awkward jailbird partner Sparrow (Arnold Stang), the needy cripple of his wife Zosh (Eleonora Parker) and bitten Molly (Kim Novak). He is trying to succeed as a drummer in the band, but before his big break comes, he is stuck, doing the only thing he was good at, except that he played high-stakes cards. And, no matter how hard you try, even the prison did not cure him of the devil's drug addiction - made him lie and deceive everyone who surrounded him, and made him take desperate measures to feed his habit. His desire to break away is his only motivation for a happy ending. <br /> <br /> When people think of Frank Sinatra, they usually think of classic high songs such as Under My Skin, New York New York and It Be Yourself But that no one will forget that he really was also a famous actor, and if his performances in the famous “From Here to Eternity” were not enough, he will also be remembered for this advanced drama concerning what was at that time the subject of ultra-taboo. drug abuse. <br /> <br /> The film is often mentioned as one of the first to cover the use of heroin in the schedule (probably the reason for this certificate 15) while the subject was still under scrutiny. underground. In his portrayal of the protagonist, Sinatra is beautiful, perfectly conveying the despair, despair and sincerity of a man who loses every second chance that is given to him. His cold turkey scene is much more intense than Yuen MacGregor in Trainspotting. The first colleague who made an impression was Parker as a demanding machine that needs to be crippled by his Wife, using her husband’s guilt and sense of duty in all possible manifestations. Novak, as his secret lover, still manages some strong moments, but he is less stellar than Parker. The steng makes its usual comic relief, like a clumsy assistant who pulls the lead man with his sharp New York accent. <br /> <br /> Directed by Otto Preminger does allow the pace to slow down a bit, but this is still a completely absorbing film, with many unexpected turns and to be admired, because it is one of the first films that so animated such a grim plot. ****
