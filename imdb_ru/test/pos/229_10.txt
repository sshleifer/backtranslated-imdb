One evening I was listening to talk radio, and Leslie Nielsen was on the program. He went on to explain why there were only 6 shows. <br /> <br /> In TV shows such as MASH, you can go to the fridge for a beer, and when you hear what is happening, you did not miss anything. But with a police squad you MUST watch the show, with the sights that you missed if you haven't seen them. Who could forget "... part of the city, known as" Little Italy "..." with the Coliseum in the background. <br /> <br /> Even the films depended heavily on the jokes, but again in the theater you were captured by the audience. <br /> <br /> Leslie also said that the only reason that shows, films, and other films, such as Airplane, were funny, was that they did not try to tell what was funny. Viewers were supposed to get the jokes. <br /> <br /> Well, that's just my 2 cents.
