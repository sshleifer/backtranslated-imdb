This story of the troubles caused by an excessive possessive, domineering, domineering and unscrupulous mother (Laura Hope Crews) for her two adult sons and their girls is a powerful tool for the star performances of Irene Dunn (new daughter in the family). the law), Joel McCree (son number one), Eric Linden (son number two) and Francis Dee (groom son number two). Here is a demonstration of the pure tyranny of jealousy and possessiveness of a mother that went out of control: four good people believe that their own life is damaged, their plans have changed, and their own personalities have been threatened. Irene Dunn is a star in his role. Joel McCray’s performance is open and clear, and Laura Hope Crews is the workshop mother. <br /> <br /> Yet this reviewer believes that the performance of Francis Dee is the best of all. Her first character in the story to show the power of her inner feelings. Her image in her soul-broken scene with a broken heart is painful, and even rude. Dee pulls the viewer around and brings you to pain, not even showing her face! <br /> <br /> Francis Dee, like Laura Hope Crews, has been neglected for too long, and is now almost forgotten as the great actress she was. None of the actresses who starred in the film after World War II had anything to talk about Francis Dee. <br /> <br /> If you're lucky enough to see the Silver Cord that was never released for television, you will find this “Old Fashioned Drama in the Living Room” - an outstanding film that is very well shown 74 years after its release in 1933, because it is full of superb performances.
