The fact that in 50 years it is still a very watchable film says a lot about it. It is smarter and more interesting than almost all recent films of the same genre that you can find, and it evokes a certain sense of innocence. I'm not a big fan of this type of movie, but I could watch it all without getting bored, which makes it a good movie to watch with someone who doesn't necessarily share your taste in movies. I liked the black and white palette, excellent casting, clever robbery scene, which makes you guess what trick they will do next, and the final, like everyone else. Monitoring the robbery makes it possible to understand the power of silence, which, unfortunately, is so little used in modern cinema.
