Most of Kieslowski’s films seem to me to be riddles designed to expand the mind and soul. The characters are not very believable, idealized, schematic. Nevertheless, the way Kieslowski presents his winding paths in life, their complex interaction with others, with the universe, with chance or fate, makes me understand faith, makes (wants) to believe in God. That at some point it all matters, if not for me, then, of course, for someone. <br /> <br /> Trois couleurs and especially Rouge are getting closer to making me touch, feel, experience the “truth” “sense” than perhaps any of his other films. The only problem is that the paths of the “puzzles” being explored are too similar to his other films, and at some point they become somewhat predictable. There is still a lot of joy. It looks like a familiar brand of wine - you know what to expect, and it delivers, sometimes with a newly found bouquet that may appear as a result of aging - either wine or you yourself.
