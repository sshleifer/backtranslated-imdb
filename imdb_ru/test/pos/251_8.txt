Good story about Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth), who dreams of being on Broadway, which means she will have to leave the small dining room where she works with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers). Grow in love with Danny. All three are good friends, and every Friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for pearl (they never eat them). The storyline provides many opportunities for songs and dances. The film has two questions that Rusty has to answer: fame is all that he has invented? and less is actually more if you are happy? The answer to these questions makes the film. The film also demonstrates well the talents of all three directors. Not a moment's peace!
