Nelson is a professor of medicine who wants his four students to kill him and then bring him back to life so that he can prove that there is an afterlife. So they do, and pretty soon, all medical students want to know if there is life after death. The afterlife is not about the pearly gates and lights at the end of the tunnel, but about something more sinister. <br /> <br /> Ghosts of the past return to haunt them, and of course this film will haunt anyone. He has some pretty scary moments that can translate into real life, and it makes people think about what happens when you die. This is a good movie to see when it rains and you feel depressed. This is also a bit strange. <br /> <br /> See this with a long past.
