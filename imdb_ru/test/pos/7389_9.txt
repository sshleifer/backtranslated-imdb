I saw Dark Harbor at the Seattle Film Festival in '98. This film, shot against the backdrop of the fall state of Maine, boasts an excellent cast and plot that makes you guess. Sometimes creepy, sometimes funny, I have to say that he stayed with me for a few days after seeing it. Iâ€™m sure Rickman and Walker are beautiful because they are married to the ice, and Reedus is the one from whom you will hear more. The first shot of the winding, deserted road in the rain at dusk (and the score that accompanied him) set the tone just awesome. Excellent work of the new director / screenwriter and his talented team.
