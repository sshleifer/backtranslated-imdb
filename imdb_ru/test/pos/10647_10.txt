Based on the real events of 1905, the silent film “Potemkin of the Battle” tells about the imperial Russian ship, on the disgusting conditions of which the insurrection is fought. Shocked by the conditions on the ship, the inhabitants of the port city of Odessa rally for the support of the rebels and, as a result, find themselves at the mercy of the imperial forces, which attack innocent supporters with wild power. <br /> <br /> POTEMKIN is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members, and it reaches its incredible strength by demonstrating the clash of groups and crowds in a series of unusually visualized and edited episodes . Surprisingly, each of these sequences was able to surpass the previous one, and the film is actually gaining momentum as it moves from insurrection to a rally of citizens to a slaughter on the Odessa steps - the last of which is one of the most famous sequences in the entire history of cinema. Filming mostly where real events actually happened, director Eisenstein is unusual because he builds - not only from sequence to sequence, but from moment to moment in each sequence - some of the most memorable images ever created for the movie. <br /> <br /> Describing Potemkin as a great movie means to downplay a bit. It is absolutely necessary, absolutely necessary for anyone who is seriously interested in cinema as a form of art, purely visual cinema at its most brilliant, often imitated, rarely equated, never surpassed. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
