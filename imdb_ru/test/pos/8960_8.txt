Yes, there are a lot of funny characters in this movie. He also has direct characters, characters who are not confident in their sexuality, people who are looking for the truth about their existence. <br /> <br /> This is not a sexual orientation film. It is about loneliness and the difficulties that people often face when connecting with each other. In the film, Denis Arkand cleverly balances various aspects of relationships and contrasting, ever-changing relationships. The serial killer element is a little less successful (it looks more like a way to wrap different storylines and, unlike the rest of the film, thematically heavyweight). <br /> <br /> Thomas Gibson centers and justifies the film; it is a quiet performance, but behind a beautiful, arrogant appearance, it slowly reveals a frightened soul that is afraid to show or accept love from others. The supporting cast is strong, especially Mia Kirchner as a Gibson friend, hired to work with prerogative abilities. Her role is more of a metaphor than a literal vanity - strangely innocent and corrupted at the same time, it represents the light and darkness of the characters' sexual consciousness. <br /> <br /> The film is attractive and often surprises with its character development. The effect is somewhat similar to the way Robert Altman directs the script of David Mamet - the dialogue does not deviate from some burning observations, except for a few contrived moments at the beginning. Often, in search of love and ordinary “relationships,” we ignore the love that already exists around us — in our friends, family, those who are able to see us as we are. Arkand and the writer, Brad Fraser, make some tricky observations about the different ways people try to escape and deny their loneliness, and how this refusal comes back to haunt us in so many unexpected ways. <br /> <br /> This movie is a rewarding experience. It may not be for fans who cannot overcome the sexual orientation of certain characters in order to see a greater, transcendent message of hope and redemption. Loneliness is a universal experience. Such a film, which dares to explore the dark side of our lives with an intelligent and insightful look, deserves applause and an unbiased approach.
