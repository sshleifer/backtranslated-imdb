This film has its detractors, and Courtney's fey chest of drawers can offend some people (who, frankly, need a good header) - but the film is top notch in all respects: attractive, sharp, appropriate. Finney, naturally, more life. Courtney makes the perfect foil. I thought the actions were terribly strong in both passages, and Courtney's character provides a lot of dark humor. The period is well fixed, the supporting cast is well chosen. It should be seen and savored, like a beautiful heart. I just wanted it to be on DVD ... (* sigh *) ...
