After seeing this film, I have no choice but to write a review in the hope that there are people like me who were hit by the rocket action of the ninja and the white hot sex fools called Ninja III: The Domination. /> <br /> We all know that Sho Kosugi is swinging. It goes without saying, but what about Jordan Bennett's ultra macho about his character "Billy Secord" cop? Bravo Mr. Bennett, bravo. At an early stage, you are proving, trying to seduce the magnificent Christie (played flawlessly by one Miss Lucinda Dickie with insane glory), that you are not afraid to risk your trade. I especially liked the fact that you do not feel the need to interfere and try to help her, because 4 thugs are trying to rape her outside her gym. Oh, you could surely help, but by standing there and watching you let her know who the boss was. Secord will wear pants in this relationship. I also liked how Mr. Bennett was not afraid to repeatedly take off his shirt or wear the shirt of a woman-beater, despite his gorilla, like his shoulders and back. The hair on the back and shoulders is hot, and Secord knows it. What about Lucinda Dicky? All I can say is “KABOOM” - I see a sex bomb getting ready to explode. She has all the right movements, as a seductress, and martial arts masters. The chemistry behind Dickey and Bennett is what makes this movie a tick. You might think that she would hate him because he is kind of a stupid jerk, but not my friends. Animal magnetism is too strong to resist, and they stick together like crazy glue. Sho Kasugi is not as outstanding as you think, although it’s still the main character that suits me, because all I wanted was more than Bennett and Dickie. He seems to be wearing a lot of eye makeup, which was good to see. Special effects? Wow. That's all I can say. I will not give up the ending, but let's say, she will not disappoint. I love Ninja III: domination, and I can only hope that there is a ninja 4. I give him 5 of 5 throwing stars. will disappoint.
