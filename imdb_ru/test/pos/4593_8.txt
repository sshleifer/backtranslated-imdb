First, let me say that, although I generally appreciate the work of Mike Judge, I simply cooled off in my response to Office Space, King of the Hill, Beavis and Butthead. I usually prefer a more reasonable comedy, and this is the irony about idiocracy. <br /> <br /> In the future world, where the realization of the views of Beavis and Butt-head, basic instincts and intellectual abilities are the basis of chaos Max’s dirty, half-crazy society with a semi-violent runner, where the imagination of every scavenger trailer becomes reality, even an average intellect threatened and accused of talking to a gay, and the mob mentality takes over. And this world is also incredibly fun. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is obvious that the leaders of Carl's Jr., Starbucks, Costco and Fuddruckers will be horrified by the distorted values ​​given by their products in the year 2505. <br /> <br /> There were some missed opportunities with the film, and the relationship between time travelers — the other was an average woman who was worried about her boyfriend’s punishment — could be stronger; chemistry there. And in the future, it seems, there will not be too many women. <br /> <br /> I left with a smile on my face, but the experience is a little better than memories. So this is my movie about popcorn, and it will be interesting to return to it in the video. Featured! For your information, stay in credit for an extra scene.
