It was absolutely one of the best films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances from an amazing cast who will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and back. <br /> <br /> I could not help but take care of the characters. Miss Merkerson will strike you, just like a young man playing a young hero. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the scenery was top notch. The viewer is indeed located within each epoch, as he is presented. <br /> <br /> Music is explosive too. A good choice for presenting mood, time and place. A blind blues man is stereotypical, but he delivers some great songs. <br /> <br /> This is a great story that will survive multiple views. Take the time to watch it!
