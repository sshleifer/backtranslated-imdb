Just watched Hair after 20 years. It hit home. For those of us who tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight the domination of privilege and power; who resisted the fascism of the Johnson / Nixon administrations; who now, as veterans of the civil wars, fought in Vietnam every single day, until finally the American beast died and ran away; for everyone who said “no” differently - it's great how unfortunate we were. How big was the real table on which Trit danced. How drove the wizard behind the curtain. We were 20, 22, 24 years old. We did not know the nature of the enemy. The size of the monster that will eat the world for the next thirty years and beyond. How could we? Even with smoke and a bat (a bat!) In our hand, like Trit, we were too young, too middle class, too invested, too much of the actions we hated. <br /> <br /> But there was a moment. As Andre Gregory notes in "My Lunch From." Somewhere in the late 60s and early 70s there was a moment when we could find something besides a yellow brick road. Something that is not fueled by Bechtel, prisons, Enron and Dick. Something joint. Something innocent and critical at the same time. Something with dancing. <br /> <br /> But we missed it. Just as Kong bends the beam, the “revolution” unfolded by itself. In sexism. Racism. Homophobia. And cool crushing policy. Until we got to the "W". Treat would have hated the "w". And Iraq and the pathological lie. If they were in this movie. Then. But the moment passed, and the "W" was almost inevitable. Comprehensive incompetence riding a drunk, raging bull in the mouths, the lives of children and Chinese stores. <br /> <br /> We had to do something more. Something better. But we clearly did not know that. <br /> <br /> Now what?
