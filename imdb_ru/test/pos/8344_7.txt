This film is obviously intended for a young, evangelical Christian audience as an educational tool. For this, I give him 7 points out of 10 points. This is a decent film to show a youth group, but I don’t think it will be very well received. For any other audience, I would rate it much lower. <br /> <br /> The reviewers who saw this “It’s a wonderful life” were right, although I didn’t think about it until they mentioned it. I was more reminded of "Chick Tract", these small 3 "5" Gospel comics. If Jack Chick ever made a film from one of his treatises, he would have looked very much like Second Look. He has a strong Christian message about the power of prayer and the influence that each of us has on the earth, but Christian stereotypes to some extent interfere with it. All Christians are very nice, somewhat passive and insanely clean, while all non-Christians seem to be bad people. <br /> <br /> Muriel, the angel, plays the main role, and he is the roughest, most stupid character in the film. He is the most incredible angel I have ever seen in any movie, and the biggest negative. I don’t know if the directors intended to distance themselves so much from his personality, or if he just hit me like that. (I admit that he reminded me of someone I know.) Dan's love for a very worldly girl who is not at all in his taste leads the plot in this film. Why he ever fell in love with her is the only question that I would like to receive an answer to. <br /> <br /> But the film does show positive Christian values, and your youth group will be entertained when they watch something useful. with a good lesson.
