I just saw All Illuminated at the Telluride Film Festival. This is really a wonderful movie. Very emotional, sometimes funny and heartbreaking. Bring your handkerchiefs! For those of you who like a movie that causes tears in their eyes, I’m reminded of the endings of Babette’s Holiday and Address Book. The stories were completely different, but they had the same emotional power that caused tears in my eyes, like this movie. <br /> <br /> There are no spoilers. A summary, as described by IMDb, of a young man's journey to Ukraine to follow his roots and find the village where his father grew up. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is conducted in English and Ukrainian (and in Russian, too, I believe). This allows for some surprisingly linguistic moments when one character more or less accurately interprets the speaker in English in a group depending on the circumstances. <br /> <br /> The landscape is gorgeous, and the musical accompaniment is entertained with wonderful Eastern European influence. Be sure that you stay with credits for the final tune. <br /> <br /> This is Liv Schreiber’s directorial debut, and he's well done. I give this film 9, one of the best films that I have seen in a long time. I recommend it very much.
