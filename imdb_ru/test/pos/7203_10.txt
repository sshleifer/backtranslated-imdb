I liked this film, the audience in which I participated, liked this film, and the little 7-year-old girl who was with me loved this film. We all laughed at the play on words, the visual humor and good feeling with which you left the cinema when it ended. I could easily understand why there was such a huge box office success in France. I am planning to buy a DVD so that I can see it again and laugh at all the pieces I missed, laughing so hard the first time.
