This is an old, old story: children throw parties in an old house, demons are released, death and unwarranted nudity set in. You know all this, it is still very fun. <br /> <br /> Many people (well, to be more precise, many horror fans) have fond memories of this film, and you always remember with a little trepidation the old film to see if everything is as good as used to think. Fortunately, it is. <br /> <br /> This is something for everyone (well, probably, for everyone who turned out to be a man). From a funny episode of titles to shoplifting fraud, which uses ingenious use of Linnie Quigley's ass and the “mirror” scene to fully enjoy demonic entertainment. Guys. .. men, death scenes are well made with some good blood effects, and, unlike some horrors from the era, it actually retains a good sense of atmosphere and even tension in everything. Don't get me wrong, this is still fun in the first place, but it offers some pleasant, bizarre moments that most fans of the genre should like.
