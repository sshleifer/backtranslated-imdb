The basic premise of the Flatliners is pretty simple. Several medical students put themselves on the verge of death to find out exactly what the brain does during this fact. It sounds like a crowd of bored students would go to the joke, but this forms the basis of some very creepy substances. In the modern world, where Hollywood has to produce foreign markets in order to create a horror film, Flatliners are one of those rare gems that show that Hollywood can do something different if it tries hard. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes the severity of many films based on this premise, which will be released today, is that it does not descend to indulgence or arrogance. Flatliners recognize that people go to movies to entertain, not moralize. In this kind of supernatural thriller, the difference that this restraint makes is truly incredible. Even more incredible is that Julia Roberts appears without irritation or demonstration that she can only play Julia Roberts. Here, the theory of ambiguity, according to which performers perform their best work with the smallest audience. <br /> <br /> The story of what the characters find at the time of losing almost all of what makes them alive, and how it happens to invade their present tense, is done surprisingly well. Of particular interest are the moments when the character of William Baldwin discovers that his personal collection of videos returns to haunt him. The fact that William Baldwin seems to play so well in the role says a lot about the scenario or the direction. I'm not sure which one. <br /> <br /> Kiefer Sutherland, on the other hand, is really brilliantly playing a leading role. He really feels for himself the mystery that past experience invades the present and why it unfolds. When the character of Kevin Bacon goes in search of an old school pier, whose life he has made a hell, and tells her how sorry he is, it becomes clearer what the film is about. We can try to change the past as much as we want, but what we do with the present is most important for us. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of Flatliners is how it creates the atmosphere without the use of expensive, complex visual effects. Quite unusual for what is essentially a horror movie, Flatliners did not spend their budget in places where it is not necessary. Much of what we see during the more surrealistic episodes is a case of professional make-believe, simple stunt photography or video material. Sometimes the simplest things are the best. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the film, it seems too short for ten minutes. The ending seems more careless than final, as if someone in the studio asked the director to finish the film so they can show it at a certain time of the market. Of course, for this reason, many films still have sore spots, so Flatliners really should not be different. The one hundred and fifteen minutes we get are very satisfactory, although not too brilliant. <br /> <br /> I gave the Flatliners seven out of ten. It works well as a date movie or a kind of popcorn night movie. In addition, it is a good reminder that low-budget horror shows were not always sad trash.
