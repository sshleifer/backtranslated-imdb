Gone with the Wind and Scarlett are two different films that were never meant to be compared, it’s obvious that the original actors in gwtw all died and deserved their own reward and praise, I loved gwtw and never expected a sequel to be shot or will ever live up to half the praise of gwtw, but to my shock, Scarlett was written in the same way by the director and acted like the gwtw scarlett itself deserves as much reward that now I can honestly say that I don’t what I like more I think the script for Scarlett yl number 1 ideal as an extension. Bravo! writer director producer and all the actors bravo! AS sequels rarely justify their name, as this works on a par with its predecessor. For those who do not like it, you miss the point and the great end to the phenomenal top.
