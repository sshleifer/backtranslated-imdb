This film has it all. Great actors, good dialogue, drama, comedy, as well as a great script and director Paul Thomas Anderson. I saw this film several times and every time I get more pleasure. It does not age, it consistently entertains and stimulates. Burt Reynolds easily plays the best role, and he does an excellent job with his work. John S. Reilly and Don Cheadle also give great comedy performances. There is no weak element in this movie.
