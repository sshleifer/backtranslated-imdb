This film is my favorite film of all times. I regret that IMDb is no more positive about this. I hope that this will not prevent those who have not experienced this from seeing it. <br /> <br /> I always liked this movie. I watch it about once a year, and it is always nice to see the film again, especially the star performances of all the actors. <br /> <br /> I always wondered if Jean Stapleton really performed the final dance with Travolta ??? ? If someone knows this little thing, please leave a comment. <br /> <br /> Thanks and ENJOY!
