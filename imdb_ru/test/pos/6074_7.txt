The English Patient is one of those films that basically deserve the highest praise. I say, most of all, because this film, although very serious, intense, deep and really thoughtful, still has some flaws. First, why, oh, why are modern films so long? This lasts more than two hours, and from time to time it becomes really difficult to concentrate and follow an extremely serious plot. I say, if the film was shorter by an hour, it would only be to his advantage. However, we have what we have. Winner of several Oscars, the English patient is still very good. This is a deep, insightful treatise on the human soul, love and betrayal, war and cowardice, violence and courage. Ralph Fiennes is a terrific actor. His hero, neurotic and silent, mysterious man, ready for anything just to save the life of his beloved. He is gorgeous, although half the time he is a deformed cripple. He is the strongest bond here. Juliette Binoche, as usual, is very convincing and sweet. She adds a lot with her superb play and storyline of a love story with this Sikh officer. Willem Defoe, Colin Firth, Christina Scott Thomas are all here, all huge and very strong. And then the desert of Egypt, the deep cloudless sky, the green groves of Italy. Nature is here, even when people die, bombs roar, mines explode. The war is here too. This is obviously terrible and bloody. Then there are corpses, horrible bloody bodies, then naked bodies, adultery and all. I do not know what to say. So much great work of actors, so much realism, so much cruelty that war brings. This is not a movie for the rest. It makes you think.
