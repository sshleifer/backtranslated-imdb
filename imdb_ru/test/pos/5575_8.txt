I remember how I ignored the series when he first debuted because of his “look” with Jim Hensen's dolls. Recently, however, a friend of mine allowed me to borrow his DVDs from Farscape, and I only now understand what a terrible mistake it was. <br /> <br /> As with any series, there are episodes that shine, but those do not. I ride adrenaline and emotional outburst during great episodes and suffer from dull. However, I tolerate regardless of the storyline, which links all the episodes together. I'm talking about the growth of the main characters and their love for each other. Let me warn you, this is something that is absolutely compelling to watch. I can not remember any other series ("Babylon 5", "Buffy", "Angel", etc.), which skillfully and reasonably combines such a heartbreaking (sometimes) and intense trip. In the fourth season, finally, everything became more focused, and I was shocked by the decision to cancel the series. I look forward to the release of the miniseries and invite others to discover this incredible gem.
