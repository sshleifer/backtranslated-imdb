Chop Shop, the second feature of Ramina Bakhrani, is a rare breed. This is an American film telling a story, usually not found in American cinema, the story of a minority living in poverty. This is the work of simple beauty. Filmed in Queens, New York, in the shadow of the Shea Stadium, Chop Shop is neorealism to the core. With non-actors, he has more in common with Vittorio De Sica's classic bicycle thieves than anything made in the United States. There is no score or soundtrack, all music and sounds are diagonal. Watching this is like watching a wonderful foreign film; it takes us to another world, because it is so rarely seen. However, this other world is not Rome or Istanbul or New Delhi after World War II, this is modern New York. <br /> <br /> Bahrani tells the story of Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), better known as El. He is a 12-year-old Latin American child who does not have parents or a family to look after him. He lives in a small room upstairs in a car shop, in which he also works. He shares the same bed with his teenage sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales). None of them passed the second grade. El, although young, strong and mature. He acts as the head of a small family. He connects his sister to work, and he himself is doing everything possible to earn when he is not working in the shop. He sells bootleg DVDs on the streets and candy in the subway. He searches for broken auto parts and sells them at many auto shops on the street where he lives. <br /> <br /> Alejandro with a broken heart learns that his sister works as a prostitute at night. He himself gradually ceases to be interested in compliance with the law. He starts to steal, first car parts, and then wallets. Like Antonio, the desperate protagonist of biker thieves, we cannot blame El for becoming a thief. This is just survival. Ale and Isamar are saving money in the hope of buying a van with a vending machine for $ 4,500. They see the van as their way out, and they have a lot of optimism. However, as is usually the case in neorealism, we know that this will only lead to disappointment. <br /> <br /> Polanco's exciting work is what gives legitimacy to the realism of Chop Shop. Here is a 12-year-old character who must be believable and naively vulnerable. Whether he sends cars to the store, sells films and Snickers bars or plays with his sister in their meager room is true. <br /> <br /> Chop Shop is a sobering reminder that not all American children grow into a land of opportunity. The ale lifestyle is something that many in middle-class white America consider to be the “third world”. They are aware of poverty and hardship in a foreign land, sipping coffee and reading the New York Times on Sunday morning, but blinding it in their streets. Looking Chop Shop, you will think differently about how children sell candy in the subway. <br /> <br /> For more reviews, visit www.mediasickness.com.
