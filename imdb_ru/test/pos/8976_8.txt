In one of the best films of the year, Tom Hanks acted as Congressman Charlie Wilson in this sardonically funny and extremely topical (given enough relevant events) historical comedy-drama dedicated to the Afghan / Soviet fiasco of the 1980s. The Soviets attacked Afghanistan, killing hundreds of people. Why should anyone care? People die, right? No, the reason why the United States was involved through Charlie Wilson was that Afghans, fearing that they would be smashed, began to enter Pakistan illegally, which, in turn, threw Pakistani President Mohammed Ziyu ul-Haq away. Charlie Wilson, trying to remedy this situation, teamed up with the sixth richest woman and religious fanatic in Texas, Joan Herring (Julia Roberts) and fun and reliable American CIA spy Gast Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to help supply the Afghans. with high-tech weapons for the destruction of Soviet military aircraft that would try to attack their land. <br /> <br /> Although this is certainly not a serious Oscar contender for the best film, Charlie Wilson’s War is probably one of the best of many political films of the year. Oscar winner Mike Nichols delivers clear direction, as you would expect, and Emmy Award winner Aaron Sorkin (Sport's Night, The West Wing) presents a wonderful script that combines comedy and drama almost perfectly. The acting is mostly gorgeous. Tom Hanks has been showing his best and most enjoyable results since his work in the Oscar nomination in 2000 as an employee of FedEx, who found himself on a tropical island in Cast Away. Hanks takes a slimy character like Wilson, and with his signature charm turns him into a nice guy. Amy Adams and Ned Beattie, as always, are reliable, but the real outstanding performance of the film is from Philip Seymour Hoffman. Perhaps the best actor working in the film industry today, Hoffman plays a small supporting role and encourages everyone around. From his first scene, where he screams at his boss, and then brutally smashes his window, Hoffman sucks you. The only disappointing cast is the surprisingly overvalued Hollywood starlet Julia Roberts. Wading through another film, Roberts ’rich and powerful image of a rich Texas oil woman beats all the wrong notes and in most cases is just annoying. In the 97th minute, the film is short and pleasant, and this does not mean that it does not pull in some moments, but when it pulls it, it takes a very short time. <br /> <br /> In conclusion “Charlie Wilson’s War” is far from a perfect movie, but it’s definitely worth a look. Rating: B +
