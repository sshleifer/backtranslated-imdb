Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart) and Joe McKenna (Doris Day) go to Morocco for a holiday where they meet on the bus a mysterious man named Louis Bernard (Daniel Geleen). The next day, this man is killed, but before he dies he tells Ben a secret; The murder will happen in London. The crooks kidnap the son of a pair of Hank (Christopher Olsen) so that Ben won't disclose their plan to anyone. Alfred Hitchcock "The Man Who Knew Too Much" (1956) is a very strong thriller. It's great, as always in Hitchcock films. James Stewart is amazing. Doris Day is a delightful man and actress, and she also reveals her singing talents. The song is Que Sera, Sera plays an important role in the film. This film is a film of many classic scenes. In the final scenes at Albert Hall, without dialogue, you can barely blink. This film is already fifty years old. Time in no way diminished his power.
