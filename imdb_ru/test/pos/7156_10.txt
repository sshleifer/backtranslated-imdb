the most "spiritual" film that I have seen in a long time. maybe ever. also one scene around the dinner table - a piece of comic perfection. I understand that the release date is approaching in the fall. if we are talking about your city and you want to watch a movie that makes you think that this is it. Aviva is great in this, and she is certainly the future star - (Superbad is now missing, in which she participates) - also all the actors seem perfectly aligned. In this film, there is a tone that is used to surprise to the end. I would not know how to call it - it is a comedy, but the message of the ward is so cruel and straightforward that the word “comedy” is not large enough for this word. I love this film. This is a comedy thinking person. but even this phrase is not good enough. FTF has a message, and you need to hear this message right now.
