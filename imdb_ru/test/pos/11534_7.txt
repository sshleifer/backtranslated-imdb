So it's not an epic, but for people experiencing something like that <br /> <br /> (suicide of a brother or sister), this can be an interesting way of therapy. <br /> <br /> The imaginative story and beautiful game make it well-conducted. <br /> <br /> For some reason he didnâ€™t gain popularity in the audience, <br /> <br /> I believe that this is the result of the main theme. Why did she commit suicide? It is clear that this is hardly something that US cinematographers are flocking to, if it were a European production, then <br /> <br /> it would probably reach its audience much more <br /> <br />. This, however, is a film that, although the realism is spoiled by a sparkling romantic glow <br /> <br />, gives the viewer a full hearty impression.
