Great story, well told by the director. The interaction between man and leopard made the audience think about who was humane. People without a reason killed animals only in order to survive. At the end of the film, you had to wonder who the real “hero” of the film was. Well-told story. The human actor did an excellent job, but the leopard stole all the scenes in which he was.
