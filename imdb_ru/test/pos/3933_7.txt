Many people burn this film because of the presence of Paris Hilton, but this is not a fair reason to object to the film. The reality is that Paris has a rather minimal role, it spends the vast majority of films behind the scenes. The film also makes fun of it several times, usually using a camera and at least once in a night vision. For those who enjoy Paris Hiltonâ€™s presence on the stage, this could be a movie that can be seen at home when it is released on video, because in the show I was at, we all laughed at her failures in the movie and she was portrayed as "woman of dubious values". <br /> <br /> The film itself was pretty good (unlike the recent stream of weak horror films), it has everything that a good horror should do; a terrible villain, excessive violence, actions that cause this ordinary person to cringe ... this film hit all the basics. It is definitely worth seeing.
