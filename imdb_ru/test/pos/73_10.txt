Yes, I am a kind of romantic who loves musicals and comedies, and it meets all the requirements! Julie Andrews gives a fascinating presentation at the beginning and at the end of this film with the number "Whistling in the Dark." The moderately ugly number she plays in the middle of the story, when she thinks that Rock Hudson saw the dancer / call girl, is simply amazing and will surely make you giggle. <br /> <br /> I’m just sorry that this film will not be found in the video or on DVD, since I’ll definitely buy it a moment before my home library!
