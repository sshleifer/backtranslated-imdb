Shortly before dawn, I was really surprised that I was a far less terrible adventure than I had expected. Instead, director Jeff Lieberman imagines an amazingly disturbing and disturbing atmosphere for large sections of the film, constantly creating tension, until I was really unsure of what was about to happen, but tensed up like waiting for spring. The lack of action in many parts gave him a very deliverance, mixed with the peculiar atmosphere of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and when the action really begins, it is really shocking and dramatic, even when in fact it doesn't even need to be bloodthirsty. The characters are about the same as in this film, though more likeable than some, and the bad guy is unforgettably strange. Photography and obscurity are the real winners in this film, and they keep it from being boring (as suggested). I highly recommend this to serious horror fans. Do not wait for blood, expect a terrible tale of the wilderness with a few amazing moments and a great fabulous atmosphere.
