This movie is great! Wesley Snipes plays with Blade, a vampire hunter, with a clean class, he strikes in such a smooth and cruel way that makes Bruce Lee proud. The film is a fast paced, thrilling ride and superb stunts. The first battle scene and the last one are outstanding, and Wesley looks like a Terminator when he runs around, wiping off all the sucking heads. The scenario is pretty good, and there is also a keen dialogue. Wesley was supposed to play more action films than he, I know that he is a very good actor, and in this he is not as stretched out as in his comic or dramatic roles, but with respect to action films he is the best of them all, only Bruce Willis, Stallone and perhaps Tom Cruise (if he is considered an action movie star) come close. Like Wesley being a quality, Stephen Dorff is also very good as a bad guy. It was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to Snipes might face a threat, but he does it. In general, the film is sharp, stylish, and I hope that the continuation will occur at the same speed.
