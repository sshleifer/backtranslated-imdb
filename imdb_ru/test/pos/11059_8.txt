This short film, of course, does not pull without blows. The story of a butcher who wrongfully kills an innocent man who, in his opinion, sexually molested a backward daughter. The film tells about how a butcher serves his time and returns to life with a caring daughter and the need to reconcile with life without a future. <br /> <br /> The graphic intro scenes of the horse being killed, and the full frontal birth of the butcherâ€™s daughter creates a fierce mood that remains with you throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The rapid flow of the film is very straightforward and adds cruelty to it. Consequently, a lot of land is covered in 40 minutes. You are completely absorbed by lifeless butchers - especially after he lost his daughter because of social services and his business. His story continues in the beautiful film Seoul Contre Tus.
