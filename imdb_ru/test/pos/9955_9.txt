one of my favorite lines in Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Ie * we have not finished with you with a long-range strike * therefore Shylock not only did not get his pound of flesh, either 3000, or 6000, or 36000 (each of 6 parts was a ducat) ducats, in essence, he was destroyed by the need to lose all his property. and his daughter has long abandoned him. <br /> <br /> Revenge is the dish that is best served cold. but Shylock's revenge attempt is backfiring. <br /> <br /> I suspect that this play was and remains popular because it aims to ensure that we seek justice. but the harsh reality is that the world is gripped by injustice, and much of it is worth it. a few big names are thrown in jail, mixed-group punks lose their turf in front of the “good guys”, but in fact most of the time it's the other way around. <br /> <br /> but not in this play. the long cries of racism and anti-Semitism forget that there could well be any other social group of outcasts who would receive retribution, simply the lenders of the time were Jews, and therefore the needs of the plot line put the Jew Shylock in the role of the Villain. <br /> <br /> “The Merchant of Venice” is my third favorite work of Shakespeare, 1 and 2 - “Hamlet and Macbeth”. This production gives an excellent moral to history. scenes with some fiances are worth seeing. also the awkwardness of new husbands wriggling and minimizing the fact that they allow the rings to slip so easily that they vowed to keep forever. in real life, this trick is a thing that spouses modestly use to remind their better half that promises MUST mean something and not be frivolous. this play has a much deeper meaning than just the comedic / dramatic aspect. It is about loyalty, devotion and love. <br /> <br /> worth it to be watched over and over again.
