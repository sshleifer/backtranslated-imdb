Here's a movie that suits almost everything, with good performances from everyone, and three strong leading performances from Hanks, Seymour Hoffman and excellent performances from Julia Roberts, which made me spell spell from the first few seconds, these are performances that raise production to the stars, keep it there for the duration. <br /> <br /> In addition to one or two minor actual problems with the script, the only thing that fails this film is the technical direction, too many unsuccessful attempts (fictional continuity) and a number of camera “cheats” that simply do not work. This is amazing for a film of this scale, and it is a bit annoying to watch, but it does not destroy a beautifully processed film.
