I liked the movie, but it should have been longer. The actors did an excellent job. Portia De Rossi is a fabulous actress, and Kristoffer Polaha is a beauty. He did not look like John 100%, but he did him a favor from a distance. I look forward to seeing him on the big screen. He did not have the charisma of John, but he definitely has a charm in himself. He has beautiful eyes and a great smile. He reminds me of my boyfriend a lot. Miss Bissett was too excited for me. She should check out this asthma. I'm not going to comment on Darryl Hannah’s character. My mom always said, “If you can't say anything good, then shut up!” That's what I'm going to do. <br /> <br /> Molly
