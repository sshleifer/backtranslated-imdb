A talented high school graduate with a bad attitude is forced to play the state high school football game. When he meets and falls in love with an attractive local girl, she helps him to realize that he has a chance to get an all-rounder scholarship if he plays well. <br /> <br /> Too often, these dramas fall into formal traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teenager. Matt Szabo from FULL RIDE certainly fits this profile, but beneath the surface is a much more unique person than we usually see in this genre. Matt is the center of action, and he is a realistic teenager, too self-confident and vulnerable, optimistic and cynical in turn. Under the influence of Amy, Matt turns into a man with character and heart. He, in turn, establishes friendly relations with his teammates, which affects his growth as an athlete and team player. <br /> <br /> FULL RIDE has all the elements we love to see in the film â€” great game, great characters, exciting sports scenes, poignant dramas, and a love story. However, although someone could see these elements in other films, FULL RIDE is helped by actions that are sincere and sometimes even moving. Perhaps the most impressive thing about FULL RIDE is the sense of reality. Although the author of the previous comment does not seem to agree with this (a clearly disgruntled student who, for obvious reasons, got a bad rating in his film class), director Mark Huger justifies the film in a plausible situation and situation and does a great job on how to live small town. These characters are real people, rooted in realistic situations that often create the most compelling entertainment. At one level, this is a love story, at another level - the study of character, and at another level - a simple football film. All these ideas come together to form a binder.
