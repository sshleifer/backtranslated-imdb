“Children of the Railway” is perhaps my favorite film of all time, just for the brilliant acting role, warm, humane interaction of three children and the people they meet, living alongside the railway in the beautiful English countryside. Jenny Ogutter is especially believable in her role as “Bobby,” the elder brother of her sister Phyllis and brother Peter. The adventures they discover and the relationships that have developed in their new home and its surroundings are very real and exciting. The scenery is beautiful, the train is part of the British extensive history and the soundtrack is very touching. This warm film never ceases to cause tears in my eyes, every time, and also makes me homesick. I often wonder if I should be born in that era, because I think that I would fit in just the way people treated each other with such chivalry and decency. <br /> <br /> In short, I consider this film to be a bit of a masterpiece and should be seen by everyone who considers himself to be a “sensitive or caring type.” Edith Nesbit wrote this story around the early 1900s and what a wonderful story it is. Most children today need to read this or watch a movie, not play violent video games. If we had more films of this kind, the world would be better.
