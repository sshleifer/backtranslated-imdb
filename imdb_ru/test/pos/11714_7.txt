Sharkey's Car is clearly Burt Reynolds's car, created to allow the star room to show its talents, and he painted the car, the plot of the film with the colors of other films and other styles, offering different moods within the storyline. . <br /> <br /> The film, shot in 1981, lasting 119 minutes (long in time), showed good results, receiving a box office of $ 37,800,000. It had a lot of things: actor and director Burt Reynolds, one-two bounce; adaptation of the novel by William Dily and the southern land of Atlanta, Georgia, at this time, a country of opportunities for film production from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Tom Sharkey Reynolds falls in love with Domino Rachel Ward, the prostitute with a heart of gold repeats here, as it was in “Hustle” when he played with Catherine Deneuve, and in this film there was also a corrupt politician in fundamentally, but with a sad ending, Hollywood happiness is not in Sharkey Machine. The plot is a purely detective procedure / action. Sharkey, a drug counter detective, poorly manages the drug dealer’s bust, leading to murder some innocent bystanders, and he is demoted, literally translated of vice to deal with perverts and other people who have committed misconduct, which "honest" police consider the restroom. His new excavations give him the opportunity to meet with many equally decent officers who do the dirty work that no one else wants. some attention is paid to a certain pimp, Sharkey examines some evidence and discovers that one particular prostitute Domino (Rachel Ward) - Dominoe is protected by the police and political forces, and Sharkey sets himself up 2 4-hour observation squad to watch her. During the time he observes, he learns that the current elected governor Hotchkins (Count Holliman) visits Domino, as does the cunning Italian gangster Victor (Vittorio Gassman). Before the police can build a case based on evidence, Billy, Victor's brother, shooting coke (Henry Silva), shoots at the door of the Domino apartment, apparently killing beautiful Domino, but when Sharkey discovers that the victim was actually a roommate Tiffany (Aarika Wells) Sharkey confronts Victor and tells him that he will be arrested. Sharkey is captured by some ninja assassins led by Smiley (Darryl Hickman) and tortured for information leading up to Domino, but Sharkey defeats them and arrests the governor and kills Billy in a hot pursuit after he killed Victor. <br /> Reynolds wants to show the inner workings of hardened policemen falling in love, but the plot of a police story, flavored with a noir element, and Reynolds's cinematic development ability tends to slide along the dynamics of relationships. <br /> <br /> We have come to know something about some men, and this brings us to the idea why they are working in the direction of their pensions in vices, rather than struggling with real crimes - this element of the film seems fragmentary under Reynolds’s unceremonious leadership and performance. <br /> <br /> In the Reynolds film, there is always uniqueness. He likes to hire stars, actors or other characters, and then let them improvise, sometimes with different results. <br /> <br /> With his team in Sharkey Machine, he gets some great moments, and sometimes a few bloated audience. but always a sense of ensemble and good nature. With Reynolds as the author, this works. <br /> <br /> Reynolds, the actor / author always seems to be grinning at himself and the viewer, as if to say that everything is fake, but good fun. <br /> <br /> An excellent feature: in the scene with Viktor, when Sharkey challenges: “You walk in all people, like you, and you want to know the worst part? You are from another state. ” It seems that this is the greatest insult an officer can inflict on a criminal. <br /> <br /> Reynolds made a film in Atlanta in his career, shooting himself while reading the phone book, and would certainly be targeted and demographic. <Br /> <br /> The film marked the appearance of Rachel Ward, who was nominated for the Golden Star in 1981 as the “New Star of the Year.” <br /> <br /> Reynolds always had a presence and stellar power and chose to make films near his home, Georgia. <br /> <br /> I received my DVD from half.com for $ 7.99, and unfortunately it does not contain comments or special features, which is insulting. Perhaps the next generation will have them. <br /> <br /> The film is still very funny, and Reynolds and Ward are great actors in their prime.
