Seeing this film, or rather a set of films, in early adolescence irrevocably changed my understanding of the possibilities of human interaction and the range of potential experience. This monumental study of individuals and their historical environment shows how rich and intense each human existence is. People are portrayed as they are: their experience from the smallest to the largest internal and external phenomena is detailed with the greatest skill and perception. Edgar Reitz shows an incredible assessment of human motives and aspirations. <br /> <br /> When these phenomena are contrasted to the huge time allotted for the duration of work, it is impossible not to grasp the strength and vigor of happiness, defeat. Lust, love, sadness, longing that everyone experiences. When I watched these films, I was aware of my future experience, how my life would inevitably spin and fluctuate due to perceived and random events. I had a feeling of longevity of being and of what it means to reflect in past lives, memories and contexts. Masterpiece and revelation. The only pity is that the BBC will not check it again. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows where I can get a copy, they can contact me.
