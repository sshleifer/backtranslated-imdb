The story begins with the fact that the soldier is transported to a deserted city, and then tells how he got to this place. He began as an officer in the army of Napoleon, who fought in Egypt, but separated from his unit. After almost starving and / or dying of thirst, he stumbled upon a leopard, who somehow became his sidekick. This brought him food, and soon the soldier became almost completely wild, so acute was his connection with the animal. All things end, however, and the man decided that he needed to leave the creature. Very strange film, well written and pictured. Beautiful landscapes from Jordan and Utah, which are not always ideally combined, but who cares.
