After my 6-year-old daughter started taking riding lessons, I started looking for films about horses for her. I have always heard of the National Velvet, but I have never seen it. Boy, I'm glad I bought it! It became my favorite, my 6 year old and my 2 year old. It is a pity that such films are no longer made.
