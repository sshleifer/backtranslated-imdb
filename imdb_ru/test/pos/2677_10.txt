This show is awesome! I love every episode. Carrie - spit, and Doug - cute, and sometimes an idiot. Arthur, Spence, Danny, Deacon and Boss Carrie add just a nice touch to the show, tying up all the funny moments of piss in your pants. One season, Doug tries to get Carrie drunk because she’s better when she’s drunk. Good husband, right? Carrie is not much better when her boss needs an IPS driver to testify on a small case at her job. Kerry hesitates because she views Doug as slobbering and does not want him to embarrass her, so instead she hires Doug's friend, Wife of the Year . But the one whom I consider the most ridiculous is Arthur's random cry. He's damn funny and angry. Hey, you would, too, if you had to live in a basement where mold has a funny smell and makes you dizzy. This is a fun show, and if you haven’t seen it yet, it means you haven’t lived!
