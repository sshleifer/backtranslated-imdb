I watched this film during a special preview in Reading, Berkshire. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Michael and Rory, make friendship when Rory is introduced to the nursing home where Michael already lives. Michael is surprised to find someone who can finally understand him, because until now his brain tentacles made people think that he could not communicate. <br /> <br /> Rory introduces Michael to the life he misses. Rory is a furious character who does not allow his condition (muscular dystrophy) to reach him. <br /> <br /> They associate themselves and apply for independent living, find a wonderful apartment and assistant and get all the pleasure they can ever dream of. <br /> <br /> Don't go watch this movie if you need Entertainment. Watch this movie if you want to see something a little different. <br /> <br /> The storyline is strong, the actors are fantastic, and, despite the sadness that comes with the film, the mood improves mood. /> <br /> I fully recommend this. Although, if you are something like me and tend to cry - take napkins, as you will need them!
