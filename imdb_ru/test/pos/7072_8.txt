This film has the courage to assume that it is best to just accept your life as it is, and still keep smiling. As someone who cares more about the idea of ​​taking responsibility for his life and moving forward, I felt like a slap in the face, but this is normal: I don’t have to agree with the film to love and respect it. Great game of Stripe and Hert, and everyone else, in fact, and several surprisingly unusual scenes. Serious movie. And take a handkerchief.
