Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative films recently released. It was funny, but there were also many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear and other actors made their incredibly strange characters seem real. The story took a turn that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're tired of the latest formula films, check out Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go watch this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!
