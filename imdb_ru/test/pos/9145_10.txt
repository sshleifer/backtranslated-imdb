The stars of Midnight Soul Armand Assante (Simon), who looked in "Kings of Mambo" and Elizabeth Bennett (Alicia Milford). Together with the sexy vampire fox, Lucila Sola (Iris), Simon lures pregnant Alicia and her husband Charles into the nether Midnight Soul. Assante immerses his fangs in the script of script writers Brian and Jason Cleveland, and you like to watch him and Iris kill. Alicia and Charles (Robert Floyd) are trying to stay alive as long as blood supports bloodlust. <br /> <br /> (warning spoiler) In today's tormented landscape, there is nothing surprising in the fact that the bitten preacher is bitten, does the Set look cool ?? Lots of detail at the Borgo Hotel and cool special effects at the end. I had a lot of fun watching this movie ?? It does not take itself too seriously and looks great.
