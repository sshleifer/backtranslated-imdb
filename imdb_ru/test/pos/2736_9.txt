If you repeat a lie many times, will it become true? 15 Park Avenue is a story about the alternate reality of schizophrenic (Mithi). The film tells about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers another masterpiece. Each film actor was better than the others. Konkona Sen looks incredibly convincing, like a schizophrenic. She removes this role with such ease and maturity that she is not of age. Shabana Azmi, as usual, is incredible. She plays the dominant and extremely independent older sister Mitya, who takes care of her sick sister and aging mother. She refuses to admit that, despite all her strength and courage, she sometimes feels lonely. It was supposed to be a very light film for Rahul Bose. The role was the least demanding, and anyone could play that role. <br /> <br /> The ending of the film was the most surreal part of the whole process in Park Avenue. It took me some time to digest that the film was over. It left me confused and perhaps even a little worried. But later he began to sink. My eyes are black. But if everyone says they are blue, I will still believe that it is black ??!
