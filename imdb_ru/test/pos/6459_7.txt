Emphasizing the role of Sidney Poitier and the pensive presence on the screen of John Cassevetes, “The Edge of the City” is a film that was shot for the audience since the 1950s, directed by Martin Ritt. Here is a great acting game and amazing photography in black and white colors. <br /> <br /> Poitiers is a delight at this stage in his career, and Tommy Tyler, whom he plays, is happy and sociable. He is friends with Axel Nordman, played by Cassevetes, a young man suffering from bad self-esteem and a past that he wants to keep secret. Tyler, a black man, takes his friend out of his shell and presents him to his family and new friend. <br /> <br /> Tyler and Nordman are working on the docks in New York at a time when workers were expected to tow the line, if they knew what was good for them. Boss Charles Malik, played by Jack Warden, in one of his many bitten roles is at the center of discontent, which leads to a catastrophic clash with Nordman. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, we are left with mixed emotions. However, the two main characters left the audience a story of friendship between two different people in a hostile world.
