This is the best film I have seen in the last 5 years. Of course, he will be on a par with such masterpieces as Platoon, Apocalypse Today, Doors, Dog's Heart (Russian film). Indeed, the game of the boy and his parents is so good that it is even impossible to say that they “play”. No, they live as if it happens to them. Pay attention to the smile on their faces when the main character agrees to walk with them. Hate and love in one piece. And the last scene! <br /> <br /> Indeed, I am still impressed by this film. It is very difficult, even impossible to combine humor and tragedy, but if you succeed (and Frederickson did), the blow will be twice as strong. <br /> <br /> I compared it with ONE TOP ON THE GOOK'S NEST, I also like this movie (and the novel itself is also good), but after Frederickson’s movie it seems simple. (I noticed the same difference after watching American History X and ROMPER STOMPER - the last one is deeper). I mean, Milos Forman only showed a material point of view on the problem. You watch it, then say: “Yes, this is a good film, I like it, I don’t like it, that's all.” But "Angels" leave you a wide base for reflection. There are no bad and good boys in the film. Because each of them has the right to behave like him. As the girl of one of the patients. Of course, she is young and pregnant, and for her the problem is that his husband is in the clinic, but the feelings and emotional experience of her ex is even stronger (as a result of his suicide). Why ask him what he did? Are not you mad to ask yourself? Why not support him, help him, understand him? Finally, it's even funny when these people talk to each other. They say ingenious things! There are many things that I would like to say about this film, but I am not very good at English. But I am sure that those of you who have watched the film understand me. <br /> <br /> Good luck! <br /> <br />
