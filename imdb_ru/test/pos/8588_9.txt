First of all, it is interesting to note that one of the users here who commented on this film (from Belgium) should have added that Lumumba was a “communist”. If this user really watched the movie, the message was that he was not a communist, but cursed (by none other than Belgium, the United States, the United Nations, etc.) as a “communist” leader for other people, corporations and the country. political and economic benefits. Even if someone decides to admit that the film is involved in “revisionist history,” it would be naive to assume that Lumumba was a communist, especially from a country that “granted” Congo independence, and since Lumumba was elected DEMOCRATIC Minister <br /> <br /> For the film ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most important and powerful films I've seen for a long time. Describing the struggle of an African freedom fighter and the struggle of an elected president as his first leader, Mr. Peck, he does a very commendable job of combining all the parts into one job. And that must have been quite a challenge. Due to the fact that most people outside the Congo and Belgium probably do not know the history of Lumumba and the Congo, with the exception of some light coverage of African imperialism (hopefully) in one of their high school / high school (or possibly university / on college level) in history lessons, he had his work cut out. <br /> <br /> And in order to think that Oliver Stone’s “JFK” took more than 3 hours, Lumumba worked less than 2 hours. And these were the most entertaining 115 minutes, as we see that his desire not to compromise with the Western powers (whom he considers responsible for the atrocities before his people, in particular with Belgium), at the same time trying to cope with the struggle for power within his own borders, it seems surprising even with some of his friends that this man lived as long as he did. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is interested in equality, justice, humanity, history, politics and true freedom MUST see this. You will not be disappointed.
