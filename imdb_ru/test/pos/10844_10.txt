It was one of the most emotional films I've ever seen. Passion, joy, pain, despair, sadness, healing, cleansing and love. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was fascinating. Everything was done so well; adaptation from the book, actors, scenery, shots from the camera. <br /> <br /> This film deeply touched me. It reminded me of the despair that loss of love can have, and the time it takes to heal this wound. You may love again, but you will always risk the pain that comes with separation. <br /> <br /> Is this not one of the most important old questions? <br /> <br /> "Is it better to have love and lose? <br /> <br /> What have you never loved before? <br /> <br /> - Ascension
