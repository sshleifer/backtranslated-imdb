a brilliant script .. <br /> <br /> the script is very dense .. that you will be tucked in a chair .. <br /> <br /> this film is an example for a film that can only survive with the script and not - history is needed . <br /> <br /> The story is very simple that you can write in one line. but the script was amazing .. <br /> <br /> Vijay and Prakashraiâ€™s brilliant performance .. <br /> <br /> although the plot is similar to the occade .. the director adapted only the plot. The Tamil version is much faster than Telugu. <br /> <br /> The film moves straight, without any chance of deviating, although you can understand that all the characters are retreating. <br /> <br /> keep moving
