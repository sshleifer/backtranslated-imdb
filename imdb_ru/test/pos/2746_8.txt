I liked the pictures of airports - Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc.,. Just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. And trimotory, and well-dressed passengers. Fast forward to 75 years .... <br /> <br /> But what really struck me was the sickle and hammer emblem and what seemed like a Chinese ideogram next to the logo in the stern of the pilot’s seat on the right side of the fuselage. Remember when mutual acquaintance Neill and Jill meet that Jim became a general in the Chinese rebel army? This, based on the hammer and sickle, could only be the People’s Revolutionary Army of Mao Tse-tung !!! Never mind lingerie and an unmarried couple in bed - would this logo and this link be preserved during the Cold War? <br /> <br /> Additional observation 12/27. This 30s film with the Soviet emblem can also reflect the influence and charm of communism in Hollywood and most of America during the depression. Adds to the historical value of this terrific movie. <br /> <br /> I also liked the aspects of the American dream of two guys from Winnemucca, who stormed at least part of the world, Red-Blooded (literally and abundantly in the case of Jim) American Boys. <br /> <br /> Others commented on aerobatics more cleverly than me, etc. I liked everything. <br /> <br /> This gem deserves more than just 1.5 stars, which Osborne and Co. rated at TCM, at least for the record. parts of american history beginning of the 30s.
