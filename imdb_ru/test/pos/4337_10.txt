Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Awful game! Incredible scenarios! Funny scenes of death! Creepy evil villains! The last 30 minutes of this film can be the best 30 minutes ever captured on tape, especially in a scene where decent, hardworking citizens pull chains across the street, knocking off evil bikers and then shooting them just to join. Children (! !!) on holiday. And how can you forget an elderly woman with a broom? She sweeps up the scum! And if that's not enough, let's not forget how quickly the punks surrender after the murder of Fracker. I laugh, just think about it. <br /> <br /> I also like the scene of the death of the girl Quercy. He just * leaves * seeing that it was blown up. These little things make Death Wish 3 such a bad movie. And I'm not even talking about a strange soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I watched this film because of Martin Balsam, whom I think I consider to be one of the best character actors in the entire history (and whose own "scum" beat the funny scene) and I left a new favorite movie. Thank you, Death Wish 3, for making me laugh so much. <br /> <br /> A few other things I forgot to mention: 1. A strange sound effect after Kersey says " Cash! "When buying your used car. Ha! It sounds so mean. 2. Mandy Freaker. Mandy! Have the writers run out of cool guys? 3. The fact that gangs there seems to be a loan-and-lease exchange program for thugs: “I need more guys.” And Mandy has a working telephone line in an abandoned building. 4. At the end of the movie, after Kersey blew up Freiker: it's just me Or does it seem like the street gang is about to break into choreography when they surrender? Just see how they synchronize after the female punk gives a stop signal. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. Nothing cheers me up like Death Wish 3!
