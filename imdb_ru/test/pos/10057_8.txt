Nikki Finn is the girl I will marry. Never boring, always thinking positive, good with animals. Well, as one reviewer wrote, too much peroxide, lipstick and eyebrows (only Madonna could get away with this). But that is why I love Nikki Finn, she is not your ordinary girl. She makes things happen, always exciting and always honest. Of course, she steals, but she does not rob and kill (unless you are going to kill her). She knows which rules can be violated and which should be followed. She knows what to take and what cannot be stolen. If you need a favor from her, she is 100%. Bottom line: she knows how to enjoy life. Nikki always loves (that's why she loves wild animals) and is completely devoted to those she loves and who loves her. <br /> <br /> Who is this girl? She is a girl for me.
