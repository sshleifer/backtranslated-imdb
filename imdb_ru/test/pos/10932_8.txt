“Eagle's Wing” is a pleasant surprise for the film that interests the viewer. I did not know anything about this, made by the British, until I read the comments of other viewers. I can see why he won the cinema award, because he was brilliantly presented and must have looked great on a huge theater screen. <br /> <br /> He seemed to be much more realistic than most westerns, portraying how the West was more believable. As well as the complexity of the characters he represents. The nature of the Indian Sam Waterson is especially intriguing. He seems cruel in the wild environment to which he is accustomed, but shows an amazing respect for the weaknesses he observes in the white men and women he faces. He is not friendly and not sensitive to these intruders on his lands, but he has a limit to his feelings of revenge, even compassion, when he is in power and watches a faded white man inclined to revenge, and also a girl he kidnaps after taking a stage coach. Thus, his character seems difficult, but comparable to the harsh lands in which he lived and which these attackers threatened, with whom he is not heartless in his relationship. <br /> <br /> The magnificent horse he rides is critical It is interesting to note how this Indian copes with this, compared to the character of Martin Sheen, who had owned and owned him for some time. “Eagle's Wing” is an unusual Western genre, which I don’t draw to, but I really appreciate this excellent offer, which I would rate in second place after “Horse called Man.”
