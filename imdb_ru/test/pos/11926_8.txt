I am rarely partial to films about smart teenagers who have problems with power, but “Toy Soldiers” have grown on me with repeated screenings. This is the same film about how Billy Tepper grows up and becomes an adult, like everything else, and I pay tribute to Sean Astin and writer / director Daniel Petrie Jr. that they don’t make this big deal, but let them turn around and sneak up on you. The partnership of Tepper's friends, their grief over Joey's death, and their joy of their survival — they all really move. And, I have to admit, I feel a certain patriotic (and, perhaps, slightly reptilian) joy when the guys from the US Army finally approach and rightly kick some drug-terrorist ass. Oooh, General Kramer! And the heroic Robert Folk is a cherry on top. I’m sure I could find hundreds of reasons not to like “toy soldiers”, but as long as we don’t take it too seriously, I don’t see any need for that. This is one of the most spectacular "bad" films in my pantheon.
