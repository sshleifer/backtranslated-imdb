I'm not one of those people who watch TV shows, because the actors are usually lame or unreal or too dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Each has its own personality, and Lorelai Gilmore is the best of her sarcastic comments, which can make any bad situation a little ridiculous. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She prides herself on going to Harvard, and the boys / boys always rank second in her book. She is a loyal friend and always a peacemaker. There is a delicate novel that I like personally. Not a soft, pleasant romance, which may not have many people in their lives, but a realistic type of romance. Each character ultimately gets it, and they don’t find their prince charming at first glance, and they don’t just “fall in love” with every guy who comes their way. This is a realistic show, but when you watch it, you better refresh your films, pop culture and random facts, because Lorelai Gilmore always links. I fell in love with this show, and if you give him a chance, you too.
