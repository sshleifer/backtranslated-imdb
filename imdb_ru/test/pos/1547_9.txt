One of the best "kitchen sinks". Fantastic views of London and priceless fragments of the life of the working class of the 60s. Loach's eyes, it seems, fix everything, but do not make judgments - the taste of things that will come. As in the case of Kes, Riff-raff and Sweet Sixteen, it serves as the cinematic social history of Britain. Carol White is completely convincing: you love her, imagine her, want to take care of her, but keep your head on her self-destructive decisions and still follow her in some vain hope. Well supported by Terence Stamp (just from “The Collector”, also “Catch”) and many English faces (all look very young). Perfectly tuned to the soft tones of Donovan. Mark sings “Yellow is the color” in a beautiful scene, ending with what he says: “It's getting better, not me” (I think this song is also used in the “Rules of Attraction”). See how Carol White’s mom prepares to “get out and get a boyfriend” by putting false eyelashes on the Rosie sound on the radio is priceless. A treasure for all who were at that time, and a reminder of how to live well now in England. By the way, Soderburgh used clips from “The Poor Cow” in “The Limey”.
