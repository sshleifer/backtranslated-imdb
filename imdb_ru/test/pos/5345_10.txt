Who can ask for more? I admit that taking children 2 and 4 years old was risky. But it's worth it. They were delighted with the loan to loan, with their parents next to them. <br /> <br /> I used to take children to films earlier with mixed results: too scary, too boring, too complicated, anything. However, with this film I was glad to see on the screen an intelligent film with wit, style and a sense of passion. Any film, the production of which takes 5 (!) Years, good or bad, deserves some respect for the courage and patience needed to make such a film. <br /> <br /> OK I'm a little whipped. Again, why don't I worry? Viewing the list of films today only reminded me of the low quality of the films being distributed. At least for the moment, despite this, W & G is a well-made film. Perhaps originality was not the most inspiring, nevertheless, well-told and well developed. <br /> <br /> Too much adult humor? Too many sexual references? May be. Although my kids didn't quite catch them. Too young. So, in my case, I actually did not notice. <br /> <br /> Well, of course, I liked it.
