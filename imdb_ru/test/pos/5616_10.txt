Although many of the great musicians' audio recordings, such as Yasha Heifetz, have been preserved, the cinema or television recording is indeed limited. That is why musical proposals like “They will have music” are such rare pearls. While with modern eyes and ears one can argue about the plot, an astute viewer must present the unique charms of this film in their proper perspective. The plot was designed to attract both young and old viewers of the era, but it remains pleasant to this day. An important aspect of the experience of watching classic films is to see them through the eyes of the viewer of that era. <br /> <br /> I have to argue with a reviewer who complains about a black-and-white film, or who feel obligated to report that their students express such reservations. These are complaints from minors that reflect a limited historical perspective. For the teacher, this should provide an educational opportunity to explain the unique qualities of black and white photography and its place in cinematic history. In fact, the color can interfere with a good storyline or music. For example, John Ford’s black and white photo of Stagecoach, like the photos of Ansel Adams, is an artistic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> As regards the fact that Kheifetz is wooden, I cannot but agree with this. If you want a blatant emotional posturing, go to a rock concert. The role of a classical musician such as Heifetz is to move the audience, not himself. Emotions of Heifetz are transmitted through his game, and not through his body language. He had a rare ability to extract every emotional nuance from music and pass it on to his listeners. Should move the listener, not an artist. <br /> <br /> By the way, one of the reviewers asked how Haifetz on YouTube plays the 1st movement of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto with Frank McHugh in the audience. This is from the 1947 film Carnegie's Hall, not “They will have music.” The Carnegie Hall is an even greater treasure of many great classical artists in their prime. We are happy that there were film producers who, at least in these limited cases, decided to demonstrate these artists. It was still an era, not fully embraced by the least common significant deception that we receive today.
