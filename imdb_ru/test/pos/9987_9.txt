THE BIGGEST GAME, EVER PLAYING (TGGEP, 2005), is an amazingly inspiring, infectious film for outsiders that never (really) turns into happiness or heaviness. Yes, this requires several freedoms, as most Hollywood films do, but these freedoms are forgiven, because they really increase the pleasure of the film, and not detract from it. In fact, there are many true moments in it. You can really say that this is a Rocky-type movie right from the start, but who cares? Directed by none other than Bill Paxton (I know, right?!), This is done professionally and immensely watchable! <br /> <br /> TGGEP tells the story of Francis Uymet (with confidence, audacity and class from future superstar Shea LaBeouf), an amateur golfer from a family of Irish-French immigrants from the working class living in Brooklyn, MA, in early 1900s Uimet gets the right to play in 1913 in the United States. Among its competitors is the legendary Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane played with great class, dignity and ferocity). Ironically, Vardon is the second loser in this film! The film begins in Scotland in the 1870s, when property developers tell a young man that they are building a golf course at home, and that golf is not a game for people like him. Francis is exposed to some of the same prejudices as the boy in Brooklyn in the early 1900s. Stories converge on the 1913 Open. <br /> <br /> The irony is that even as an adult and multiple champion, Vardon is still an outcast in British society because of his upbringing. Francis learned a lot about golf by reading Vardon’s books on the subject, and Vardon is his idol when he grew up. Unbeknownst to Vardon, they actually met in 1900 in Boston after Vardon, who won this year's Open, toured when Francis was only 7 years old. <br /> <br /> In addition to Francis and Vardon, participants in the 1913 Open Championship include Friend and champion Vardon Brit Ted Ray (furious Stephen Marcus) and classless two-time defending champion John McDermott (Michael Weaver). The film really shows the different people of these people. <br /> <br /> Redhead Marnie Macfile is ingratiatingly serene and stunning as the Irish mom who supports her and veteran Francis Elias Coteas performs a stern, restrained, silent performance as his French father. In addition, the brave young Josh Flitter (in the role of a 10-year-old Caddy Eddy the size of a pint the size of a pint) almost alone steals the case. <br /> <br /> Paxton adds a lot of modern details, such as special effects - in the pictures to show the positioning on the scoreboard of players and CGI for a lot of golf shots so that the movie is exciting and at a fast pace so as not to make the movie too significant. But the film still convinces us in a certain time and place. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, although it looks like Rocky, it’s all based on real events! So the final is satisfactory on many levels. An entertaining golf film made in the early 1900s ... Wow!
