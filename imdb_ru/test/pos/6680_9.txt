at least for me. and quite unexpectedly - as a subject. a film that makes you question your beliefs, your life, your approach to everything. it helps you see the world we live in through a lens - or a variety of lenses ... an exciting, amazing, and exciting movie. <br /> <br /> and one of the best performances from Kevin Spacey. very well supported by Jeff Bridges. there is no false note in this tango, it is the perfect dance. perfect to the end. <br /> <br /> What does the end mean? well ... whatever you want ... <br /> <br /> the movie you want to see again. may not immediately possible after a few days. months. of the year. but it is something to go or come back.
