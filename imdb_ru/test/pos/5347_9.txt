Creative, fast, satirical! Americans make "crazy", but the British make "witty" - and they like to make fun of themselves (hmm: unattractive teeth, big lips / nose, the usual "Veddi" or the snob "Veddi", obsession with "gaden"). Inside there is a joke for older people in the audience, a lot of action for the kids. Subtle use of devices from other classic films (see "Back to the Future", "Indiana Jones", "Harvey", "Tremor" ... and others). In addition, a great film "buddy" (Sounds quiet, but resourceful assistant). Add a brilliant voice acting by Bonham-Carter and Fiennes (really? The best acting game these days is done in animation?) - enjoy! I saw it with my grandchildren. fun time for everyone. - canuckteach
