Think of it as an extreme form of detention without trial. Without commenting or supporting the US foreign policy, the Emergency extradition process involves the delivery of persons suspected of terrorist activities to a foreign country, as opposed to extradition, if you will, to a place where torture is not a crime, but a means to illegal information. Instead of staining your land with the blood of potentially innocent parties, you do it in a foreign land, where such tactics are an accepted interrogation technique. <br /> <br /> Naturally, given the severity of tactics and attempts to break a person, sometimes you get what you want when you pass resistance, or do not get anything, or, worst of all, get recognition only because your mind was broken to the extent that the subject agrees with everything you say. This is an ugly process, and what better way to do it when you become a human rights champion, preferring to use any necessary means to protect more lives, in an era when information is the key to fighting terrorism, where probably the rights situation is doubtful. <br /> <br /> This year Siriana is executed, although on the eve of the new year we have a number of political contenders for a thriller for this crown. primarily with Rendition, followed by Robert Redford’s Lions for the Lambs film with Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep (again, though, now on the other side of the fence) and the Kingdom with Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner, although this one is probably would turn out to be more active. Directed by Gavin Hood, who starred in Tsotsi and will lead the new release of Wolverine, Rendition is a decent thriller with the highest level actors, in a narration that has been proven quite popular these days - split, which provides for a fairly large differential perspective will be presented in the ensemble. <br /> <br /> Chemical engineer Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metvalli) is assigned on his way home by order of the CIA’s top leadership Corrin Whitman (Meryl Streep); , so prophetic) begins his very first interrogation, no doubt, being put in a position to which he did not subscribe. Upon returning home, a very pregnant Reese Witherspoon is desperately seeking answers to her husband’s disappearance and sought the help of former Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard), as he works for Senator Hawkins (Alan Arkin). Throw in Yu.K. Synmons, the investigation into the terrorist plot and the incipient story of forbidden love between Fatima (Zineb Oukhk) and Khalid (Moa Huas), you have quite a few events in the busy picture. <br /> <br /> Given the few throws Location, timing, and the like, the presentation was not at all confusing, and it plays with clever handling of the material, never judging quickly, presenting ideas and thoughts from both sides of the equation. Each character has their own agenda, and the disclosure of this agenda involves enough not to bore you or mislead you. And the best part of all this is how, for real, they tend to self-preservation in various forms and, ultimately, in various situations of loss, unfortunately. It made you also guess whether he did it or not, and constantly thought about whether Anwar deserves what he gets. It used one extremely clever sleight of hand, which I did not expect until it was too late (so that was all the merit), although he gave in to the usual stereotypes about terrorist fighters and did not spend much time studying their motivation. , <br /> <br /> Perhaps this was not necessary, given that many films already dealt with this topic (Paradise Now, Day, Night, Day, Night, even Siriana). Although it turned out to be rather one-dimensional (personal tragedy with the attachment of bombs to becoming a suicide bomber), I felt that Rendition did the right thing without providing a sugar sweet end, that this struggle with a negative, destructive ideology is not something that can be considered in the two-hour film, and I'm glad that he avoided such fabulous improbability. <br /> <br /> Instead, we have a well-thought-out story that leads one to the question of transmission, and is probably capable enough to ignite the discussion after the lights come on, in which camp you belong - are you? Supports causing severe pain during interrogation? Yes or no? This is the most significant question of our time. Yes or no? (OK, I'm already adapted for lions for lambs)!
