Paul Schröder and his brother Leonard wrote to Mishima, and at the same time they clearly draw parallels between the life of Yukio Mishima and his work. The film is divided into four parts: beauty, art, fighter and fateful day, when Mishima took hostage an army general and talked with the garrison, only to ridicule him and his ideals bushido in the samurai code. Mishima performed ritual seppuku November 25, 1970, and he conceived it as a combination of beauty, art and action. Schröder edits scenes recreating this day with three different scenarios from Mishima's novels: the Temple of the Golden Pavilion, Kyoko House and Running Runners. The moment of seppuku is perfectly realized in relation to its shocking climax by pulling the camera back and simultaneously increasing. <br /> <br /> Black and white sequences are mixed with colorful moments depicted in Mishima's novels. Black and white scenes represent memories from Mishima's childhood and youth. Schroeder relates some of these autobiographical moments to scenes from novels that are often parallel to Mishima's real life, such as his stuttering, the development of his obsession with bodybuilding, and his development of samurai code. Each of the three themes of beauty, art, and action is illustrated in selected images from the respective novels. The color sequences are reminiscent of Technicolor’s early stage films, giving the film a supposedly surrealistic quality with subject matter. <br /> <br /> Ken Ogata plays the real Mishima with steadfast determination and goes to the general’s office. that fateful day reminds the real Mishima. With this film, Schroeder took a tremendous risk by focusing on the novels he made and on linking them thematically to Mishima's personal life and his literary ambitions. Editing the film between the three main sections of November 25, 1970, the black and white segments of growing up and the colorful novels clearly indicates the intentional intersection of these elements of beauty, art and action in the life of Mishima. Sometimes it is difficult to follow him, and very few people can recommend him to the uninitiated viewer. *** out of 4 stars.
