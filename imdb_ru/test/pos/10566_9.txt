3-hour adaptation of the BBC novel Sarah Waters ... "Fingersmith". Life is hard without money, especially in London Dickensia. Dark deeds lead to disgusting dilemmas. Is love really just a luxury for the rich and free ?? Elaine Cassidy as Maude Lilly and Sally Hawkins as Sue Trinder give fantastic performances to leading women asking this question ... EVERYONE'S MORE ... while Rupert Evans shines like a deliciously bad Gentleman ... "Mrs. Saxby" Imelda Staunton, "Mr. Ibbs" by David Troton and "Uncle" by Charles Dance. The plot unfolds, and I was not sure that I could be taken care of characters who could hurt and use each other in this way ... but somehow ... I donâ€™t care ... and this is because of the quality of the performances. .. love is love ... hate is hate ... betrayal ... confusion ... I hope you get the idea and hopefully get a DVD and enjoy. (Elaine Cassidy is just gorgeous in this ... really gorgeous .... I have to announce that I am at her fan club ... Hi Elaine :)
