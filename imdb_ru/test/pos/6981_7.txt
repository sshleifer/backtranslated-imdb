Fairly effective horror / science fiction in the style of "Alien" is pretty well made, given its limited ambitions. Some nice special effects and well-thought-out sequences of actions adequately correct cracks in a rather tedious dialogue. When the spacecraft falls on a distant planet, the survivors soon realize that in the darkness of the coming total eclipse awful horror awaits them.
