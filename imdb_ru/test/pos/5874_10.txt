What can be said about any Wilder film, apart from the fact that they are the most human and real stories about people, and what drives them, causes them, pursues them. Billy created paintings that look like paintings that always reflect the human condition. He draws good and bad in all of us. He also draws with love. I can't imagine anyone having a list of the best films without a Wilder film. They will last because they are true. I first saw this film on TV in the 60s when I was a child, and I had to leave the room because I felt tears rush at me and become embarrassed. Now I am an old man, and I still feel the tears, but do not leave the room. I knew these people, loved them and grew up around them. Billy retained them in this film, not in the “greatest generation,” but in the most realistic way, retaining the power of the human spirit.
