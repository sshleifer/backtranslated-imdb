“ASCENT” by Larisa Shepitko (1976) is an extraordinary, exhausting story about the partisans' struggle against the Nazis in the German-occupied Belarus. "Climbing" reflects the Russian obsession with the horrors of World War II, but it is unusual that both are imbued with religious symbolism. and is ready to admit the existence of a less great Russian collaborator. The real battle is not with the Nazis, who hover in the background as simple extras, but between a Russian Nazi investigator and Sotnikov, captured by a partisan, who finds spiritual strength to go to death unbeatable. With numerous references to the Crucifixion, the story takes on heroic proportions, glorifying the suffering of the martyr and his influence on future generations. A wonderful piece of work.
