I'm not a fan of sports - but I love sports movies! So why ... what a great sports movie ... this one. And the style of storytelling is very good. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a reliably fantastic 2 hours of entertainment, the “Greatest Game” is worthy of its worth. Here is a movie that moves. Bill Paxton attended the same school of directors as Ron Howard - a. K. Richie Cunningham, "Happy Days." That's not bad. Look at the huge mass of beautiful work that Ron did after moving behind the camera. <br /> <br /> Bill, like Ron, was a great actor, but will become a superstar director if “The Greatest Game Ever” is an indicator of things to follow. <br /> <br /> Beautiful cinematography is a fantastic direction - beautiful game, especially Elias Koteas, Shea LeBuf, Marnie MacPhail, Josh Flitter, Stephen Marcus, Justin Ashfort. a film that needs to be seen not just as “feel good”, nor as a “sports film,” is a very good film.
