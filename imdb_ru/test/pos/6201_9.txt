I do not understand why this show did not continue. There could be different ways to continue the game on the line of Darwin and Farik after the second season, obviously, Darwin could not be an agent at the University of California, penetrating the cells and sabotaging them from inside, but still they had to give this show at least one more season. <br /> <br /> The show is well thought out, believable, and considers the Islamic religion from both a normal and extremist point of view. It touches on controversial topics in detail and has a dramatic meaning that can be said about very few shows today. I am really sad that I did not know about this show until the end of 2007.
