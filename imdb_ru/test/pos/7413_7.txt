There was no special desire for this film, but was pleasantly surprised. A very well-made film, very well cut out, does not really reach the height that Human Traffic has reached, but this is a very good effort. Good director, and I thought that the lead actor played great! In fact, the only really bad performance in the film was from Tim Curry, who is supposed to be called. <br /> <br /> Cool Film was surprised that it did not achieve more success than before. I never heard of it until I saw it with my comrades. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m not nonsense, but I imagine people who really like this movie.
