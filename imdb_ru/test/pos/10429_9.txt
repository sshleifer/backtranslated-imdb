I do not understand why more people have not commented on this, except for the fact that perhaps not very many have seen it. This is an amazing set of characters, one by one, all made by the guy who wrote the play. If you don’t like the movies you shot, you may not like it (after all, plays usually don’t look good on TV), but this is a show for one person you’ll pay attention to. Highly recommended.
