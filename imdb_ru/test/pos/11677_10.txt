I saw this film in the theater when I was 14 years old, and it changed my life. I immediately cut my hair and began to buy all the records of the groups in the film. These were some of the original L.A. punk rock bands, captured at their peak. Bands such as Black Flag (pre-Rollins), Circle Jerks, Fear, X, and The Germs have little equal in punk music history. I can not believe that this film has never been released on video or DVD. Great movie for punk rock lovers.
