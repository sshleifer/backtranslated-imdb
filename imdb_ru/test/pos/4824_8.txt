I saw part of this movie on a science fiction channel, but missed the final. I bought a DVD to watch the whole movie, and I'm glad I did it. <br /> <br /> A young mother and her two daughters move into a house in a deep forest, which they inherited from their husband, who died of the disease. This is very exhausted, but three women are doing everything possible. A teenager (scout Taylor-Compton) warned by a local boy about zombies who go out at night. She ignores him, but since he has a dear friend, she joins his group. Meanwhile, the youngest daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) turns on a girlfriend in a zombie girl of her age named Mary. It turns out that Mary and several other children died in the mine in 1913, working as child labor. Now that they are zombies, they attack and kill anyone who is not a blood relative. <br /> <br /> Director of the film J.S. Cardone, whose previous films include The Slayer (1981) and Shadowzone (1990), two films that I didn’t like at all. That's why I was surprised that I really liked this movie. The film is consciously what I liked. This allows you to find out the main characters, most of whom are cute. Baby zombies have been used, at least since George Romero’s classic “Night of the Living Dead” in 1968. However, I found it interesting to use the tools of the zombie children in this film. It would seem that Cardone finally found the right script and threw it away. I was bored with only stereotypical scenes when teens smoke, drink and eat in a parked car. <br /> <br /> Taylor-Compton also appears in the Halloween remake. Moretz appeared in the film "Amityville Horror" (2005) and in the horror film "Room 6" (2006).
