I heard a lot of different opinions about this film, and then I found out that Paris Hilton was in it, and it did not make the best impression on me about the film ... and then a group of my friends dragged me to the cinema, waiting for a bunch of pants I was shocked to find that I was scared by the whole movie ... it was predictable, yes, but the accumulation of deaths and the whole atmosphere of the movie made it really scary for me ... I watched through my fingers all the way through. So I say: watch it and decide for yourself, and if the fact that this is a scary film does not convince you to go see it, then it also has Chad Michael Murray, who cannot be ill watching a couple of hours. but?
