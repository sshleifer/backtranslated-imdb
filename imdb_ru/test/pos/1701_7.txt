Well, most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake, but at the same time it is another film in itself. Don't get me wrong, “American Werewolf in London” is an excellent film, but “An American remake in Paris” is also a good film. <br /> <br /> First, the only real similarity is the NAME. , 2 american backpacks and werewolves. In addition to these three things, American Remake In Paris stands out quite well on its own with its particular blend of humor, action / adventure and horror. Most people who say that this film is better than the original are the youth of today's generation, who believe that any film shot before 1990 is complete nonsense. While those of us who grew up in the 80s can appreciate old movies and what they added to horror films today. Many people do not understand that without the old classic films, including black and white, the horror would not be what is today. Now I’m a little lost ... <br /> <br /> An American werewolf in Paris is a good attempt to recreate the classics, but it never surpasses the original. With that said, this is still a very interesting film, and I recommend it. I give him 7 out of 10. Maybe this is a bit generous, but I have seen much worse attempts to try to recreate the classics.
