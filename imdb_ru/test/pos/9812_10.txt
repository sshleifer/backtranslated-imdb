Just an amazing, bitter-sweet film, which depicts the side of life, often overlooked in films about good mood. I saw it in childhood, just recently returned to her and fell in love again. <br /> <br /> When I was a child, it aroused my interest only in building an airplane, and as an adult he took me to the Dark World and a young man escaped from this world. <br /> <br /> The King’s image was gorgeous, the style of the camera, chosen with low shots and frames with an emphasis on actions and hand movements, was, I thought, well done, I personally can’t remember anything completely done and adds to the character and portrays it as a force, almost not human (which is perhaps not far from reality), it makes for interesting events <br /> <br /> Worth seeing any day
