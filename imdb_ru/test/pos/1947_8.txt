I finally saw this in the video after years of hearing about it. This is by no means an ideal film, but strangely hypnotic - one of those rare, special films that creates its own world. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** First, bad things. Scenes in the Burkewaite class are agonizing. Even if the subject is social science, this guy is WAY TOO. His speeches are so overwhelmed that they are ridiculous. And no teachers that I have ever had would not fry their students in this way and would not say to those who protest, “Shut up!”. These scenes are short, but they violate the mood and pull the viewer out of the story. Next, how the hell did Lane just walk out of the police station near the end? Also, what happened to Samson's car after his first trip to the city? He spends the rest of the film on Lane or Fek. *** THE END OF SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Aah, Fek ... this guy is great. Dennis Hopper steals a movie effortlessly. “Check by mail”, “I love the company”, “You are my friend” - each line is classic. He gives Fek the inner logic that makes the story work. Incredibly, he actually makes the audience feel sympathy for this guy, especially when Samson talks about his (Samson) future. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Crispin Glover is sometimes difficult to accept. And yet the scenes of his driving in the "Beetle" are perfect - children with cars in high school always have something to do, and with whom it is connected. Matt's humble attitude makes Lane a good obstacle - their friendship is believable. Glover's manners are few, but he is consistent in everything. He controls the plot and exudes a sense of urgency that no one else does - just try to present this film if Lane was a zombie like Matt or Samson - a snoozefest! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** What makes the "Edge of the River" alarming is that Samson is not really evil, in the usual sense of the word. He’s kind of a boring guy who’s tired of being taken for granted — in other words, he’s like thousands of other boring guys. After he kills Jamie, he begins to unravel, which creates some anxiety while we wait for him to break again. *** THE END OF SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Part of the appeal of this film is how the action remains centered around the teenagers and their point of view. Parents - comic relief - Clarissa's mom, Tony's dad - or overwhelmed - Matt's mom. This underlines how children hold together for attention that no one pays to them. This keeps the story focused on relationships within the clique, and emphasizes that the only adult they can relate to is Fek. "The edge of the river" - is a textbook on alienation. It conveys, how awkward, mysterious and embarrassing adolescence is unlike any other film.
