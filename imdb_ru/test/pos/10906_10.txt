Joan Cusack steals the show! The premise is good, the storyline is interesting, the script is in order. A little too simplistic that the story about gays was so positive when it was usually not very positive. On the other hand, it is fiction. :) In general, an interesting romp. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed was an aspect of the “inner joke”. Since the target audience was likely to be frank, they may not perceive “fun things” in the context of the story. <br /> <br /> Kevin Klein showed the edge of his acting skills, which the writers sometimes do not take into account, suggesting Klein for a role. <br /> <br /> This hit the target.
