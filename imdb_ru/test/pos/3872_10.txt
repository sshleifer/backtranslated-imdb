Tynesha Mells In this drama, Jah Rul, who starred as Reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps Reggie find who killed his father. A week after his father died, the preacher, Rev. Packer, came dead. Reggie should have killed him, but not? Did Reggie kill Rev. Packer, or was it some kind of setup? Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes. You see, Reggie falls in love with the preacher's daughter, and Jay-Bone does not approve of his love monster. When J-Bone tries to destroy what they have, Reggie finds out that love is forgiveness. But what does J-Bone do, does it work? Is Reggie and his girlfriend frustrated, or does that bring them closer? I like this film because it makes you wonder what will happen next and whether this or that happened. I like movies with suspense! It kind of makes you want to be in a film so that you can discover things. I also like this movie because everything falls into place if you really pay attention to it!
