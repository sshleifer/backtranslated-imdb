Un Gatto nel Cervello / The Cat in the Brain is one of the worst horror films ever made. There is a lot of blood and blood, including a chainsaw massacre, bloody knife wounds and numerous beheadings. The film is also interesting as a “self” parody of Fulci, but blood and violence are a key element in it. Some of these effects were taken from Fulci's own films "Quando Alice Ruppe lo Specchio" and "I Fantasmi di Sodoma" (both 1988), and also Gore FX taken from "The Snake House" supervised by Fulchi "The Bloody Psyche" by Leandro Lukchetti , "Massacre" by Andrea Bianchi, "Non Avere Paura Della Zia Marta" by Mario Bianchi, "Non Si Sevizia i Bambini" by Giovanni Simonelli and "Luna di Sangue" aka "Fuga dalla Morte" by Enzo Milioni (all year 1989). The scene where Brett Halsey beats a woman’s face in the face is taken from the movie “Quando Alice Ruppe lo Specchio”, a film that Fulci made for Italian television in 1988. The sawing of a female corpse at the beginning is taken from the same film as the head in the microwave and the guy who goes with you over and over. Highly recommended, especially if you like extreme movies!
