Oliver Stone is not one of those who shy away from a movie or topic for that matter. He seeks to confront people with his fears or to show them their ugly faces in the mirror. Look at his resume for proof! This film is no exception, rather, on the contrary, it is another gem that, unfortunately, not many have seen. <br /> <br /> As regards controversial films, you should be grateful for them. A film that should encourage you to think about yourself, the people who are next to you. Prejudices that exist and that each of us has in one form or another. Either we like to admit it, or not, but it is easier to classify people and be like “Oh, he“ xyz ”, yes, he should be like ...”. Perhaps now I read too much, but I do not believe it. I think that Oliver Stone is a very intelligent director, and he was keen on these things. And if this is what you want to explore (like a movie or in yourself), then watch this movie and be delighted!
