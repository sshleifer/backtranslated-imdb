Extremely interesting western mid-1950s, which holds only 96 minutes. Most viewers will quickly immerse themselves in this story and find this experience quite enjoyable. The budget was modest and affordable, despite several big names. Glenn Ford was the only box office at the time. Edward J. Robinson and Barbara Stenvik passed their search for work and in search of work. Stanwick was 10 years old from the new popularity in the “Big Valley”. Brian Keith and Diane Foster are just starting out. <br /> <br /> Ford is playing John Parrish, a little rancher who decides to sell off when the sympathizing sheriff is killed by a hired gunman (Robinson). Parrish is a former Confederate officer who moved west only for health reasons. <br /> <br /> Robinson is played by Lee Wilkinson, who already owns most of the valley and intends to acquire the rest, fulfilling a promise to his wife Martha (Stanwick). Lee was disabled in a land war in which he fought 12 years ago; his brother Cole (Keith) came from Texas to help him manage the enormous spread. Lee turned a blind eye to the obvious connections between Stanwick and Keith, but the sensitive daughter Judith (Foster) is understandably upset about what is happening in their house. <br /> <br /> John Parrish promised his bride Caroline (May Winn) that he would return to the east. Caroline, who is modeled on Grace Kelly's High Midday character, breaks the engagement at the first sign of trouble and just disappears from the movie. This opens the way for the development of the novel by John and Judith. <br /> <br /> Violence begins early and continues throughout the film, and Parrish can use military tactics against an enemy who underestimates his abilities and determination. He has a very original confrontation with the main shooter around the middle of the film. Ford plays one of his standard characters; a modest guy who disarms everyone with a self-deprecating manner, who is slowly offended, but brutally, when he is finally provoked (very much like his role in Sheep Dog). <br /> <br /> Robinson is also excellent as a person who maintains his personal integrity, although he is physically only a shadow of his former self. And he gets enough lines and screen time to adequately develop his character. <br /> <br /> Stanvik plays the most difficult role, and she is simply not convincing, like a classic two-faced woman, an outwardly devoted wife who is going to replace her husband with her brother. This is partly due to the fact that she does not have enough time to do something more than superficially convey both sides of the character. However, a talented actress could have done much better, even with these limitations. <br /> <br /> Diane Foster is a pleasant surprise. She has a lot to remind viewers about Carroll Baker, both in physical and acting style. Although she is obliged to play Judith in accordance with the agreement of the 1950s (she is allowed to be tough, but then she should go into hysterics after every serious confrontation), Foster shows a good range. She conveys a growing attraction for Parrish, but she does it so subtly that it is only in retrospect that various clues click into place. <br /> <br /> The real problem of “violent people” is that he is trying to be both a western fighter and a moralizing game for learning character. Since so many things have to happen on the screen, most of the action is hastily, and many characters receive only a curt appeal. This is not a fatal flaw or a reason to avoid the movie, but it could have been much better with 20 minutes of work or the absence of unnecessary characters such as Caroline. <br /> <br /> Again, what should I do? do you know I'm just a kid.
