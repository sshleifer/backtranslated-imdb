This is a thoughtful film that reveals the injustice of the so-called upper class and those who work for them, the haves and the have-nots. Robert Shaw does a decent job as a compulsory, correct driver for Stephen Ledbetter, who helps Lady Franklin (Sarah Miles) overcome her mental depression from the very beginning. Nevertheless, Stephen has a lot of mixed feelings about this lady from the upper class. He inevitably falls in love with her, which, of course, goes beyond the social boundaries that divide them. <br /> <br /> I havenâ€™t read anything before and rate the film just the way I saw it. I think this is a very honest story about the realities of everyday life and the conflict of what we can want or expect from life and what we get. This is a good drama that is worth seeing again.
