This movie just can make you sooooo. The film WELL was worth a dark trip to the city. Betty (Renee Zellweger) is the only "acceptable" soap fan. Her character is SO charming and SO convincing that you find yourself forgiveness for being so stupid. I could even allow myself to get lost in Betty’s charming fantasy, if it were not for the fact that Dr. Ravel’s real name is George ... And talking about the devil; The "looking" Greg Kinnear performs his role VERY well. While Charlie (Morgan Freeman) makes you want his wish to come true, Wesley (Chris Rock) makes you tie him to a chair. And Rosa (Tia Texada) brings you back to these vibrant friendships in elementary school. The sheriff urges you to feed him donuts and lose his name. The rest of the cast fits well. Never act in the same movie twice, nurse Betty is an exception. One of such long, cold, needing smiles on something winter days.
