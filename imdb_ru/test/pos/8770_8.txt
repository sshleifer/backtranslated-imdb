The man is unjustly accused of killing his friend as a result of a fire at an aircraft factory, and he must travel over rough terrain to avoid the police and uncover the true sinister nature of the situation. The storyline, which was later used to feed the classic Hitchcock North in the Northwest, wins Saboteur from some very good performances, as well as some masterful episodes of suspense from the Master himself. <br /> <br /> For any Hitchcock fan, the plot is too familiar, but he could always fill the story with his memorable characters and charades. Here, the handsome and charming Robert Cummings plays a leading role and soon finds himself visiting many strange and bizarre characters who do not stand up to a troupe of circus performers, a rich businessman with hidden motives and a blind loner who shows him the best way to judge someone. <br /> <br /> In terms of originality and quality, this is lacking in some areas, especially antagonist motifs. However, there is some pleasant chemistry between Cummings and his lead woman, the rather underrated Priscilla Lane, as well as a really exciting performance in the role of the blind Von Glaser. The best part is the final sequence, which perfectly reflects what Hitchcock would use later in the North in the Northwest, only this time culminating on top of a statue in New York. Of course, not at its best, but Master Suspense gives us some great moments to wait.
