The image of the marines in this film is accurate. Action scenes are some of the best content ever made. The uniform and weaponry of the American and German troops were flawless. The Berber costumes and weapons were also completely accurate. This film can be easily used to teach the military of that period and was used by the USMC Academy for this purpose. The scenes depicting the shooting of Roosevelt and the rifles he used were beautiful. Obtaining such a large amount of weapons of the period in such a good shape is evidence of attention to detail and the presentation of this film. Milly is a genius.
