I love horror movies, but I think they work much better when they hide dramatic consequences (for example, The Backbone The Devil, The Exorcist). This is such a film, and it is not only creepy and frightening, but also very beautiful. The tale of two sisters begins very slowly, so if you hurry to see the ghosts in the first 20 minutes, you will be disappointed. In fact, this is not a ghost story, although there are some. This is something more complicated, and it is done in such a way that it does not beat Ringu and The Grudge out of the ring. Fairy tale ?? This is a much smarter movie than these huge cultural hits, because he really cares about his characters, and the direction is impeccable. Every detail in this movie will make you gasp if you are the kind of person who likes to pay attention to the details while watching the movie. The game is great, especially from the stepmother and the main girl. These two cost one ticket price. Do yourself a favor and watch this awesome movie.
