The end of time lies somewhere in the middle of the cannon Johnny To, in the category of "sheer good". As a crime thriller, it is not very original and not overwhelming, and the militants will not shake you, but there is something else in it. In the end, this is a Johnny movie. To do this. <br /> <br /> Andy Lau has 72 hours left to live. He decides to play a strange cat-and-mouse game with a Hong Kong police negotiator, played by Lau Ching Wan. This is a story in a nutshell. On top of that, heaps of layers of turns that make the process interesting in everything. Sometimes it becomes too intricate for its own sake, but never allows it to benefit from it. However, just as Johnny That is about to convey a smooth and well-made criminal click (which, let's face it, ten cents), he slips into pieces that enliven the Running Time out of time, like a full Emotional experience giving soul and heart well oiled skeleton. <br /> <br /> The concepts of synchronism and minimalism (the main elements of his work) are very well studied here. Always subtle, allowing images to speak for themselves, giving them time to evolve with long takes and slow tracking shots, exemplary reduction to zero, it's all here. A small love story on the bus between Andy Lau and the girl is one of the highlights of the film and part of the “heart” that I'm talking about. So simple, but so powerful. The same applies to the car scenes of Lau and Lau Ching Wan, as well as collisions in the bowling alley. <br /> <br /> However, something prevents me from saying that “Beyond time” is a masterpiece. He has all the abilities and skill, but sometimes he can be too skillful or soft. When he is good, he is really good. There are even some moments of pure brilliance, which are TOO good by themselves, leaving a bitterly sweet aftertaste for the rest of the film. I am convinced that if he puts his heart into this, he will be able to make a really great film. Like this, this is another one of his films that is flawed but enjoyable. Under HK's sleek style, it's black humor and soulful drama that makes this film irresistible. Worth a look, definitely.
