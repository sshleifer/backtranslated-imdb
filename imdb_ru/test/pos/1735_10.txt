2005 will go down in the history of “Doctor Who” as the most incredible year. Everything seemed to click; a first-class new Doctor and his companion, a large audience (10 million for the first episode and the Christmas edition), major awards, critical acclaim and idiots who had giggled over the Daleks' apparent inability to negotiate the ladder for years were well and truly silenced. But then Christopher Eccleston dropped the bomb, leaving only one run. Looks like the honeymoon is over. Fortunately, the public seems to have embraced his successor, the excellent David Tennant. In addition to this show, it boasts excellent S.F.X., for example, a spaceship crashing into Big Ben in Aliens Of London, and superb storylines such as Tooth & Claw, Army Of Ghosts / Doomsday. The new "Doctor Who" is basically the same as the old one, only updated for the 21st century. Some fans blamed Russell T. Davis for "breaking down" the show. They need to remember that for sixteen years there was no show until it appeared together.
