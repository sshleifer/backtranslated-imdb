An interesting entry from Europe about Czech fighter pilots flying the Air Force during World War II. It is always interesting for an American to see a new point of view on familiar events in history. There is nothing horribly original or revolutionary in the style in which it is filmed, or the romantic love triangle that reinforces the narrative. However, it is irresistible. There is a good balance between drama, romance, humor, action and symbolism, which is perfectly understated by the director and actors. It's a breath of fresh air after watching bloated and boring Hollywood epics like Pearl Harbor. Full production around. This is definitely worth your time if you are a fan of foreign cinema.
