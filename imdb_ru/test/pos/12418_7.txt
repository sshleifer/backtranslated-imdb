I took Monster Man into a box set of three films, where I basically wanted two others, but I still had a really good time. It combines horror and comedy with a reasonable effect, which was greatly helped by the worthy performances of Eric Jungman in the role of moderator, Justin Urich in the role of his girlfriend and Aimee Brooks as love interest. The film is quite predictable, and it combines the ideas of many other films, but it remains cheerful in everything, with the addition of good horrible blood. Of course, it does not match the classic comedies of Gori, but it is still good. Directed by Michael Davis even manages one or two horrible scenes, for example, in the bathroom or in the bar. The film can be watched everywhere if it is a little tangled in the plot and written, and for me it lost it a little closer to the end, when the title monster begins to resemble a Slipknot member, and the film tries to become more awful, but it is not crooked or convincing enough. The final moments are also a bit weak. Nevertheless, despite the absence of particular tension and general stupidity, this is a good example of an unpretentious, often creepy comedy that fans of the same should like.
