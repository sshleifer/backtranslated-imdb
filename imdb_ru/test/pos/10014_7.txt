“Night of the Hunted” French porn star Bridget Lahaie.In fact, many of the actors in this slow-moving production were porn actors at the time of his frantic filming.This film is certainly different from the usual Rollin movie vampire, but it’s not so memorable like, for example, the lips of blood or the charm. Lahai plays an amnesic hitchhiker who cannot remember who she is and where she comes from. Most of the film takes place in a modern residential complex where Lahai is contained in a medical group that treats many people with a similar condition. In any case, she escapes from the monolithic service tower, where the victims are kept. On the highway outside the city, she meets a young man who stops and picks her up. “Night of the Hunt” offers a lot of nudity, unfortunately, the pace is very slow. The atmosphere is terribly sad, and the relationship between Bridget Lahai and another prisoner Dominic Journet is well developed. However, the “Night” from “Hunting” is too boring to be completely enjoyable. Look at it, only if you are a fan of the works of Jean Rollin. 7 out of 10 and it is very cute.
