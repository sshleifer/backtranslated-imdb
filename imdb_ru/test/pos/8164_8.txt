Four holy young men from the Mormon country are sent to Los Angeles to preach the gospel to the city Gentiles. But one of the young Mormons is a repressed gay who “accidentally” crosses the path with a very “young” youth from the party L.A. (What will be the plots of films without coincidence?). These two very different young people become friends and in the process influence each other’s worldview, which, in turn, creates an inevitable clash between gay and Mormon cultures. <br /> <br /> This is the premise of “The Last Days,” a 2003 film, written and directed by S.Jay Cox, a former Mormon missionary. The history of the film is, of course, very relevant, especially in contemporary America. , retell and retell, hopefully, in future films ... because the main theme reveals the hatefully superior attitude that Christian fundamentalists too often show towards gays. By nature, “Last Days” are provocative, and I doubt that the film was well received in Provo or Pocatello, although the script is smart, sensitive and insightful.
