Someone will say that this movie is a guilty pleasure. I liked this movie, but I donâ€™t feel guilty about it. You can say that the whole cast and crew had fun while filming this movie. But Jack Frost 2 will not be good with some people. From the very beginning, you can say that this film will be cheesy and it definitely has an amateur look. Well, if you get the privilege of watching this movie, after watching, remember that Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the mutant killer Snowman is a pleasure, not a feeling of guilt. Now, because I can't fill ten lines, here are some wonderful scenes: <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Three women on the beach had big deaths. At the first, Jack was sitting on a tree, trying to drop the icicles on one of them. He continued to be bored, so he threw the anvil at her. The next woman fell into a bed of icicles. The latter was stabbed in the eyes with forceps. <br /> <br /> Another great one was where two surfer stoners hang out near a frozen pole. One of them hooked his tongue (of course). Jack Frost removes him, tears off his tongue, saying: "KOVA-LANGUAGE, DUDE!". Well, you have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the snowball kids kicked their ass. <br /> <br /> ** END OF SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> infinity star
