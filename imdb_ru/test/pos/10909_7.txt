I remember seeing it a long time ago, and I knew most of the concept, but without details, so I'm glad that I looked at it again from director Frank Oz (The Muppets Take Manhattan, Bowfinger). In fact, new star Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) just won an Oscar for his latest work, where he plays a gay soldier, and he makes the usual “thank you”, he even mentions his former school English teacher Howard Brackett (nominated for Golden Globe (Kevin Klein), and he surpasses him as gay! Howard is determined to clear his name and get out of the media spotlight as negative gay, especially since his marriage to Emily Montgomery (Oscar-nominated and Golden Globe Joan Cusack) is coming. Thus, it’s about the wedding day, and when it’s about Howard, who says “yes” or “no”, that is, when he loses his temper and admits to himself and everyone that he is gay. This, of course, leads to the fact that he is dismissed from his post as a teacher, but everyone stands at the prom to prove himself (in support), and Cameron even appears to clarify the situation to everything, especially school principal Tom Holliwell (elf Bob Newhart ), knew it was normal to be gay. Also starring Tom Selleck as Peter Malloy, Debbie Reynolds as Bernice Brackett, Wilford Brimley as Frank Brackett, Gregory Jbar as Walter Brackett, Glenn Close, Whoopi Goldberg and Jay Lehno. The highlight of the film should be when Klein cannot help but dance under the version of Diana Ross “I Will Survive”, which must have convinced him of his sexuality. Kline is always good, Cusack is an unexpected Oscar nominee, and all the supporting actors also contribute to this very funny comedy. Fine!
