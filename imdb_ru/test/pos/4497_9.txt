I have not read the novel from which the film is based. Therefore, I cannot comment on what is missing or whether any changes have been made. <br /> <br /> As I said above, I had a wonderful experience when I watched THE KITE RUNNER ... I see that when I watch films about other cultures than here in the USA, I find out how other nations live and exist. <br /> <br /> The filmâ€™s actors are from Afghanistan and other countries in the region. In this almost epic film there are 3 small children in the first roles. They were amazing. <br /> <br /> The scenes that were supposedly in Kabul were filmed in various parts of China, I assume that this area looks like the actual places in the book. <br /> <br /> Mark Foster was the director, and he FIND NEVRAND, he created the same magic here. <br /> <br /> All aspects of production are first class. <br /> <br /> I found this film better than the nominated and won Oscar. <br /> <br /> The subtitle of the film is very easy to read. It has a proper PG-13 rating. SPOILER WARNING --- The rape scene is very good for children. <br /> <br /> However, I cannot give it a 4-star rating as a general storyline and storyline, which we have seen many, many times. less is a very useful movie to watch .. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
