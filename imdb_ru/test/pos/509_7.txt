I hope that the final line will not annoy you greatly (this is a small tribute to Chappelle Show / Charlie Murphy, but also to the character Daywalker). But I will try to put everything that I liked in the film in one paragraph, and everything that I did not like in another paragraph to make it easier to read! <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good stuff! The quote “strong bloody violence” (which is used by rating boards to describe the content of the film is very well suited here. This is not a film for children! Or for the faint of heart! The focus is on the Blade. The character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal) and the storyline is crazy enough keep / justify action scenes! The original idea is also very attractive and intelligent. Episodics are great here too. <br /> <br /> OK Things I didn’t like. eating There are fighting scenes, but there can be more. And a character like Blade deserves more (imo). Drama is not the best for this ... and using cliches does not help. )
