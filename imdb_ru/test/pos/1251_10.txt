It is so nice to see Bruce Willis step down from his fighting throne and let us see that he is a truly talented actor. In this film, he shines like an almost 40-year-old image consultant who has completely lost touch with his inner child until he meets him face to face. This is one of those rare films that do not talk about their audience and really offer something for the whole family. It is about taking care of each other, keeping some children in you, and understanding that you are not growing as you thought. Willis seems to create an impressive track record for working with children (just watch “The Sixth Sense” with Haley Joel Osment), and he has excellent chemistry with Spencer Breslin. There is good photography and music, and the finale is wonderful and inspiring. Great movie to watch with every member of your family.
