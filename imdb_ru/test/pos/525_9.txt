I did not know what to expect from this extremely popular (and funny) Swedish comedy and satire team when they released their first feature film. Wider satire? Well, we get four modern, exceptionally memorable stories about family pains, gaps between generations and paternity, in particular. But this is drama, fortunately, and what a drama! Epic in scope, since each episode comes from carefully selected, geographically different parts of Sweden. But each story can seriously entail the whole film, if it is deployed separately. <br /> <br /> He is dark, crooked, painful, but at the same time massively entertaining and stunningly executed. The script, acting and cinematography are absolute world class, since three hours seem to pass in an instant! These are four shades of skill and one of the best films in the history of cinema. This is Sweden's answer to the “Short Paths” or “Magnolia”, if you will, and instantly along with them! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 from Ozeppe
