I remember watching the police squad! when he first appeared on ABC in 1982, and I thought it was a very funny show, thanks to the many spectacles, not dividers and scenarios filled with wordplay. In one episode there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, ABC canceled the show only after six episodes. I felt that this deserves a much longer launch, but the network director believes that the show requires too much viewer attention because of all the shows in each episode. One that I remember was at the beginning, where the title of the episode was different from what was shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen’s picture of Frank Drebin was ruthless, but very funny, and his role was in the narrative style of Jack Webb of Dragnet. Alan North succeeded and Peter Lupus in one of his few roles after “Mission: Impossible” was not as bad as Norberg. But the only outstanding character was Johnny, the Shoe Boy, played by William Duell. After he gave advice to Drebin, cameos from Dick Clark, Dr. Joyce Brothers, and then Dodge manager Tommy Lasorda appeared. <br /> <br /> Even though the police squad! He had a short life on ABC, the Zucker brothers did not abandon the concept, which turned out to be even more successful in the Naked Gun franchise. I will close with the usual gag closure. Freeze the ending right here.
