First, I hate Sci Fi Stuff, and although this film occasionally got a little bit of Sci Fi, that's fine, because at least it’s focused on Andre Toulon. In the last 3, Andre seemed to be mentioned, but “Stories” never focused on him, and that pissed me off. What also drives me crazy is the amount of “0” that got on the voting list. Rest, People. If you watched this movie and liked it, please vote for it. You are welcome. What I liked about this movie is that it went back to where it all began. When Andre first learned the secret of life. I would recommend to rent it if you have already seen the Puppet Master movie and you liked it. But don't rent it if you are viewing it from the PM collection for the first time, mainly because you might think that all Puppet Masters are just as “boring” as this one.
