A group of teenagers decide to take their hen party to an abandoned school, where a terrible slaughterhouse occurred 27 years ago. Unfortunately for them, the person responsible for the slaughter is still hiding in the halls of an abandoned school, and he is dissatisfied with their presence. <br /> <br /> This film is not like most of today's teenage slashers we have seen. It is much darker, much more alarming, without wise killers, etc., and I liked it for these reasons. In terms of filmmaking, this is not great. The game is below average. The letter was pretty bad and rather full of cliché, which contained randomly inserted links to American horror films, some of which did not even make sense (for example ... "Did you see Scream 3?", The girl asked. Yes, I have, and this had nothing to do with walking through the doors of the old school, so it has nothing to do with this film). But hey, this is a slasher, this is part of the fun. In addition, the under-use of characters has been strongly featured in this film. There were six main characters (not counting the “Guard”), and, frankly, only three or four were actually used. Two characters (a black guy and some other girl who was not important enough to get a label) barely said: between them I would rate only five or six lines. In addition, girls (except one) were not sufficiently formed to distinguish them from each other. They could replace each of the girls on each other throughout the film, and I would not notice the difference. However, stimulation works well, as horror begins from the beginning and rarely stops. The atmosphere is well used, and the direction shows some really scary moments. , although, in general, the appearance looks a bit cheap due to, I believe, low-quality camera equipment (and work). The ending, although I liked the idea they were aiming for, was rather poorly done. It was felt hastily and without explanation to make it effective. Given the amount of time they spent on the run in search of nothing, they could spend a little more time drawing a conclusion to make sure that this didn’t look like a random event added without a good reason (which is a disadvantage for many). modern horror films are amazed). However, ignoring a few tedious problems and trying to focus on the first 98% of the film, rather than the final, this is actually a pretty good modern slasher that is worth checking out, especially if you are a Spanish and / or Atmospheric horror fan. <br /> <br /> Required elements of Slasher: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: Really a lot of blood and blood, really done, but not a bucket. Violence is very well done, but not excessive, but rather cruel at some point. <br /> <br /> Sex / nudity: a little, and with the hottest girl in the movie. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer: Well, the guards can hardly be called "cool", but this guy is pretty angry. His eerie smile was frightening. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Pausing: waiting is first class. .. very hard, very well done. There are also some very creepy moments that mix funky jumping and eerie atmosphere. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: none at all. <br /> <br /> - Awkward dance scene: Sure: between a couple of guys and a half involuntary woman in memory. <br /> <br /> - Classical quotation from the film: “Another trophy”. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: 7/10. It may stretch it, but Session 9 fans may want to check it out just for a similar tone and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
