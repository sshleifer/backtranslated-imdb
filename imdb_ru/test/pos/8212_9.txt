When this film first came out in 1995, I found it strikingly wonderful. Especially with Sandra Bullock. After watching her brilliant performance in Speed, I was ready to watch any of her films. <br /> <br /> Back to the Net, it was a movie that keeps you on your toes. I enjoyed it, so I give it a ******.
