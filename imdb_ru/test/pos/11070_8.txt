I thought that Nick Gomezâ€™s view of the sandy streets of New Jersey, where the jacks are at the highest level, was both thought-provoking and interesting. It's as good as movies like Boyz n the Hood or Menace II Society or Above the Rim. I thought the actors and the scripts were suitable, it had a realistic feeling and was very atmospheric, on purpose or by coincidence. I really liked this movie, an undervalued gem that I found on TV, and I am glad I caught it. Go see this movie if you get a chance. If they don't have a DVD, they should release it. Well done Nick Gomez. IMDb rating: 5.9. My rating: 9/10
