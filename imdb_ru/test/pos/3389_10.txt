I agree with the messages here that the book does not look like a movie. I read the book as a sophomore in high school in Sumter SC. I immediately fell in love with the book and looked forward to the release of the mini-series. As much as I liked the film, and I thought that it was very well done, I was disappointed that the film did not follow the book. I was glad that Orry was not killed, as he was in “Love and War” or “N & S II.” <br /> <br /> Having grown up in the SC and graduated from the University of the SC, I fell in love with the history of the south because of this mini series and book. I had the honor of meeting John Jakes at the 1988 USC symposium. I stayed after this and met with Mr. Jakes. Unfortunately, I could not ask him a question. But to meet him was enough honor. I majored in accounting, but received a degree in southern studies. In addition, I created a lot of my manners after Orri Maine. Orry and I are very similar. I feel I was born 150 years later. I am a southern gentleman and very proud of it. <br /> <br /> Well, I fell in love with two women in the film .... Gene Francis and Wendy Kilborn. Dude, I had hot dogs for Wendy !!!! I could never find its real version. I hope that one day too !!!
