Firstly, this film is a part of reality, very well implemented in artistic terms. Some kind of combination between American Beauty and As Good as It Is. And, of course, something specific for all Russian films (of course, valuable, no dirty propaganda!): The problem of human loneliness ... Especially recommended for people who really want to see beyond any gagging propaganda about communism (both positive or negative propaganda !) A film about ordinary people, their problems, lack of satisfaction - especially for the young, fear when they touch the real and too dirty face of society ... and about fake "solutions": alcohol and violence ... and probably the only real solution: true love ... Of course, it is very well "located" in the space and time of "Russian perestroika", but this is true for all of society (except the ideal, but do not worry - it is impossible to find) this is on our Earth!). Last time - definitely recommended ...
