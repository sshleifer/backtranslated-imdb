A fiery masterpiece of madness and despair of war, “Fires on the Plain” (Nobi) will not please everyone: this is a war film in the most direct sense of the word, which does not resort to waving flags. patriotism, not sugary sentimentality. Nobi penetrates deeply, ugly, darkly and gloomily, like fewer celluloids have ever been perfect. This is a war for guns, without triumphs and heroes, without moral victories and defeats, just a handful of haggard and terrible looking people scattered on the ground, ravaged by war, as repentant, fleeing from a great catastrophe. Characters challenge moral judgment because they are creatures embraced by great grief, grief that does not resolve moral issues. War and survival. Confronting the expression of will against another in the arena of battle. The loser simply disappears from its existence. <br /> <br /> Tamura, a soldier of the Japanese imperial army, is discharged from his platoon and receives an order to report to a nearby hospital because he coughs blood and does not like the others. platoon. He was told to never return and instead commit suicide with a hand grenade in case the hospital rejects him. Which does it. The hospital is nothing but a wooden plank shack, and the hospital surgeon simply tells him that if he is able to walk, then he is fine. It is in this pathetic excuse of the hospital that one of the most heart-rending scenes of the film takes place. As this area is being bombarded by American planes, doctors and those who can walk and support themselves are fleeing from the hospital into the forest. A few moments before the hospital shattered into pieces, exhausted and crippled figures of sick and wounded crawled out of it in any position, dressed in their sickly white clothes, as if the building was a kind of beast, spewing entrails and dirt on the ground. <br /> <br /> This is Nobi's biggest success; a dark and thoughtful description of the sufferings of war in simple but evocative images, without melodrama or pseudoheroism. Soldiers cross the swamp, knee-deep in mud, move across the opposite shore and into the field only to detect enemy tanks hiding in the woods, their lights shine like malignant eyes when they scan darkness. The procession of wounded soldiers, dirty and half-crazed, crossing the road, falling to the ground under the noise of enemy aircraft. Buzzards feast on a heap of corpses. Abandoned village. A mad soldier who considers himself a Buddha sitting under a tree covered with flies and his own excrement, offering his hand to be eaten by Tamura when he dies. These are images that Kon Ichikawa evokes before our eyes, merciless and unshakable in their acuteness, but honest and rude. <br /> <br /> Nobi is in no hurry to get somewhere. He is pleased that he is following Tamura’s travels on war-torn land when he is trying to reach Palampa’s regrouping center, and to observe the insanity and obscenity of war. The film penetrates the barrage of war horror, slowly and thoughtfully, just like the characters he follows. The last thirty minutes, during which Tamura takes refuge with two deserters who eat "monkey meat", are the closest to Nobi’s attitude to ordinary narratives, and they are no less influential in this regard. Brightly photographed in black and white, with great performances from the actors and Itikawa’s confident guidance, Nobi is not only among the best war films to be made, but also among the best in Japanese cinema.
