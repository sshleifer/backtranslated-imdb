The first thing you see in this film is a static angle (which will be repeated later in the film), depicting the chaos occurring (invisible to the audience) in the studio that broadcasts the news. Soon after, the typical story of the Foundation character is shown in the same perspective. Do not let this mislead you; The film is not about a woman reporter, a woman who is fighting for success in the male profession. This is just an introduction, a way to start a movie (although it will be used later). The actual point of view on this production is revealed gradually, and the first thing we see about it is a deliberately long scene at the very beginning. The whole movie has such a pace; not slow or lingering, but deliberate. This is never really fast, even in the few sequences that one would normally expect. This stimulation (especially because it seems to slow down as the plot unfolds when the disturbing, disturbing nature of the film is revealed) is strong, almost painful for the viewer. It inspires you, if it were possible, to jump into the screen, grab the people responsible for the collar, and shout at them to “do” something with it to correct the situation. I never wanted to get up or even take my eyes off the screen for a moment. The subject is extremely important to understand, and here it is beautifully processed. No excessive dramatization (well ... very little, anyway), just an accurate representation of the problem. The direction is astounding. The feeling of sympathy for the character of Lemmon is deep. Editing is masterful ... one scene at the very end illustrates this perfectly. The editor, judging by his filmography, is greatly underestimated. The letter was excellent. The game was great, in particular Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas (who also produced it). The lack of appreciation is perfect; music is not needed for improvement. The ending is sublime and effective. The film has several negative points ... among them, some dialogues, obviously, and undoubtedly mostly exposition, one particular part of the film, while the dramatic ones do not seem to interlock with something that follows it. Not everyone will watch a movie because of its two features, which are usually (and rightly so) attributed to bad films; tempo (which can be taken as slow) and (lack of) accounts. It can be argued that this is a negative thing, since everyone should take into account the moments that he represents, but perhaps this will be better; handle a heavy object wisely and respectfully (both to the subject and the viewer) ... something like this, maybe it should not be fed with a spoon. I was hypnotized by this film and was very surprised. I recommend this to anyone who considers himself strong enough to handle it. 9/10
