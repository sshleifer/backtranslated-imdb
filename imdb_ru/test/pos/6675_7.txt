Prot (Kevin Spacey) is a psychiatric patient who claims to be native to a distant planet called K-PAX. His psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) is trying to help him, all the while trying to understand Prot and find out if he really is from K-PAX. <br /> <br /> This film really does not fall into any particular genre. One big part of K-PAX is drama / science fiction, another part of fantasy, plus, add to this a bit of comedy, and you will begin to understand what K-PAX is. The story (as you see above) is not too complicated or deep, but it still offers some good plot twists that may still surprise you, as they did me. No special effects or graphics accompany this film, and they are not needed, the music in the film is great. The techno soundtrack, along with an amazing piano piece, makes the sound of K-PAX sci-fi and makes some scenes intriguing. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is the heart of the film and plays a very convincing newcomer (Prot) Planet K-PAX, emotional with a beautiful facial expression, Spacey copes well with the role of leader. Jeff Bridges - Dr. Powell, who helps and tries to understand Prot. Bridges are also great on his part. Bridges and Spacey fit together very well, and they must, after all, have a lot of experience. Dr. Powell's wife is Rachel Powell, played by Mary McCormack. McCormack plays his part well, showing the disappointment that her husband is gone and so devoted to his patient. Alpha Woodard plays Dr. Powell’s colleague Claudia Villars, we don’t actually see Claudia too much, but overall she is showing excellent results. <br /> <br /> K-PAX has a PG-13 rating for “sequence of violent images, and short language and sensuality,” and this covers it. As for the "violent images", we do not see too much. A few people who have a lot of blood, but that's all. The language looks like this: 1 word “f” (wow, only one!), 11 words “s” and a few cases of using the name of the Lord in vain. Not so bad really. Part of the "sensuality" arose just when Prot explains to Dr. Powell how reproduction works on K-PAX, nothing terrible, just something in it reminds "to have your nuts in a vice." Not bad in terms of content for a PG-13 movie, it could have been worse. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, K-PAX is a good movie. It will not overwhelm you, but it is pleasant and pleasant to watch. He has some funny parts, sad parts, really sad parts, and, well, you know what I mean. This is a patient story in a mental hospital, what do you expect? In general, a good rental for those of you who are looking for a good drama in which you can relax and unwind, K-PAX is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Bonus! If you’ve already watched this movie, wanted it and wanted to get a DVD, I highly recommend it. It has many add-ons to watch, and even an alternate ending and deleted scenes. 8/10
