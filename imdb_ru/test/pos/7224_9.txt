Trémo and Juliet are probably the best Shakespeare upgrades I've ever seen, not that there were many competitors, but in any case ... <br /> <br /> In general, Trômo and Juliet are definitely one of the best films of Tromy, one of the little pearls hidden in a huge pile of manure. This is a fun, exciting, bloody story about the greatest love story in the world, but it still manages to follow the original story as faithfully as possible, except for this kind of film. Well, except for the finale, where Thromeo and Juliet kill the abusive father of Juliet and happily live together in a sunny suburban area for the rest of their lives with their horribly mutated children. <br /> <br /> THIS - a film of high school literature should be shown instead of forcing poor students to read hundreds and hundreds of pages of Shakespeare’s scripts. Thumbs up!
