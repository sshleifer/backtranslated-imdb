I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew that it was about a former Vietnam prisoner of war in Laos who ran away, but I didnâ€™t know anything else. In fact, I did not expect too much. Oh, what a surprise! The life story of this person is in itself very interesting, but what distinguishes this film from other documents of a biographical type is that Dieter himself tells most of the story himself. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life in Germany during the Second World War and difficulties. We are with him in the same small town as he describes his family, inspiration and struggle. We follow him to America and his path to the realization of his dream of becoming a pilot. Then Dieter describes his story of capture, escape and survival in the Lao jungle. We are again in the jungle, when he describes and re-describes his conclusion and the path to freedom with great detail. We see the same primitive huts, villagers and forms of detention with which he dealt, which have not really changed in 30 years. We see dense jungles, highlands and rivers that Dieter encountered during the escape. This helps us understand his emotions, pain and distress. I enjoyed the man, the story and the style. Well done work!
