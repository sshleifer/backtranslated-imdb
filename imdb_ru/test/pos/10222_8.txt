For a film like this, there is always something to follow in the coming years. Clive Barker, the man who brought The Risen from Hell, shoots a horror film, in which there is partly "goth", "partly mythology" and all the horror between them. "Night Breed" is a group of mutants who go out only at night and roam around places called Midian. Now a man named Boone (Craig Schaeffer) claims to suffer from hallucinations, he goes to this thin doctor Decker (David Croneberg), who “helps” Boone with his problems. Not knowing about this situation, Decker states that he is a purist disguised only as a hater. Boone, however, goes to Midian and claims that he is one of the mutants there. But a mutant named Pelokin (Oliver Parker) considers Buna meat! His bite, however, relieves Boone, so after he was killed by a glove from a firearm, he is now one of them. Being deceived by Decker, Boone does his best to protect Laurie (Ann Bobby) from him. Laurie saves the mutant from the sun, and in return helps others. I liked the mutant lady who gives a smoky “kiss of death”, and the Porcupine woman who dreamed of Buna demonstrates her power, which is so seductive and deadly at the same time. I enjoyed this horror movie all the time, and the rule of it, never trust a psychiatrist! Rating 3.5 out of 5 stars!
