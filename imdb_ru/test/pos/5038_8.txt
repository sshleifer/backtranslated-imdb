I really liked this film for what it is: a funny little film that does not take itself too seriously. Summary plots are available everywhere, so I will not go into details. In any case, Michael is not about a complex plot. It is simply built on a magnificent background and takes the viewer on a wonderful journey. <br /> <br /> John Travolta as an avid, loving lady quarreling in the bar, the angel-cake is just perfect. And who doesn't love Sparky? <br /> <br /> Watch this if you want to laugh a little and have a good time. Highly recommended.
