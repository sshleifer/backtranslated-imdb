The Brotherhood of Satan is one of the most underrated horror films of all time. Why he did not reach cult status is for me. Chronicle screen horror. In a small American town, some children disappeared, and their parents were brutally murdered. What is the cause of hysteria? The film is really creepy, some scenes are really unnerving and are definitely not easily forgotten. up, the game is really good, and the climax is strange and disturbing. Check out this forgotten gem of satanic horror. Absolutely recommended.
