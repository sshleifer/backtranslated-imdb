It was Saturday before Halloween this year (today, at the time of this writing), and it should be the best anthology of horror. I'm not usually a horror movie fan - mainly because of the amount of crap that was recently released. However, the director of Campfire Tales has the gift of waiting for Hitchcock-Esquire - unlike other modern films, he does not use every opportunity to scare you silly, instead he uses foresight and “almost blunders” - incidents that seem to be the moment when will come at the same moment, but it turns out, will not. <br /> <br /> I didn't catch the “Hook” or the first main segment, but from what I read here, there were two that you could afford to miss. <br /> <br /> “People can lick too” was full of anticipation - this short one keeps you on the edge of your place, expecting something to happen to a little girl while she wanders around the yard and house looking for her soccer ball, and then her dog. She faces such a large number of blunders that the expectation reaches heartbreaking proportions before the culmination of a short circuit, when the girl gives in and goes to bed, thinking that her dog is under her. She stretches out her hand to let him lick her, and she feels the touch of her tongue on her hand ... before noticing that it is written on her blood-painted mirror: "People can also lick." I'll leave the last few seconds for you to know, my reader, because at this point a short circuit could take any number of moves. <br /> <br /> “Medallion”, nevertheless, was an undeniable masterpiece. this movie. It all starts with the fact that a man on a motorcycle just goes ... to what he does not know, but he feels that he is coming. While he was driving, a storm broke out, and he was forced to take refuge in the house of a dumb girl. They quickly became friends with each other, but before they could do anything other than a kiss, the girl wrote that the ghosts inhabit her house. They quickly begin to pack up to leave, but they find themselves in the center of a scene reenactment a few decades ago — the father, returning home to his daughter, and her boyfriend prepares to escape, kills them both and then commits suicide. I will have to leave you to open here and finish - I could not hope to justify the story in any way, and what I have said so far is only a brief summary of the story - I could not Hope to convey the nuances and sensory details that complement him. <br /> <br /> “Campfire”, which is a link between all the stories, is a rather interesting rephrasing of the topic of a car accident and girls. very attractive - in fact, most of the girls in this movie are cute. In any case, despite the fact that it has split, the story got justice, and the ending is hard to predict if you are busy with other stories. However, if you pay enough attention to the “Campfire” segments scattered throughout the movie, you can certainly predict the ending, especially if you have seen movies based on the same premise. (MST3k fans, remember Soultaker? Same premise, but without Vivian Schilling’s terrible composition and mainstream film. If you saw the first 30 minutes of this, you should be able to predict the final.) All in all, the best horror movie I've seen for a long time, and the only anthology of horror, worthy of purchase.
