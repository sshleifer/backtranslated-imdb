Over the past century there have been many achievements in the field of gender equality, but not so much in the world of cinema. I'm not talking about what happens behind the camera, I mean the tastes of the audience. The idea of ​​throwing a tiptoe is alive and well today, while there are still a lot of action movies and horror films that men like most. Of course, there are men and women who enjoy movies that go beyond their typical demographics, but not so many films that they would like. Hitch, Will Smith's latest car, which is trying to change this trend, being a fan that adds a dose of male perspective. <br /> <br /> The stars of Smith in Hitch play the main role, Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, "Date with the Doctor", which teaches men how to approach a woman and successfully conduct a date. Hitch enjoys his work and loves to see how men successfully achieve their goals of meeting with the woman of their dreams, but due to bad college experience, Hitch himself is somewhat tainted with the idea of ​​love. As the story unfolds, the film introduces two seemingly separate storylines. The last thing Hitch is Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), an accountant who is very attracted to one of his clients, the beautiful heiress Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). Hitch doubts the chances of Albert, but if the wishes of his clients seem sincere, Hitch supports them. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Hitch meets gossip columnist Sarah Melas (Eva Mendez) and immediately attracts this strong woman. However, a doctor on a date cannot follow his own advice in pursuing Sarah. Things get even harder when Sarah’s job forces her to explore the relationship between the accountant and the heiress. Can Hitch balance his personal life and his work? And more importantly, can Hitch believe in love again? If you are a real fan of cinema, then you have been at least once in your life when you complained about the redundancy of a Hollywood film factory and demanded something new and original. Well, Hitch is not that movie. But most movie fans also recognize that sometimes formal films can work exclusively at the entertainment level. Hitch really qualifies as this movie.
