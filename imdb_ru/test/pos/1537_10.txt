This film gave me recurring nightmares with the voice of Alan Rickman, representing the all-powerful, treacherous fascist ruler. The worst movie I've ever seen is psychological terror, stronger than any horror movie ever. The voice of Alan Rickman will always represent for me the power and terror of a totalitarian state, reminiscent of 1984, of Orwell. This film tells those who are not indifferent to the reality of a significant part of the current world governments. This film is disturbing, but so that everyone should watch it is a description of a reality that no one should ever experience, but do so much.
