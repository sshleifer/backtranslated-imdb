One of his lesser-known films, many horror fans, has yet to catch this sentence by Dario Argento, which is regrettable. This is underestimated mainly due to the fact that very few people have seen it. The film boasts Class A Argento Gore with its usual close-ups set for wild scores. Although it is true that this scenario is not very complex, it is not as bad as the other entries in its genre, or its own resume in this regard. <br /> <br /> This film symbolizes more “horror” that he likes to portray in his films by his own admission. Worth seeing any night.
