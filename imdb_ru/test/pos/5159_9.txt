This movie should not be funny, but it made me laugh. <br /> <br /> It’s not meant to be sad, but my heart felt heavy with a lot of vignettes. <br /> It is not written as an action adventure, but my pulse has been quickened more than once. <br /> <br /> Like life, this film does not manipulate your emotions or tell you how to feel. It’s just that, and you react. <br /> <br /> If you don’t find it funny, sad, or touching, I suspect it says more about you than about the film. <br /> <br /> It is amazing and good to see that the director celebrates so sincerely that we are all human, and we accept that we are all trapped here, doing this “vital”, again and again as much as we need. <br /> <br /> Tomorrow is another day
