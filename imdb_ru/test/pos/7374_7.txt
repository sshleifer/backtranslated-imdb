Definitely not only for lovers of urban legends, Campfire Tales is often a scary and always fun ride on several popular stories. It is also a film that exceeded the (low) expectations that I had. A horror film, which I have never heard of or read, a direct video release (yes, the latter often presents us with a pleasant surprise, but with horror films in our time it can be all or nothing), the cast, mostly unknown. ... well, I'll leave you the math. <br /> <br /> The film is an interesting, intense and generally very enjoyable experience. Four stories develop well and satisfy. The only one I felt was a bit weaker, was the “Medallion”, for the simple reason that it offers almost no explanation of the plot or actions of the characters; However, I still loved the story, its atmosphere and its ending. My favorite was the third story, “People can lick too” - the tension in it is not only palpable, but also informative. <br /> <br /> I discovered that The Tales of the Bonfire is one of those jewels of horror that chance reveals, and then continues to recommend it to everyone. <br /> <br /> 7/10
