This is one of the best sequels and a very good movie, even with some mistakes, but I still enjoyed it. This time, Charles is fighting not with one or two robbers, but with a whole army. There are many great action movies in Death Wish 3, and I enjoyed them every second. Director Michael Winner knows how to shoot a good fighter like this, and Jimmy Page, who provides music, with producers Golan and Globus who are still doing it, and Charles Bronson still plays well for Paul Cursey. This film also looked like Michael was trying to finish the Death Wish series, and I can't blame him, and I like the gun that Charles uses. Death Wish 3 is one of the best films of 1985, and it could not be better than this one. <br /> <br /> I give it 9/10
