This is not a movie, but an experience! <br /> <br /> Not an ordinary eye candy, as I thought. Too many things happen at once, your feelings almost could not handle it. A product of advanced technology (we were torn between sitting back to enjoy the show, and putting our 3D glasses on and off to decipher magic), the music is great (this is a concert!) their world), it's funny, it's magical, it's exciting — I know it starts to sound like an advertisement — but it's really so great! Surpasses Christmas in losing a baby! <br /> <br /> This attraction alone is worth a visit to Disney. ;)
