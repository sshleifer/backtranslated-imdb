Another movie must have. Henry Brandon is a favorite! I was so surprised when I learned many years ago that he is from Germany, because he sounds and looks so typical American! And wasn't he great in the Quest as a scar? !! Another one of my favorites, I have and watch it again and again. Now, if I could add it to my collection, it would make my day! This is a great wildlife story and film for all ages. The landscape is so beautiful and the situation of endangered snow leopards is spoken with such great emotion that it will arouse interest in endangered species in all, especially children. If I could, I would give a copy to all my great ones!
