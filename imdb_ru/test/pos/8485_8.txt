Let's not fight about the bush here, undoubtedly, Taylor Hackford’s cunning film makes little of it from the biographical genre, besides Jamie Fox’s exceptional career performance. Remember the year when they handed over the special effects of the Oscars to the tombs of Terminator 2, without disputing? They should do the same with the best acting gong of this year. <br /> <br /> The story of Ray Charles, worthy of filming, is not disputed. Indeed, many memories of his traumatic childhood are well used and intelligently used. But for such a unique life, the film seems incredibly formal and familiar. The letter pattern “history of vicious genius” follows almost to the letter: difficulties and exploitation, women and drugs, records of disputes, quarrels in groups, rehabilitation, yes, yes, yes. And, of course, there was more humor in his life than we were treated? <br /> <br /> I appreciate the music of Charles, although the tidy potpourri would continue this story, Hackford indulges in the almost complete performance of too many songs - in denim joints, in a recording studio, in concert halls, infinitum. Narratively, and for nondevotees, they begin to act as a cinematic brake. This may seem like a harsh judgment on a musical biopic, but with such an extensive catalog as Ray has, we need taste, not the whole dish. Otherwise we would buy albums. <br /> <br /> Intrigued as I am, I repeatedly looked at my watch. So with all the glamor of Fox, maybe Ray would better serve as a two-member HBO?
