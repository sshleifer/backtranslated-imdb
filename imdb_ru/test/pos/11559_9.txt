I would like to know if anyone knows how I can get a copy of the film "This is the Way of the World." It has been about 30 years since I saw this film, and I would like to see it again. Earthly Wind and Fire surpass the nation all over the world with their inspirational music and themes. Unfortunately, this group did not take off, as their colleagues did in the early 1970s, but, as mentioned earlier, racial tension existed in the United States, which prohibited equal impact on African-American musical groups. Nice to see Earth Wind & Fire continue their success. I would like to add this movie to my collection. Someone please help me if possible. Thank you for your attention. Milton show
