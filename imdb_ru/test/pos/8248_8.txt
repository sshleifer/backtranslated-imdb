David, “Debut Master,” Niven plays the Big Boss (IVAN), who hunts poor unfortunate Richard Jordan (PINKI), forcing the unfortunate former fraudster to use his poorly found new position in the bank. Elke Sommer (Miss PELHAM) most effectively ensures the interests of women whom Pinky cannot simply confront. <br /> <br /> It seems they could not choose one title for this film, so instead they used four .... does it make sense ??? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this turns out to be one of the last roles of Niven. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is fun and worth watching if you can catch it. his rare or late night television shows. <br /> <br />
