The above profile was written by me when I used the nickname OldWereWolf56, which is still my email address. I still believe that Andy Devine's Frisky character is the best episode of the Twilight Zone, and I watch this episode at least once a year, because I think Frisbee is lucky because he has many friends who love him very much. <br /> <br /> In case many of you are too young to remember, I am 61 years old and in the 50s Andy Devine organized an entertainment show for children called “Andy Gang”. He had three assistants on it: a cat named Midnight, who played the violin, a mouse named Skviki, who played the hand organ, and a devilish toad named Froggy, who could appear and disappear at will, embarrassing Andrew such as billy gilbert.
