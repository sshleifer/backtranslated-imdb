After the very disappointing part 3, I somehow thought whether I should worry about The Next Karate Kid at all, although I could understand why this saga would not continue, I still liked the Next The Karate Kid of second and third "Kid Karate" movies. Although there are some very unrealistic moments and situations, it was very pleasant, and the story is memorable and warm. <br /> <br /> Hilary Swank, has this girl gone far or how? She plays a rebel girl who lost her parents because of a car accident, and when Mäugi seems to be “looking after her,” he notices that she has karate skills. He offers her more lessons if she becomes more serious in life. Now, of course, there is a boy who loves her, and evil hooligans, who are very similar to their first child in karate, but I would recommend it. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> 7/10
