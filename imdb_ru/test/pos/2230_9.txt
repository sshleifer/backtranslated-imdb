I can't understand why this 1971 Hollywood production is currently available only through an Australian video company, but this is the sad ambiguity of this classic Peter Sellers (The Cinema Guide by Leonard Maltin continues to provide the same BOMB review that they gave in the 1970s ). With so many scenes stealers, Sellers is shown, which is probably his most fun role. It all starts with his discovery of a patient who died at 11:15, but Sellers asserts that the corpse still lives due to the fact that the new day does not begin until noon! The last straw for the besieged hospital commissioner comes to that very room, the “DO NOT DEMAND” sign is still on the door; as soon as he leaves the room (a handkerchief holds his nose), the doctor talks briefly with him - DOCTOR: “We cannot save them all! This man was at least 85! COMMISSION: “How old was he when he died, 63 years old? "Harold Gould plays an inept surgeon who closes his eyes when a knife is thrown, Richard Lenz (whose pompous reporter in" The Shootist "was loaded from behind by John Wayne) plays a patient who exposes a fraud (he came only for a chest X-ray until they found that he owns the house.) Also on the screen (and providing great music with a taste of country music) in the cast is Keith Ellison, former guitarist Paul Revere and the Raiders, who also worked with Michael Nesmith on several recordings of Monkeys (and He wrote “The Municipal Court of the Aunt” with Nesmit on “Birds, Bees and Monkeys” of 1968.) Alas, there are some missing shots from this print, including topless with Ushi Digard at the end, as well as a scene with actress Kathleen Freeman (who wants to use green marks o to finance their activities), which Sellers locked up in his office, and will never see her again (in uncut form, he returns to his office and finds that she wrote in large letters on the wall "WRONG PRIKA"); his answer? "You were mistaken by the price!").
