This film is beautiful in many ways: the plot, the depth of the characters, the amazing photo and acting, the colossal battle scenes (there are no computer graphics, just thousands of people). Someone said that this story is somehow connected with the tragedies of Shakespeare. I also find some links with the Greek tradition of tragedy. <br /> <br /> The unusually active emperor struggles between power and love, but he is forced (for the good, for the will of his ancestors) to choose strength (and loneliness, the hatred of his subjects and relatives) as his destiny. He, like Creon in Antigone, was a good guy before he became emperor. Having obtained power, he must be merciless and cruel (with innocent children, his mother, father, etc.), in order to protect and expand the empire. Captured by force, he becomes a monster. In general, Emperor Qin is a magnificent figure of the Greek tragedy. <br /> <br /> An assassin develops in a different direction: from pure evil to heroism and morality. Even this character is forced to his fate with love and his new ethics. This character is also really memorable. <br /> <br /> Lady Zhao, the wonderful Gong Li, is an unspoiled morality, neither by force, nor by love, nor by hatred. She is a moral against power, like Antigone. Her conspiracies (for and against the emperor) always have a moral rationale. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, a great movie. If you like movies and want to try Chinese movies, you can start here.
