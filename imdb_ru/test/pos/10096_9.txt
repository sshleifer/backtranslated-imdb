If there is such a thing as beautiful horror, this film is one of the best in this genre. This is a horror film, which, in spite of the fact that it is not devoid of bloody scenes, relies more on psychology and masterly increasing tension to create thrills. And this is one of those films shot so beautifully, where each scene represents a complete world of symbols and details, each of which serves a scale and a genre that can be called but beautiful. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s not just a story when the two sisters returned to the mansion of their father and stepmother after spending some time in a psychiatric institution. They barely cope with the death of their mother and try to protect their world by protecting them from the adult world. Thus, the film seems to be at the outermost level. In fact, the film is slowly developing into something completely different, at a slow pace, but not a single frame is lost to convey a sense of exciting beauty, so I will not say much more. Look, this is one of the best horror films in the Far East, recently conquered world cinema, and it really shows that they succeeded for good reasons.
