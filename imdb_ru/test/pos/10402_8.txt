The director of the documentary film investigates seemingly unrelated paranormal incidents related to the legend of an ancient demon called “kagutaba”. <br /> <br /> In appearance, the film looks like one of those camcorder films that have been popular among the past few months, even the one that will be released next week (PARANORMAL ACTIVITY)! However, unlike films such as CLOVERFIELD, REC and BLAIR WITCH, where most of these films are in total chaos and chaos with all this precariousness, this film is mainly shown in the traditional documentary style. He has television excerpts and interviews, and fears are very subtle, well, except for the last 20 minutes, when we enter into chaos and where the fear factor is extremely elevated. <br /> <br /> And it works. The film is very exciting and makes you wonder. Yes, you understood me correctly: it makes you think. You should pay attention to those unrelated details that are given throughout the entire film, and the return is great when, during the film, these things begin to intertwine with each other. The film is also very slow, which is good in this case. We, as spectators, absorb the details shown on the screen, no matter how subtle or glaring they may be. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a scary little movie. I'm a man who fears ghosts and paranormal phenomena more than murderers who kill teenage victims, so yes, the film gave me some nightmares. Here there are some images that are really alarming to watch, including another one, at the end of which you see “What am I looking at ?! There are about ten repetitive characters, each of which gave authentic representations in their roles. <br /> <br /> The only thing I don’t like about the film is the ending, because most of the questions remain unanswered. The question "That's it?" went though my mind. It left an unpleasant taste in the mouth. However, the rest of the film is exciting and really scary. I do not see this one in the dark, because you regret this choice. Besides, I can see in a couple of years that Hollywood will remake this film. It will be interesting.
