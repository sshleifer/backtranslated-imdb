The successful description of Spock all-powerful Fox, in whose claws the command of the Enterprise falls. It was one of the sectors of the cosmos that our spacecraft was to avoid: first, Sulu and Kirk simply disappear from the bridge; the landing party follows them to the surface of an unknown planet and encounters Trelan, an outwardly aristocratic man dressed in clothes from Earth many centuries ago. But he demonstrates the ability of someone or something far beyond the limits of a person and is not recorded in McCoy's medical tricorder. The officers manage to escape back to the ship, but, like some bad cosmic penny, Trelane continues to jump out. He returns them all, including women's communication, to continue their games. The dilemma now takes on the elements of the “most dangerous game” in space, and in front of such unbridled force, an annoying and even infuriating aspect of the crew’s total helplessness arises. <br /> <br /> What really makes this episode great? The unforgettable performance of Campbell's guest star as an all-consuming, but not all-knowing alien. His character is obviously the early version of Q, which was introduced 20 years later in the TNG pilot series. The scene of Trelan's confrontation with Spock stands out among all the strange drama that unfolds. As usual, Kirk quickly begins to look for possible weaknesses in his new sworn enemy, despite the fact that he is completely different from him. Answers to the question of who Trelaine is, or who, is right in front of us all the time, so when we really know the truth, it makes perfect sense from the point of view of the perfect Campbell game. He constantly indulges himself, preening himself before some unknown audience, noticing contagious, but not quite correct things - at first we cannot determine this for sure, but here something is missing. Every few minutes his tone becomes ominous, and now the crew is in grave danger. In a sense, you cannot take your eyes off him, always expecting what he will do next. Actor John de Lancy captured the same tone as Q in the Next Generation series.
