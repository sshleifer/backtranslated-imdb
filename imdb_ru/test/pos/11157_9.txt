Well, I know this is a clich√©. At first glance, this is a bad film, perhaps allied with Plan 9 from Space. The dialogue is suspicious (but Singlish is rather pleasant ...), the plot is not entirely plausible, Gavin's character is overly overzealous. While watching a movie, some things happen that really make you wonder ... Handsome and Kim, looking at the tank, Gwen eats a banana in the bathroom, almost everything Gavin says and does ("psssssssssssssssssysycho !!") possibly flawed. Taken together, however, they are just fads. Watch this movie with an open heart (especially if you are not familiar with the Singaporean culture) and with an open group of friends is guaranteed to deliver a lot of laughter and memorable time. You cannot enter this movie, expecting a masterpiece, or even expecting something serious at all. If you can take this film for what it is - a film about losers about losers, filled to the brim with its vagaries - you should watch this movie well! I have already seen it three times, and I would not hesitate to look at it three more times !!
