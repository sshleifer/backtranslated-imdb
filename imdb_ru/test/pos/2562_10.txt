At first I made a movie for hire because of the cover for the DVD. In fact, this is true of my friends, who did not shoot him because of the art and mental images that he evoked from a film that little interested me (or my friends). But I rented and looked at it, and was really amazed. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comments of another user that this film is not for everyone because of the blatant sexual findings, so I definitely don’t want to watch this small children (and seriously doubt if they will understand it anyway) . <br /> <br /> I like films like these, in which the characters' personalities and who they are are really defined unmistakably, directly, without teasing, to indicate that they turn out to be bad. Acting ... is it acting? Ricci and Jackson performed so well that I was drawn into this film, not even knowing that they were playing. The same with the story ... may seem contrived, but it was done very, very well. It reminded me of another movie with Mel Gibson, Tim, where each character had limitations, whether mental or indirect, so they were clearly defined. <br /> <br /> I found more depth in this movie with a character, so I feel that all participants (from cameramen to actors) deserve praise for the perfect fit / result. After watching this movie, I talked to a couple of friends who were negative about watching it, just like me, so when I heard my comments, they rented and watched it. They were also very surprised how good it was. It is a pity that the drawing on the jacket was made as it was, because it is turned off. Now I understand how art is applicable, but I have never heard of this film before, and art was my first impression ... art sells or destroys DVD sales / rental. <br /> <br /> These characters were given more attention and a good time was chosen to give an audience like me time to soak up the “feeling” of each of them. I felt I could trust the film, and it really is. So, if you do not take into account the jacket, I would recommend to watch this movie.
