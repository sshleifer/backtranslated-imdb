Although I can understand some of the points expressed in relation to cinematography (I thought that a more goal-oriented approach would better support the sense of home theater with a low sound level), I must say that it seemed to me that the script and the action “What is not found” were excellent. ! Dean Bell created a real jewel that Judith Ivy charms with a controlled character with delight. Her performance of Sandra is enjoyable - turns around, alternately, as devilish and romantic. We are immediately intrigued and repelled by her actions ... and never get more information than is necessary. Her efforts and support staff meet Bell's postmodern fairytale with her arms wide open. Alice Emily Grace is filled with blue-eyed magic. She seems to be molded in front of us like clay, turning into some beautiful, lost beast. By the end, we are not at odds with the words as she is saying goodbye to her mother. Kudos should also be given to Jane Lincoln Taylor, whose Mother provides the right amount of tragic historical weight, and Justin Parkinson, whose shy newcomer John Sam provides one of the sweetest, if not the most awkward sex scenes in the film. Bell created a first-class story and gathered many talents to make it.
