I don't watch so many horror films, but one night I sat down and watched it with my cousins. Now we are teenagers, so we tend to laugh at many things, but, to be honest, the game here was really not very good, especially at the beginning. One of the notable traits was when Scarlett told Jill and Tiffany: “This is so ... high school!” While the next scene shows how Jill passes by the sign with her name in high school ... Many parts at the beginning reminded me of a banal , poorly written, poorly played episode with Lizzy McGuire. However, as the story progressed, when the cast moved almost to Jill, most of the time I was able to appreciate the film more. Camilla Belle played very well in this film, and I think that other actors and actresses spoiled her film. And I have to admit that it was one of the scariest films I've ever seen. Well, no, there were no big monsters and white faces that appear in dark corners and are obsessed with dolls, but the thing that made this film worse than those that contain these things is that it could really happen. And this film really reminded me that it’s really scary ... We all know that we’d hardly ever come across the living dead, but the idea of ​​having a killer inside the house in which you sit could really have happened. The only drawback of this film is that it is one of the most stamped films I've ever seen. It has everything that ever happened in any horror movie: turning the keys and the car starts, the shadows in the corner, turning in the corners of the stairs with uncertainty, unfolding and observing the dead body, the quick completion of the fatal scene with awakening from dreams and t On the tense scenes it was very predictable, but on the whole I would give 7/10. It is definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> By the way, this is my first review, so I don’t know if any of these things were spoilers ... But just to be safe ...
