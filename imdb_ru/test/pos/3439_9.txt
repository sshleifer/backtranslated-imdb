Jaded takes on the hard question of violence: the criminals and the victims. In smaller hands, it would degenerate into an erotic thriller created for live video. However, this director managed to conduct a textured multilayer study with a completely different point of view. <br /> <br /> Considering the fact that the director / writer is a woman, and the main detective and DA also women, it could turn into a very anti-masculine movie. Is not. Being a sexual predator is neutral in terms of sex. The nude nature of this film is not erotic. Rape is cruel, not sexual. We look at the victims, not at the jokes. <br /> <br /> Gifted cast rings ring true. For a film that is so little known, I was surprised at the quality of the performance. They are good. Carla Gugino and Raya Kihlstedt are incredible. <br /> <br /> For some reason this film was lost. Perhaps he is too smart for his own good. This is a "must see." Highly recommend. Sexual thriller thinking man.
