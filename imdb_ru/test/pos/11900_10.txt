This film was one that I had been waiting to see for some time. I was glad to discover that everything was expected. The writing of this film has been so carefully thought out and explored far beyond what viewers see. It seemed to me funny that so many people who are watching will not read between some very important lines, but in reality, if not, the film will have a different meaning and be very brilliant. The film has many stories and characters woven around this character of Kilo, a man who rose from the street amidst many troubles and became a very powerful criminal. After spending some time in prison, Kilo finds a loophole in the justice system and, through an alarming turn of events, is released only to find that everything is not at all what it seems. Kilo discovers that he goes against the highest kingdom of society and political royal power, in order to clarify how important and worthwhile the Word of Man is. The war begins when the street is armed with the rulers of wealth and a corrupt power. <br /> <br /> Expanding explosive and powerful non-stop turns. This movie will leave you chained. I found the cast of this film outstanding, and this is not a film that needs to be ignored. Fine. Ride today !!
