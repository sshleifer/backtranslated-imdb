I remember watching this film when it was released, and I still remember the “thrill” that I felt when I left the cinema. Everything in this movie is great! The music is top notch and I still play the soundtrack after all these years. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie so many times, but I still have the desire to watch it again and again. Nicolas Cage was great, and whenever I see Cameron Give in anything today, I always associate it with this film. It’s a pity that the rest of the cast didn’t do much more, but perhaps this is part of the charm of this film. <br /> <br /> I will not criticize the film school, as I am sure that all Analysts can complain if they want, but I will say that this film defined my teenage years and still continues to influence my life more than 20 years later . The film "feels great" and causes emotions when you watch it (well ... it was for me), and I cannot recommend it highly enough for those who have not seen it yet. <br /> <br /> You also “get” a movie or not! Those of you who “get it” will be rewarded with a unique cinema experience.
