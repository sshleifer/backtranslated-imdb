It should be recognized that the best work of Harold Lloyd ended with his last great mute comedy "Speedy" in 1928. After that, he enters sound films (such as Chaplin and Keaton and Laurel and Hardy and WC Fields) and does better than Keaton, but not as good as the other three. Chaplin was rich enough to make his own films as a producer (but he went through his films, so there was five years between filming). Laurel and Hardy were protected by Hal Roach, so the standards for producing their shorts and sound films were pretty good. First, Fields worked with Mac Sennett, and then with Paramount, and then worked in freelancing. Lloyd tried the route Chaplin took, but with less success. <br /> <br /> He produced his own films, but, unlike Chaplin, he didn’t have his own studio. Also his first two choices were not very good (especially “Legs first”). But he began to choose more wisely, and "Movie Crazy", "The Cat's-Paw" and "The Milky Way" were good options. These three (and, perhaps, Harold Diddlebock's Sin) were his best sound projects. All of them are interesting, but none of them has to do with “Last security”, “Freshman”, “Baby brother” or “Speedy”. <br /> <br /> Of the four best sound films, “Cat's Paw” is the most controversial. Ezekiel Cobb’s decision to rid the city of electing him as mayor is very extreme for the tastes of 2005. Or is it so? When the film is shot, it is dictated by what kind of politics: "Cat's paw" - since 1934. The second year of Roosevelt’s “New Deal” (rather controversial in itself due to more active government involvement), the audience watched films such as “Gabriel over the White House” and “Phantom President”, where our leaders took extra-constitutional actions to save the nation from internal enemies (and disarm the whole world). Even Cecil B. De Mille got into this act from “This Day and Age”, where a group of teenagers use rats to force the gangster to confess to his crimes. <br /> <br /> For us, the use of violence to force someone (even a handful of fools and fools, such as the gang of Alan Dinehart) to admit repulsive. In the end, the Supreme Court protected us from confessions under duress. We forget that the reforms we are thinking about did not occur until they were carried out by the Warren Court and the Burger Court. For example, although Mr. Justice Sutherland’s opinion of Powell’s case (Scottsboro Boys) in 1932 guaranteed the right of every defense lawyer to criminal law, Gideon v. Waynewright didn’t apply this to the court’s decision to pay the defendants until 1962. The Miranda affair, with its now well-known warning against self-incrimination, dates back to 1963. Nothing like this was considered necessary in 1934. <br /> <br /> If you study other films from the period before 1954 (and even before 1960), tricks are used to get confessions - Kirk Douglas confesses his crimes to witnesses in “I am coming alone”, while Bert Lancaster holds a gun to him. When Lancaster leaves, Douglas mocks confession under duress, only to see that the gun is discharged. Suddenly he realizes that (legally - in 1948) he confessed without coercion. I hate to say this to all civil libertarians who read this article, but what Cobb / Lloyd does with Deinhart and his friends in Cat's Paw imprisonment would not only be legal, but would lead to their imprisonment in 1934. You can call it tough, fascist or terrible, but it would work legally when it was invented.
