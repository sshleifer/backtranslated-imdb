Mountain forests, young happy tourists, a warning from the park ranger and a hiding figure. The ingredients are here for horror, and director / co-author Jeff Lieberman does an adequate job of achieving this. This is a formal forest horror, but for the most part the performance is on top of the game, and the story (which is quite simple in a stripped-down sense) is effectively told in a certain realism. Maybe a little more exposure would not have gone astray, but Lieberman's skill compensates for the flaws in the material and the typical details with growing tension, gloomy visual effects and the suffocating atmosphere created by Brad Fidelâ€™s very sinister protracted score. Whenever this very creepy whistle appeared, he created a truly unnerving feeling in harmony with the beautiful background. Cinematographers Dean M. and Joel King also do an amazing job. There are many styles, even with minimal features and slow grinding. From time to time, stimulation can be a matter of stopping. This is not particularly cruel, but there is still an obvious meanness, even if something happens from the screen. The last scenes of the chase and the escalation of fear are well done, as the darkness comes alive with its huge killers, and you get the actor George Kennedy, who rides a white horse in a small but miraculous turn. There is a cute group of presentations; Deborah Benson becomes a strong, dashing heroine. Gregg Henry, Chris Lemmon, Ralph Seymour, Jamie Rose, Mike Kellin, and Katie Powell complete a modest series of believable shipments. The final climax is rather distorted, but the ending is one of those types that make you think ?? "This is it?" <br /> <br /> A well-engraved solid wood object, which probably makes it too safe to be distinguished from the norm.
