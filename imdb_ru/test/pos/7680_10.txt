When I was a kid, my grandmother took me to see this movie. And I fell in love with it. I really admired Dorothy Dandridge and wanted to be like her. I fell in love with Sidney Poitier. Pearl Bailey made me laugh. And Sammy Davis Jr. was as great as Sportin Life. The music was just a sigh. When my first son came to me and the film appeared on TV, I let him see him, and to this day he never forgot this film. He loved it. I will always remember Porgy and Bess. It holds a special place in my heart then and now. I really want them to restore this film, because it was one of the greatest films that ever existed with the Black Cast star.
