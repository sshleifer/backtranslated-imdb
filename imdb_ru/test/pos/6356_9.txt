This film is a great example of what an independent film can be. The director copes with the distinction between emotional and physical abuse. But in the end he remembers what many indie films forget - he tells a good story. When I watched this movie, I was reminded how timid and mundane of the most high-budget Hollywood films really became. <br /> <br /> Especially noteworthy is the exceptionally strong performance of the main character of the film - Jorge Cordova. As a villainous thug (on the way to the top of the criminal heap), Cordova plays a cunning, cruel, vain, cunning and deceitful SOB, but he is so cute that always entertains you I read that these guys were part of the “New Wave of Latin American Cinematographers” in Los Angeles - “La Nueva Obra,” or something like that. In any case, this film makes you hope to see more of their work. <br /> <br />
