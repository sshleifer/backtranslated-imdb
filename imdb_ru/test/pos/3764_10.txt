Some have said that it was a flip of praise for the nose, but apart from Dr. Hyde’s original blend, no medicine was developed that could provide THIS effect. If Viagra was the stage of mucus formation, then this white sparkling powder is Stephen Hawking's evolutionary step (or at least a branch of the pharmacist's idiot). This reality show is actually about the sacred cows of medicine, seen as an emperor without clothes. Few of us want to question the health field; and because most of us would not have survived to our present age if we were born to “modern medicine”, and because our subconscious mind hopes that we will continue to live if we believe in helping professions. Thus, the geniuses who produced this film were joking from those Calcutta Bessies, giving us sugar that allows us to swallow a modern medical facility. The time was right, and many were able to see the business side of the healing companies behind the scenes of Oz. Ten years ago, when George S. Scott was walking through the film Hospital, my wife and I sat at the crowded premiere in Oklahoma City. As in the remake of Jekyll and Hyde, we almost could not resist falling from our seat, and continued to laugh and howl uncontrollably. Hundreds of other viewers were deadly silent. They were shocked that they scoffed at doctors, nurses and hospitals. Like dad, Billy Graham and Gandhi were sitting in the House of Animals, colorful beer shirts and all that, competing to see who can tell the most funny jokes of God between belching. If the Hospital were a comedy, not a satire, they could see what they were shown. Unfortunately, they were like Republicans at the Michael Moore 9/11 show. Smaller golden parachutes might have been given to corrupt medical corporation managers, it would have been harder for health insurance companies to refuse medical care, and medical workers would have been demystified earlier if George S. Scott danced in a tutu during labor. his terrible truths. But - forget everything that I just said. Watch the movie, become consciously happy, joyful, and full of laughter, like the best parody of Saturday Night Live, and let your subconscious dive into a documentary about reality. Just don’t blame me when “Got to hit” becomes one of your statements, or when “Hide doesn’t hide anything” occupies that part of your brain that is now paralyzed. “After all, this is a small world.” Or when you start calling the local hospital, “The Mother of God of Pain and Suffering,” instead of “Our Lady of Perpetual Construction.” Even Oklahomans changed their favorite horrible request with the winner in the form of a boss lever with “Talk to him and leave him to die” to “Body in a hole, you are in it ...”. The smell of death ... no more! Chicken Sushi! Mary. MARY. MARYEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
