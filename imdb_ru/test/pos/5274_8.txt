This is confusing, Absurdist Short. The miller, dressed in white, heads towards us from a windmill in a desolate landscape. Although the image is truncated, there is an obvious logic here. However, he was stopped by a sweep, all in black because of his work. They start beating each other for no particular reason - did the insulting miller insult the sooty sweep? Is this a class war? <br /> <br /> Anyway, he throws his opponent bags of grain that fly throughout the battle, making everything he did before the fight, making the windmill redundant, so that everything becomes as meaningless as a battle, Miller's Grain whitens the blackness of the stripping - later westerns will not be so thin, and the characters and villains will be color-coded. Is there a racial hue here? <br /> <br /> If it wasnâ€™t amazing, the militants are squeezed out of the screen by a crowd of people who have come from nowhere, and, accordingly, Kafkaianism ends in a strange story (or do they simply grow up against the struggle that negates order and purpose?) , and very unusual in times of early silent film. This mix of comedy, surrealism and the Absurd is an obvious harbinger for Buster Keaton, while the mill reminds us of one of Hitchcock's great thrillers, The Foreign Correspondent.
