Do not allow any reviews (critics, IMDb users or mine) to influence the viewing of this movie. I read only the plot background and was intrigued. After watching this film, in my opinion, definitely worth seeing. This gives an idea of ​​life, which many probably did not even think about. However, as Leland himself says, this is not a film that "can be wrapped up in a neat package with a bow and everything else." Other user reviews on this site claim to be of psychological origin and imply that history is impracticable. Obviously, they missed the whole point of the film, which is disappointing. to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a well-played, well-directed film. The story is not very pleasant, but I feel that if you don’t leave the film, you feel good, maybe you just missed something. In my opinion, to characterize it as an “art house” is unfair, but since our society likes labels, this is probably the one that fits. If you find that you know everything you need to know about the world ... I would suggest skipping this one. If you think that films should be a form of escape "from the world" ... you will not find them here. But if you look at it ... you can find something in yourself.
