What a great movie! I knew little about Buddy Holly, but I was familiar with his lively and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of a man who helped change music in the 1950s. Although I never cared for Gary Bessie, he was awesome, like Buddy Holly! I do not know how accurate the film is, but suppose that, at least for the most part, it is accurate, which makes the film even more interesting. Music throughout the film simply adds a riddle to this biography. I don't think I would change something in this movie, everything was fine! What is the difference in stars from the 50s to today's music stars. How can you compare someone like Buddy Holly with Justin Timberlake? or any of the other popular singers of this generation?
