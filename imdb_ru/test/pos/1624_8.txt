When I sat in the theater, almost crying out of fear because of the atrocities that Ron Howard and Tom Hanks call the Da Vinci Code, I could not see the light at the end of the “Angels and Demons” tunnel. <br /> <br /> Hanks and Company returned to the Sequel-Prequel Angels and Demons, and they learned the lesson. <br /> <br /> Act wisely - everything is much better. Aylet Zurer is very good, like Vittoria Vetra, and better than the girl who played Sophie Nevo. Tom Hanks, as always, is very good, he is better at this, because he works harder to make the film feel like a thriller. I think Evan McGregor does the best work of all the actors. He may even deserve an appointment in March, but it is doubtful. He convinced me to the very end. He is dynamic and loyal, but intelligent and understands that the Church must leave her past behind. Minor actors also do a very good job. Technically and visually the film is significantly improved. Cinematography is much ... much better, and the visual effects are excellent. The final explosion sequence at the end is excellent. Howard does an excellent job with your tour of Rome. <br /> <br /> This time, Ron Howard does an amazing job of promoting history, and does not bore us with a lesson in history, which is considered to be a condemnation of Christianity. The film also makes you feel more at stake. In our weak minds, who discovered if Jesus has children, is not so high on the list compared to the catastrophic explosion that kills thousands, including the Roman Catholic Church. One of the reasons why I think the story is developing so quickly is connected with a great score. I can not say enough about the bill. From time to time it was epic, like something from The Lord of the Rings, but sometimes it was like the movie Bourne, which is a good mix. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about this film is that it is ridiculously far implausible. The likelihood that Carmelengo will be someone from the age of Evan MacGregor is extremely unlikely, and the chances of the cardinal with his adopted son to be elected Pope are even more ridiculous. Not to mention all the antimatter that has yet to be created, and Dan Brown wrote the book in 2003 ... <br /> <br /> In general, “Angels and Demons” are much stronger, faster, more interesting and more important film, than the da vinci code. This is a must see thriller for all who love history and mystery combined.
