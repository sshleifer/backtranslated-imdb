Mom should be one of the most awkward movies to watch. There is an elderly woman in it who you would like to have as a nanny, who will become the most disgusting mother, the damn monster you will ever want to meet on a dark night! <br /> <br /> This nanny dinner is eaten from inside by a young lady at the opening of the film, and it only gets worse as it continues. It seems that when describing a mother, a cross between a howling and a dead brain comes to mind. <br /> <br /> Required for horror fans who have this desire (if you watched a resuscitator or a dead brain, it will release your boat) and are ready to turn off the brain for about an hour ... Let the blood flow! ... 8/10
