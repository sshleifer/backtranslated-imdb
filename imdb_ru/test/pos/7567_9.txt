First of all, despite the low rating on this site, I saw something quite worthy in this film and gladly defer it. And no, I have nothing to do with the team ... <br /> <br /> I accidentally stumbled upon The Wind DVD, and I had such a strong feeling that it would not be as described in the video packaging. So I took a chance and was pleasantly surprised by this strange, very different drama. I assume that DVD marketing and summaries were the work of MTI Home Video to hook a rental or sale (the “Love comes in many forms” tag has been changed to “Fear comes in many forms”). Of course, renting and selling smaller films depends heavily on attracting the attention of the person, especially if they have never heard of the movie before (a similar incident happened with the ITEM movie). This is probably what works against this release, as horror fans read the description of the “ancient wind” carrying with it the “omens of the apocalypse.” It’s easy to think that this is what this film is about, and it will turn some college students into a story of crazy savages who keep killing. Thus, at the time this review was submitted, it is likely to be the cause of the lower IMDb rating. I can understand how people get upset and think that they were fooled by this resume, seeing an apocalyptic introduction, but then having experienced a dark drama. I can forgive a marketing choice, as I enjoyed The Wind and thought it was a refreshing change in pace from the mainstream Hollywood offerings, just if attention was paid to the target audience, it could have given a higher rating. <br /> <br /> “Wind” in this film is, in fact, just a metaphor for society, and this is the story of four friends who make bad choices and how their lives quickly turn into desperate self-preservation. Having gone too far in “teaching a lesson” to one of his own, death occurs, and each person tries to maintain his position. Manipulation between them becomes the norm, and by the end we see how self-preservation becomes their main motivation over common sense. Civilized savage, mostly. This is very obvious when you notice that the use of a knife, branches as truncheons, fists and kicks are tools of violence instead of weapons. These characters, in a sense, do all the wrong things for the right reason, just to stay abreast of the situation, as they have already gone too far. Despite the fact that there are many alleged violent images, it is interesting to see that there are no expletives and nudity. <br /> <br /> “Unknown” actors work in favor of “Wind”. Originally, big stars were meant, but I think it works better when you have lesser-known, capable actors. Thus, you can make history without thinking, for example, “oh, this is Tom Cruise,” instead of actually tormenting a person who is dealing with an unusual situation. Even unusual conversations (for example, between Mick and Billy in the field, and Mick opposing Claire in her bedroom) keep well and feel quite natural in Fairview's strange universe ... which has cozy houses, a forest and wide open fields. I kept thinking about the calm landscapes that hide the darker secrets in Reflective Skin, which director Michael Mongillo mentions as inspiration in his commentary. <br /> <br /> The Wind manages to spread messages without demanding serious attention. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you look closely, you will see a multitude of symbols and dialogues that other directors just hit you on the head. I even understood the shameful "kissing scene" between Claire, John and Billy in the context of the story, without being surprised that this happened. I still wonder how some people (mostly guys) who complain about two men kissing on stage would obviously have NO problem if there were two girls kissing instead on stage. Everything is handled well here, and additional observations will make things clearer without making you moan and say, “Oh my God, how I missed IT ...” Things gradually sink, and I appreciate it. Or you can listen to the comment on the DVD to learn more about it! <br /> <br /> For those of us who “understood” the intentions of this film, “The wind is a breath of fresh air (not a pun)” at the time when most of the films are made to just earn money and be heard, knocking out other films from their “box office competition”, standing when mentioned in Entertainment Tonight or CNN. <br /> <br /> Years later, these are always small little discoveries, such as Wind, that remain in my memory, not processed star blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Take a marketing trick from MTI's Home Video, and you can really find this fascinating story. I highly recommend it to friends who are looking for unusual films like this.
