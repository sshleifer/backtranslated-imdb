I thought the movie started a little slow and disconnected during the first hour. However, over the past two hours, it has become more exciting, exciting and amazing. Thus, while it begins as a cheap horror film, it turns into a beautiful and beautiful fantastic film. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda stands out as the Snow Queen. This was her best performance, and, unfortunately, this was her last performance, as she had not performed in the last 7 years. She absolutely personifies the beauty and cold of winter. <br /> <br /> My daughter, 14, the film seemed a bit intimidating, so if you show it as family entertainment, stay with the child and reassure him or him that this is just a fabulous fantasy and you should not take it too seriously . <br /> <br /> This is really one of the best science fiction films that I have seen in a long time, a little better than Eragon. or any of the "Lord of the Rings". It is about as good as the Golden Compass.
