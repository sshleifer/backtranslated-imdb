I really liked the movie "Northfork". I did not know anything about the film before watching it. Therefore, I had no outside influence or information to guide me in what I saw, turning on the screen. Looking back, I would advise anyone who is interested in the film to watch it, if only for some other reason than the quality actors who participate in it. Do not read anything about the plot, storyline or evaluation of the film. In fact, STOP reading something else in my comments, although I believe that they are general in nature and would not spoil the film for you, I do not want to diminish the value of the film for you. Find your own meaningful path in this film, or its potential has diminished. <br /> <br /> In general, I discovered that 3 good strangers in Northfolk are puzzling. When the film unfolds, they can be qualified as three spectacular fugitives from a mental hospital or the dreams and hallucinations of a sick and feverish boy or three angels “sent” to find a “lost angel”. <br /> <br /> A sick and possibly dying boy is working to convince three “strangers” to abandon the search for a lost angel, become his guardian (mother and father) and lead him safely away from Northforka (at least 1000 miles) He even states that he is a lost angel who is trying to manipulate them all to become his guardian. Only one of the three responds positively to the boy. The other two do not have much enthusiasm or passion for this participation. <br /> <br /> A priest caring for a sick boy demonstrates a deep concern for people and a deep conviction in his faith. He transcends the devastation and emptiness of Northfork and his people; he is the light of good and hope for both Northfork and the viewer of the film. <br /> <br /> Toward the climax of the film, the boy and the new guardian travel overland to the field where the plane is waiting. They sit down to find two other strangers also on the plane; actually one pilot. The engines start and the plane takes off. <br /> <br /> Who are these 3 strangers? If only one stranger was interested in helping the boy, why were all three on the plane? Where is the plane going? Two others found "The Lost Angel"? Is there a lost angel and if so, who is it? Who are these six men dressed as undertakers? If all this is only the feverish dreams of a sick boy, then, as one of 3 strangers, he finally reached out to help one of the men dressed as an undertaker when he jumped and hit his head (neither the boy nor the strangers had a man’s contact with this) ? <br /> <br /> One or two sentences written under the heading telling people about what this film is about is a tragic mistake (this is not a spoiler, this statement is only about advertising). So, if you haven’t seen the film “Northfork”, the above questions show only a few interesting and funny forks on the way of thought when watching the film “Northfork”. If you read the plot summary before watching it earlier, you may need to look at some of the above questions and watch it again ... I know I will. Terry
