Read the biography of the late George S. Scott and you will understand why he is so talented. The interviewer asked him what his secret was, creating each character he played. Scott replied that he possessed in him the burning fire that led him. In one of his last interviewers, he sadly discovered that he had lost the drive. This was not the case when he starred in the film "Hospital". In this sentence, he plays the talented Dr. Boc, the medical director of one of the best hospitals in the country. However, life brought him some serious problems, such as losing his wife during a divorce, alienation from his promising children and, even worse, belief in himself physically impotent. At this point, he becomes complacent, sullen and often fantasizes about the various methods of suicide. In addition to the growing list of personal obstacles, the main reason for its existence, his hospital was under siege by students and neighborhood protestors, incompetent doctors such as Dr. Welbeck (Richard Dysart) and the mysterious medical doctor. who kills both patients and doctors, because he thinks he is the "Wrath of the Lamb." (Barnard Hughes). Bock left some options. One of them is budding Dr. Brubaker (Robert Walden), whom he trusts by saying: "If there was a furnace here, I would put my head in it." The second is a juicy young woman named Barbara, who is attracted to Bock, because he acts like a wounded bear. Paddy Chayefsky wrote the screenplay, and Arthur Hiller coped well with directing this dramatically interesting, grim story, but, nevertheless, a car lit by George S. Scott's fire. ****
