I was amazed at this early Clint Eastwood performance. I did not read the filmâ€™s summary when I decided to watch it on TV. Thanks to Mr. Eastwood, I expected a good shoot and no deep story. I was completely mistaken. I found several topics that were explicitly addressed, and until the end I could not decide who was good and who was bad. This film is definitely not the typical Eastwood, but definitely worth seeing.
