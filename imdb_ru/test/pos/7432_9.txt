I'm an avid fan of ff7, for example, I have a game, then I sell it (bad mistake), but then I buy it again (good mistake ... uh) <br /> <br /> yes, this film is very good, the fights are very cool, the music is very good, and CGI can't falter. <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappoints me in the film is the lack of participation of other characters, it was almost the whole cloud, which, although an excellent character, you cannot defeat Sid and Barret. <br /> <br /> but despite this, the film was great, in my opinion, and you need to watch it. <br /> <br /> In general, an excellent film gives and will give 9/10 squaresoft, make more such films, and you will be worshiped more than you already are !!!!
