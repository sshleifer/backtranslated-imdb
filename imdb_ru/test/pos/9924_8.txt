Dario Argento is a director, whom I gradually enter, following the iconoclastic efforts of Deep Red and Suspiria; he is not a director, to always take care of such stupid things as "conspiracy." This may be his only insignificant (but obvious to me) duty: he will not allow trifles like common sense to spoil his plan of his elaborate killing sequences, since his killer (s) can undergo any complex process. setting the invisibility until it is revealed that the POV tracks the killing of the psychopath. But it’s very exciting to see how the cinematographer risks this way, since pure Italian aesthetics breaks into the soul of the Hitchcock warp (actually, as a note of interest, if someone recently saw Scorsese’s short film where he shot) Hitchcock’s three-page film which also took place in the Opera, Argento beat him for almost twenty years, probably not knowing the text). It is also shamelessly 80s (CD players and heavy metal and hair, oh my!) And with the absurd, which makes it all the more acceptable to swallow. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: Macbeth's opera is produced using high-tech pyrotechnics and trained ravens. At the last minute, even the talented rising star Betty, played by Marsillah, replaced. But the murder takes place during the premiere, interrupted not by this, but by a falling light, and now the murderer is following Betty! She can't go to the police (how can she say that the opera is really cursed?), But will it be important in the face of a killer who doesn't give up? Probably, someone has seen similar premises in other Argento films - the killer is after the girl, but Argento, like De Palma, constructs and executes his episodes, and also adds his own special taste to add touches of strange humor. (a breakthrough of the ravens to attack the killer, and a subsequent version pointing in line), a kind of excessive styling of ala Leone (a bullet through the peephole through the door probably inspired a similar shot at Killing Bill 1) attached to Betty's eyes more than once! <br /> <br /> Argento passes his actress through the woodcutter, and she will start playing all over it, even when it seems that everything just goes into the territory of what the hell (I threw up my hands, almost saying that I give it when the secret the passage over the little girl, as if we are now in Aliens). And thanks to this dark genre material, Argento retains the rigidity and freshness of violence, about the same as with opera music coming directly from the stereo speaker, and the cinematographer, who may have drunk a few drinks (and rightly so!) During some scenes like they shoot and vibrate to the heartbeat. This should be seen as rubbish, but it exceeded all limitations of the genre due to the director’s bold attitude, despite the stupid ending - the silliest thing that preceded what came before him (thanks to the little lizard) - and try to break the Macbeth curse, something to Unfortunately, in real life was not on the set of Opera. 8.5 / 10
