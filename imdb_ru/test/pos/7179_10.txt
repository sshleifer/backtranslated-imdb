The second film about the adventures of a pair of Gaulois Asterix & Obelix is ​​10 times better than the first. Humor is great (and disobedient), and the script is well executed, taken from the original 1965 comic strip Goscinni and Uderzo I fell asleep with the first film (although I am a big fan of Asterix) and did not want to see this sequel, but I am glad that this film proved me wrong Great comedy for everyone. Highly recommended!
