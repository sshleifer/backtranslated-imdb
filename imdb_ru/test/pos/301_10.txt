The masterpiece of Francis Ford Coppola was the perfect end to the golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s, an atmosphere of tolerance, impartiality, and progressiveness reigned in the studios, which made it possible to film major films to several of the best directors the United States ever had. I am not a historian, but all the events that preceded the decade (some of them are the violent deaths of the main figures of American political and cultural life, the racial struggle, the emergence of the counterculture of the 1960s, the increase in violence and death on the streets ...) seemed to have affected visions of directors who were willing to dare, be different and create fascinating and intelligent movies. The Coppola film is a strange mixture of humanistic thinking and skillful filmmaking, following the parameters of military and adventure films, and at the same time subverting them with current thinking about the value of life, cause of death or ethics of war. It is also passionate work, done in spite of everything mentioned in the 1991 documentary Hearts of Darkness: Director's Apocalypse; a film that surpassed all previous reflections on the Vietnam War, ever reaching the screen. Perhaps this is not a definite picture in Vietnam, but in dealing with it, Coppola challenged the formula of a classical melodrama found in two Vietnamese films filmed simultaneously: “The Deer Hunter” and “Returning Home”, or in the latter, as “ Platoon and Victims of War before Vietnam became the starting point for the creation of works of any genre, such as the horrors in Jacob’s Ladder or the Good Morning Vietnam comedy, among the more respectable. Coppola had the courage to take this economic and political conflict as a backdrop for finding answers to the questions that every person faces every day of his life, without betraying the dramatic consequences of this war.
