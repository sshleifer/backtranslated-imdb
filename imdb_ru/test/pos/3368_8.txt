I was not sure what to expect from the BOX. I'm a big fan of Darko, but I also saw the mess that happened with Southland Tales, regardless of whether it was a studio rush, who knows. With the box I was pleasantly surprised. It was a return to the classic science fiction films about paranoia, which hint at much larger insidious events, but focused on the intimate character of the character. <br /> <br /> Slow building and terrible stress very effectively influenced the tone and theme. the whole movie. Any change in such stimulation would lead to the typical Hollywood or MTV style that simply would not serve the purpose of this story correctly. Everything, from strange looking / acting add-ons littered everywhere, to a low level, to a minimal explanation of what exactly happened, added a whole thread of basic fear and a diminishing sense of hope for our greedy, though well-meaning, leading characters. It was something well thought out and powered by Richard Kelly, from the first act to the end. The story of Richard Matheson, on which it was based, and not the episode of the Twilight Zone, which was another taking of history, was one of the mores and greed that were still central elements of the BOX. Being only about 8 pgs in length, expanding it into a content feature would not be an easy task, but it was done with style, originality and left the viewer with lingering thoughts about the film. Many have and will compare this with DARKO for how deep or not it is, but I found it to be a completely different film, thematically and emotionally. His tone is completely different, as are the messages and intentions of this film. Where Darko left us questions inside, THE BOX leaves the viewer more external questions concerning the world around us. For example, knowing human nature, will the BOX test ever end? A decent game, great creepy visual effects and an impending atmosphere add a slow, chilling ride. This is not for everyone, but for those who understand where it comes from, this is a pleasure.
