“Shock Force” or “Librarians” is a fascinating action movie that is not taken too seriously. William Forsyth plays the role of Simon, who is looking for the missing daughter of a rich client. He meets with Sandy (Erika Eleniak), who is also looking for someone - her sister. But there are evil bad guys in motion. The most evil of them is Marcos Canarius (Andrew Divoff). Marcos loves killing people. So now Simon and Sandy must unite to defeat the villains. The whole cast is great, Divoff steals the film. There are also cameos by Ed Lauter and Bert Reynolds. If you're looking for a good action movie, watch it and have a good time.
