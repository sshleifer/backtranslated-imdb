It contains a spoiler. The film is a good action / comedy, but I don’t know, the director has shot too much, but it seems that the bad guy is dying too quickly. The end of the film has come, the bad guy is dying, and that's it. <br /> <br /> The special effects are good, and I don’t regret having paid to watch it in the theater.
