The hit was an exciting movie about a pair of young punks trying to survive in the 1980s in New York. This includes fighting another street gang, with whom they directly share their high school lessons, trying to stay in school, and visiting local shows in which bands like Dead Kennedy and having the name Skulls as the band name participate. Rex (played by David Jacobson) Plays an autistic child who starts to get annoyed with all these kinds and starts showing them that poetry is really beautiful, and if you apply it to what these children do in life, it can really make you work for the best. ! Billy Kane (played by William McNamara) and Kate Kane (played by Cara Glover) are brother and sister. Although they roll with this mob of thugs, these children are not people like this group.

Rex showed them the beauty of evil music. Rex showed them beauty in Rats, Disease, and Murder. Rex showed them the beauty of almost everything, while some of these things have nothing to do with beauty, they still could see that when used in verses, these verses speak to people. Rex played an important role in this move, which changed everyone's heart from depression to see what they had hope for, and that is why he began to show them; Beat.
