This biography of Buddy Holly’s early rock and roll star (1936-1959) is a journey of strength for Gary Busey. The highlights of the film are the stage performances of Busey, where he plays the guitar and sings Holly songs. He introduces such energy into performances that the actual Holly performances compared to them are almost pale. Buzie's infectious toothy grin illuminates the screen, he creates an absolutely believable and winning personality, and his Oscar nomination for Best Actor was deserved. <br /> <br /> The film tells about Holly's career from growing up in Lubbock, Texas, to fame and New York and his untimely death in a plane crash. One thing that seemed interesting to me, if this was true, was Buddy's ambition — he had big plans to go beyond recordings and performances. In his youth, he had already established himself as an astute businessman and definitely wanted to take everything to a new level. We will never know if he could eventually catapult his early success with a business brand like The Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The lyrics of many of Holly's songs are quite young; read the lyrics to "Peggy Sue" or "Oh Boy!" and you will understand what I mean. Maybe this largely explains his popularity among the youthful audience, but his instruments and stage performances undoubtedly explain his influence on the groups that they have to follow - and The Rolling Stones and The Beatles recognized its importance. <br /> <br /> Obviously, some freedoms were taken for dramatic effect. For example, I doubt that Holly ever beat out a producer in Nashville, or that the audience at the Apollon theater in New York was so responsive that they danced in the aisles. If you are interested in getting closer to the truth, see the documentary The True Story of Holly Buddy (1985), created and adopted by the very relaxed and fascinating Paul McCartney. It contains interviews with Holly's family, friends, and band mates (Holly's musical brothers are not even mentioned in The History of Buddy Holly). Members of other bands, such as Keith Richards and Don Everly, also offer their opinions and stories, and there are shots of Holly's old speeches. McCartney's production may stand on its own, but it is a great addition to “The History of Buddy Holly,” and it may be necessary to watch everyone who watches the fictional storyline.
