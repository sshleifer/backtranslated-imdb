Before I watched this film, I heard a lot of praise about him and quite a few exclamations about how “terrible” he was. In order not to pay tribute to this film, I think that it was not so terrible or even shocking. This is just a film about people living in the dark part of the city. And good to portray the essence. <br /> <br /> There is a great game and a well thought out manuscript. Paavo Westerberg is a famous writer on the Finnish cinema scene, and he is the best at describing contemporary Finnish culture (although he is not the only writer of this film, but I dare say that he is the main author in any case. Correct me if I'm wrong). <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent, with the exception of Jasper Pyakkönen (a pseudo-main character who, in my opinion, should have stayed in the scene from the soap opera), as well as sets and cuts and sounds are also very well done and create great atmosphere in this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a story about poorly related sad fates, which, according to a very famous song of the famous Finnish group (“Tuhansien” Eppa Normaali) Murheellisten Laulujen Maa ", which is VERY roughly translated as" Paha Maa ") into the whole of Finnish society, leads to a sad, dark end, accompanied by drinking, loneliness and poor choices.And this is part of everyday Finnish life, which about 80% of the population do not know, unless such films have been made.
