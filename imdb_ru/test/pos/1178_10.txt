Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau must be some of the best friends who have ever worked together. They made a lot of movies together, I think they are both fantastic when they work together in a movie. In the sea, a fantastic comedy film, which I think to watch. I give the film 10 out of 10. Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau will remember when the films they shot together will be shown on TV. They will be sadly missed. God bless you both.
