Their father, Harry Brighton (John Savage), a banking investor, lives in the basement with his models of trains and railways. Evie mysteriously sabotages her interviews for various universities that reject and Emily teaches her poems. When Martha hears Emily repeating the verses, she takes notes and shows them to the English teacher, Stuart Worsy (Christopher Lloyd), who believes that Emily had a moment of geniuses. When Evie James's only friend (Fran Krantz) reads his notes, he immediately reveals the truth about the authority of poetry. But when Martha realizes, she finds Ivi's reality, evoking a series of revelations. <br /> <br /> “Reception” is a very strong drama about those in need of love and a complex of guilty. The performances are amazing, and this is the first work of Lauren Ambrose from "Six Feet Under", which I see, and it is amazing. This independent film is a great choice for viewers looking for a refreshing story based on the actors' action. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Cumplicidade" ("Complicity")
