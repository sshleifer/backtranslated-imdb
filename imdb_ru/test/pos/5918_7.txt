Biographical account of the life of Charles Lindberg, the first man to make a single non-stop flight across the Atlantic in 1927, on his Spirit of St. Louis plane. <br /> <br /> While not among the top Billy Wilder films, it really does boast of very impressive production performance, especially for a film made 50 years ago. The story is well told, and the performances are also good, although not outstanding. <br /> <br /> One of the factors limiting story-telling is that Lindberg flew alone and without radio, which means he has no one to talk to. This required several different storytelling techniques, such as in-house monologues talking to a fly, and occasional bouts of self-talk, especially when exhaustion occurs. Also, to avoid the extended sequence of the famous flight, it alternates with memories from his life and methodical preparations for the flight. <br /> <br /> Charles Lindberg was a huge hero of his era, but his conflicting beliefs would spoil his legacy somewhat. Despite this, he will continue to contribute to the aviation field and assist as a civil aviation consultant in US efforts in World War II. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart certainly had experience in supporting his portrait of Lindberg. He rose to the rank of Colonel of the United States Air Force during World War II, and, while in reserves after the war, would have reached the rank of brigadier general.
