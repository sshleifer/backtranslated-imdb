Although this film is 11 years old, I just shot it yesterday, and I found it really touching. The story of true friendship in the face of this monster is inspiring and touching. <br /> <br /> Although I didn’t care how many languages ​​some young actors use, especially from Renfro - I understand that art imitates life. Renfro once again does an excellent job of a rough and tough, very (and I mean VERY) agitated imitator bully (I recall his role in the “Client”), and Mazzello does a wonderful job of a witty, somewhat strange Dexter. - A child who understands that his life must end too soon. <br /> <br /> Although there are so many touching and funny moments in the film, I have to say that my favorite was when the boys were cornered by Pony. in an abandoned church, Dexter (Madzello) cut himself, saying that his blood was poison. Despite the fact that he is very resourceful and a little funny, when he sees an adult man running away from two small children, this is one of the most difficult scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> Definitely check it out, but prepared with your Kleenex - you'll need it!
