I'm a hot fan of Vijay. I have never seen one of his films that would be so good. <br /> <br /> It has all the usual clich√©s you would expect from a commercial artist. A hero who is bad at school, but a star in his strength, i. E. Kabbadi. His friends to fill the comedy quota. The heroine in a life situation. The villain I speak is the best one ever depicted by the main character. High octane chase and action sequences. Music that can do one dance. And above all, this is the perfect storyline to keep all of the above factors in a pleasant circle. Fine. <br /> <br /> The director does not give a chance to relax. It simply moves from one nail on the head to another. And in this film is visible the brighter side of Vijay, which he rarely performs. <br /> <br /> Everything is said ..... This film has been and will be perfect for many years ...
