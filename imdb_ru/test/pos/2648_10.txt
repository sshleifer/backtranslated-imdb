This course, of course, one of the greatest films of his or any other genre. Kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time, but his entire filmography must be placed in a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey, unlike anything I've ever seen on screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors who can attract you and keep you captive from start to finish, even in the absence of an extended dialogue or plot development. Only with the help of visual materials, the year 2001 is able to present a picture of the future, which is both sublime and terrifying. 10 out of 10, without a doubt. For my money, it's not much better than 2001: A Space Odyssey ... now, the sequel, 2010 ... that's another story.
