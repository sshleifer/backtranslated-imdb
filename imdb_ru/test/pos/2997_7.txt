I caught this movie at the end of the tape that I used to shoot the movie, which I really wanted to see again. When I saw the name Raquel Welch in the opening credits, I decided to watch it. It was actually a bit captivating and led me back "off the road" to the farcical films that Hollywood produced in the sixties, in much of the same genre as the current Austin Powers material. Oh, the acting was not great, like the plot, but it was worth it to watch. There were some amazing landscapes, although Miss Welch provided the most pleasant of these. Tape if you have the opportunity, and see when you have nothing else to do. It does not sleep, but it does not make you ride in the aisles, wanting more.
