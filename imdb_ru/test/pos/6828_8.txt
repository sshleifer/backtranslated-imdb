“Confirmed Dead” is an important episode in the series, which features four new characters: a rescue team that Naomi contacted before Locke got a knife in the back. However, as stated in the quotation from the one-line resume, their true purpose of being on the island may be something completely different. All new characters seem intriguing (especially Miles, some psychic / exorcist), but at the moment it is too early to make firm judgments. I felt that this episode was a small step down from the Beginning of the End (this time not flash forwards; instead, short flashbacks), but it still has its amazing moments and is gaining momentum at the end. *** out of 4
