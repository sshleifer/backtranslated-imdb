Yul Brynner was a symbol of Villena in the 50s, he played the role of the Russian leader in Hungary during the revolution in this country in 1956, which opposed Marxism. <br /> <br /> The script of this film was made to the taste of the author, combining love and adventure with the image of different characters traveling from Hungary to England. <br /> <br /> The best moment in this film was the call symbol from the Resistance of the Hungarians to kill the Russian major (Yul Brynner) during the film, which made sense about the shortcomings of this major because of his bad work, but in the end good work to help Deborah Kerr for escaping from her and her road to London to write a good job in her book in order to finally achieve people's agreement and trust after he was killed by the Hungarian Resistance.
