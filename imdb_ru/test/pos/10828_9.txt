Bon Voyage is fast paced, which somehow reminds me of films about Indiana Jones and Star Wars - as if you were taking a high-speed train or a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> He is exposed as romance, mystery, thriller and farce; all this and more, including candid observations of the reactions of French society during the Nazi invasion at the beginning of World War II. And this is also a juggling exhibition in which 7 main characters participate. All the scenes seemed historically accurate (in my opinion) and gave excellent feelings during this period. <br /> <br /> All the actors were well-played and gave excellent performances, but IMO's most excellent was that Isabelle Adjani, who played the role of an opportunistic, self-centered French film star; Not only did she quite convincingly play the role of a young actress, perhaps half her age, but she also convincingly played her love tricks, but viewers saw that she was only half serious and more complex as a person than just a gold miner. Her character and energy propel the film from start to finish. Only when I read the review of Roger Ebert did I discover that she was 48 years old at the time of the film. What a beauty !! <br /> <br /> I appreciated the final - it is a pleasure, but it allows you to write your own conclusion about what happens to the main characters. <br /> <br /> As another Commenter user noted - DO NOT be late; You should be there from the opening scene. Good advice. <br /> <br /> I gave it 9 out of 10.
