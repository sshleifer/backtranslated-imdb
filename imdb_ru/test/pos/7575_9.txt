What a joy to watch this family grow up and see how the same children play this series eight years later. Anna (Lexi Randall) is a beautiful young woman working as a doctor in the city. She is in love with his son Justin, who went into the army and was wounded in the war. And the younger daughter of Jacob and Sarah, Cassie, frank cutie, so frankly honest that she is often embarrassed. <br /> <br /> On a cold winter day, a stranger appears on the farm. He is in no hurry to reveal his identity. When they find out that he is Jacobs' father, John Whitting, who has long been considered dead, it is difficult to answer difficult questions about the past. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is great as a loving mother who wants only the best for her entire family, and constantly struggles with the forces that seek to separate them. Sarah, talking to Jacob, said: â€œIn this life, everything is so fragile. Anything can happen in the blink of an eye. I could die in this blizzard. Think of Justin and John. Perhaps even more painful than we know. Time moves on. " . A moment passes, then it's too late. It's a shame, isn't it? "<br /> <br /> Life lessons of honesty and forgiveness make it meaningful evening entertainment.
