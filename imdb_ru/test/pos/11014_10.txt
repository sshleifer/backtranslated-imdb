One of the best films I've ever seen is the classic film The Matrix. For years I tried to record it on VHS or DVD - to no avail. The German film and television industry still prefers valuable cultural contributions (and this is Fassbinder!) To rot and collect dust in some kind of archive rather than distribute it for commercial purposes (and earned a lot of money from it if instead of promoting creative thinking). However, the WDR once told me that if I paid 200.00 German marks for copyright verification (not refundable), and then 8 German marks per minute of copying plus the cost of materials, they would consider preparation (one!) Copies for me. Some way to sell something! We have the same problem with many other television films or TV shows, such as “So weit die Füße tragen”, “Sonntagseltern”, “Kellerkinder” and others. Great series - never to hear again. Germany, wake up! <br /> <br /> UPDATE since March 2007: Last year I was finally able to get a copy of the DVD from "Mittschnittservice" WDR for 50+ euros. Big!
