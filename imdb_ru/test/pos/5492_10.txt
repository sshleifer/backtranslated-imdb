One of the best films I've watched ... A good script, an original story about a man who is being pursued by the assassinations of John F. Kennedy when he was assigned to defend him on that cold November 1963 day. Thirty years later, another antisocial madman wants to kill the current president. A secret service agent loses his partner on the way to crazy insurgents who plot, lie and kill anyone in his path who stands in his way to his mission. <br /> <br /> The film is accompanied by a magnificent memorable score and a restrained, but significant novel between Rousseau and Eastwood ... which shows how difficult it is to lead a romantic life in such work. Malkhovich is great, of course, many other candidates could play the role he played, but how many of them could play with such cunning and intelligence that he showed in the film? <br /> <br /> Of course, I thought so. there was a great movie ... every time he goes on TV, I have to watch it ... and I have it on DVD! I'm a big fan of Eastwood, it only strengthened his already incredible career and the best role of Malchevich today! <br /> <br />
