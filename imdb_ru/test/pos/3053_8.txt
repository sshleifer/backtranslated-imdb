Please keep in mind that this movie has nothing to do with Radio City Music Hall! As archivist: Music Hall .. I know what is and what is not connected with the New York place. Theodore of the film - just "Music Hall". There is no Rocket in the film. Only great skaters plus great actors and fun. Just thought you would like to know. Really wonderful movie. You never guess who the "killer" is while watching this movie ... until the very end. What a great story and great skating. Never again see such representations. The Roxy Theater and the Center Theater, in New York, were skating on stage!
