I thought the storyline was very well crafted. I really liked this movie. If you're going to ruin the Bridget Fond movie, you can just rot. I thought that a rag on movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently, someone does not think so. I rather liked the movie. I even think about buying. I want it to be my very first dvd for my room. That's how I like it. I would prefer not to start an online dispute with someone I don't know, and let it be because of the movie. If someone kindly refused what they said about the storyline, I would be more than happy to withdraw my insult. However, if they feel that I am not worthy of refutation, I can simply feel that they are not worthy of that either. But I can not control their actions, I can only encourage them in the right direction. Hey, they do not need to give up, but I would really appreciate it.
