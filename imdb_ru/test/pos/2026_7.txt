Rock Star is a “good” movie. All is well. Even guys who don't have to be good are really good. Chris is a good guy who learns from life. He returns to his girlfriend Emily, who is also good. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, despite all its mercy. Maybe I'm just used to everything related to X Gen music. In a sense, the film was a caricature of Rock Stars and not tough enough to be believable. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg is pretty good. Jennifer Aniston played her part well, but she was uncomplicated. She was a good girl. <br /> <br /> Go and see. If you have ever been to a rock concert or seen Spinal Tap, watch it.
