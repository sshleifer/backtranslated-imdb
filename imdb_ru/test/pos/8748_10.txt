I did not see a more recent "traffic", which is based on this, but I would put on this as the best creation. I do not know of any other film that would so well depict the intricate tragedies of drug trafficking and the “war on drugs”. I watched this film at least four times and enjoy it again as part of the presentations of the 30th anniversary of the Theater Theater.
