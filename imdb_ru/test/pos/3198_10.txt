I caught it as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was just great; the salutary grace of what was another wise oblivion for just a bad group of films. <br /> <br /> The perfect use of deep black and pure white with excellent, but simple animation is just a cat chasing the moon. Cheerful, charming and touching. A small piece of paradise for cat lovers, romantics and anyone who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your city, take a look. This short is worth the cost of admission.
