This is probably one of the funniest Danish films ever made. Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas Bo Larsen are hilarious when traveling all over Sweden. I don’t know how Ulrich Thomsen does it, but somehow he manages to play a madman in a very sensible way. BUT, if you don’t understand Danish (I don’t mean your cookie here), don’t waste your time on it ?? I don't think it will work with subtitles.
