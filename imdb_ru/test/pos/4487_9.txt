During the science fiction marathon TZ on January 31, 1999, this episode was the last in the 20th century in my time zone (Eastern). It was New Year's Eve, and when the clown began to sing: "We are here because we are here because we are here because we are here ..." I realized that it was a clever bow of TZ to be New Year's Eve because that this tune is also a tune to the Old Lang Sin. Conjuncture? We will never know. <br /> <br /> I like this story for little touches: a tear on a ballerina, a clown’s antics and a final “hit himself on the head”. This and Art Carney Santa TZ - the only ones that are dedicated to Christmas. <br /> <br /> My personal five best episodes after five characters ...: 1. Hunting 2. After hours 3. Hitchhiker 4. Lonely 5. Little girl lost
