Black tar is an amazingly good movie. I was not a fan of Vin Diesel before I saw Pitch Black, but after seeing Pitch Black, my respect for Vin Diesel increased. He played a great Riddick, who was wanted for many murders. His character is cold and makes a lot of decisions that surprised me, as if near the end Riddick was going to board the ship and save his ass, leaving everyone to die. I like this film and how it works with human instinct. This film is low-budget, but this film shows that you do not need amazing special effects and a lot of money to make a good film, I think all the characters made this film. I give this film 8 out of 10;)
