I saw three episodes of "Animatrix", and this is my favorite of all. The Second Renaissance gave a light story to an already fragile universe. The program was a stylistically impressive number, it was just silly. I think it gives a special shade - this is the direction from Sinichiro Watanabe, the director of the incredibly popular (and for good reason) Cowboy Bebop series. It has some of the best elements of Bebop: slick, sci-fi adventures, a crazy, slightly indifferent, self-employed hero, a dizzy head (more or less) and a chase scene, all wrapped up in an excellent film noir film. Tarantino-style mucus Watanabe penetrates full gas.
