This is a typical high-speed entertainment film of the early 1930s. When you play James Cagney at the head, these “pre-coding” films become even better: just fun things to watch. Usually, when films are “dated,” this is negative, but not so with movies from 1930-1934. Yes, with slang and attitude, clothes, hairstyles, etc. They are outdated, but this is a big part of the fun. These films have an advantage that is almost always fun to watch. <br /> <br /> They also have a zest, attractive and exciting. You see people — such as the juvenile offenders depicted in this film, and their stupid parents — whom you simply cannot see in any one period except this one (in the early 1930s). At the beginning of the film, the children are brought before a judge, and you sit and just laugh at these crazy characters who appear in court on behalf of their children, one by one. Yes, we get the stereotypical emotional Italian father; Jewish dad; The Anglo-Saxon mother and several other mothers, who all in a dramatic form beg them, are the "good boy." Despite the fact that in some cases everything is predictable, you do not mind, because everyone here is so fun to watch. <br /> <br /> It also teaches you that the children were punks 75 years ago, they stole, robbed, rob, lie - hey, this is a human condition. This film refutes the theory that "people were kinder in the old days." No, people have always been rotten or good. The degree was helped by their environment, parents, financial situation and other things. Here we get a group of "dead-end" children who fall into the Reform School. <br /> <br /> A funny and silly-liberal storyline forces children to behave like angels immediately after they conduct a show at a school of reform; in no way punished for causing a person to fall to death and set fire to the institution (explanation: he was mean and deserved it. So much for real justice and reform). and Patsy shoots a guy, and the police don't even interrogate him, because he's a good guy! Pay attention to the thin anti-religious excavation, in which only one guy prays - the evil “warden”. This is not by chance, not by chance. Such negative associations have occurred since the Hayes Act was passed in the late 60s, and, as you can see, they heard in the early 30s that preceded the code. <br /> <br /> Dudley Diggs, by the way, is an outstanding “Mr. Thomson” in his role as a “bad guy.” I especially his voice was very effective and could imagine that he plays one of the same evil roles as the institution's boss in the film adaptation of Charles Dickens. Cagney played his usual role, a tough guy who without a doubt gets a pretty girl "Dorothy Griffith" played by Madge Blake. Frankie Darro was also effective as the boys' leader, Jimmy Smith. Only the looks on Darro's face made his character believable. He was a real movie star, but I’ll still go with Cagney. The rest of the guys from the school of reforms were not too believable, and these were really ethnic stereotypes, but they were interesting to watch. <br /> <br /> I thought that the most interesting part of the film was the first 20 minutes when we saw how bad these children were and witnessed the good and bad and stereotypical parents in court after the children were arrested. These scenes are pure things from the 1930s Dead End Kids. They always showed bad news to the children at the beginning of the film, but by the time the story ended, they were more and more like Wally and Beaver Cleaver - hardly rude "criminals." This is very contrived, but it also works in entertainment. <br /> <br /> In general, a funny but very interesting film, typical of Cagney films and films of the early 30s. Almost all of them rank at least eight stars for their entertainment value.
