You cannot watch this movie on a history lesson. It was the first time I heard about the saga of Ma Barker, but I could almost immediately say that the facts were far away. And with a little Internet research, I realized that I was certainly right. Ma Barker is sure that, damn it, she is not a sexy, calculating woman, in which she is portrayed from a film, and obviously did not organize all the schemes of bank robbery, kidnapping and murder committed by her criminal boys. <br /> <br /> But don't expect a brilliant crime drama. The script and actions are adequate, the skirmishes are excessive and mostly unreal, and there is a very funny death scene in slow motion. So why did I give him 7 out of 10? <br /> <br /> Because it was damn interesting. Shootout is fun to watch, but deeper themes arise between them. The film has a strong sense of intimidating the ego among its cast of alpha men, each of whom has his own agenda. And I appreciate the minimal use of curses for the period. Plots are gorgeous, reproduce a convincing era of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> So watch this movie as if you were a cult movie, and take an excessive amount of blood and ruthlessness with the silly and very serious comments of the FBI man. who wants to kill the Barkers at any cost. In other words, don't take it seriously, just have fun. And if you like it, you will love Serial Mom.
