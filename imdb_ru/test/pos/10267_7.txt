As in the case of FOOTPRINTS (1975), I found out about this quite by accident: this was mentioned in the review LIBERTINE (1969), which I investigated when this film appeared on an Italian nightly telecast, as in a similar vein; By the way, I missed the screening of the film LIBERTIN (although I later purchased it through the same channel), but I managed to watch a DVD movie with the English name R1 during my stay in Hollywood at the end of 2005. / early 2006. In fact, given the rave reviews about him, I was disappointed with LIBERTIN - too carefree in nature for what was essentially a serious topic (sadomasochistic relations between a young couple)! To be honest, for most of the time, I was afraid that the Scaring Woman would follow exactly the same route ... but later was abundantly redeemed by an evil (if not completely unpredictable) last turn. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the freedom of thought and stunning creativity prevailing in this era: an eminent philanthropist (Philip Leroy) invites a journalist (Dagmar Lassander) to her fashion house for the weekend; However, it turns out that he is a woman hater who does not trust all members of the opposite sex and prefers to dominate them (or even kill)! Therefore, in the first half of the story, we see how the heroine suffers pain and humiliation at the hands of Leroy (including having to make love with a dummy in his own way!) ... As long as the tables are thin, but not surprising, they are not turned: she’s not only frees himself from his control, but also teaches him that the Man and the Woman can coexist harmoniously - except that Lassander also follows his personal program !! <br /> <br /> Starring great play, and the film itself is often gloomy for those in the mood; besides, the usually effervescent evaluation of the “Euro-cult” (from the always reliable Stelvio Cipriani) and the figurative - even the outer - look (a giant structure depicting the lower part of the female form, with a steel trap where its sexual organ should be It seems to come from Freud: by the way, this prop featured prominently in the frames I saw earlier from “The Frightened Woman” ... but he is barely recorded in the film itself!). Other fancy touches include the ridiculous radio program Sexual Aberrations and the Stars and the idyll at the castle belonging to the Leroy family, with a secret passage through the wardrobe and a dwarf servant. Thus, one of the highlights is Lassandra’s easily erotic dance almost naked — the episode that actually leads Léroi’s “humanization”; after all, the two characters have an “autopsy” in the bullet of the latter - fun-tuned to the theme of spaghetti western! <br /> <br /> In the long run, the film, despite all its stylishness, is inferior to the similar, but much more extreme contemporary Japanese masterpiece by Yasuzo Masumura BLIND BEAST (1969). Finally, it is worth noting that “Frightening Woman” was distributed in the USA by Audubon Films, directed by Radley Metzzher; he even hired a designer of his production (Enrico Sabbatini) for his own CAMILLE 2000 (1969)! To get to the publication I was looking at: in addition to the usual flaws in the duplication section in English, the presentation here was overshadowed by a rather vague appearance and brief examples of distracting outside noise on the soundtrack! By the way, it seems that there is a certain confusion regarding the length of the film: its duration, indicated in various sources, ranges from 84 to 108 minutes - however, all I can say is that my copy worked for 87 minutes . !
