This film is definitely a case of style in essence, but the style is good and, of course, more than unique in itself to make The Cage memorable and the film is above average. <br /> <br /> “The Cage” looks great with impressive sets, costumes and makeup. Yes, this is a real sweetie for everyone. In the film there are several completely “dreamy” episodes, which, of course, are strange, but at the same time very beautiful and creative. This film is the perfect combination of an art-house movie and a typical Hollywood thriller, accessible to both fans of the genre. <br /> <br /> The story itself is rather far-fetched and does not always make sense. Because of this, the film is not always pleasant and pleasant to watch, but, as I mentioned earlier, the style compensates for this. Style makes you keep looking to the end and delivers the best moments of the movie. <br /> <br /> Vincent D'Onofrio is unforgettable as a serial killer with a twisted mind. Vincent D'Onofrio is really underused as an actor, and this film once again demonstrates his talent. I am not particularly pleased with the casting of Jennifer Lopez. I know that she may star in some of her films, but she really didn’t fit to play the main character in this film. Her character was not strong enough, and she was overshadowed by Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. However, I felt that Vince Vaughn was also mistakenly accepted in this film. He did not fit this role well enough, and no, I don’t say this because I’m used to seeing him only in comedies these days. The rest of the cast is good and still gives the film a certain degree of credibility. <br /> <br /> Howard Shore's musical score was also surprisingly good and was a kind of “Se7en”, as from time to time. He went well with the film and gave the scene a little extra mood and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> This is not an ideal film, and the concept is far from appropriate and is not always processed correctly. However, “The Cell” is a film that you can watch with pleasure, and which you may even need to watch because of its style, originality and creativity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
