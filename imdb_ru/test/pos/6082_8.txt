One of the most charming and, at least for me, the strongest elements of the exciting "Best Picture" by Anthony Minghella. The English Patient is that in the mid-90s, when Hollywood was in its early stages, he lost his temper. grandiose new projects, the film was created, which returned traces of very powerful traces of a wide, remarkable grandeur, which created such films as Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and Ten Commandments (1956). The “English Patient” contains a lot of things that made these films so powerful. He has this great feeling, stretched running time, which hardly seems like a long time, and exciting characters with words and stories. <br /> <br /> “The English Patient”, based on the novel by Mikhail Ondaye, as “The Godfather: Part II” (1974) in the sense that it was built. This is a mixture of two stories: past and present, and it all revolves around the title character: the English patient in the period after World War II. Ralph Fiennes is playing an English patient who suffered a plane crash for the rest of her life and who is cared for in an isolated church by a lone nurse who Juliette Binoche wonderfully performs. In addition to communicating with his hoarse, worried patient, Binoche finds out about his past when a stranger arrives (Willem Defoe), and these two seem to know each other. <br /> <br /> This is only one of two beautifully crafted stories that form this film. The other recounted in the memoirs is the past of the patient before he got the scars and died in bed. The history of the present is mixed with the patient's past and his love story, which tragically changed his life forever. <br /> <br /> To put it bluntly, “The English Patient” is a love story, mixed with a wide epic feeling, and it combines beautifully. What really fascinated me in the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Christine Scott Thomas is how passionate, obsessive, charming she was shown on the screen. Usually in love stories such as the later “Cold Mountain” by Minghella (2003), romantic elements seem to me much more lustful than intrusive. In some love scenes there are elements that are usually associated with lust rather than with love, but, nevertheless, because it is so well developed and not in a hurry and not exploited proportionately, we can believe that there is a real, real love between these characters. It reminded me a lot of “Vertigo” (1958) about how well the directors and performers convinced us that they were two real people who really fell in love with each other. <br /> <br /> All the performances were great, and I was particularly struck by the performance of Juliette Binoche, who took Oscar home for her performance next year. I also liked that Willem Defoe plays a kind of cynical, dubious character, whom he always plays a key role. And, of course, I can not fail to mention Faynes and Scott Thomas and their portraits of two very passionate lovers. <br /> <br /> Despite my tremendous enthusiasm for this epic, I would be dishonest if I described it as a perfect movie. There are two flaws that I cannot look at. First, this is too long, and the reason for this is my second complaint, there are several unnecessary side scenes. I was not fascinated or particularly interested in the second love story between Binoche and the bomb expert played by Navin Andrews. My research led me to speculate that this plot element was taken from the original book, and I’m sure it worked perfectly, but in the film it’s just a little distracting, and the relationship between the two characters does not fascinate me. with two leading actresses. <br /> <br /> However, these two drawbacks are easy to forgive, even if they slow down a bit. Putting aside, “The English Patient” is an outstanding achievement in filmmaking. For me, it was a kind of crazy mix between Casablanca (1942) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962), two great and best films, and this effective mix turned out to be worthy of my time. This is a real shame that Anthony Minghella left us. Because he was a really gifted director. This is all the evidence that anyone needs.
