If you are a "child of the eighties," like me, you probably remember this Disney film from 1981 - one of the first Disney films with a PG rating and Michael J. Fox debut on the screen. I remember watching this film again and again on HBO when I was in high school, and only recently found it a very old copy, since Disney stopped producing the film several years ago. Needless to say, this is a really fun movie to watch. Five college teams decipher evidence in an evening race around Los Angeles, trying to get to the finish line first. Follow the cameo from Paul Rubens. From fun music to the disco scene with fat twins, this is a typical funny movie from the 1980s that you will surely enjoy.
