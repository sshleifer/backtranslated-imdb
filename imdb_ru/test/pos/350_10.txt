Since 1981, Nintendo has been making great video games like Super Mario and Zelda. Most ideas will get a little boring after 20 years. The games made by Nintendo never seem boring, because they always add something new. He moved from arcade games to Wii, and I heard that in 2011 it is planned to release a new version of the Wii. A distinctive feature of Wii games is that you are actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch, pressing buttons, <br /> <br /> And I have more good news. Super Mario Galaxy 2 is due for release in 2010.
