Tonino Valeria "Il Prezzo Del Potere" aka. "The Price of Power" is an excellent and exciting spaghetti western, reflecting Kennedy's assassination. Giuliano Gemma’s superb performance and the excellent appreciation of Louis Bacaloff are just two of many reasons to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> In 1881, Texas was divided into those who appreciate the abolition of slavery and simply want to live in peace, and those who, after 16 years, still want to restore the confederation. Despite warnings, President James Garfield, who wants to establish a new equality policy, decides to visit Dallas, where corrupt law enforcement officers are planning to kill him. Bill Willer (Giuliano Gemma) and his two friends, a black man named Jack Donovan (Ray Shonders) and a crippled guy named Nick (Manuel Zarzo) are determined to prevent the assassination of the president. <br /> <br /> Since James Garfield was not killed by racists who wanted to restore the confederation in Texas, but in Washington, DC, by the mentally unstable Charles Gito, the storyline “The Price of Power” is, of course, historical nonsense. Since the film, however, does not pretend to historical accuracy, but attempts to refer to the Kennedy assassination in Dallas in 1963, the fact that the story is fictional is legitimate. <br /> <br /> Giuliano Gemma perfectly copes with the role of the protagonist Bill Willer, Benito Stefanelli is great as the villainous and corrupt sheriff Jefferson. Other good performances include Ray Schonders in the role of black friend Bill Jack, Warren Wanders in the role of Arthur MacDonald, presidential adviser, and Fernando Rey in the role of Pinkerton, a villainous rich businessman. The score of Luis Enriquez Bakalov is gorgeous, the cinema and the locations are gorgeous and (like, for example, in the early “Day of Wrath” by Valery) very much resemble Sergio Leone, for whom Valery worked as assistant director in “The Handful of Dollars” and “a few dollars more”. /> <br /> Everybody says: “Il Prezzo Del Potere”, after “Day Of Anger”, is another excellent spaghetti western that demonstrates both Giuliano Gemma’s great talent as an actor and Tonino Valerius as a director. “Price power "- this is what you need to see fans of spaghetti ve thorns, and I also highly recommend it to everyone else. 8/10
