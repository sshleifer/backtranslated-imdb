Unlike most of the people who commented, I was born after the last Episode of Sylvester McCoy and therefore could not compare the two centuries of the doctor, who at first. I really liked it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series. Since then, I have seen the old episodes of Doctor Who, and some of them were great, but, like the doctor, the series needed to be restored to continue. A wonderful doctor of the 21st century, I thought that Martha was gorgeous, almost suited the doctor, and if Jack’s appearance didn’t change, she would be gorgeous when she was filmed in Kame 4 or 5. <br /> Speaking of Jack, Torchwood is also great, and you should watch both of these programs (although this is definitely more suitable for children). However, if you insist that it is not the same and that it is not Doctor Who, just stay in the basement. <br /> <br /> 10/10
