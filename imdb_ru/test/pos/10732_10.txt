I have seen many of Dustin Hoffmanâ€™s films, such as Straw Dogs or Rain Man, and I liked them, but his characters are often calm or even shy. I expected him to be in this film just like he was in Straw Dogs, but I saw a completely different person. He was much more energetic in this film and reminded me a bit of Al Pacino in Serpico. The film was very interesting from start to finish. I liked how the character of Dustin Hoffman was ready to do almost everything to stay with his son. This film is also revealing. Personally, I think that this shows that people should learn to find a compromise without involving other people in the problem.
