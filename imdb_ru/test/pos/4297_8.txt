I wish there were more films about middle-aged people. Intellectual travel and turns of life make viewing interesting. It seems that women with extra-marital relations have different standards than men. Amy Watsonâ€™s insulting and humiliating behavior towards her husband seems to be passing without comment. Switch roles, and you can expect a stream of condemnation towards a person. If she had found her husband boring and condemning, she could have told him so, left and waited without a doubt for a major financial settlement after the divorce. The country and London scene is amazingly authentic and rich, while the autumn weather perfectly complements the melancholic background. The ending is perfect, so consonant to real adulthood.
