I saw this film in the early 1990s when it was on VHS for a while. At the time, I found it interesting, and I was particularly struck by the Ken Russell segment with visions of a victim of an accident in sorting and surgery. <br /> <br /> Last night at the show in the second run of the last Indiana Jones film, John Hurt’s vision caused an unexpected memory of “Aria”, which I hadn’t thought about for years, and the sudden memory of Russell’s work itself was enough to cause tears for a while. Little. <br /> <br /> If I can make this observation, I note with interest the reaction of love and hate that people have expressed in the Russell segment, and I found this interesting difference in other films that delve into deep trauma. and its consequences. Some GET it, others NOT, interesting. <br /> <br /> I see from the comments and rating that the overall work strikes people in various ways. This is how it affected me.
