Spike Feresten is a comic genius. Talkshow demonstrates a new look at the strange irreverence of the balls that have made such shows as Letterman and The Daily Show successful. Its appeal is palpable. He seems to be finding a unique angle of a joke, rather than the predictable path of a comedy series ... thank God. His comedy resembles the award-winning “Arrested Development” (cross your fingers, that Tokshow has a longer life span). The topics he highlights are usually things that pass unnoticed by everyone else, but when he creates a joke around them, you wonder how you missed it the first time. I especially liked the sketches ... "Unfair Goal" will become a cult classic in the shortest possible time. Set the people of your Tivo ... this is a show not to be missed.
