Elizabeth Ashley receives phone calls from her nephew Michael - he cries, screams and asks for help. The problem is that Michael died 15 years ago. <br /> <br /> This movie scared me to the depths of my soul in 1972, when it aired on ABC. Seeing it again, after years, it still works. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit slow and predictable, the deaths are very tame, and there is a happy ending, but this is a TV movie, so should give it a place. Elizabeth Ashley is gorgeous, Ben Gazzara is all right, and it's nice to see Michael Douglas so young. And these phone calls still scare me with a living light. In fact, I had to turn on the light during one of them! <br /> <br /> A small creepy television movie. Worth seeing.
