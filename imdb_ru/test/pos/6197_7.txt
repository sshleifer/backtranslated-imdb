If you watch this series, you will get an interesting 10 chapters about the history of the sleeper cell and about each character. And more intense with FBI penetration. <br /> <br /> Good story, good characters and performances, but something is wrong (for me, of course) The final is incorrect. You are waiting for ten chapters in the hope of a wonderful ending (it doesn't matter if they fulfill their goals or not), but ... well ... I think that is not enough. This is a small final for a large series. I also hoped to get more definitions about the characters of the stories. <br /> <br /> But again, these are interesting mini-series. If you do not want to wait with a large series (chapters 22-24), look at this. I give 7 out of 10.
