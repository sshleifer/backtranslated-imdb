Interference. This review has been edited due to word limitations. <br /> <br /> The horror. Horror.' Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001) <br /> <br /> A phrase that is also known as “Looks at you, baby,” or “Are you talking to me?” Or “ May the Force be with you, ”or“ I'll be back ”means a little more than some lines. When it is pronounced, it is held in the air with a value and a value that does not go unnoticed. What can drive some viewers crazy is that they will never find an answer to this horror if they don’t watch the movie again and try to watch each frame carefully. <br /> <br /> What exactly does this line of dialogue mean? The horror they are talking about is the reality of war. The reality of moral people is so easily distorted that they give birth to their innate instincts and kill their brethren with no signs of guilt. When Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is standing in front of the dying Colonel Kurz (Marlon Brando) at the end of the movie “Horror. Horror". this is the awareness of Willard's corruption. He ruthlessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his assignment. This is not a typical Hollywood finale. In most cases, the character gets something, either emotionally, physically, mentally, or all three. But Willard wins and loses. He gains the knowledge that he has lost his morality. And this is a shocking ending. <br /> <br /> Apocalypse Now is a tribute to Francis Ford Coppola on the artistic side of filmmaking. This film is completely different from The Godfather. It is hallucinogenic, visually blinding, and an ode to the guilty side of human nature. At first it seems realistic, and then becomes strange, and then symbolic and, in the end, original in its unique perspective of the spiritual side of the war. This is not so much a film about the Vietnam War, as a film about the war within us. <br /> <br /> At first this is really another war movie. Captain Willard (Shin) is appointed army lieutenant (young Harrison Ford) to kill an American renegade colonel named Kurtz (Brando), who is hiding somewhere in Vietnam with a supply of troops that more or less act as his slaves. <br /> <br /> Willard accomplishes his mission “with prejudice,” sailing with four soldiers, including a captain, a chef (Albert Hall), a chef (Frederick Forest) and the very young “Larry” Fishburn (who later became Morpheus in The Matrix). <br /> <br /> Apocalypse Now is in many ways a modern update by Odyssey of Homer. As our main character, Willard, continues his journey, he encounters many original and strange characters, including Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who has a strange surfing fetish, and a seasoned photographer (Dennis Hopper) whose living gestures and manners can be compared with the gestures of Jeremy Davis in "The Million Dollar Hotel", one of the worst films I've ever seen. Davis was unable to establish any connection with the audience; Hopper does. He is like a poetic atmosphere between Willard and Kurtz; he is like a translator, walking back and forth and speaking foreign languages. In this case, he translates Kurtz Willard, although I'm not sure that Kurtz needs Willard's translation. <br /> <br /> Many films are lucky to have one or two memorable scenes or lines. Apocalypse Now has a lot. Kilgore, descending to a village in Vietnam and playing Wagner's Valkyrie's Journey, remains one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history. It has sharpness, cruelty, ironic tone, and a sense of playfulness. When Kilgore kneels on this beach and says: “I like the smell of napalm in the morning. It smells like victory, we all smile. <br /> <br /> I will not lie to you: “Apocalypse Now” is a strange film. This is not an easy thing to analyze. The end may upset some viewers if they do not understand the significant speeches of Marlon Brando. But what comes down to what really matters is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche. Horror is an awareness of the war and its consequences, not the war itself. Kurtz says: “You have the right to kill me. But you have no right to judge me. Character Brando, Kurtz, left to the public. To many naive viewers, he may seem crazy crazy, whose power has penetrated his head. But this is not what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to convey. After fighting in Vietnam, Kurtz realized how great he was and how bad he was of others. Walking through the devastated villages, he eventually comes to understand that we are naive and live in a paradise of fools. We are absolutely naive with respect to our surroundings and possible misfortunes, until they hit. Seeing how unhappy some Vietnamese are, Kurtz realizes how easily he can be hit by something. How easily he could end up like the people around him. And he also understands that the people who did this are the people who left their morals and left them at the door. Many people think horror is one thing. These are two. For Kurtz, horror is the reality of how naive he was, and the reality of the impact of war on people. And after Willard kills Kurtz and hears Kurtz’s dying words, he also understands this. He is aware of the consequences of the war. Seeing so many soldiers without a sense of good or evil makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man. And what it did to him. Horror. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
