This movie is great. The best acting game I've ever seen in my life. Ingvar E Sigurdsson is the best Icelandic actor, and, of course, Hilmir Snar and Bjorn Yorundur. Great music and sound. Cold harsh reality about the struggle of a man who has a lot of problems and people in his life. Black humor is mixed with great acting and style of European feature films, it works, it comes together in the best Icelandic film ever made. I tell you: "Watch this movie, you will not regret it." I gave him 9 stars. If you see one Icelandic film in your life ... Watch this
