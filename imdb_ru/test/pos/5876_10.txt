Since there have been so many reviews of this beautiful film, I will write in a list and try to resolve issues that were not discussed. <br /> <br /> 1. Dana Andrews was 38 years old while filming this movie. His character on the script was in his mid-20s. Andrews, a highly underrated actor, brilliantly played a character who was supposed to be much younger. <br /> <br /> 2. Fredrik March, like all great actors, must sometimes be limited to the director to avoid excessive play. He robbed the camera when he was drunk the night after his arrival, and also the next morning when he checked his hanging in the mirror. <br /> <br /> 3. Dana Andrews was gorgeous, like in Lore, Incident with the Bull, Walk in the Sun, Purple Heart and many other films. Why did Fredrik March receive an Oscar and why was Dana Andrews not even nominated for his outstanding work? <br /> <br /> 4. Harold Russell gave the best performance I have ever seen, not an actor. <br /> <br /> 5. I understand that it was the 1940s, but Dana Andrews did not seem to show any romantic interest in her exceptionally attractive wife (Virginia Mayo). <br /> <br /> 6. Ray Thiel, who played the right-wing fanatic, after years became famous for depicting the sheriff on Bonanz. <br /> <br /> 7. A professor from the south wrote that the film was slow, boring and acted poorly. The professor is most likely unaware of classic films. The beauty and significance of these timeless classics is that they are slow studies of characters who avoid profanity, excessive violence and useless sex. <br /> <br /> *** I was surprised that zero out of 3 people found my review useful,
