It was an amazingly very good movie and an interesting idea. However, it was a bit disappointing, because Twist was too predictable and too early in the film. While watching, he began to get a little strange and confusing to such an extent that the only sensible result was the inevitable turn of the plot, but this, of course, did not destroy this stream of films. There were excellent performances, there was never a boring dull moment, so itâ€™s worth watching this movie. It interested me to the very end, and for me there are not so many films that can make it today. I highly recommend people watch this amazing little movie.
