As I expected, too many reviews of this film (both by professionals and amateurs) focused on the ideology of the film, if not more. This is because “The Sea Inside” (aka Mar adentro) is a film about euthanasia. In particular, this is the true story of the notorious Galician named Ramon Sampedro, who for many years fought for the right to suicide with an assistant, who was denied this right by the Spanish constitutional court, and which - well, I don’t want to destroy the end of the film for you . <br /> <br /> In real life, Sampedro became a catalyst for a national debate about euthanasia in Spain. Now with a biopic of producer / director / writer / composer / editor Alejandro Amenabar (Abre Los Ojos, 1997 and The Others, 2001), The Sea Inside, another rhetorical help was provided in the international debate on this hot issue. <br /> <br /> But, as I repeat (deaf?), your opinion on the ideology of the film should not affect your movie rating. You should not evaluate the philosophical or political messages that Amenabar wants to make. You should rate a movie like a movie. Perhaps this is too idealistic, since none of us can probably completely separate our assessments from our ideological prejudices, but idealistic or not, this is the goal. <br /> <br /> So let's forget about philosophical and political issues for a minute. As a film, Amenabar has become one of his most elegant and mature works to date. He does not focus on public debate. He does not focus on Sampedro’s legal / political struggle. He focuses on Sampedro as a man who lived to the bed in his brother's house. <br /> <br /> Sampedro, who played here in an amazing performance by Javier Bardem, was paralyzed. As the film begins, he has been paralyzed for 26 years. This condition was caused by how Amenabar shows us through surprisingly removed memories, as a result of a diving accident - Sampedro was distracted by a beautiful woman, miscalculated in the water, dived, snapped his neck and almost drowned. As a four-legged man, he eventually began to write poems, some of which were published in a book called Letters from Hell (Cartas Desde El Infierno); in real life, Sampedro’s book became a bestseller in Spain. Perhaps taking the replica of Sampedro’s artistic work, Amenabar created an elegantly poetic film. <br /> <br /> Most of the Sea inside is in the bedroom of Sampedro. The focus of these scenes is the sophisticated and sublime game Bardem. As paralyzed, Bardem is limited, moving his head and talking. He mastered the subtle changes in expression and inclination to convey the profound nature of the multifaceted intellectual approach to life. Bardem and Amenabar Sampedro often sound philosophical in understated speech, but there is always a combination of an evil sense of humor, a passion for aesthetics — including music and women, and sadness and even sometimes bitterness not far below the surface. The various underlying emotions sometimes erupt, like waves, over the skin of the ocean. <br /> <br /> People with whom Sampedro interacts most often help this in a complex way. Among others is his sister-in-law Manuela (Mabel Rivera), who was his main caretaker after the accident Sampedro; his brother, José (Celso Bugallo), who is one of the vocal opponents of Sampedro’s desire to die, and with which there is an unsolved problem (it seems that José was the one who saved Sampedro from drowning?); his nephew Javier (Tamar Novas), who is perhaps the most understanding to him; human rights activist Jena (Clara Segura); pro bono attorney, Julia (Belén Rueda), whom he wanted because she had a degenerative disease, CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical heart attacks and leukoencephalopathy), and therefore more empathetic, and whom he fell in love with; and Rosa (Lola Duenas), a local woman working at the cannery and under the moonlight as a DJ, who learned about him from the media, wants to convince him of wanting to live and falling in love with him. <br /> <br /> Most of the film consists of these characters interacting with Sampedro in his room. There are also several other supporting characters, including Sampedro's father, who remains strangely distant, and the infamous media-aware priest, Padre Francisco (José Maria Po), who does his best to change Sampedro’s opinion with the help of philosophy / theology (in the scene is often mistakenly described as “comic” - there is an accompanying comic element in it, but the scene is mostly very serious). <br /> <br /> The fact that most of the film takes place in Sampedro’s room, ingeniously gives the couple significant changes. in setting a greater impact. There is a beautiful large window in Sampedro’s room, which, he says, suits him as a point of observation of the world. Perhaps more importantly, he regularly presents the window as a launching pad through which he flies through the hillsides to the ocean, which he always loved and which was the most influential force in his life — he provided his life when he was younger and took his mobility. Amenabar gives us a fantastic sequence of Sampedro, representing one of his flights to the sea. It is beautifully filmed, with corners (presumably from a helicopter) of the hills, sweeping until we follow the stream to the wide open ocean, which in this film represents freedom, endless and natural forces. <br /> <br /> Another significant change occurs when Sampedro finally sits in a wheelchair (otherwise, he refused them, saying that they “ridiculed his stillness”) to appear in court to help defend his case . Amenabar gives us a bitter, dreary voucher, taken subjectively, from Sampedro, who looks at life and the world in action from a car window. <br /> <br /> Whether you agree with the legalization of euthanasia or not, it is difficult to deny that this is a well-played, well-designed and well-composed film. You may not believe that this is ten (and this is even more unlikely if you do not agree with the legalization of euthanasia), but it is still worth seeing as a great example of artistic, complex filmmaking.
