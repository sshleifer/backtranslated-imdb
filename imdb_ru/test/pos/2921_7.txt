Maybe it's just a personal affection for this film adaptation of Mick Valtari's novel or love for Egyptian things (I grew up loving visiting mummies in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts), but I think that Maltin is a bit cruel in this pretty good movie. Production values ​​are great in terms of color and cinematography, and it seems that some of the efforts have gone to historical certainty (I am sure that most of this is from the novel). Admittedly, Purd is a bit cruel in the lead role, but this can be taken as part of the Xinuha character. Victor Mature, well, in general, Victor Mature. Peter Ustinov is very pleased to observe the role of this type, which he always did so well and so wittily. Bella Darvi’s performance as Nefer is a classic camp, and I find that even the rather dry image of Michael Wilding Akenaten has its own appeal. <br /> <br /> The historical oddity of Ateneten monotheism, a brief detour of the theological history of ancient Egypt, is interesting, as is Akenaten, and it is worth reading about it; The religious wars depicted here are truly grounded. <br /> <br /> An interesting footnote about Darvi, whose name was Beyla Weier: she was a Polish immigrant, which producer Darryl Zanuk and his wife Violet took under their wing (I suppose they might even have taken it). Her pseudonym Darvey is formed from the names of Zannak and his wife. She continued her acting career in France, but did not achieve great success and after a rather miserable life, died in 1971 from her own hands. <br /> <br /> In general, this is an interesting film that is pleasant to watch for a visual film. values ​​alone. American Movie Classics sometimes shows it in a mailbox, which is very important to cover the scale and scope of history.
