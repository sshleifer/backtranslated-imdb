Gorgeous Greta Garbo is in great shape in this first radio. She receives excellent support from the rest of the cast, including Charles Bickford, a stern sailor who captures her heart. Ms. Garbo does an excellent job with her duties, as is usually the case as a detached daughter of a sea captain who returns fifteen years later. Also in the cast is that great actress Marie Dressler. A great movie!
