This film by the famous Czech director and writer-co-author Peter Jarkhovsky is notable for its peculiarity, but annoying and distracting with its details. Taking his topic and title from a poem by Robert Graves, he deals with a woman with several men and some unpleasant relatives in her life who are trying to survive and protect their two children, 15-year-old Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) and little blond asthmatic Cuba (Adam Misik). The poem proves a lot, but the theme is a bit lost. <br /> <br /> Marcela (Anna Geislerova), the beauty and the Yard (Roman Luknar) lost everything in the floods of Prague in 2002 and it seems there is nothing left but good sex that they make with such revenge in their tiny apartment that Lucina and Kuba in front of the TV channel should keep their ears from noise. Hrebejek enjoys such frankness and skates to the point of embarrassment or shock. There is no exact explanation why, but financial despair led Jarda to handling stolen cars in a large garage that adjoins his apartment. His car thief drives off a posh Volvo, left quiet by Benes (Josef Abrham) with ignition keys while visiting a large property he owns. Benesh is a super nice guy, but not a fool. His Volvo is designed to track the satellite in such cases, which leads the police directly to the garage Yards, and he and his team are sent to prison. <br /> <br /> “A beautiful woman in trouble runs to a good angel / on whom she can rely,” Graves' poem begins. But in fact this scandal leads Beniss to Marseille when he meets her at the police station. He introduces from the land and on how to drink wine, and draws it with a picture book about Tuscany, where he, although born in Prague, owns a beautiful villa and lived most of his life. He is here to return home in Prague, in which the couple now lives with an ancient and weak mother whom he allows to stay. Each gesture of Benis is kind is desirable, although it does not prevent Jarda from going to prison. <br /> <br /> In these circumstances, Marcel must retreat with Lucina and Cuba to depend on her mother's charity, Zdena (Jan Breikhova) and much less tender mercies of her current husband Zdena, a skinny diabetic Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer), who for children who begin when they commit the cardinal sin of eating his diet cookie, is the uncle of hell. At this point, Jiri Schmitzer hijacks the film and never lets it go. Even in the final scene, he is a mocking threat figure. Surprisingly, the abominable Richard does not sexually abuse one or both children. He insists that Marseille needs to get out on his own, and when Benes suggests taking her under his wing, he and Richard become incredible allies. Incredible - perhaps implausible. Why should benes love him? But then, what is the whole story of Benes? About some things, the film gives too much information, and about others - not enough. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Benes’s “good angel” is unmistakably kind - and a polished, good-looking elderly man whose manners match his Italian upbringing. It is only at the end, when his Prague masters brought their Prague property to the limit, he proves that he is not one of those who will not lie and walk. <br /> <br /> You also need to deal with the religious fanatics of Jarda Sdena (Yana Breichova), and her communication with Zdena and Richard is worth seeing. But she is just another wild card that does not increase the deck. <br /> <br /> The poem was written for music in Czech translation and performed on the screen by accordionist vocalist Raduza, first in a tiny scene and then in a more extended staging on the stage in prison, witnessed by Yard and the car thief of a friend. If you read Comber as an author, you can enjoy this consistency; otherwise, it tends to feel gratuitous. Also included are a number of songs by Glen Hansard / Marketa Irglova from the Irish musical film Oscar, which won an Oscar, including the theme song of the last, Fall. They feel more out of place than they did otherwise, because they are familiar with “Once” - although this film appeared first. <br /> <br /> Row people are arrested; even little Koba has his Shakespearean-childish moments and rich charm; but the director and his writer do not seem to be able to resist the temptation to retreat and expand excessively. Benes property worries can be helpful to show that he has a hard side. But such a complex demonstration was not necessary. Acting is good, and there is a miracle with whimsicality and specificity, but the main themes of love, sex and money are lost in Marcela's shuffling and conflicts, and how she resolves them never becomes clear. It is good that there is no permission and loyalty to this theme and to Graves' poem that Marcela still has hot sex with Yarda during her second visit to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and her children. But there are too many questions about what to do with the disgusting Richard or the annoyingly pious mother of Yards (Emilia Vasareva). Why do we suddenly find out that Koba receives letters from "India", allegedly from his father, who is in prison? When did it happen? Interesting details hurriedly inserted into. It seems to be a world in which you cannot see the forest behind the trees.
