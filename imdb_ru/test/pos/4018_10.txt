An interesting film based on three novels by Jules Verne. Considering the special effects and computer animation of today, this film is a historical marker of cinematic resourcefulness and imagination. Karel Zeman realized the lithographic images of the original texts of Jules Verne. This is a must see for lovers of classical science fiction and history. <br /> <br /> I give this film 9 out of 10. Enjoy !!
