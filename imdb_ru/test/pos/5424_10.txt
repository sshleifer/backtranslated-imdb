Richard Condi's animated mad movie “Big Nyunka” is a journey through weirdness, madness, courage, pleasant background, melting characters and a conclusion that almost makes me tears of joy every time I see him. <br /> <br /> This short I have seen again and again and again, and I NEVER ARE A BUS (fortunately, this is on a tape from the broadcast on TV) !! It never ceases to make me laugh uncontrollably, and then plunge into the depths of my spirit, emphasizing the greatness of the human condition. <br /> <br /> Because when someone says: “Come on, let's finish the game”, everything is in order in the world, and the troubles that we face every day, we suddenly realize - all this is minor fleeting things that you no longer need to fight or worry about. This film at first glance seems like a simple exercise in cartoon humor, but it’s much more. This film strikes a greater sense of spiritual meaning with humanity following, when everything seems so bad and trivial. <br /> <br /> It is impeccable ... in all respects. And damn funny;) <br /> <br /> Rated 10 out of 10.
