For those who still prefer films about human relations, 51 Burch Street is something to see. <br /> <br /> By teaching attention to his family, Block covers an area inaccessible to most filmmakers. He explores the general but tacit family dynamics and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is initially deceptively restrained. <br /> <br /> In addition to studying one family — and, accordingly, each family — the Block also chronicles a very specific period in recent history. I do not know whether it was intentional, but inevitable because of the archival content. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
