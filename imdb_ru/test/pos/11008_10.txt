Yes!!!! Fassbinder and Ballhaus are at the top of their game, back in 1973! This is about the same theme, but, in my opinion, the film is much better than THE MATRIX (1999), at least it was 200 times cheaper! Very good camera work by Michael Ballhaus and a wonderful Albatross from Fleetwood Mac at the end. Fassbinder creates a very capricious tone for the entire film. It's a shame that this movie never came out on DVD. But now, after 37 years, they finally came to the conclusion that this television film is not only one of the best Fassbinder films (although there are many best Fassbinder films), but also a vivid example of a sci-fi film made without much money. Buy it !! Watch it !!
