I have not seen this film since it was released in the cinema, and since then I have been looking for it. At that time I was 12 years old, and the story thrilled me; and NOW the ending eludes me. Most of all I was embraced by a young love, not to mention the vocals of John and the lyrics of Topin. The story (at the time) struck my soul. I am a fan of sentimental films, and it still hangs in my head after 35 years is so good. Put yourself in adolescence and let your fantasies grow. If this movie didnâ€™t make you curious, then you were too old. I look forward to seeing him again (even at my age)! If nostalgia for your place, I'm sure this is an interesting film. This innocence is simply astounding, and its simplicity is so simple and pleasant.
