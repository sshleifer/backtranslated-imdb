What can I say? I got up this morning and turned on science fiction, looked at half the first season and understood everything. Strange, unusual and brilliant. It gives you the full potential, and to think first I said that it looks silly. It should be the next best thing after the X-Files, but as always, in my opinion, nothing will work. I tell you, it's scary, and then anxious, and then soft. By the end, you have Miles as a love puppy with a strange pet, which is a new species. You have two people on the run from the authorities. And the deadly tsunami is about to hit! Blimey! And I mentioned that Miles' pet is a potential killer (well, the rest of his kind). The surface is a brilliant show with backs and turns that delivers it all.
