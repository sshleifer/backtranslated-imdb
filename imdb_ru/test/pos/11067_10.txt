Fantastic film, and very overlooked. Gary was never more beautiful, and Ingrid was more beautiful than in any other film. If you don't believe, just watch the movie. Every cast is great; Love scenes between Gary and Ingrid will make your pulse beat! The story is excellent, the scenario of the Oscar caliber. Do not miss this movie!
