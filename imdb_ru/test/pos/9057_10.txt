This is a really great movie. Full of love and humor, he makes the viewers really care about the characters and participate in their journey. Michael Parness managed to put together a great cast, a minor miracle for the first film. No doubt they were touched to help him tell this beautiful story. David Krumolts carries the film with his understated intensity and honesty. Natasha Lyon is unpredictable, irritable and, nevertheless, very sweet, like Grace. Also a great twist from Karen Black (glad to see her on the screen again) as a crazy but sympathetic mother Grace. Everywhere there is a sharp wit, which allows us to ease laughter when we are confronted with a pain of life. The game is flawless, editing is tight, the direction is inspired, and the music creates a suitable mood background. Given the current Hollywood Blockbuster passion, full of big budgets, big names, car crashes and special effects, Max & Grace is a refreshing care Give yourself a treat and watch this movie.
