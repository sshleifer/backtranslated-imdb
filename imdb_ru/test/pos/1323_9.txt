Mishima is one of the greatest films ever made. Now I think Paul Schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time, but I don’t really like the films he made about what I saw (except for this and Affliction), but this is amazing, exciting 3-D character study. It follows the life of Yukio Mishima, Japan’s most famous writer, combining the last day of his life with memories and his stories. I don't know how, but Paul Schrader manages to combine all this in a very artistic way. The acting is great, as is the photography, and Philip Glass's great result. Despite the confusion of the first viewing, this is one of the few films that gets richer with each viewing. A truly underrated jewel of the film.
