A train with union soldiers carries $ 300,000 in gold along with banker Clayton, who must see how he reaches his destination, but is suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero. However, Bahunda tears off the gold and hides it, but when Monethero tries to get it, soldiers kill him. The only key is the medallion, but Monetro is captured and will soon be executed. A stranger comes in, dressed as a priest (who, after the Monetro Prize) and offers to save his life for half the gold. In return, Monetero gives him half of the medallion, but Clayton notices this and discovers that something is wrong. Soon, all three of them cross each other in search of gold, but the insurance company of the bank and the Monetro gang are watching them, waiting for them to have a chance to lash out. <br /> <br /> Just by watching the opening sequence, you’ll find out that you’re in search of a spaghetti western with a mocking style and support for scattering a lot of links (some of them are nicely implemented) from other films (mostly the “Dollar ") Your subgenre. The vigorous direction of director Enzo Castellari is stretched and mostly light, but in many of his grandiose, spectacular scenery and smooth rhythmics there is potential. Basically there are a lot of fights, fist fights (and many acrobatic stunts) compared with total vicious firefights. However, most of these tricks are very well done, and very nice, and when the weapon is burning, there is energy to burn. Traditional history is close to ordinary details, but since there is a lot of cunning and deception going on, the spontaneous nature ensures that you will never be absolutely sure how this will ultimately happen between these three. This leads to many effective tense moments, tricky turns and a lot of winks. The humor inside the script with starch is pretty tricky. Works in the best among the light and piquant style, dynamically trimmed framing by Giovanni Bergamini and the impulsively incendiary musical score of Francesco De Masi. The performances are very well thought out and form a striking mutual understanding. George Hilton's crooked and bullying turn is as solid as an ambiguous stranger. Gilbert Roland introduces class and intelligence to his formidable Mexican gangster Monetero. Edd Byrnes shows himself in the role of Clayton, who keeps well. Karin O'Hara is not particularly busy, but worthy of attention. Gerard Herter, Pedro Sanchez and Ivano Stacićoli provide expert support. <br /> <br /> A fun and worthy parody / tribute to spaghetti, which throws one bent ball after another and many fruitful and dirty tricks.
