I just watched this movie today, and I really liked it ... <br /> <br /> Yes, it is simple in the storyline, in the sweetest love story, and just like any woman can't fall in love with Callum Blue, she defeats me .. . <br /> <br /> The landscape in Italy was, as one would expect, Beautiful, the villains lost at the end, and for the two lovers who were to be reunited at the end were beautiful, but the scene where there is some Italian looks like confetti after the wedding of Eric and Wanda, perfection! <br /> <br /> Drink a cup of tea and watch a fantastic film, yes, better prepare a napkin and be delighted, I know that I was and I hope to release it on DVD very soon. All the actors played their roles perfectly, it was a film from the Second World War, which you could believe in, as it was so realistic and did not go beyond, as in other films ...
