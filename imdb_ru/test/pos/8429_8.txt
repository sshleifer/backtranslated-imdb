I am a big fan of the 1995 version, which I have seen many times and is considered a thin, excellent film. This version of 1971, which I bought yesterday, is a bit hesitant, but now that I saw it, I am glad that I did it because it is more faithful to the book and the views of Austin. The 1995 version has more dramatic power, mainly because it sharpens many characters — in the 1995 version, Lady Russell is more snobbish, more manipulative, less sincerely caring for Anna; Sir Walter is even more vain; Elizabeth is disgusting; Mary is more unbearable; Mr. Elliot is smarter; Lady Dalrymple is much more stupid - but I think that the characteristics in this version of 1971 are closer to the book, to the vision of Austin and to the real people of that time. The 1971 version also includes more key lines and scenes from the book, including a particularly key scene in the area where Ann overhears Wentworth's conversation with Louise (or is it Henrietta?) About the importance of strength of character. I found the action to be more subtle and evocative than many of the critics here, but the action in the 1995 version is stronger. I agree with the critics here that the actress who plays Ann is too old for this role; I watched her recording on IMDb, and she was 38 years old at the time of filming, when her character was to be 28. I thought her game was thin and effective, however. Wentworth is the right age, and I found him very persuasive. In particular, this version of 1971 Wentworth has much more of his sense of humor and tease; in 1995, there is much more of a sea captain’s sense of power and more passion. The admiral in the 1971 version lacks a coarse presence and human warmth, as in the 1995 version, and he lacks a sense of power that the admiral could definitely convey; I found it the only really weak element in production. I agree with others that the setting of the "falling" scene was too wooden, and it seemed inconclusive that she would have been so wounded by such a small fall. However, it may have struck the back of the head on the edge of the stone step, which in that case would really lead to a very dangerous injury and would make the scene more convincing than the scene in the 1995 version, where it falls further but does not have sharp edges that could would cause a serious head injury. As for the costumes that some have criticized, I am not an expert and cannot answer, but I note that none of the Navy characters (Wentworth, Admiral Croft, Benwick, Harville) in the 1971 version wear a uniform, and in the 1995 version all of them constantly wear their trendy forms. I suspect that the 1971 version is accurate, and it always bothered me a bit in the 1995 version: the officers were always in shape, when it was clear that the nation was in the world, and the officers were suspended from active service. My father and grandfather were professional captains of the US Navy, commanding aircraft carriers and submarines, and they did not spend every day while on vacation or on vacation in their blues dress. I doubt that 180 years ago everything was different. The uniform gives the 1995 version a lot of noise, and I prefer it, but I doubt that it is historically true that these officers wore their uniform so often. Finally, it is true that the production cost of the 1971 version is much less than the 1995 version, but given the year (1971), the television format and the budget, we cannot blame the artists. Modern viewers who can mentally take into account lower production values ​​can find this version worthy of its time.
