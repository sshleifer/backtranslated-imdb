In the 2nd of his films Historical Martial Arts, Chiba portrays his real sensei, Masa Oyama. The film even recreates the incredible feat of Oyama - to kill a mad bull with bare hands (Oyama did this feat more than 50 times in real life). Dynamic combat choreography using authentic Kyokushinkai techniques. Ironically, this is one of the rare films about Sonny Chiba, in which he doesnâ€™t tear or tear off opponents' body parts. Sonny Chiba fans must see one of his 5 best films.
