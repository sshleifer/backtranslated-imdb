This review was written by someone who has read this (several times) and knows what they are talking about! First, I read other comments and noticed that some of the objections were really pretty dumb. People who read the book and another Jane Austen, or, for that matter, any good book, will know that it’s vital to stick to this book, you must trust the author with what they do. If the viewer does not like it, BECAUSE it sticks to the book, it shows that they do not understand Jane Austen and, obviously, are not her true admirer. <br /> <br /> First, if the viewer really loved the book or Jane Austen in General, watching it for four hours should not be difficult. Secondly, their society was very concerned about their appearance, and such large bizarre hairstyles showed how rich you were, which at one time was the key factor for living in a “good” society. I must admit, women's suits were not brilliant, but there were only a few bad ones, and the men made up for it, also this prejudice for naval men, not in their form, in good words is very stupid! from school or work, because they have everyday clothes, and it was the same thing in the 19th century. In addition, the acting is very good, thin, because Jane Austen writes that way! and the scene at the end is beautiful. You cannot compare the survey with the one that was in the 1995 version, since the technologies have improved so much that it would be absurd to compare them. The actress who plays Ann is too old, but her manner of action and how she does it compensate for it. <br /> <br /> People seem to prefer the 1995 version for some reason I can't understand! It is not at all tied to the book and therefore flat, the end sentimental, they change the main scenes, the only good actors are the main roles, and I give you a good job for what they were given. Obviously, people who really, truly love this (I apologize) are stupid because they do not understand Persuasion and therefore need it to overdo it. The 1971 version is beautiful, romantic, written by a great screenwriter (as well as Inspector Morse), had very good actors, and really, this is a film that you can watch many times, and during each one you can be delighted with it.
