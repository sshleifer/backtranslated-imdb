This is one of the funniest movies in history. And for those of you who don't understand this, this must be funny. So often comedies try to be so deliberately ridiculous that they skip, but finally, a film that succeeds in being fun in the most subtle way. Even “parodies” lack the originality and natural sensation of this film. This is a comedic classic, which will certainly be appreciated at another time, when studios regularly deal with such things. Glory to the creators and fun thin composition of actors, including Isaac Wade, whose performances at the highest level. Truly, the real star game of this undervalued actor. It would be great to see how this guy got his.
