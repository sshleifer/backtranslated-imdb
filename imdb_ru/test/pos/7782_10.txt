It rarely happens that I sit down to write a commentary on the film .... but this film !!!!!! Oh my god, oh !!!!!!!! There has never been a Hindi film better than this ...... and there has never been a better movie than this ...... this is the king of all comedies ..... <br /> <br /> Aamir Khan perhaps the best comic actor in the Indian film industry ... although it’s ridiculous to say that because he is a great actor and not a comedian ... but what he did in this film is perhaps the most fun performance of any Indian actor in the comedy. .. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan was never a good actor in my eyes .... but this film got the best of him ... he was innocently comic ... if ever there was a term like this ... just what the doctor prescribed for his role in the film ... <br /> <br /> Rajkumar Santoshi: I don’t know why, I never tried myself in a comedy again. ... he led great adventures, such as The Legend of Bhagat Singh and Khaki, but he could not recreate the magic of Andaz Apna Apna ... <br /> I don’t care why this film was bombed at the box office .... although I am sad that the film like "gum, aapka, hain, kaun" became the reason for his failure ...... for the moment I hope that the rumors will become true ..... there will be "andaz apna apna-2" , they say ....... we, as viewers, can only say AMEN !!!!!
