"Outside of Rangoon" is simply amazing. From a traumatic opening to an inspiring finale, you'll be amazed at how well this film is composed. Patricia Arquette amazingly portrays Laura Bowman, whom we see as a disabled and upset young doctor who is unable to cope with her grief due to the loss of her husband and son. Throughout the film, when she is trapped in Burma, witnesses an uprising of democrats and massacres in the capital, Rangoon, flees and saves the life of her guide (U Aung Koh), she regains her will to live. This may seem far-fetched or harsh: it is not. John Boorman, a master of spiritual and emotional conflicts, paints the film in broad strokes and often uses symbols to capture Laura’s emotional state and physical difficulty. Patricia Arquette, as usual, gives a surprisingly convincing and believable performance in the role of the emotionally wounded Laura. What Arkett does amazingly in any role she plays is giving us a window into the heart of her character without words. Every time she is given a close-up in the film, viewers are given an idea of ​​her character. She does not need to talk to convey emotions, or be excessive. Some critics were harsh about Arquette’s performance in the film when it opened on August 25, 1995, believing that it was “flat” or “boring” in the role. I found that her characterization completely coincides with melodrama, which, as a rule, is part of the acting performance when a personal tragedy occurs. She is shocked and reserved in her feelings: it is as normal as shouting at others. I hope that Warner Brothers will release this title on DVD very soon. With the highly successful Arbett drama NBC "Medium", which led her to the status of the Name, not to mention the victory of the Emmy and the nomination in 2007, it would be in the interests of the studio. I hope there will be additions with an alternative ending. Do not pass by this movie. This is one that you probably will not forget after viewing.
