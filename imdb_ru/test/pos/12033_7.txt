I found the parts of this film rather slow, especially the first part; the second part seemed to go much faster, but I donâ€™t quite understand why one part was faster than the other. I somehow managed to find it enjoyable. The game was good, the letter was good (but vulgar). There was another good side: it was easier to understand than to say, The Godfather films. You knew who was on whose side, etc. In general, the film was not welterweight.
