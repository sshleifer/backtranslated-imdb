I used this film on ethics courses in college for more than 10 years (also Woody Allen's “Crimes and Misconduct” is another amazing multi-level ethical study). <br /> <br /> This is fiction. I do not focus too much on the unrealistic features of Strangers, because all fictional films are clearly false on many levels. I love the film as a comedy of the gallows, harshly said, with many ironic twists and visual pleasures - even if it’s "unbelievable." The story is told so well that I do not even think about criticizing its credibility (although I must admit that the tennis match seems to me the weakest part - too much Hollywood fluff and not enough real tennis competitions). <br /> <br /> Some of the problems presented in the film promise realistic moral education and ethical discussion: <br /> <br /> 1. Ethical passivity: some of the weaknesses of Guy’s character are intended by Hitchcock. The basic ethical understanding of the film is the danger of failing to articulate its moral position. The guy can't effectively block Bruno’s crazy offers right from the start. An interesting question: why and how does Guy behave so passively, inefficiently? A possible answer is his depression due to his intense and complex divorce process. <br /> <br /> 2. Misunderstanding: The guy makes another failure in the beginning: on the train to leave quickly, he agrees that Bruno’s ideas are all good. But the literal meaning of Guy is the opposite of his apt, sarcastic meaning. Bruno takes the literal meaning as a murder agreement. The guy perceives sarcastic sense as an escape from a murder agreement. To some extent, at the very beginning, Bruno can partially pretend that an agreement was reached to draw Guy into the network of complicity. Bruno manipulates Guy; Guy’s linguistic ambiguity on the train gives Bruno a chance to impose an ethical “stranglehold” on Guy. Bruno, manipulating Guy, may have other meanings. ,, <br /> <br /> 3. Secrecy: Some reflect on the sexual relationship between Guy and Bruno. At first, this seems ridiculous, especially when you consider that Guy is clearly heterosexual in relations with Miriam and Ann. However, remember that Guy is also ineffective with both women. The guy seems (stereotypically - I remember 1951) effeminate, especially in a relationship with Bruno. The guy, a strong athlete, is weak inside. Bruno is also in conflict (he plays “against himself”), at first he looks strong on the face and physically, but then he displays some “feminine” features (fashion and work of Bruno, emotional rush to Guy in various situations, his manicure from his loving mother ). Bruno kisses and desperately caresses his mother's hand; other more subtle stereotypes of gays that have a mysterious meaning from Hitchcock’s point of view). I would like to hear Hitchcock clarify his intentions here. <br /> <br /> 4. Unfairness and mistrust: Guy makes enormous blatant mistakes in hiding the truth about Bruno from his family and from the police. The guy is not able to fully understand that admitting an error can be better than concealing or delaying recognition. Again, Guy is driven by passivity, insecurity, fear, and perhaps self-hatred, which is closer to Bruno’s own hatred than we want to see or admit. Both Guy and Bruno play their parables about powerlessness. <br /> <br /> 5. The lack of evidence: The guy feels the problem, collecting evidence to justify himself. A quick call to the police would solve a huge problem, Guy is luring himself into a trap with his own doubts and uncertainties: the lack of the desired alibi; the inability of an alcoholic professor to testify on behalf of Guy; the obsessive need to appear politically intact; and other personal factors that make Guy feel defenseless. He is as incapable as Bruno, but not as dangerous (although Guy can be partly accused of killing Miriam). <br /> <br /> 6. Illness and mental disorder: an interesting question is, how legally responsible is Bruno for the killings? The more ethically incompetent Bruno is as a sick sociopath, the more guilty can be the Guy as a healthy person who could not stand up and act morally to prevent crimes. A guy’s refusal is like a man who cannot call the police when a sick friend threatens suicide and death occurs. Some may argue that more than one crime has been committed, and that Guy is an emotionally tortured accomplice. <br /> <br /> These and many other features of the film make “Strangers on the Train” a pearl of moral play, a diamond for philosophical and cinematic reflections.
