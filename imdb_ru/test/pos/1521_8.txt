Closet Land is an amazing, terrifying movie piece. There are only two actors in one set, but never lose attention. The scenography is creative and disturbing, the staging of the scenes supports your attention, adding to your own sense of confusion and horror. The acting game is outstanding, Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe are responsible for each scene. <br /> <br /> I first saw this film in 1991, shortly after it was videotaped. It did not play in the theaters where I lived; not surprising, given its political content. This should be seen though. It shows the brilliant stage of torture and interrogation methods used by repressive societies to instil fear and obedience to its citizens. The country is never called, making it even more astounding. It can be anywhere; East, West, 3rd World, 1st World. This shows what happens when a small group of people decide what is best for everyone; when the government becomes the ruler of the citizens, not the servant. <br /> <br /> Madeleine Stowe is a children's writer who was pulled out of bed at night and subjected to terror and torture. She finds herself in a room with Alan Rickman, who seems to be a pleasant functionary. At first it seems like a terrible mistake, and she is free to go; but fear makes it stay, and terror increases. She is increasingly subjected to physical and mental torture. The investigator uses sensory deprivation, temporal manipulations, confusion, auditory manipulations, role-playing and distorted logic to break the author. She is humiliated and intimidated, forced to endure heavy postures of the body, devoid of food and water. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, she refuses to give up; do what the investigator asks. She is told that everything will end if she simply signs a confession. Simple little act. She refuses. Despite all this, she uses protective mechanisms that have evolved since childhood. Slowly revealed that she was the victim of child sexual abuse. To survive, she developed fantastic worlds and characters that would remove her from abuse. These mechanisms allow her to transcend her torture and turn the tables on her investigator. She begins to attack his own beliefs and profession, forcing him to explore his own life and motives. In the end, it is free because it supports freedom of thought. The investigator is the one who fell into the trap of the state. <br /> <br /> This film was shot at the height of the Cold War, apartheid, and at a time when the crimes of many governments around the world were daily reported. This is even more relevant in a world where “enemy combatants” are held and interrogated in secret prisons, they are denied legal rights or a lawyer; where “ethnic cleansing” is ruining entire societies, and humanitarian aid is prohibited. This demonstrates that a person can withstand a state or another oppressor, refusing to succumb to fear and terror.
