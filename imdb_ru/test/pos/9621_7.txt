Martial arts films became popular in the 60s in parts of Asia, but with the growing popularity of the infamous Brothers Show films, America was supposed to gain popularity. This film was the first to be presented in America under the Warner Bros. label, and in fact the passion started here that flooded the 70s martial arts films. Many subsequent films will be pale in comparison to others, but some of them were great, and many, such as Enter The Dragon (which came out shortly after that), became great success stories and made superstars of these fighters. <br /> <br /> Fast forward almost 40 years later and this film still holds. Most of the Shaw brothers' films are as good today as they were then, and, to tell the truth, not a single film has been created in this genre that can compete with those that were shot by The Shaw Bros. <br /> <br /> I like to think, Martial arts are like porn and nobody watches porn plot only action, it also comes with OE films, and most of them are just a bunch of big fights with a little story, this is one exception. He has no amazing story, but it does. <br /> <br /> The main character, played by Luo Li, actually stands out among the karate heroes. He never brags and never fights just because he can, he is often considered weak and less fighter than most, but when he has to fight he damn it is the greatest living thing. I really liked this character. Many of the bad guys were memorable, and the battle scenes were so amazing. Even a small role with Bolo Jung can be seen as a huge Mongolian, and Bolo is in my top five best martial arts movie stars, he was also in the movie “Enter the Dragon” mentioned above. <br /> <br /> The production, as I have said again and again, is wonderful, you cannot beat Shaw, the direction was not at all the same as I saw in the 70s films, the use of color was well placed and made this film stand alone and grow taller than others. When the light shines on the hands of Chi Hao, as he does the Iron Fist, his pure beauty. <br /> <br /> The music was also excellent. The martial arts films for Asia were the same as the westerns for Italy - they are two different forms of art that have a lot in common. The countries that made these films were of all genres, but Japanese films were what caused a wave there when spaghetti westerns were in Italy. With their many different styles, these two genres were neck and neck. As seen in films like 5 Fingers of Death, fights are easy to compare with Sergia Leoni's cowboy shows, and music connects genres so well. The music here borrowed a little from Ironside, but it was still very original. <br /> <br /> This film inspired me to many films, and when I watch it, I see everything, from “The Killer Master” to “The Bloody Sport”. The most obvious film that was influenced was “To Kill Bill,” which for me is the greatest of all time. Many of the sets that Quentin used are exact replicas of those seen here, and he used the music from this film, although the music he used was borrowed from Ironside. And the fight scene at the end of Kill Bill vol. 1 with "The Bride and O-Ren" is sometimes accurate compared to the fight with Chi Hao and the Japanese thug at the end of this film. <br /> <br /> I have seen many martial arts films, even slightly better, but it is MANDATORY for fans of the genre. You can not go wrong here. The film starts slowly, but after 15-20 minutes it starts to work and does not slow down.
