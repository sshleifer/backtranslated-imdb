Back in the 70s, a little Texan director named S.F. Brownrigg directed several surprisingly decent low-budget horror films that seem to have developed a small cult after several years. Before watching his first movie, “Don't Look in the Basement,” I wasn’t sure what to expect, but damn it, I didn’t expect it to be the only Texas horror that, in my opinion, is better than the Massacre chainsaw. I don't know, maybe this is my favorite horror movie. <br /> <br /> We start in an isolated insane haven. At first, this seems like a fairly calm place for mental health, given that all patients are allowed to roam freely and a lot more, as if it was their home (probably so). none of them seems so dangerous, only delusional. Among the residents are a love nymphoman, a 700-year-old woman, a man-child, a spasm, a guy who thinks he is at war, a woman who thinks she has a child, and a guy who thinks he is a judge. One day, out of nowhere, the judge kills the doctor with an ax, soon afterwards the expectant mother kills the nurse. Ten minutes of the movie, and everything looks terrible. Perhaps the new nurse will know what to do, and then maybe not. Giving back will do more harm than good. It is better to immerse yourself in this, knowing as little as possible. If you can appreciate honesty before God without fear of horror, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you like Scream, if you like Wrong Turn, if you choose this extraordinary, overproduced, replayed digital Hollywood junk, then the chances are high that you simply will not see the beauty in this, Do not look in the basement, being the first attempt makes the quality even more shocking. The atmosphere and grain fit into the location and score like a glove. Unfortunately, the good old man SF He used most of his good ideas in his first film, although the next entry in his quadrillogy the size of Texas is a kind of masterpiece, that is, if you are in a very sloppy, mean, Hixploitation, like someone I know, If you fell in love in the first two, Brownrigg and absolutely have to figure out what else he could offer, see “Don't open the door” and “The house where hell is cold.” Do not look in the basement has everything you need for a successful horror, no stars, no budget, no digital effects, just an original story, embodied in an insane refuge, with a dozen actors and a gloomy, thin account and of course, a turn. This is a real horror for a real fan of horror. 10/10
