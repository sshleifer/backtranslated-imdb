Ich will be given Herr Hacke f√ºr den Filme. Mein Deutsch ist nicht gut. Enschuldigen Sie. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I did not know how diverse Istanbul sounds, despite the fact that I live in Turkey. Faith Akin and Alexander Hakke have different approaches to Turkish music. the fact that Istanbul and Istanbul music from the perspective of a foreigner gave real meaning to the music itself. <br /> <br /> In this film I learned how different our (Turkish) culture is, how interesting our performers are, and how much respect they deserve. Unfortunately, no one was able to show this documentary before.
