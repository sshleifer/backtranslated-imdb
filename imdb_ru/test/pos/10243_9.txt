The story line of “Thrush” is a simple story of unrequited love, which, despite the past decades, is still strong. Now 50 years old, Minako Obha (Yuko Tanaka) lives alone and works two jobs ?? one is a cashier in a supermarket, the other is a milkmaid, walks daily in the Nagasaki hills. One of her stops is in the house of Kaita Takanashi (Ittoka Kishibe), a government official who cares for his incurably ill wife Yoko (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita had seen each other as schoolchildren before, but after the death of Minako’s mother and Kaita’s father, who seemed to have a common romance, their own relationships were destroyed. Lying in her sick bed, Yoko knows, however, that her husband’s feelings for thrush have not completely disappeared, and after Kaita’s death, she is trying to think of a way to bring them together. <br /> <While the story may be simple, the emotions with which it deals, and the means by which it expresses them, are indeed the basis and beauty of the film. The film does not rush to show the simple daily routines of each of the characters, their actions are recorded by an elderly woman who writes her story for the book, looking after her husband, who is showing signs of dementia. This process describes the social circumstances of people from different lifestyles, how they interact with each other on a daily basis, how relationships are formed and how the past and the present can collide. The director copes with this surprisingly with a strong structure and visual style. Only later in the film does the story begin to follow a more generally accepted and inevitably melodramatic way, as if it were really created in accordance with the narrative structure of the written book. All this is confirmed by the emotional depth that the film touches on, most effectively represented in an exceptional performance by Yuko Tanaka.
