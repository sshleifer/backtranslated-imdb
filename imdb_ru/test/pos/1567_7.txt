This story is nothing special. A young woman steals money from a dismal Vermont supermarket, where she works, decides to flee to Florida, where he dreams of going to school with his girlfriend Julie, and meets a strange couple on the highway. If you remember an elderly couple from Baby Rosemary, you have an idea of ​​what these two look like. Bill has a funny face and is fired from the army. Sandra, a former stripper, has now become a prostitute, although we will not immediately find out. They are affectionate, helpful and full of common sense. <br /> <br /> They more or less adopt the girl Alice and promise to give her a lift in their complicated RV, although they do not drive directly. "to Florida. <br /> <br /> Here the film could be a hundred percent wrong. All the cinematographers needed to do was turn the elderly couple into the personification of evil. They take the virgin Alice (handcuffed to the bed or something kind of) and sell her body to any driver who has a lot of money and who loves rough sex. (Alice would have a hell of a lot of time escaping with a lot of unsuccessful attempts before the final shootout.) But no. virgin. Alice overhears Sandra with a client asks about the business and tries to solve the problem on her own. Bill keeps something from happening and insists that she does the job right if she is going to do it at all. They don’t tell her about it. They lead her. <br /> <br / > Alice earns a few hundred dollars, which is a few hundred dollars more than she had when she met a couple. Bill and Sandra keep their money in a safe where customers won't find it. Alice misunderstands. She does not find a pleasant job, and she thinks that she will never be paid, because every time she asks to be thrown, Sandra replies: “What? Not here, dear. In the midst of nowhere. However, after she was persuaded to hand the gun to Sandra, the couple gave her the money she wanted, and rather lovingly let her go to continue the trip to Florida. <br /> <br /> Do you know what I found the most tragic moment in the film? This has nothing to do with prostitution or theft. Alice was expecting a room with her friend Julie after her arrival in Miami. Julia is a legitimate student. But when Alice calls her friend from a place in Alabama to assure her that she is already on the way, but she is late, Julie hesitates and says: “Well, my mom does not think that you should live with us. And to tell you the truth, my roommate is not cool either. I invited you, of course, but I thought it was like a visit for a week or something. Go back to Milford, Alice "There is a long silence in front of Alice. <br /> Only one shot (several white frames of the film), and no one hit. Tears appear only once. No one else bites anyone. No car it doesn’t explode into a fireball either a musical score. There is a short male and female record. Goth, and it's embarrassing, as it probably should be. Alice is not unattractive, but she is not stupid. vivid memories. Nothing is lost. And all this was apparently shot and killed around Danbury, Connecticut. The city is remembered because I drove through it after one of its floods and I remember how muddy cars reached the door handles. <br /> <br /> I don’t know exactly what Alice is found. (I’m even afraid to think that the answer to the riddle is that "she found herself.") The game is not bad at all. Judith Ivy is better than that. It is definitely worth seeing, a quiet, orderly film that treats viewers like adults.
