As an adventure mini-series, it's about as good as it turns out. I watched it when it was originally shown on HBO. Sigrid is absolutely believable in his role as Philadelphia, and the whole performance was first class! Look at all 400 minutes, if you can. I highly recommend this mini-series. It's amazing that I can't rate it officially, but for you, readers / users, I'll let you know that this is a solid 10!
