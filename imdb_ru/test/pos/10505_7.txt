A strange ray of light penetrates Dr. Craig Burton’s bedroom (Arnold Vosloo) and his wife Sherry (Gillian McWirter) when they make love. About two hours are considered unrecorded, since they seem unharmed. Under hypnosis, during a session with a psychiatrist, Dr. Susan Lamarch (Lindsay Crouse) Craig discovers that his wife was impregnated with aliens. Sherry resists this notion as absurd and is very happy to tell her husband that she is really pregnant. Delighted with the fact that they tried to get pregnant for ages, Sherry is afraid that Craig will not be his fruit ... this is due to checking his low number of sperm cells with particularly high chances that he could not fertilize his wife. The embarrassing, embarrassing experience of the embryo inside her leads Sherry to some frightening discoveries ... her doctor David Weatherly (Wilford Brimley) discovers that the ultrasound gives some unusual results for a developing baby, but this is Craig, who notices that he looks like an alien! Sparks ignite, disabling electrical equipment, even disabling the pacemaker Wotherly! Through hypnosis, Sherry reveals the experience of her abduction, but Lamarche believes that her problem is psychological, not physiological. Nobody believes in the alien fertilization theory of his wife, and Craig turns to the sociologist Dr. Bert Clavell (Brad Dourif), whose job is to study life and abduction by aliens. But Bert doesn’t want to help Craig, who will go to the ends of the earth to save his wife’s life from possible harm. The tragic results occur when Lamarch and others try to keep Craig from his goals of “cutting the thing,” believing that he is crazy. Craig will still be performing his task, trying to carry Bert along this path with him. <br /> <br /> A dark, fascinating horror story about one man’s struggle to save his wife from harm to creatures that no one considers to exist. Fortunately, Dourif’s character is not a charlatan, but a clever doctor who wants to learn more, but his desire for truth about aliens is not hostile .. he hopes to learn from Sherry, but not incredibly picky about this Goal. The story is told realistically ... It is easy to understand why others may consider Craig to be an ordinary rocker. Voslo does not go too far behind the character, but expresses the suffering of his current situation. How can he save his wife from these enemies and prove to others that he is not crazy? McWirter deserves praise for the demands of the difficult kidnapping scenes, where her unfortunate character is naked on this table, being investigated and sticking to these things. Crouse is good at her limited but important role as a voice of reason in a situation where her clients seem psychologically out of control. Monster effects are unsightly and effective. I think the film works quite well, and the director Yuzna deserves credit for having at least restrained himself for this film. The last twenty minutes, during which Craig is trying to perform a “removal operation” with a frightened Bert, watching how the crazy situation escalates, bites a nail. <br /> <br /> You know, the fans of “Fire in the sky” can dig out this Flick.
