I watched the movie yesterday and really enjoyed it. Although there were a few clues that I realized after the second viewing, I could not wake the Dow Dawn case. Perhaps it was my inattention. The subconscious of the woman has become concrete with personalization. “Let me get out of the movie’s key sentence. Let me get out of the depths of your brain, and we will both be free. a film that makes human mind and brain constrained. Anyone who has seen the "Machinist", is aware of the similarities with the dawn. A person who could not escape his conscience (again, a psychological and abstract concept), meets him in a person. body. And he will simply be free from accepting and realizing that there is no way to escape. I also want to mention the performances of “shaving dawn”. Despite the fact that the actors and actresses to the director do not have much experience, they are all exhibited separately. reasonable performance that created synergies that would improve the quality of the film
