Most of Bridget Bardot’s films that I saw could not take full advantage of her charming presence on the screen. Unfortunately, she was given some really good roles in films of undeniable quality, which was a real omission. She deserved them and was able to demonstrate all her cinematic power when they came to her. Like Genevieve in “Love on the Cushion”, we had a clear exception to the trend of light, fluffy vehicles, as it was an interesting, feature film in any reasonable measure, and in it, the 28-year-old BB had the most attractive “Une Parisienne ”Is another one in which an extremely interesting Bridget in an interesting, carefully thought-out comedy tells how you can convince an ambitious male to remain loyal to an incredibly beautiful young wife. There are some good performances here. Her playboy husband, Michelle, is one, the "prince" played by Charles Boyer, the other, with the amusing efforts of a good cast. As for Brigitte Bardot, the way she looks in this film, I remember how she was a child in the fifties. She was 23 years old in 1957, and she was well ahead of her time, more beautiful than any other actress of that period, including Marilyn Monroe. Her seductive flirtatious sexuality, vividly demonstrated in several naked, tight-fitting dresses, just jumps out of the screen. She was more fashionable and cute than the women of America today, almost fifty years later. Obsessed with their careers and still desperately clinging to feminist politics, they come off like a bunch of ignorant lesbians. In contrast, the sex kitten was sexually liberated, intelligent, and clearly independent long before it became fashionable, but fully understanding the power of her exceptional femininity, she used it for a higher purpose than just personal interest — she believed in be in love. A still photo simply could not justify it. You should have watched her slim, but voluptuous figure (with a 20-inch waist) lightly cross the room. You should have seen this wild blond mane, looked into her big, brown, seductive eyes and listened to how her full, pouty lips spoke French. Close-up at the end of this film, she winks and flirts with the camera, her beautiful balls twinkle. What a baby! For fans of Brigitte Bardot "Une Parisienne" can not be missed.
