As another poster mentioned ch. 56 (a local Boston television station) showed it several times over the years on Saturday afternoon. They connected it with the first sequel, The Return of Ginat Magin. <br /> <br /> Now I have not seen him since ... ... but he never left me. Besides the brutal duplication and faded color, it was a pretty good fantasy. Technically, this is not terrible ... until the statue comes to life at the end. It is just a village ruled by an evil person. There is a giant stone statue there, which the villagers continue to pray to help them ... to no avail. But things have gone too far, the law comes to life and kills the bad guys ... but then he starts to go and get the good guys! Excellent with some cool special effects at the end (I really liked how he got rid of the main bad guy). Also there was an enchanted forest, in which there was also something interesting. <br /> <br /> Not a masterpiece, but an unusual combo-fantasy / horror movie. It is worth catching - but not if it is a duplicate print.
