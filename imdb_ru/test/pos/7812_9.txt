In A Minute for Prayer, One Second Before Death, Clay McCord (Alex Cord) is an unfortunate criminal with a generosity of ten thousand dollars on his head and degenerative epilepsy. <br /> <br /> Understanding that his days are outlawed, he desperately wants (albeit reluctantly) to use the amnesty given by the stern and run-down territorial governor Robert Ryan (excellent performance), who strongly wants McCord to give up action and took the amnesty as an example for others, while in the Bandit Center of Escondito, the criminal Mario Brega plans to kill McCord to prevent this. <br /> <br /> Also starring with Arthur Kennedy, Aldo Sambrell and many other European acquaintances, this is co-authored and produced (American) spaghetti — the western pioneer Albert Bend, also responsible for the preliminary film sands. " <br /> <br /> Although the decision of the protagonist's epilepsy is filmed right in Howard Hawks’s Dorado, the script is solid, rather fresh and unassuming. It has a great balance of action and history, and Alex Schnur is good. He really should have been a bigger star. <br /> <br /> In defense of a shorter (well-named) English version: I personally passed the age when the longer version is always the best version and ending where McCord is ironically shot by dirty bounty hunters after his forgiveness is unnecessarily nihilistic and completely destroys the message of the film about hope and redemption. <br /> <br /> Call me old-fashioned, but I rooted for McCord and felt that he deserved this happy ending!
