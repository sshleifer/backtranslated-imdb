This is a very successful example of a biographical film of the 1950s. He has a strong and handsome young hero - well, not so young on the screen anymore; Billy Wilder's excellent, albeit unlikely, direction; an incendiary fully organized musical score of billowing scales and, if necessary, Franz Waxman's heavenly strings; strong supporting players; exciting story; a terrific photo of the beloved Hitchcock Robert Burks; and the story of a special historical event. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Jimmy Stewart as Charles Lindbergh trying to get some sleep at a hotel on Long Island before his grand solo flight across the Atlantic from New York to Paris. And he can not sleep. <br /> <br /> The flight itself is full of memories of Lindberg’s personal history, as well as the purchase and construction of his unique high profile monoplane, The Spirit of St. Louis. St. Louis, Missouri, is the home of the partnership that sponsored the flight. (Even in 1927, money was spoken.) In any case, the film should have had a few memories and a story by Stuart. What is the Alternative Watching Unions? Thirty-three hours of observing Jimmy Stewart silently sitting at the helm of his noisy plane, and days and nights come and go? I found the script and direction impressive for their time. Unpleasant things, of course, are not counted, so as not to introduce more ambiguity than a modern audience could stand. <br /> <br /> I bet that the howling crowd that surrounds Lindberg at Le Bourget has ripped the plane to pieces for souvenirs, and, of course, nothing about the pilot's escape tube, although this would add more possibilities for humor. Some of today's viewers will find some incidents banal if they think too much about them. Above, Stuart talks to a friendly camping fly, who, in his own quietly worried way, wakes him up, landing on his cheek at a critical moment. Later, the medal of St. Christopher, which Father Hussman gently tapped on the glass crystal of one of his instruments, just as Stewart was desperately trying to land. Atheist Stewart is saved twice - once by a fly, and the other by God. <br /> <br /> But do not pay attention to it. This is an impressive movie. This landing at Le Bourget, with the exhausted Stewart behind the joystick, baffled by searchlights, sweaty from fear and falling from fatigue, is really convincing. “I'm going to tear this plane apart,” he says to himself, and we can believe him. <br /> <br /> Flying on a light aircraft is not at all like driving a car. There is no smoothly curved highway to tell you where to go, no lanes to provide guidance. You are busy every second. You should watch the instruments, check each wing tip to make sure that they touch the horizon, go into the nose of the plane and constantly watch the movement up, down and sideways, although this last would not be a big problem for Lindberg. He was alone over the ocean. <br /> <br /> Why? At one of the most popular moments of the film, Stuart and Murray Hamilton, two 1920s Gypsy barnstormers, idle around their planes in the Midwest region. "What is it? What makes us love flying so much? ”Asks Hamilton. (No answer.) Later, his financial backers are trying to dissuade him from flying. Five other pilots have already died trying to do this. “But don't you understand? This MUST be done, ”says passionate Stuart. <br /> <br /> Well, that’s not a good answer either. Why should this be done now, and why Lindberg? Why not wait ten years and stop wasting life in the meantime? The answer, dear Socrates, lies partly in our glands. Pilots - this is a calm and confident fate, from which awakenings sometimes occur. Their main problem may be dependence on the internal release of adrenaline. Just kidding. Some of my best friends are pilots. However, Lindberg must have been a real guy. He deserved to be treated like a hero. Not only because of the flight itself, but also because of its later behavior - a quiet, modest, family man. We can easily forget his admiration for Hitler, since he more than made up for it by testing the Corsair fighters in the Pacific and advising the fleet on how to tune the planes and get them maximum performance. <br /> <br /> See if you have a chance. If nothing else, this is a history lesson told with visual pomp.
