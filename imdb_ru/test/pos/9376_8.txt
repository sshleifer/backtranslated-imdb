Definitely a “must-see” to all noir film fans. <br /> <br /> Thanks to a thin script and a clear, sharp razor direction, the main cast joins and works like a well-oiled clock, creating a psychological thriller with a mad beat. . <br /> <br /> Remarkable characteristics express a strong message from a film about racial and religious tolerance. It is difficult and almost unfair to single out one particular performance, because there is no weak link in the whole company, but Robert Ryan, as a hated and cruel white supporter of excellence, is truly a frightening spine. <br /> <br /> Making this film in the 1940s would take a lot of courage. Now, all these years later, at a time when ridiculous abundance of obscene vocabulary, naked breasts, sluggish actions and deafening soundtracks predominate in modern films, it is refreshing to return to the basics of high-quality filmmaking with viewing pleasure like Crossfire. <br /> Another low budget jewel from the Hollywood archives.
