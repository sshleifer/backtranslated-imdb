I watched this show from the very beginning, and I am 45 years old. For me, this is much more than a show that attracts women. This is a family story, perhaps an unusual one, but nonetheless a family one. The focus is on mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive and in their own way successful women. Lorelei lives in the fictional Stars Hollow, Connecticut, a small town in New England with a sense of history and a population that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family. The show also adds the relationship between Lorelei and her parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore, people from DAR WASP with old money who disapprove of choosing Lorelei in life, although Lorelei doesn't care. Relationship history and a through line - this is what makes this show, in my opinion, the best on the WB network (it will soon become CW). Watch this show!
