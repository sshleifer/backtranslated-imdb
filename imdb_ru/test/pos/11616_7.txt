Well, it's safe to say that Subconscious Cruelty is one weird movie! Presumably, understanding the human mind, Subconscious Cruelty includes four creepy and bizarre stories about extreme sports. The first segment, titled "The Eyeball of the Ovary," is actually just a warm-up, but it's good at giving the viewer an idea of ​​what to expect from the next three segments. He simply sees a naked woman laid out on a table, while another woman smashes into her stomach and pulls out a human eyeball! I have no idea what's wrong, but it certainly does for internal viewing. The next story is the best of all, and it tells about the “old favorite” sore subject of incest. The segment follows a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister. He pushes away her pregnancy - but still he wants to have sex with her, and, naturally, he is seeking his own. This story stands out thanks to the monotonous story "in fact", as well as the finale, which can not but shock. This segment is well played, well shot and easily highlights subliminal cruelty. <br /> <br /> Naturally, the following two sections are not as good as the second; so the only way out is down, but director Karim Hussein still manages to pull something from the bag to the end of the movie. However, he does not do it right away, since the third segment is the weakest of the film, and he just sees how many people have sex with the earth. It is very surreal, and therefore remembered for the same reason; but it seems that this does not make much sense, and I was in the mood for something more painful after the second section. The film ends in full swing, however, although I'm not quite sure what was the point, the last segment shows the best images of the film. This segment is focused on religion, and, of course, not for those who appreciate it! Director Karim Hussein achieved something here - since this collection of four “extreme” stories does not unite into one, the film looks almost tasteful because it was shot in such an eloquent and effective way. The director seemed to imitate the highly respected surrealist director Luis Bunuel, albeit with blood, rape and incest; and if you ask me, he did not do a bad job at all. Not for everyone, but definitely worth paying attention to extreme fanatics!
