My local radio station PBS WHYY Philadelphia recently showed “Elegant Universe”. After three hours of viewing it, in addition to my brain hurting, I learned all about wormholes, quantum mechanics and parallel realities, and alternative universes. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the show was devoted to the physics of "string theory", the Half-new section of physics, which makes many ideas of science fiction not only possible, but POSSIBLE. With String Theory, it sounds like wormholes, alternate realities and alternate timelines, and it may be a matter of time until we get the knowledge to use them. <br /> <br /> Although it may not have given the New information for someone familiar with the topic, it seemed to me very interesting and informative. It was clear to anyone who only gets acquainted with this topic.
