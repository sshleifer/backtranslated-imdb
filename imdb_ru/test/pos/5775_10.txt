This film from what I remember was such a wonderful film! I watched it on TV when I was 11 years old and could not remember the name. If I remember correctly, I believe that it was a special TV Christmas movie. One of my friends at work, and I discussed it several years ago, but none of us could remember the name. But we remembered almost the entire movie. No one at work remembered ever seeing it! Thank God, someone on the site of a television movie responded to my post! Now I have a fun job of finding a copy of it! It's amazing that you can remember in childhood, but this film definitely remains alive in my head ... even after 28 years. And I believe that I watched it only once. Maybe it’s because I’m the oldest sister in my family, or maybe because I was nursing and working in kindergartens, it was stuck with me for so long. Regardless of the real reason, this is still one of the films that I really wanted to watch lately !!! If anyone knows where it can be viewed online or has a copy, please let me know. I would really like to see it again !!!! Thank! Seriously, I tried to publish it, and it says that my comment is not long enough. So, apparently, I have to print more, did you know that Melissa Michaels is Peter Billingsley's sister, who starred in “Christmas Story”? I know that I’m not the only fan of this film, so if anyone has any idea where to find it, I would be very grateful.
