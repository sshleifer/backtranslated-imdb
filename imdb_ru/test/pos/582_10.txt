Looking back at Jim Henson’s work years after his death, it’s like looking at another time. Unlike most of the so-called creative types who are trying to sell to children or, even worse, cynically exploit children, these days, Jim never seemed to forget what it means to be a child. And if there ever was a moment when he demonstrated this, except for the Labyrinth, this is the 1979 Muppet film. Filmed as an allegorical story about how Henson came to work for children's television as a puppeteer, and ended up with his own half-hour prime-time television show, the film Muppet ends with a statement about everything more progressive, understanding what the children who do not quite match the expected norm during the 1980s. And since we enjoy the fruits of an era in which we are gagged, and we cannot talk about anything so that someone does not take offense, here we offer an open celebration of differences or diversity, which made up most of the Muppets. I said it in other comments, but I have to say it here. The great light in the world went out that day when Jim Henson died. <br /> <br /> The Muppet film begins with an cast that sits to watch the premiere of what was to be seen in the next eighty or so minutes. In a word, we get acquainted with exact strokes both with the main players and with some minors. And when the real story begins, we are given a great song to bring us to the moment. "Rainbow Connection" painted a beautiful and sad image of who the dolls were, especially Kermit. These were not just puppets of felt with unusual personalities who came together to stage a show. They were living creatures based on the part of us all, they just wrote much bolder than we used to. Since each Muppet was presented to us in turn, we saw another reflection of ourselves, and, of course, the children in the audience reacted differently to each character. Therefore, everyone had a favorite. When the Beast appeared behind the drum set and tried to eat a plate, I realized that I had found one of my own. I’m currently a fan of a Swedish chef, but what the hey? <br /> <br /> In addition to the characters, a chain of musical numbers was presented, which further developed their motivation and personality. Can you imagine it? spoke about Dr. Zita and his group, as well as the creative soul of Henson. But the most suitable song for me was Gonzo's number, asking who he was and where he came from. Many of us spend our entire lives looking at the stars and, like Gonzo, say that we knew that we would return there someday. Not that all the songs were so serious, of course. Fozzy and Kermit share the number after they decide to combine their talent (or lack thereof) and hit the road. If it took any proof that modern “musicians” lost the ability to use the pop structure to create something that could be heard, this number would be like that. Never before and never again has the group dynamics of the cast and music so perfectly complemented each other. With the puppeteers and the voice actors who play excellently in their game, there is something for human composition. <br /> <br /> What makes it even more surprising is that the human factor also lived to the end of the transaction. Cameos literally pervade the film, and everything, from Steve Martin to Telly Savalas, comes in to offer their support. Even Richard Pryor, the last person you can expect to see in a doll movie, seemed to have a fun moment. Camel Mela Brooks is as disturbing to me as an adult, as it was when I was a little boy, but I suspect that this is because Henson knew why I was worried about it now. However, the great strength in acting is coming from Charles Durning, who, like Doc Hopper, embodies everything that both Henson and his audience are determined to resist. At each intersection, Hopper either offers Kermit a chance to sell off and betray his own kind. Or perhaps the proposal ceases to be the right word when Hopper's attempts to enforce Kermit are becoming more determined and violent. All this is one big metaphor about how each artist broke his heart with the world. <br /> <br /> Of course, Animal also appears to remind us that just because our friends are not sweet and pleasant, it does not make them less of a friend. In fact, Animal turns out to be Kermit's best friend at that moment. And this was the main message of every good show or movie in which Henson has participated since then. This dodging or dismissing others simply because of language or cosmetic differences can literally be the worst mistake ever made. There can be no doubt that in the modern world, where a moron in a purple suit can tell my sons that they are bad if they have not had good feelings for fifteen seasons and are still not seriously investigated by child protection agencies. Henson's workshop may never be off the ground. To incorrectly quote the name of the album, daring to be stupid is one thing, and imposing a choice on others is another matter. The film “Muppet” demonstrates how Henson dared to ask all of us to think both inside and outside the notorious framework. There will never be another completely like him, but he would never want us to stop trying. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the film “Muppet” is the epitome of the film of ten out of ten. If we sent the film into space to prove intelligent life that we are worth more than destruction, it would be so.
