This film is stunning ... so hard ... <br /> <br /> Cameos ... links to drugs ... sharing ... love ... rock! When Jack and Kyle first met at the Tim Robbins theater troupe "Actors' Gang" a few years ago, who knew what a legacy of amazing music and fun would follow ?? All these door-to-door bangs paid off ... <br /> <br /> Although anyone who loves classic rock will benefit greatly from this film, I would definitely recommend renting 6 HBO episodes in the original store. before watching a movie in a cinema. They are on the Tenacious D Masterworks DVD, which can be rented in almost every video store. There are some internal jokes in the film that relate to these earlier episodes that will add something more pleasant to the overall viewing experience ...
