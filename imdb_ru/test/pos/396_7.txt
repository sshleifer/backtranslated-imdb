This is another good westerner that I liked. This is not an epic or something like that, but itâ€™s good for what it is. This is about 3 fur hunters, led by a man named Jed, who is rude and uncivilized. Jed and his two friends turn out to be scouts of the fort, which is the only thing standing between them and the Indian group, who resent the Americans on their land and want to take them back. This is the essence of the story. Next comes action, excitement, even a little humor and a forbidden novel. One of Jed's friends, Gus, reminded me a lot about Quint's character (played by Robert Shaw) in the movie Jaws. They both have rude, rude behavior. You are a western fan, you have to find a lot to like about this particular post. I think it deserves 7/10
