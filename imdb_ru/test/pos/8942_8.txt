Wales seems to be releasing some unusual films lately. In fact, Wales seems to be developing its small film industry. I recently saw Very Annie Mary, which seemed very good to me. But “Plots with a View” are not only bizarre, they laugh loud and funny, they have surprisingly talented actors (Brenda Bletin is amazing) and the plot, which, although not quite original, is written so cleverly that it is always happy to pick up can be almost disposable lines. It was a film that I wanted to watch again, as soon as it ended, and one of the very few that I would like to see. Although many of the characters are caricatures, and you had to go to a Welsh village to appreciate it, they are also very human, and the connection between Bletin and Molina is a joy.
