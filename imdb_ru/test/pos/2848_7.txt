* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I thought the movie was funny. It was strange, and I liked it, I laughed a lot, so the point is that I recommend the film. However, I have a problem with what LaBut wanted to say. The plot is very simple. Betty (Renee Zellweger), a housewife with a hard life, watches her husband being killed, and, forgetting everything she saw, she follows her "true love" for the show's hero, the doctor. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough, but not enough, to spend a 95 minute film. And here comes the big question. What is the whole movie about? The reference to the "Wizard of Oz" is obvious. Betty and Dorothy are both from Kansas, however, although Dorothy comes to the conclusion of this film that “there is no place better at home,” Betty does not come to any conclusion and by the end of the film we can only wonder what she learned and the answer to it is simply nothing. It seems that she does not affect her in any way. <br /> <br /> How is the film different from reality and fantasy? it could be, but the scenes that deal with this subject are short and serve as nothing more than a joke, and not a serious plot line that can take the film to other places. (And, by the way, The Truman Show dealt with this much better). <br /> <br /> The film may be about obsession. Betty is obsessed with soap, and Charlie (Morgan Freeman) is obsessed with Betty. Labyut shows two sides of obsession, and he seems to forget that obsession in any form is dangerous and must be condemned. He seems to be sympathetic to Betty’s obsession because he considers her harmless. <br /> <br /> The whole movie we have scenes that in themselves could be the theme for the entire movie, but without it we could think about, without which they will affect the characters. <br /> <br /> The ending is just makeup, which has nothing to do what we saw before. It's a shame, because the film could be sharper if it concentrated on one or two subjects. a lot, but really do not say anything. <br /> <br /> We still have the feeling that we watched a small film, funny and strange, which could have been much more.
