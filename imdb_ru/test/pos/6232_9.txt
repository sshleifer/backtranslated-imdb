Perhaps one of the first Slasher films that came out after Halloween (although it was made from the Irwin Jabalance film from Halloween), I have to say that I honestly found the “Tourist Trap” scary and fun. “The tourist trap” is one of those wonderful pleasures that you find from time to time, and you have the most pleasant feeling of surprise. I told you that it was fate, but one night I was in my local blockbuster (one or two months before he stopped working), and I had nothing to get. Then I come across this movie, I think it looks like a funny B-movie, I shoot it and take it home, man, I was terrified. The tourist trap looks like a bad movie, it definitely has its funny moments, but in the end you’ll have to have fun with it to really take care. <br /> <br /> What impressed me as the absolute majority, and what made this film one of the worst from those I have seen, is number one. A horror movie without a good setting is not very funny, not here. I just love, love, love this place, the feeling that we can relate to it, almost the feeling that we were there before. What makes it creepy. Next come characters who are not truly stereotypical, and they all have a real personality. For example, they are not stoners, alcoholics or even people obsessed with sex, they feel like normal young people. Plus, they look quite realistic, and then this is Chuck Connors. The one who plays great in the role of Mr. Slausen, who also likes us a lot, because, again, he is so real, he feels like that nice guy, grandfather, whom we adore. The last and perhaps most important thing that makes this movie scary is how they make us (the audience) jump halfway from our seats and turn on the rights for the right reasons. For example, most of the time in horror films we basically just jump because of a sudden change in the musical field, but prepare yourself in the “Tourist Trap”, this is not so. With its perfect use of lighting, mannequins and weirdness, you feel completely scared. Plus I love it, because although they may be a bit excessive with some things, you still feel that this can happen. This is exactly what a horror movie based on such a mockery should do, and it makes us (the viewers) feel insecure and frightened. <br /> <br /> In general, as for serious problems, I don’t have them. Only that it is strange can sometimes become too strange. However, in the end, “Tourist Trap” takes a place that is close and dear to my heart, because it is one of the few horror films that makes me turn on the lights and feel insecure when traveling.
