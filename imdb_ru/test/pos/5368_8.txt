The young couple - Father Ben (respectable Charles Bateman), wife Nika (beautiful Ahna Capri) and their daughter K.T. (dear Jerry Raschl of fame I Dismember Mama) are trapped in a small California town populated by the desert with hysterical madmen. Worst of all, there is a pernicious satanic cult that kidnapped small children for their own diabolical purposes. Directed by Bernard McIvity, working on the original and inspirational script of William Welch and L.Q. Jones (directed by "Devil Times Five" Sean MacGregor invented a bizarre story), talks about an incredibly strange story in a slow but steady pace and skillfully creates an eerie, harsh, mysterious oog-boogie atmosphere. Stroter Martin demonstrates a surprisingly vicious and powerful performance in the role of Doc Duncan, who is a joyfully sinister leader of an evil sect. A high-profile cast of excellent acting characters qualifies as a significant asset: Jones is gruff, nonsense Sheriff Hillsborough, Elvi Moore is a friendly local Toby, and Charles Robinson is an insightful, fiercely devout priest Jack. The bright, polished widescreen cinematography by John Arthur Morrill, Jamie Mendoza-Nava’s eerie score and the wild, defiant climactic ritual of the black mass — all this also corresponds to speed. The idea of ​​making toys come to a deadly life is simply brilliant (the initial scene with a toy tank, which became reality and overwhelms the family in their car, is really amazing). Good terrible ambiguous ending too. Nice peculiar and underestimated winner.
