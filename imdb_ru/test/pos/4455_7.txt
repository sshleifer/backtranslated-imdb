Located in and near the poor working-class town in the mountains of rural Italy, this is a story of madness. The landscape can be quite picturesque, but there is a madness here, hidden under the mask of a man who seems outwardly normal. This man kills small children. <br /> <br /> In terms of style and pitch, this film resembles the famous Italian drawings of Dario Argento, these fascinating horror films, with the exception that Argento films look much better. However, the visual effects in the Fulchi film “Don't Try the Duckling” are competent, with some interesting compositions and lighting. Lightning and thunder on a rainy night reinforce uncertainty in one sequence, in which one of the ducks is vulnerable alone. <br /> <br /> In one sequence, the blood overdid it a little. But this is not a slasher. Legitimate theme supports history. And this topic is that insanity can take many unexpected forms, and not just the obvious delusions of people practicing voodoo or black magic. <br /> <br /> Numerous red herrings make puzzle solving difficult if the viewer does not presume an agenda from the director. Do not dismiss someone who may seem unsuspecting. A turn at the end provides good direction. However, in a halfway scene one could add a line of dialogue to clarify the relationship between two characters, one of whom is the killer. The film finale takes place on a beautiful mountain peak with a whistling wind in the background. We see flashbacks of clues and get an idea of ​​the killer’s mindset. <br /> <br /> I don't care about the widescreen projection of the film. But background music is effective and ranges from terribly creepy at first to low-key jazz, to local Italian songs. Acting is generally average, although in a few cases it is a bit exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Although not as brilliant as Jallos from Argento, “Don't try the duckling,” nevertheless, this is an excellent film that contains a thematic storyline and enough puzzle to interest most viewers who like thrillers and murder mysteries.
