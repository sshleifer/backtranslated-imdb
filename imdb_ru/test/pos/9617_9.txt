I first met this film in San Antonio, Texas. This film was the second. in double function. Unfortunately, the theater where I saw it was demolished. In any case, the Five Fingers of Death (aka King Boxer) was released in 1972 and introduced to the United States next year. Like many "other" Kung Fu movies made during the filming of "Tails" of "War with the Dragon", this film was really quite good. This is the story of a village boy who is sent to a martial arts institute to improve himself and his martial skills. Meanwhile, the martial arts school “enemy” plans and plans to prevent our hero from using dirty tactics to try to lead him astray and prevent him from taking part in the tournament. Surprisingly, I thought that since Warner Bros. distributed this film in the USA, Warner Bros. was going to release a DVD. It never happened. As far as I know, this film was released in both English and cantonic, with subtitles ... the latter is more "cleaner". Although it is a bit funny to watch the combat sequences (i.e. fly in the air and strike, jump on buildings, fighter, using your head ... literally ... strike the enemy, etc.) classic Kung Fu action perfectly planned and executed. If you like Dragon War, the Five Fingers of Death is a great addition to any movie collection ... if you find it.
