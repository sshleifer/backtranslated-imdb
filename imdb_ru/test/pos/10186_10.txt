This is the best Disney 3D experience in their theme parks. This is definitely better than their original film about a trip to the 1960s acid, which was in its place, a league better than “Honey, I cut the audience” (and much more fun), barely creaking from the 3-D MuppetVision at Disney-MGM and may even surpass the original 3-D "Movie Experience" Captain EO. This film relives some of Disney's greatest musical hits from Aladdin, The Little Mermaid and others, and brings a smile to my face throughout the show. This is a completely child-friendly film, unlike “Dear ...”, and has more effects than the exciting “MuppetVision”
