There is a great thing in the price tag of silk negligee. Bimbo in the office demonstrates the deal she received for $ 22 (close-up). Later, Mary Astor finds a tag in the boss's bedroom (proof that Bimbo slept with him). Later, Mary Astor is going to have an affair with Ricardo Cortes, looks at the price of HER silk negligee ($ 14) and reminds her how disgusting she was about pranks, and also that she spent $ 8 less than the “most obvious” woman, which she has ever met It sounds like an obvious moral change, but it was well done. The film would have been stronger if Robert Ames's character was played by a more powerful actor (he is too restrained for a self-made salesman, and he spends most of the film turning his face away from the camera), and if Ricardo Cortes was given more to do than to smile ironically. Both men's passages are soft and easily forgotten, and they are hampered by the pancake men's cosmetics, so popular in the era of this film. However, the character Mary Astor is interesting, attractive and believable. Behind closed doors worth seeing.
