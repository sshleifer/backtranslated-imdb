TEP is like a long, cool drink of water after it has crawled across the Sahara to classic film lovers who have been deprived of this particular cinematic magic for too long! Not only is it beautifully photographed, but the characters are perfectly portrayed. If you are looking for a movie that will become a mirror of the book, you will be seriously disappointed. On the contrary, this is an excellent “companion” for the book, and I think that this was exactly what Anthony Minghella had in mind. Ralph Fiennes is probably the most handsome man in the world; not to mention the brilliant actor. Juliette Binoche is the creator of vulnerability and children's enthusiasm. And, of course, I’ll go see any movie that featured Kristin Scott Thomas. She just has to be a better actress like Deborah Kerr. So much was promised with this film, and so much staged!
