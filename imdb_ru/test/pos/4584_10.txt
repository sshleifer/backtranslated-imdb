I never heard of this movie when a good friend recommended it. I trust the taste of this friend, so I bought a DVD. My wife and I sat down to watch him, not knowing what it was about. I thought it was the funniest film I have seen in a long time, mainly because I saw the truth in satire. I highly recommend this movie to all my friends. <br /> <br /> This film is not for everyone. Some people see coarse humor and aura of stupidity, and consider Idiocracy one of the most stupid films they have seen. It seems that these people do not understand that rude humor is present here not to cheer up the public, but to show what attracts morons in the future. <br /> <br /> Luke Wilson is a well-known "average Joe." He is basically there to be weak for harsh commentary about society, which is spread throughout this film. Many funny pieces are in the background, so they are easy to see several times. What makes the film even funnier and more terrible is that I see its elements in everyday life, in people I meet, or in the media. Then I go back and look at “Idiocracy” and understand how good it is. <br /> <br /> Those few who have seen this movie and enjoyed it can become part of an elite club. I will see an ad for a product with a new breakthrough ingredient, turn to my wife and say: “She has electrolytes!” She knows exactly what I am saying.
