Pretty funny stuff. Charlie was still working on his summit, when he spoke quite boldly about the soldiers in the trenches of the First World War. Brash, because, after all, the war was still going on, and it was a comedy about serious business. <br /> <br /> The jokes are funny, but not funny and not jerking. One successful scene follows another, as Chaplin and his comrades are trying to sleep in a bunker that is knee-deep in water. (That's where we got the term "trench leg".) Probably the most ridiculous episode â€” Chaplin is disguised as a tree and prevents any number of German soldiers from trying to execute an Allied soldier caught below the line. Edna Purvians, the main problem of Chaplin at the time, is a woman who collaborates with the Americans and is also saved from execution. <br /> <br /> Chaplin would continue to do more ridiculous and ambitious things, but this is better than most of his shorts in this earlier period.
