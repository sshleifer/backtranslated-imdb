When a saboteur explodes a controversial government research lab, two experimental animals are lost in a small community in Washington state. One of them is a dog with an unusual intelligence. The other is the "External Experimental Mammal of the Combat", or "OXCOM". For the reasons revealed in the film, Oksky hates a dog and tries to kill her. The observers relate to the random participation of Travis Cornell (Cory Heim), his mother Nora (Barbara Williams) and his girlfriend Tracy (Lala Slowatman) with the dog and ox, as two national security agents, Lem Johnson (Michael Ironside) and Cliff (Blu Mankuma ), track them. <br /> <br /> Many have commented that “The Watchers” are very different from the book by Dean Kunz, which serves as a launching pad for the film. It's true. But this should not affect your rating. If you want a book, read the book. Judge a movie by its worth, not by how closely it fits the book. Bill Fried and Damian Lee, who wrote the script, are the same artists as Kunz (this is not a comparison of quality, but simply a statement that they are all artists). Likewise directed by John Hess. Their job as directors is not to slavishly follow the book as if it were a script. They, as artists, adapt a book to make a unique work of art. This is based on the book. Not identical to this. When watching a movie, you should weaken your prejudices / expectations because you will experience a work of art that you are not familiar with, even if you read Kunz’s novel. <br /> <br /> So, “Watchers” is a good movie? It's pretty good, not great. Good enough to earn a “B” or 8. Hess starts things on his right foot with one of the most beautifully shot blasts I've ever seen. Unfortunately, he stumbles a little immediately after we listen to some very thick, slang exposure. After this scene, the “Watchers” threaten to become clichés of the 1980s, when we first meet with Travis and Tracy. <br /> <br /> The attraction to clichés is a constantly threatened threat. But this is only a bias. Most often, Hess can overcome the beaten-up territories with many interesting turns: both Travis and Tracy are from single-parent families with an inverted floor. Both have unique, mature relationships with their parents. Despite the fact that this is a horror film, the focus is on cute, intelligent dogs, and it often feels the same as an adventure film, as well as horror movies, thrillers or fantasy, and it affects all these genres. Hess is a large set of characters, some of which do not come to the end of the game, but the film is never confusing, and no character feels that he was left in the dust - all the threads are beautifully connected in the end. The structure is also complicated by the fact that there are two main villains, the second one becomes less obviously malicious as the film moves, until the turn, accompanied by brutal violence, clarifies one antagonist. Soon after, Hess gives us a good moment of doubt with another antagonist. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in my eyes is scary, common with horror films, at least since the 1980s, the “attack” scenes are shot too gloomy, too close, too out of focus, and they are edited too intermittently. Because of this, it is extremely difficult to say what is happening, which removes most of the tension from the scenes, which should be the main point. Of course, part of Hess's motivation for style, and this is a typical excuse for this problem, was the concern that the creature would look more humorous and / or fake than frightening and disturbing. In my opinion, presenting a dizzying spot to the audience is not a satisfactory solution. We can see the creature's costume / makeup only towards the end of the film. Well done enough for better shot and edited scenes of the attack to bring the film to at least 9. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the degree of correspondence between the novel and the film, Observers present a fascinating story using smart, alluring characters. This is often a nail bite, and horror scenes turn out to be wilder than you would expect, if not to say just horror (although there are a lot of blood in a couple of scenes). Observers tend to underestimate because of misconceptions about the role of the film when it comes to adapting the literature — don't lose sight of this and don't reject it in general terms because of the misconception.
