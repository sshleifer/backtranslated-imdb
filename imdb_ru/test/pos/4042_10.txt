First of all, I remember vaguely telling this story in elementary school about 6 or 7 years ago, so I’m kind of familiar with this story. <br /> <br /> However, a lot has changed, and there are a lot of differences and mistakes (sometimes unnecessary) in the film, which die, the fans will not appreciate. <br /> <br /> However, in general, I really love this movie. I first saw him around Christmas about 2 years ago (well, 1st part), and then all this was repeated last Christmas, probably on the same channel. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed, sometimes it can be a bit overworked and long, but with an exciting story, a decent game (especially from the frosty Foundations and Hobbs) and beautiful scenery, costumes and little strokes of magic make this film really special that for me really reminds of Christmas. <br /> Despite the differences from the book, I think the film has succeeded in incorporating new themes and ideas (seasons with Autumn, winter, etc. I think the new thieving character will represent autumn) in all images as soon as you notice, amazingly and brilliantly executed. <br /> <br /> I live in the UK, so I waited a long time for a DVD, and, fortunately, I saw an advertisement showing a series of free DVDs offered in the Daily Mail newspaper, which I usually can't do, so I received yesterday’s problem and finally got my DVD. If you missed it and want to receive this rare DVD for Region 2, I suggest you collect the Daily Mail tokens and send them, since your DVD will be delivered by Christmas. <br /> <br /> So for a little runaway this year’s Christmas season, light a fire, feel comfortable and watch it, since you and the children will probably really enjoy this wonderful movie. If you don’t have one, it’s likely to be repeated on channel 4 this Christmas, so write it down!
