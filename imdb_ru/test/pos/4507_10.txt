Seeing Alien, Not Fantastic, directed by Mark Forster, is the cinematic equivalent of eating your vegetables because this PG-13 rated epic art house is good for your movie going diet. No, this is not the film that I like to shoot on the couch and in the eyeball at the end of a hard day. Kite Runner is not your typical mainstream movie designed to entertain you and make you forget your troubles. First, celebrity stars do not appear in it. Secondly, nothing is cut and dried, black or white, or so outlandish that you will not believe the image you see. Thirdly, The Kner Runner turns into subtitles, when characters sometimes speak their native language. Fourth, the Forster film is not a romantic trifle about a boy who wants a boy and a girl, and then about a boy and a girl. Fifth, this foreign language film can cause you discomfort and challenge your assumptions about life, friendship and survival. The main topics here are cowardice and redemption. The main character commits a cowardly violation in the first half of the action, which he must atone at the expense of his personal safety and immunity. That's right, The Kite Runner is redeeming yourself for the sins of the past. We’re talking about personal responsibility, so don’t rent or buy this wonderful movie to celebrate a bachelor party or something that could pull the bad taste of the day out of your system. Based on Khaled Hosseini’s best-selling book, this culturally enlightened melodrama about the right and the bottom initially resembles one of those carefree teenage friendship films, in the spirit of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Sandbox. About half an hour from his 127 minutes this escapade with the participation of two young people who fly kites in Afghanistan, becomes dark and unpleasant. However, if you cope with the remaining hour of the plot, you will be satisfied, facilitated, and perhaps even entertained. <br /> <br /> “Kite Runner” opens in San Francisco in 2000 when our main character, Afghan immigrant Amir Yang (Khalid Abdullah from the United States 93) and his wife Soraya (Atossa Leoni from The Florist) get two boxes with publications of a copy of Amir’s first novel. As soon as Amir had the opportunity to bask in his life storytelling triumph, as the telephone knocks him out of the rut, he reluctantly returns to the past, which is best left forgotten for him. Raheem Khan (Sean Tobe from The Christmas Story) calls Amira from Pakistan to make a request. Rahim was a servant in the Amir family in the 1970s, when Amir lived with his rich Pashtun trading father, Baba (Homayun Ershadi from the Taste of Cherry) in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion. “You have one more chance to be good,” Amir reports, not covering his request with sugar. In fact, Rahim wants Amir to fly to Pakistan, and then drive into war-torn Afghanistan and save the young grandson of Rahim Sohrab (Ali Danish Bakhty Ari), who is held captive against his will as a sexual slave for Assef (novice Abdul Salama Yusufzaya) brutal Taliban leader and once terrible opponent of Amir. <br /> <br /> The Kite Runner moved from San Francisco in 2000 to an expanded flashback in Kabul in 1978, when life was idyllic. Twelve-year-old Amir (Zekiriya Ebrahimi) and the son of his father's servant, Hasan (Ahmad Khan Makhmudzade) love to watch films, such as John Sturges' magnificent "seven", when they do not fly kites. By the way, this is a kite, as if you have never seen flying kites. Not only do the children fly on them, but they also compete with other children to see who can cut the strings of another child's kite. The scenes of flying kites cause the same excitement as the scenes of fighting dogs in Top Gun by Tony Scott. Hassan is the best friend of Amir, but unlike Amir, Hassan belongs to the insulted Hazara minority. Earlier, young Amir and Hassan opposed the young Assef (Elham Ehsas) and his two lackeys. Assef was going to beat them, but Hassan took out his slingshot and threatened to use it on Assefe. Assef had no choice but to retreat. Meanwhile, Amir was ready to move the hand of fate. Amir Baba's father mourns the absence of his son’s spinal column and is afraid that he will grow half as a man because he is a coward, unlike the brave little Hassan, who saves Amir from difficulties. In any case, Amir and Hassan come out of the fight with Assef without a single scratch. Later, after Amir set a new record with his skills in flying and kite-fighting, Hassan runs for a kite to claim it. Hassan is the eponymous character mentioned in the title. Hassan is demanded by a fallen kite, but he is dominated by Assef and his two minions. Assef allows Hassan to keep the kite, but his henchmen make fun of Hasan by hiding his belly in the alley while Assef sodomizes the youth. Worst of all, the injured Amir is watching the attack from the side, but he lacks the courage to intervene on behalf of his friend, who would intervene for him. <br /> <br /> In addition to unusual kite-flying air scenes, The Kner Runner is practical, simple things. When Amir returns to Afghanistan to save Sohrab, he is disguised as a Taliban fighter, but he has no firearms. The rescue scene at The Kite Runner is very similar to the Midnight Express escape scene. While Forster does not study local politics and does not immerse us in the ethnic and cultural problems that are at stake here. Indeed, Troy screenwriter David Benioff should have excluded some parts of the book, and racial and ethnic prejudices are not clearly demarcated, therefore you should accept some things on faith. Forster made a film almost in China to give it a genuine look. Forster deserves praise for making this two-hour epic fascinating. Performances, especially children, are distinguished by their believability. Kite Runner is a movie that you will not easily forget.
