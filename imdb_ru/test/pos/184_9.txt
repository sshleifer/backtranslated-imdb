I watched this film last night at TCM, everyone was anxiously awaiting the last time they saw him (twice) in his memorable issue of 1957 in Toronto. I told my wife, who had not seen this before, to watch the exciting long follow-up shot, without cuts, where Veronica was spotted on the bus as she goes to find her Boris. In the manual frame, which certainly precedes the modern Steadicam, a shot is pulled back and pulls out (pun inadvertently) above the street when it gets off the bus and rushes among tanks to cross the road. Then I remember that without being cut, we follow her close to the fence, when she peers, looking for him with anxiety, but does not find him. But we continue to follow Veronica, as she is looking for the faces of the battered recruits and their emotionally hot women, all the extras, and each of them is the pearl of Stanislavsky's exciting behavior. It is interesting how Kalatozov and his operator Urusevsky created this unusual sequence. But what did I see in this version? After crossing the street, evading tanks, the scene suddenly ended and shrunk to a scene in the apartment, before continuing the way to the soldiers and their families at the fence. It seems to me that this film was not only restored, but also edited. What a depression!
