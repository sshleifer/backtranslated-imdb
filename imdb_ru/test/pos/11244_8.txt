This is a great show, despite the many negative user reviews. The purpose of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh. Two guys compete with each other to get the girl's phone number. Simply. The most interesting thing about this show is to watch as two males try to reach their goal. <br /> <br /> Some people seem to hate the show for various reasons, but I think they misunderstood it as an “educational” show on how to pick up chickens. Well, it is not, it is a comedy show, and the whole point is to make you laugh, not teach you anything. If you didn’t like the show because it doesn’t teach you anything, don’t watch it. If you do not like this whole club thing, do not watch it. If you do not like communication, do not watch it. This show is comic. If you look at how others pick up girls, this does not make you laugh, so don't look. If you are so disappointed in yourself after watching this show and realizing that you do not have the opportunity to “pick up” girls, then there is no reason to hate the show, just don’t watch it!
