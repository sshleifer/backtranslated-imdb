A sweet, rich girl from the valley begins to fall in love with a punk from the alley, and when her amateur friends disapprove of him, she is forced to choose between her heart and popularity. Very funny romantic comedy combines elements of black comedy and cheese of the 80s, which makes this viewing even more exciting. The film tells not only about the life of a girl from the valley and her punk; but her friends also go shopping, have parties, hang out and go to the mall. If the dialogue does not make you laugh without interruption for a week, the music will be. Songs like "Johnny, are you weird?" found everywhere. In addition, Elizabeth Daily is a funny, existential character, and the words of the graduating king and queen are fun at the end!
