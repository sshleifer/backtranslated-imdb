It was a movie that I ran into by chance. I flipped through and saw that it was on Showtime, so I watched it. Now I watch it at least once a month. This is a movie that is filled with characters that can cause some people to spoil it. Do not listen to people who hate this film, if they want an action movie with the road x / x, they had to rent a film that promises them. If you are in the mood for good science fiction, I highly recommend. When buying on DVD, I recommend the Alliance Atlantic film edition; it contains much more add-ons than the Dimension Films edition.
