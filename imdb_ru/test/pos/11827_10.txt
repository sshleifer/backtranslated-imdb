This is one of the best and funniest comedy shows I've ever seen! All characters are great. <br /> <br /> Mr. Slatt (David Bamber) is a very very annoyed person, annoyed with everything and everyone. <br /> <br /> He wants to do things and cope with situations as well as possible, but he never gets it right and only gets himself deeper and deeper in trouble. Not supported by his wife, Janet, who is only trying to get deeper and deeper into the troubles into which he falls (and in fact she does not need help at all!). <br /> <br /> All the characters play / portrayed brilliantly. Just imagine that you send your children to such a school. <br /> <br /> It’s incredible that people don’t like it (maybe some don’t get a lot of play with words that appear many times per episode). <br /> <br /> It's also incredible that there is still no DVD release. Only 2 series! <br /> <br /> So please let go, let go! So fans can and will enjoy it! <br /> <br /> Try it, you might like it !!! <br /> <br /> Several names and words from the series: Pumpman, Man Helmet, Hot Bitch, Mount Susie, Travis Fellatio, Kokfoster, Aarshed (and many others).
