I went to watch this film with my family, who was expecting a neat convincing story such as “Mr. and Mrs. Jer”, and they returned home completely disappointed. So this is a warning to all lovers of "convincing stories." to stay away. 15 Park Avenue does not seek to answer questions or offer moral decisions about how to deal with the mentally retarded. Moreover, his intention is loud and clear. It casts doubt on every person’s sense of reality, normal or not. I even doubt in my self-evident sense of sanity. Security, slavery, satisfaction that I find in my present, whether I really am or how it really creates the illusion that we all desperately and sometimes ignorantly cling to just to falsely console an abandoned “meeting” exists in all of us? So why does Anjali make such a manic moment to demonstrate her fortitude when she is really concerned about the realization that she is becoming a monster? Do not all of us think that we are “normal”, truly monstrous and helplessly vulnerable at heart? Isn't it better to be happy even madly than to create the impression of “normality” by suppressing your fragility? Meethi boldly, madly, sincerely does this. and society calls her "schizophrenic." The end at first embarrassed me, but then you realize that Meethi’s boldness and sincere faith led her to where she wanted to go. I searched, not caring that the society should comment on its searches. and these seemingly “real” people - Anjali, a psychiatrist and jojo - who never go anywhere. My family thinks I'm a schizophrenic too, trying to understand the film, which is pretty much “crazy” for the rest of the world. Anyone else want to believe in my sense of reality ...........?
