This excellent musical film, in the wonderful Technicolor, is so wonderful that it is enough for every person of Irish descent to feel pride. Full of joy and celebration of everything, Irish, a wonderful cast, with brilliant settings and excellent theatrical attributes, wonderful Irish music and the superb Irish tenor voice of the star Dennis Morgan, the Irish are lucky to have such a wonderful film to enjoy again and again! Notice, not only for St. Patty's Day, but for the whole year. <br /> <br /> One of the jewels made by Jack L. Warner during his heyday as head of a studio in Burbank in the 1940s. /> <br /> Warner Brothers shame for not having this beautiful picture on home video and on DVD!
