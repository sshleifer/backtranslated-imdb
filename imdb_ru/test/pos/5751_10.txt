I can't even imagine why everyone hates this film so much. I literally cried several times with laughter (“I hope you slept well?” “In fact, we had a bit of a hard night.” “Ah, the danger of adultery.”) <br /> <br /> admittedly, the ending is a bit flat, but it still has its moments (the obvious fake surge of the ball of Bolger, when it flew into the ocean, “beach house paradiso”). <br /> <br /> I personally think that this is the funniest film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
