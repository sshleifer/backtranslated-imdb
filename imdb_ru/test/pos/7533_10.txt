“Nagisa no Shindobaddo” or “Like Grains of Sand” is an amazingly beautiful story about boys and teenage girls, dealing with becoming one with who they are. This film is not about homosexuality, but about sexuality. <br /> <br /> Ayhara, a detached girl, will definitely make the audience think about who is behind the detached girl. Does she love Yoshida? Or does she love Ito? Or did she somehow become a lesbian because of the "incident"? (I doubt it.) <br /> <br /> What about Yoshida? Does he understand that he loves Ito in the end? Well, we all know that he loves him as a friend. But you will never know when you see this film ... haha ​​:) In the end, Ayhara (along with Ito) conveys an exceptional message to the audience: it does not matter whether you love a boy or a girl, And I must tell you I am so dense that at first did not understand. ^^ ;; This is due to the fact that there are generally no conversation scenes ... You should try to understand what the characters think and say through their actions, NOT according to what they say (especially the final part ... phew, man, it knocks confusing!) It's a complicated story, but, nevertheless, it is beautiful. :) This film is definitely one of the best Japanese films I have ever seen (and believe me, I have seen a lot).
