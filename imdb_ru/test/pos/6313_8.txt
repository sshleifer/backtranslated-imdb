Although I fully agree with the previous comment about the wonderful role of Tony Servillo in the role of Titta di Girolamo, I would also like to add excellent filming and editing that turn this film into a picture. The young director Paolo Sorrentino had the courage to experiment with various types of cameras that reminded me of Requiem for a Dream by Darren Aronofsky. They both used the same MTV style in combination with modern (alternative / techno) music, making the film ?? Le Consequenze dell'Amore - stands apart from other criminal / mafia films in its genre. Even though the film can start with a very slow, almost “second” compared to a faster Hollywood performance, it should be liked because of its serenity, amazing character and great ending. Definitely need to see people who love European / Italian cinema. PS Tony continues to behave like this, we need an encore.
