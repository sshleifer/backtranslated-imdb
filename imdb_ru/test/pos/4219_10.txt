I know that this film is not for everyone, and I will not impose my opinion on you, but I have to tell the truth about how many people relate to this film ... It was the best I've ever seen! !! It was very funny, and although it was not the scariest film that I had ever seen, he did not give me rest, because I did not know what would happen next. If you like funny scary movies, be sure to watch this one!
