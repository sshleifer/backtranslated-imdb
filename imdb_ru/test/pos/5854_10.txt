This is a great, intense, mysterious film about murder. Not only was the plot full of tension and intrigue, but you can see the magnificent Ryan Gosling for a couple of hours, why not love it! In addition, Sandra Bullock is good at this film - I have always been her fan (I just wanted her not to decide to go to Lake House, which was terrible, but that's another story). Obviously, since there are thousands of other murder / horror films, there must necessarily be a similarity between them, there is no need to make this film, since it looks like at least a few already shot. In any case, this is a great movie for those of you who really like “scary” movies, it is a bit gloomy and perverted, but overall a great movie !!!
