Charlotte Beale arrives at an isolated mental hospital in the country to become a full-time nurse there. She is faced with a motley group of crazy and seemingly crazy observer. Is Dr. Masters all that she seems? <br /> <br /> DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT - one of the best low-budget films in this genre, and why people always shoot it, I can't do it. The game is excellent, my favorite performance is Betty Chandler as Allison, a nymphomaniac. Chills just jumping right from the screen. You probably don’t have to say “This is just a movie, this is just a movie,” it’s not so scary, but any horror fan who respects the low-budget horror genre should like this, which I do. It is very difficult to make a creepy movie with a small budget, and few actually succeed. AX is another cheap film that is looked down upon. Perhaps people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any film that doesn’t have excellent effects and / or is not considered a classic has no chance for an audience. But I think that after people see this film, they will see how important the low-budget horror genre is, and this film is a classic that stands out among all the other rubbish.
