There are films that are just another version of the other, not remakes, but just like others, this is not true. Although it speaks of the mafia, it is followed differently, and often it seems to be a secondary topic. I went to watch this film for the occasion (because the theater of the other was full), and I was pleased at the end. It surprised me because of its black irony or cynicism, and there are more and more interesting items to analyze. He does not follow the classic ways of cinema, he is just different, and I think that he is not the only one who likes it. I am very happy because it is Italian, and I was afraid that Italian directors and producers would not be bold enough to change the subject. In this film, you can also watch the new Italian style, but not blocked in the clich√©. I hope that it will be clear enough, I know that it is difficult, I also hope that this film can be taken out of our country, this is a good product for export. I also want to mention the music, a very good soundtrack, the film needs it because of its long silent pause, and they blend perfectly with the music. Many compliments to the director, and thanks, the movie needs these films.
