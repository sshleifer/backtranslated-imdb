Billy Crystal - Larry, a writer who did not write and is suspected of being killed in the movie “Throw Mom Out of the Train,” in which Danny DeVito and Ann Ramsey are involved. The phrase "black comedy" was coined for this insanity, which is Hitchcock's takeoff "Strangers on the train." In fact, Owen (DeVito) had the idea of ​​Larry killing his mother in exchange for Owen killing the former Larry after watching this famous movie. “I saw the movie. Criss Cross, ”says Owen Larry. Not that Larry knew what he was talking about, until it became clear that it was already too late - just like “Strangers”. Larry, a letter teacher, claims that his ex-wife, played by Kate Mulgrew, stole his book and put her name on it. She became a big celebrity by appearing in Oprah, where she calls Larry the "beast." Owen in class Larry. He lives with an abusive Neanderthal mother (Ramsey) and sees how he is poisoning her by sticking scissors into her head - you call it. Soon after seeing the Strangers on the train, he ended up in Honolulu, pursuing Larry’s wife. While she leans over the railing of the boat, trying to get an earring, Owen stands behind her and sneaks up ... Soon the police are looking for Larry to interrogate him, but he is near Owen, where he is encouraged to live to the end. to bargain he had no idea what he did. You know, criss-cross. There are several scenes copied from "Strangers" that are very funny. I especially liked the recognition of Larry before the sleeping Mrs. Lift, Owen's mother, like when Guy thinks she is talking to her stepfather Bruno. <br /> <br /> Crystal and DeVito are full masters of comic dialogue and time and will make you laugh often out loud. Ramsey is disgustingly funny - absolutely "there" performance. Kim Greist and Rob Reiner also have roles — Greyst is Crystal's girlfriend, and Reiner has some kind of cameo. <br /> <br /> The ending is very clever, and the whole movie will make you laugh.
