I watched this film for the second time in three years, and it was just as wonderful as before ... <br /> <br /> There are more than a dozen modern fabulous French films from en couer de hiver to three colors. trilogy and they are all special. This film is one of them. The true delight of so many wonderful things that follow him from respecting Hitchcock to two beautiful ladies in Roman and Monica. While Monica is very beautiful, Romana is a very sexy woman and steals many of the scenes in which she lives. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why people think this film is confusing, because the scenes are the perfect combination of the past and imagine yourself acting as a counterpoint to the characters' most wonderful journey the movie follows and you are barely understand that 116 minutes of beauty and mystery have left an enchanted and bewitched sight. <br /> <br /> As in many French and European films, this story will never move across the Atlantic, as no studio can capture magic without stifling its life, thanks to the Hollywood bleaching characteristic of most films that are lost. when translating. Americans are making brilliant films, but not of this type ... maybe if they allow someone like young Polanski to work on it, then maybe they won't completely undo the English version ... <br /> <br / > For those who do Not watching movies with subtitles, you will spend your whole life in ignorant bliss. For those who can read, you would spit on yourself to skip such films ... <br /> <br /> I would describe it as neo-free-noir, but only to withdraw a reviewer who called this film elite. I think I saw him make an addition to four and twenty cakes. He thinks Roman Bringer is a type of French mayonnaise ... It is skillful in the sense that artistic reading is skillful ... but with a lot of Gallic favorites ... <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 with each view ... and somebody got Romana's phone number ... she's the perfect French salad dressing ...
