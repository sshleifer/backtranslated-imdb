“Two Hands” is a good addition to the Australian film catalog. <br /> <br /> This is a curious mixture of real life, surrealistic life, comedy, tragedy and love that the Australians have developed on their own. <Br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is basically a good, naive guy. Wanting to rise, he falls with a local Pando boyfriend (Brian Brown). But at the very moment when he embarks on the dark path to crime, he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). That is the reason for the mistake to change your life in unexpected ways. After accidentally hitting the wrong side of Pando, things get worse very quickly, and if it were not for some otherworldly help, it would be a short, sad film. Yes, Jimmy learns a few lessons in life, and no one will escape the wounded one way or another, but at the end he had a pleasant feeling. Although this story has a theme of lawlessness, it is not glorified and helps show how destructive a crime can be in ordinary life. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is great, like Jimmy, innocent and quick-witted, Rose hypnotizes how Alex and Brian are amazing as usual. This small set of characters is plausible, and it seemed to me that I care about good guys and do not like villains. <br /> <br /> This DVD is usually in a cheap hallway, so I would recommend adding it and it would be well-spent money in my DVD collection. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
