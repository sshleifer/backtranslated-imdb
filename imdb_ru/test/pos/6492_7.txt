In the August Days / Dies d'agost, Mark Recha gave us a sun-filled Catalan documentary in the style of a road film, which is basically a tortuous, improvised meditation on brotherhood and the return of the dead. Beautiful, sometimes large-scale, richly atmospheric 35 mm. Landscape images, a good soundtrack and the Catalan narration captivate as part of the mood, if a person is satisfied with the trajectory, which does not have a large dynamics and leads nowhere in particular. Film director Mark Recha and his non-identical twin David are stars, and the story is voiced by their younger sister. Mark explored the life of Ramon Barnils (1940–2001), the editor of the Socialists, who was a family friend. He felt that he was saturated with information and had to take a break. The break turned into the creation of this film, which seeks to convey the mood of interviews with Barnils's colleagues, reflections on the Spanish Civil War, the drought season they are experiencing, the turbulent landscape, the Recha brothers affection for each other, swimming and tanned nudity and any characters or stories they encountered when they camped out of their van. This leads to the pursuit of a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers. In the end, David must return to Barcelona to be with his daughter, and Mark must return to his project, and there he ends. It was interesting for me to listen to the extended narration in Catalan with its combination of Spanish and French words (possibly related to Provençal?). It is not a major film, but it attracts attention and makes sense as the choice of a film festival with its pure visual and auditory beauty and its ability to play with genres and mix autobiography with fiction and documentaries fresh and thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> The official selection of the 2006 New York Film Festival at the Lincoln Center.
