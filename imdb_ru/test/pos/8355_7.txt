Well, firstly, this is not a bad movie. This is good, and I like the characters presented. In this, I also prefer the voices of Lady and Trump. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to see Lady and Trump more. I know that Scamp's Adventure is written there, and I love Scamp And Angel to pieces, but this is a continuation of the original where, in my opinion, they should have just released it as Scamp Adventure, and not Lady And The Tramp II. : The Adventure of Scamp. <br /> <br /> Tramp had his own role, but he didnâ€™t have much time with the Lady. <br /> <br /> But in any case, the songs are pretty good, and Scamp and the angel are sweet. I saw the best sequels, but hey, this is not a failure. <br /> <br /> I give it 7/10. Very good, but there were still flaws.
