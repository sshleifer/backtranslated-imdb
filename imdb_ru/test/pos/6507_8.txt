The omission of Jezzie Jeff, the creator of tweets and scratches on the transformer, raised a few eyebrows, but it's nice to see that he still got into the statistics of the DVD. With SCRATCH, Doug Pry, who previously chronicled the 90's grunge phenomenon in HYPE (1996), made an excellent documentary about the world of hip-hop DJ and Turntablism evolution. His latest documentary, INFAMY (2005), explores contemporary American graffiti culture. After a couple of views four years ago, my DVD has been gathering dust since then, but I recently watched it again, and, besides the subject material, I was surprised at how well this documentary was shot and edited. Very nice soundtrack, and not only talking heads, but also a lot of music, old school frames, parties, break dance, you name it. One of the best things about the film is that it mainly explores where the art of turning a helicopter is today (that is, in 2001), without ignoring the pioneers, of course. Good things. <br /> <br /> Camera obscura --- 8/10
