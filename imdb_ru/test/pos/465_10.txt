One of the BEST films I've seen in a very long time. Bechar has a way of looking at things that are absolutely unique, and this film does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> In this film, you will guess everywhere, and with seemingly taboo themes facing him you will be chained to the screen. There are no bad guys or good guys, Beshard is sure of it. The characters are so complex that you feel for each of them, you care about what they went through. <br /> <br /> Beshard’s use of attention to detail is unmatched in this world of “FAST FOOD FILM”, and although some of them may be uncomfortable because of some topics, you like the feeling it gives you. <br /> <br /> I heard that they too often say that there is no need to tell NEW stories. Thanks to Gorman Beshard for proving that this is a lie. <br /> <br /> Run, do not go to see this movie.
