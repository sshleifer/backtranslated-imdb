I just watched this movie in preview and I can only recommend it to watch. It lasted about 90 minutes, and when it was over, I felt that it could go on for hours. The stories of the main characters are so realistic that you feel at home. The film consists mainly of dialogue, but I was not bored for a minute. 18 people are really different characters, and each of them played so well. I had to laugh, feel awkward, sad, and still feel happy. Overall, this is a film that shows the different types of people in our society, the way they communicate and how love has changed, and is now viewed as an economic thing. Dating becomes something like an audition. The whole public loved it. Therefore, please see if there is a possibility. You will love it!
