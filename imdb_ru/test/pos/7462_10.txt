This is a great movie. I read a brief synopsis, and I was not impressed, but when I watched it (mainly for Caroline Dhavernas), it grew on me. <br /> <br /> This is such a pleasant change - watch a movie where girls / young women are not punished for their sexuality. Girls are given a full license for research and even the opportunity to make mistakes without absurd consequences. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are absolutely funny - and many of them - presumably erotic scenes - that were not excessive or unpleasant. The male characters in the movie were great - David Boreanaz was great as a volatile piece - and it’s great that the movie doesn’t make us hate it so much. Two other young male characters were also good, not being overbearing. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best films I have seen in which girls grow up, and it gives you the opportunity to see how they realize their mistakes. but, in the end, come and continue to live your life, rather than drag your mistakes along with them.
