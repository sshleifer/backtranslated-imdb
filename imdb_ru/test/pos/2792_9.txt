My wife and I watched this amazing movie this evening, because tomorrow we will watch “Russian Dolls”, and the first is important to see before the second one. <br /> <br /> We both fell in love with the apartment “Spania” and will be happy to see some characters through the first years of their lives - now in St. Petersburg, Russia. We both identified ourselves with the rough frame of history, because we were students, for us Florence, Italy, so the script was not completely alien to our young people. Our life was significantly different, but, as in this film, every time you collect young people going through the same life cycles as people of any developed world, they face the same life situations. <br /> <br /> The totality of people and the personal difficulties they encountered were universal, and this is the beauty of this film and, probably, its sequence, which I will see tomorrow. As I wrote, the characters, as well as these situations are familiar to all of us, and therefore we can enjoy their life for a while. This should be one of the strengths of the film - to allow the viewer to noticeably experience the emotional upheavals of the people involved and at the same time stand aside. Through this distance, the viewer can laugh at himself, thinking: "I would not do anything stupid" or "I would avoid this trap." Maybe that's why we go to the movies.
