This wonderful BBC three-part production is one of the sweetest love stories I've seen lately. Actresses demonstrate a very high level of talent, especially Rachel Sterling as Nan Astley. She is funny, seductive and cute. The love scene and close kisses are very erotic, regardless of sexual preferences. <br /> <br /> Characters are clearly defined and believable. I think this is a by-product of a good adaptation from a well-written novel. <br /> <br /> A truly wonderful, well-developed drama that quickly picks up speed after a couple of boring (but necessary) scenes at the beginning. <br /> <br /> My vote: 9/10
