I really loved this movie! Since I do not want to give a lot, it mainly concerns the mother and daughter and their life together. This is a very touching story between the struggle that they have. I also think that Natalie and Susan have the perfect chemistry throughout the film! It is definitely worth a look! Two thumbs up!
