A photographer in the small town of Gunsan in South Korea discovers that he has an incurable disease, but he exaggerates the seriousness of this disease for his family and friends. We will never know the nature of this disease, but the main thing that was in the center of Hur Jin-ho's sharp first Christmas in August is not his disease. This is the grace in which he spends his life - his ability to accept what life has left, without remorse. Unfortunately, it was the last film made by cinematographer Yu Young-Kil before his death, and the film is dedicated to his memory. <br /> <br /> Photographer Jung-won plays Hana Suk Q, at one time the most popular star of Korea. A handsome man of thirty with an infectious laugh, he is so warm and full of energy that it is difficult to imagine him close to the end of his life. Jung-Won owns a small photo shop and lives at home with his hearing-impaired father (Gu Shin) and sister (Oh Ji-he), teaching his father how to play movies on a VCR, and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he will die. While Jung-won doing his daily activities to restore order, Dar-im (Shim Yun-ha), the meter reader, comes to his shop with an urgent request for some photographic magnifications. <Br /> <br /> Sharp and impatient, he treats her with contempt, but then apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without the explicit expression of romantic feelings, their relationship is becoming increasingly intimate. Love is not what they say or do. This is their basis of existence, the place where they come from. To protect Dar-im from suffering, Jung-won does not tell her that he has only a little time left to live, but this does not make things easier for her. His inevitable absence in the store inevitably leads to the fact that she feels deceived and disappointed to such an extent that she throws a stone in the window of the store. Although Jung-won’s decision to conceal his illness from Dar-im is questionable, it seems organic to his character in the film and is not used merely as a plot device or an excuse for the character to “live life to the fullest” by playing around. <br /> <br /> One of the most touching roles in the film is when an elderly woman returns to her studio to take a memorable photo. Jung-Won makes sure that the image is an exact likeness, knowing that he will soon make his own picture of memories. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resort to melodrama. It's about having fun at the usual moments: ride a bike, share jokes, eat ice cream, be thoughtful and attentive, and feel good about what life has to offer. This is a love story, where love means having to apologize. Although there have been many films about the process of dying, Christmas in August promotes the genre in a new direction and, in the process, offers an unforgettable comment on the human condition. Unfortunately, this film about death is the experience of the greatest joy.
