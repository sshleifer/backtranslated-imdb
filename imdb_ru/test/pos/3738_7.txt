Eyhard Gere and Diane Lane again in another romantic love story. They are a great team, BUT, anyway, this film will not be among the best, <br /> <br /> Director George Wolfe, using the script of Ann Peacock and John Romanao for the novel Nicholas Sparks, does an excellent job. This is another story about two strangers who meet and fall in love with each other, then they go there, then, when they are going to meet again and start a life together. <br /> <br /> SPOILER, but not quite. Tragedy happens, one of them dies. <br /> <br /> How many times have we seen this. <br /> <br /> I hope those who have never seen such tears will like it more than me. This story has all the clich√©s. <br /> <br /> The only reason I have ratings, I will give. This is because of the wonderful action and excellent production. In addition to our 2 stars, the cast includes Christopher Meloni, Viola Davis and Scott Glenn. they all give really good performances and do everything possible with the material they gave <br /> <br /> There is a good but not complete sequence of storms, sex scenes are well done, no nudity and almost no foul language, <br / > <br /> Ratings: *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 out of 10)
