I have been a fan of Rachel since the beginning of the 30th anniversary of the Food Network, so I saw her grow over the years. The minute I saw her interacting with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen because I saw how Oprah was perceived with her, and for good reason: she looks very natural and ready to laugh at herself, which is very interesting, the Set is attractive, and there are some fresh ideas (I like the lazy Susan, on which the audience sits). The celebrity segment is enough, and it avoids controversy and debate (this is enough on daytime television). The show is a carefree escape, and she has not departed from her strength (cooking), which is a very good planning. I know that there are people who hate her and hate her show; all right, you can't please everyone. And anyway, I think Rachel knows and accepts this. So just turn on the channel; I don't think she will object.
