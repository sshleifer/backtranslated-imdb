Deepa Mehta's “Fire” is innovative, courageous and artistic. Great social commentary on the plight of women from conservative Indian middle-class families. This movie no one should miss. Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das give star performances, underestimating their characters as much as possible. A.R. Rahman's music is the work of a genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film. Mehta uses Rahman's account, and together they create such amazing sound montages that effectively reflect world views around Radha and Sita when they turn to each other for support. This film is not about lesbianism, as many have branded it. Lesbianism is only part of the film. Unfortunately, most people tend to write off the film, calling it a taboo, instead of giving it a chance and look at its real meaning.
