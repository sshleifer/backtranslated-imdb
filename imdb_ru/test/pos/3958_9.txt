Films belonging to the genre of “film noir” usually contain similar elements: the plot twist “deus ex machina”, which impetuously drives the protagonist into bedlam, a pretty but psychotic girl, a beautiful but psychotic gangster, a lot of money, a lot of cruelty and usually a junction in the desert. Think: "High Sierra" or "White Heat." <br /> <br /> There are a lot of bad hard-boiled films. But when the film noir is good, you can not look away from the collapse of human lives. <br /> <br /> It is this last tradition that belongs to the “Blind Spot”. The film tells about Danny Alton, a troubled teenager (superbly played by James Franco, who is deeply immersed in this role with depth, grace, emotional integrity and frank lament), falling in love with the rough Darcie streetcade. /> <br /> From the very beginning you know that it will be bad. <br /> <br /> Darcy invites Danny to his home. But the house is empty and put up for sale, and a bloody check for thousands of dollars lies on the floor. Danny is deprived of his clothes and possessions, but he uses a check to track down suicidal April - another Darcy lover. When they reach the real Darcy house, they find Wayne - the thug hunting Darcy for the money he stole. Together, the three manage to find Darcy in a dusty abandoned motel in the desert. But this is only the beginning of the story, as plastic explosives, drugs, weapons, a creepy funeral home, bisexual killers and a lonely semi-finished product in the desert lead events to an explosive head in an alley near the tattoo parlor in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> This film presents the best noir cinematography I've seen in recent years. In one scene, Danny races across the desert to a semi-finished product in the desert, where he believes Darcy could be picked up by gangsters that evening. A very long shot with harsh light effects shows Danny - hands and feet tremble, perceptible fear corrodes his face (visible even at such a distance), a dust cloud stretches behind him when the wind beats in his direction - rushing along the desert plains to the house. The loneliness, despair, despair that Danny feels is shocking. In this film, many of these scenes, wonderfully created by an experienced Maximo Munzi. This is Oscar stuff. <br /> <br /> Editing is also amazing. In the film there are small moments when the characters get an idea of ​​themselves or their situation. Bits of time when memory and feeling come back. At this time, quick mounting images flash across the screen. This is excellent editing by editor-in-chief Stefan Voloschuk. In an early montage, Danny describes the amazing feelings he now has when Darcy entered his life. Danny's quick diary images flash across the screen: the words "4 lives", "lucky ones" and "safe" stop momentarily, and page by page, the contents of the human heart, swings around the screen - not in focus too fast to read. It’s like a stream of emotions that Danny himself feels. <br /> <br /> The flow of images reveals something else in this film: how beautiful is the production of Nathaniel Waters. Darcy House is the perfect combination of high technology and carelessness (a tribute to the scenery designer Kimberley Foster). Awesome scene in a deserted house just awful. Destroyed motel, where Darcy is hiding, can be found in any abandoned small town in America. An eerie (and strikingly lit) funeral home, where the plot takes a terrifying turn, blends gloom with a pale death hanging over the entire film. (It is unfortunate that the film director is not credited.) This film has an excellent design that improves each frame and the performance of each actor. <br /> <br /> This is the fourth element of this film that makes him grab you and hold on to you: acting. James Franco is a great actor. Even in Spider-Man, where practically nothing was done to him, Franco showed that he understands human emotions like no other actor of his generation. He is not handsome, who flaunts like Brad Pitt. Franco portrays deep emotions with full force. His speeches contain a pure human heart. Consider the scene in the phone booth near the funeral home where Danny falls, telling April and Wayne that Darcy is dead. Smaller actors could not endure a person’s complete emotional breakdown. Franco does it. <br /> <br /> Sean Montgomery in his first film simply amazes with his performance as a suicidal April. Deeply in love with Darcy, suffering from severe depression after she had to bury one of her unborn children (after a spontaneous abortion) in a perfume box in the forest, her life in luxury and perfection is now ruined: April is one of the best. the drawn characters on the film that I've ever seen. While Danny’s relationship with Darcy is slowly revealed during the film, April’s nervous breakdown is revealed only to viewers. Neither Danny nor Wayne show any particular interest in her as a person. The April despair, when she realizes that Danny was also Darcy's lover, is sharp and strong, even if it is cut off due to the character’s complete inability to feel any emotions for a very long time. Montgomery brings pathos in April that permeates your heart. <br /> <br /> Mark Patrick Gleason is given the hardest work in the film: Wayne, to make something real and human out of the bandit. At first, Wayne is simply one of any number of violent, mud-obsessed, obsessive pusher / gunsmith addicts who appear in any number of films (from “Kindergarten Policeman” to “Beverly Hills Policeman 2”). Gleason is very good at what they give him, but he doesn’t quite get to the place where you really love Wayne. It is difficult to say whether this is a Gleason problem or a material. There is one thing - when Wayne (who is Darcy's brother, although neither Danny nor April knows about it) reads Danny’s diary and is aware of the sexual and emotional connection between these two men - when you just know that Wayne is going to be a homophobic Danny's Ass. But the explosion does not occur. (Thank God! Banal plots are death for a film noir.) As soon as the revelation about brothers and sisters comes at the end of the film, viewers are rather surprised to realize the depth of love and compassion that Wayne really felt for Darcy - so deep that Wayne accepted Homosexual Danny's love for his bisexual brother. But all this is happening behind the scenes. Gleason is never given the opportunity to play out Wayne's feelings. It must have been a very frustrating performer. <br /> <br /> The story is rather inventive, although the contraband device seen at the end of the film will probably remind viewers of “Diamonds forever” (yes, James Bond). Traditional voice-overs (which proves that Franco is as great as the actor-physicist and voice talent) creates an amazing atmosphere, although, as a rule, it goes several times to the end of the film (providing some unintended laughter). ). Stunning places play key visual roles in the film. Kudos to a scout location for finding such amazing buildings! The end of the film struck me as a bit hasty; not a pat, but a little too hard for my film noir. <br /> <br /> Now I have seen viewers who either hate or love the Blind Spot. The modern cinematic audience, subjected to extreme cruelty and violence, often does not appreciate the subtleties of the film noir. I propose to take a small group of friends who do not consider laughter a hopeless, emotional collapse, despair or depression. Take them to a small theater, where they may become famous for seeing a movie’s vision, but where they will not be watched by a crowd of people who don’t recognize a good film noir. Give them some popcorn (believe me, they will be so absorbed that they will not finish it), give them a soda, and let them be amazed. Go to some bright and joyful place to wash the dirt from your soul. Since this film is so good that it makes you feel, you will need this restorative tool.
