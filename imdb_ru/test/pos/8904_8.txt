... but I was laughing. Lots of. <br /> <br /> I saw Astérix et les Vikings in a public show during the World Cup. The sound was lousy, it was too bright to see the screen correctly - but I still enjoyed it immensely. The names of some of the characters made me roll on the floor: Smsix, Abba, Vikea ... It's not very witty, but in the good Astérix tradition. Some very good jokes, but also some that did not seem to get everything. <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn’t like was the voices of Asterix and Obelix, at least in the German version. The voice actors here are very well known, and this was the only reason they were really cast. They do not suit characters at all. <br /> <br /> In general, a good way to spend some time (and if it's free, as in my case, all the better) and have a couple of laughs. 8 out of 10.
