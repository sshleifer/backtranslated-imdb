It must have been that the sale of this storyline began back in the 40s. The epidemic threatens New York (it is always New York), and no one takes it seriously. Someone might say that Richard Widmark and Jack Palance did it better in Panic on the Streets, but I disagree. <br /> <br /> In these productions of “Poverty” there is always something that really touches the nerve. Production values ​​are never so perfect, and the action is a bit rude, but for this very reason I think that this film and others like it are effective. Rough, grainy, sharp. And the cast. All 2nd stringers or actors from the list after their prime. There is no ego. These people were happy to get a job. Whit Bissell, Carl Benton Reed, Jim Backus, Arthur Space, Charles Corwin and Reed Hadley's melodious voice, flowing in the background, like crude oil. By the way, I was in the hospital a couple of times; why my nurses never looked like Dorothy Malone? In such films, they don’t really care about makeup and hair, but they did manage to turn Evelyn Keese into hag. Or maybe they just missed makeup and hair. In any case, it was quite effective. She plays a smuggler in love with a gemstone smuggler who takes away a case of smallpox in Cuba, while smuggling the jewels back to ultra-villain Charles Corvin (who in the meantime is cheating on his sister). You have customs agents looking for her because of gems, and the Department of Health is looking for her because she is going to relocate New York. No 4th amendment rights here. Everyone is having difficulty. <br /> <br /> You must have the right attitude to enjoy such a movie. I have a brother who studies films to death. If they do not meet his standards, Orson Wellian, he mercilessly bomb them. They should have the directing superiority of the film David Lin, Wolfgang von Korngold's scores, Sound and The Art of Douglas Shearer and Cedric Gibbons, respectively. This is not true. <br /> <br /> But I have the right attitude, and if you do that too, you will love this movie.
