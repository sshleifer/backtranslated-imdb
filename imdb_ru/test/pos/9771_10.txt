I saw this drama on cable television. Although I only saw two episodes, I love this drama. I am waiting for more TV series to be released via cable. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it describes the terrible and ridiculous situation in the prison camp, this film shows us the indomitable spirit, warmth, friendship and humanity. They do not know whether they will be able to survive or not, but they have greatly retained their hope, not giving up on misfortunes. <br /> <br /> I know that this film is not as realistic as other military documentaries, but I don’t want to blame for that. It makes me believe in the strong will of people in the most difficult situations. <br /> <br /> “Private Bill”, especially this episode, touched deep in my heart. <br /> <br /> I remember every scene. I always hate math. But after seeing this drama, I can understand something in mathematics ... Mathematics is his connection between the past and the present, also symbolizing eternity. <br /> <br /> "Time, light and memory are enclosed in a circle." <Br /> <br /> Like the other victims of the war, he lost his lover for an irresistible fate. I am immersed in his time and memory, as if I had experienced the same thing. <br /> <br /> He suffered a great loss, but he has a pure passion for learning. <br /> <br /> He began his studies in the camp, his joy in awareness, <br /> <br /> I believe that his dedication to study supported him. <br /> <br /> I have seen it several times, but the meaning of this film never disappeared. Every time I see it, I feel the same deep emotions. <br /> <br /> * Their songs are beautiful, harmonious, <br /> <br /> I am very sorry that I can not listen to OST.
