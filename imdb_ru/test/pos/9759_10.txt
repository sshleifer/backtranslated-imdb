Jean Paget, Joe Harman and Noel Strachan are all unlikely heroes and survivors. A small but powerful Jin, whose strength and determination help save lives, overcoming hundreds of miles and possessing calm self-discipline and persuasive abilities, Joe Harman (“oh my word”) who risked Jin and other prisoners only to suffer the worst pain you can imagine, and Noel Strahan, who trusted Jean, no matter what. Her good humor and stamina inspire everyone around her, and those who have the courage to go with her are rewarded. Beautiful scenery and music adds to the adventure. Despite the length, I have never been bored. These ordinary people did unusual things, and this is based on a true story. Someone borrowed my VHS a few years ago, and I never saw it again. Learned my lesson, buddies, and buy another copy when it can be found. It's a shame, the miniseries are not on DVD.
