I felt obligated to comment on this film because it is listed as the fourth most popular science film with the lowest rating of all time on IMDb. WHAT KIND!?!? Of course, this movie is crappy, but it's funny! It's not terrible at the Ed Wood level, it is more surreal and uneven. <br /> <br /> There are a few classic moments in the movie. Brain surgery is rude and healthy, and even more crazy if you consider that the film received a PG rating! Gore chases his cart, and then battery acid pours onto his face - "Mine! Give it to me!" Zandor Vorkoff’s speech at the beginning of the film: “Before Amir, Kali was just another weak nation fighting for liberation from centuries of stagnant feudalism!” Angelo Rossito also has excellent features: “No, Gore! No! ”“ You want these keys, don't you, my charms? ” It is absolutely wrong that this is the 4th film with the lowest rating on IMDb, because it is FUN. No matter how bad a movie is, if it can still be strange, bizarre, disturbing, or interesting, it has its merits and does not deserve to be abandoned and rejected. I will not defend most of Al Adamson’s films, but this one, along with Dracula V.S. FRANKENSTEIN and BLOOD OF HORRIBLE HORROR are interesting enough to fill their horror.
