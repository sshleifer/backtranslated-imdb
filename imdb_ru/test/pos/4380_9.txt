It takes a rare film to get better every time you see it. Oh, Brother does that, and then another. When I first saw this, I must admit that I had never seen anything like it. Then I wanted to see him again, and now I am going to make a double digit in this wonderful film, the best film of the Coen brothers, which they have ever done, with Fargo and Hudsacker Proxy, which come second and third for me. br /> <br /> George Clooney talks about his career as Ulysses Everett McGee, a quick-talking fluent know-it-all who really doesn't know anything at all. Tim Blake, Nelson and John Turturro are Clooney's ideal assistants, especially Nelson and his portrait of Delmar, a loyal, though uneducated, escape. John Goodman is my favorite character, like Big Dan, great. It reminds me of his role in Raising Arizona, he is just the perfect actor for this role. Favorites Cohen brothers Holly Hunter and Charles Durning also give unforgettable performances. <br /> <br /> Joel and Ethan Cohen are masters of their craft. It’s not that they try to win an Oscar every time they shoot a film, they just try to tell the story they want to tell, and that’s interesting. This is a free adaptation of the Odyssey, and I mean free for all of you Homer's fans. This is just great. <br /> <br /> The most amazing part of this film is the coloring. I watched them feel soiled in the film, and I still loved it, just thinking about it. Coloring really becomes an important part of the film. Great great movie.
