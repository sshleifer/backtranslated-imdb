I entered Hunting Night, not knowing what to expect. I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is a mystery / thriller, where this girl, who does not remember anything, is saved by a guy who is passing by. They become good friends and lovers, and together they try to figure out what is happening to her. Through some vague memories and dark memories, they eventually reach the point, and the finale is pretty cool. <br /> <br /> I really liked the setting: a deserted, postmodern Paris - a background with lots of gray sky and tall buildings. Very metropolitan. Great soundtrack and nudity. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, this was done in 1980; it seems a little ahead of time. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 children.
