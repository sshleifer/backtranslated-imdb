One comment said that this is not a comedy ... Error! It was a delightful comedy of the period of history, which is not suitable for this genre. Very busy ... and active film from start to finish. Often the shots from the train or car window were just perfect. A nice way to spend a couple of hours in the theater. All French historical figures, such as Charles de Gaulle and PÃ©tain, as well as some of the people involved in the French Resistance, were included in a scenario that could send those unfamiliar with the collapse of France during the German invasion, who may want to explore. The characters were attractive, and the actors portraying them were excellent. Recommend 9 out of 10.
