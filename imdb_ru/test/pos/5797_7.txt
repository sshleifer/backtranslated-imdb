In Russia, an ordinary teenager Vera (Natalya Negoda) lives an entertained life with her drunk father and simple mother, not working and not waiting for a call from a technical course of a telephone operator. Her brother Victor (Alexander Negreba) lives in Moscow with his family and sometimes visits his dysfunctional family and Vera, always motivating disputes. When Vera meets a university student Sergei (Andrey Sokolov), they fall in love with each other and decide to get married. Sergey moves to Vera's house, but lives in conflict with his father. This relationship leads the family to the tragedy. <br /> <br /> I just saw “Little Faith”, and I really liked this deep family drama. I am not familiar with the way of life in the former URSS, but there are some unusual behaviors that I found very interesting. The first is when Victor tells Vera that she was conceived not because her parents wanted her, but because they wanted to move to a big apartment. Another one when the family goes to the beach by truck. Many of the difficulties of the family of Vera and their friends, repression in the park and other situations depicted in the film are common in the third world countries. This low-budget film is very well directed, and the story is very deep and real. The cast has excellent performances, and actress Natalya Negoda is very beautiful. On the cover of the Brazilian VHS, released by Sagres distributor, there is information that Natalia Negoda was the focus of Playboy magazine. I'm not sure how accurate the subtitles are in Portuguese, since many long sentences in Russian are limited to a short translation in a few words. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): Peckeno Vera (Little Vera)
