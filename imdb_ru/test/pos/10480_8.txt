If you find that the first 30 minutes of this film are going so slowly that you wonder why you are watching it, do not give up. In addition, listening to the Danish language is a bit new for most North Americans who do not see or hear many Danish films. In any case, as the movie progressed, he became better and better, and the viewer was rewarded for his / her patience. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of the movie “Out of Africa”, this film aroused my interest because it was based on the short novel of Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), the main character of this film. <br /> <br /> The dish of Babette’s feast was delicious. I am not a cook, but I was impressed! The way someone interprets a story can also be different, I suppose, depending on how much you read about it and where you stand in religion. If the latter, then how you look at the definition of "legalism" can affect how you interpret this story. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is a good film, but do not watch it if you are on a diet. ,
