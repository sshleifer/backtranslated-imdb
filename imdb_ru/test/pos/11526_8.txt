I like it. I just sat out half of the Glass House (turned it off ... God, what a swamp of predictable plot and bad game), and then I saw this film. I thought it was awesome. Both Cameron Diaz and Jordan Brewster were loved there. I liked the flight of the whole situation, traveling around Europe in the 60s, but they made it more realistic by showing the dark side and all the bad things that could happen. It held my attention completely, even if I really thought the pieces were incredible.
