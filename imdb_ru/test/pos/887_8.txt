I saw the film at its North American premiere (July 14, 2004) at the Fantasia festival. I was a little disappointed, as I was expecting a more epic, ensemble film based on “The Warrior of Musa”. Instead, the film concentrates a much smaller number of characters. However, the film was solid, thoughtful, and visually intriguing. There were some drastic changes in tone from the dominant thoughtful and realistic tone of embarrassed loyalty, intrigue and blood compared to lighter, brighter martial arts sequences. It seemed that the filmmakers could not decide whether the film should be a “martial art” or a historical epic. History well addresses the need for loyalty compared to the need to adapt to new situations. Is it really worth your life and the lives of your friends to be faithful to your master, or is there a moment when you need to submit to the winds of change? Maybe there is a lot of courage to leave the old ways for new ones? How to solve? These questions are raised in this film, and ironically, there is an assumption that this answer may in fact be wrong!
