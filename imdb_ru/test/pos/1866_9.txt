I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Real husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly play the role of Charles and Emma Darwin in the midst of their struggle through writing and deciding to publish The Origin of Species. Their consideration of the implications this may have for their family and the future of humanity is transmitted in such a way that it can be suspected that only a couple of overs can achieve this. <br /> <br /> John Amiel (who gave a feel for the introduction) and John Colley also do an excellent job of translating Randal Keynesâ€™s biography. They created some very bitter and human moments, great cinema and sets and generously insincere about the still controversial theory of evolution. <br /> <br /> Surprise star Mart West, who plays Annie Darwin, the character around whom most of the story unfolds. She plays an early young girl in a T-shirt. If this performance is worth playing its star, it should be on the rise. <br /> <br /> In general, an excellent film, and although this is a historical drama, the problems that promote it are still very much alive today.
