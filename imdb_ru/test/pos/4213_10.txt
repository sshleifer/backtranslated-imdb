I guess I was about ten years old when my uncle took me and my brother to watch this martial arts film on "DRIVE IN" on the circular road in Long Beach. The name was “HAMMER OF GOD”, from which I can never forget for some reason, but I remember how different scenes were forever imprinted in my memory. <br /> <br /> My brother always reminds me of the movie, although it was forever, it seems, since we saw the movie. From time to time discarding years, I looked for it in rental stores, and from time to time I checked on the Internet, and for some reason it seems that it is never available, or nobody knows which movie I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If I only knew whether it was available, I would gladly have bought this film. If anyone knows about its availability, please inform me.
