I don't cry easily because of the films, but I have to admit that it brought me to tears. Although I am not a Miss Strip fan, her performance was excellent. The name defines in the sentence what mother's love is. During the first hour I didnâ€™t like any of the characters, but with the development of the film, everything changed. The film also explains why some marriages continue, although there are obstacles. Must watch a movie.
