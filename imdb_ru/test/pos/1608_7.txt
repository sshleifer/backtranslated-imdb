In the film Lucino Visconti “Death in Venice” decomposes not only the beauty of the surrounding world, but also in pursuit of the very beauty Gustav von Ashenbach turns into a simple human envelope. To understand decay, we must recognize the beauty that fascinates us, best described and explained in the Socrates quotation found in Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice: “Only beauty is beautiful and visible at the same time” is the only aspect of the spiritual that we can perceive with our feelings, otherwise what if the divine, if reason, virtue and truth must speak to us through feelings? Shouldn't we perish and become obsessed with love? "We see in the film that this is exactly what is happening, a man is gripped by longing for beauty, which turns into longing for a boy, Tadzio. Despite the fact that the balanced part of his mind tells him that adoring beauty can lead to sensuality and leave him, he could not restrain himself. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to describe it as a beautiful film; we soon see the extravagance of the salon, and we turn to the ideal generalization of the life of the upper class at the turn of the century, and this is perfectly captured on film by Pasqualino de Santis. But Visconti does not indulge in the picturesque aspects of Venice. Instead, the glorious and sensual artistic achievements of the past are based on materialism and sensual beauty, and these things are a thing of the past. A city that we know has incomparable beauty and uniqueness is nothing but as a holiday resort with curious hotel staff. Streets turn into exhausting labyrinths filled with disgusting mud and rot, the city disintegrates with the main character. Only through memories we can understand why this famous composer is a weak and harmless person. The death of his daughter and, presumably, his wife, along with the failure of his music, allow us to understand why he is destroying himself. <br /> <br /> Alfred, with whom Ashenbach talks in detail about the meaning of beauty and can create it; but Alfred is more than a friend, he is Ashenbach's alter ego, and what Alfred says expresses the composer’s own doubts and fears. Behind the scene, in which Ashenbach decides to leave Venice, immediately follows the clip of Alfred, in which he says that he is weak, alienated and lacking feelings. In the end, we can conclude that these memories are not at all reality. This is a decline of memory, and not an objective display of the past; these memories become distorted memories. We can say that these are shattered memories, because even Ashenbach cites this, he says, “reality distracts and humiliates us”; and, following the scene in the travel agent's office, we see Ashenbach confront Tadzio and his family and warn them to leave Venice, but immediately after the meeting we see that he is sitting with the clerk again and realizes that all this was in his imagination, he hires long scenes without dialogue, which are created by the sharp music of Gustav Mahler. It allows the mind of the viewer to wander when we observe how the life and respectability of Ashenbach merge with the beauty around him. <br /> <br /> Gradually, the viewer realizes that our hero is struck by exhaustion, which is mixed with the growing awareness that the city is choking with dirt. The collapsed city creates the ground for the attraction of a middle-aged man to Tadzio, this is a romantic desire for something so idealized and ambiguous that it can never be eaten, even in fantasy. The beauty of this Polish boy lights a fire in him, which at first makes him glow and then absorbs him. The film ends with the fact that von Aschenbach sits weakly in a lounge chair and watches Tadzio fight with his friend. We see how the black paint from his hair flows down his cheek, and it looks like rotten blood. until his last breath. The final decline occurred, the city around it was stained, and with his help he became what he hates. When Ashenbach dies, he has the same painted face as the old man on the ferry at the beginning of the movie, the man who bothered him. It was the pursuit of beauty that led to its decline, in pursuit of artistic beauty, he could not sense his own death and the death of the city around him; his sensuality indulges, although it is constantly controlled by the presence of death and decay. It is these three themes that bind together the Damned and Death in Venice: beauty, death and decline, these themes are the art of Visconti, the beauty of his works is in the decline of beauty itself. <br /> <br /> In this film we relate to the disintegration of one great man. We see the honored composer Gustav von Ashenbach in the pursuit of true and pure beauty, and it is in the pursuit of this feature that it decomposes around him and leads him to a miserable, lonely death, following the goal of his love. I believe that with the help of these films Visconti is trying to tell us that what is beautiful cannot last for long. Degradation is inherent in the world around us, and when we are distracted, it can destroy splendor. In “Death in Venice”, all because of culture and because of the pursuit of beauty is removed. Beauty and promiscuity are woven, like thorns in the works of Visconti, both beautiful and destructive, it is these themes that define his art.
