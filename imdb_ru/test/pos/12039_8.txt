This is not far from the garbage that Bollywood usually does, but there is something really good about it. <br /> <br /> The title track is one of the best in Bollywood, and it follows everyone. This is one of the films (along with “Baazigar” - you definitely need to watch a Bollywood film) in which Shah Rukh Khan starred, and for that you have to check it out. <br /> <br /> Other reviews give the story - it's a pretty simple idea - ShaRukh definitely stands out, and one of his latest expressions right at the end made me give this movie an extra star. <br /> <br /> It's pretty stupid, but definitely worth seeing if you are new to Bollywood or not! 8/10
