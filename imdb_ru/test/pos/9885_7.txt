In the film “Departure,” Peter Falk plays an elderly New Yorker who calls his children home so they can be with him before he plans to commit suicide. As the film progresses, we see all the flaws and other problems. While some people may interpret this as a “soulful” film, I liked most of all that the character of Peter Falk does not allow him to belittle anything, and even from time to time gets drawn into a little obscenity. <br /> <br /> So this may not be the best movie, but worth watching. I thought for a long time that Peter Falk has the perfect look to play such a role as with his glass eye and all that. Also starring Laura San Giacomo, David Pamer, Judge Reinhold and Shera Danes (Falk's real wife).
