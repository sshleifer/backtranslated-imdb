Michael Haneke is known for his exciting films, such as Fun Games. This time he took on Elfriede Jelineks "Die Klavierspielerin", which is probably her best work at the moment. Jelinek always writes about violent behavior in families, and especially about the suppression of women in a patriarchal society. <br /> <br /> Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) works as a piano teacher at the Vienna Conservatory. She still lives with her mother (Annie Zhiradot), they even sleep in the same bed (already a hint of something strange). Erika picks up her student as she mocks her mother and secretly watches porn movies and plays sadomasochistic games with herself. A student, Walter (Benoit Magimel), falls in love with her, but she refuses to just sleep with him. She wants to play his games with him, but he is disgusted. He reluctantly follows her rules, which means disaster for both of them. <br /> <br /> Haneke has a very clear language of pictures, everything is removed almost Spartan, so complex characters and history are improved. <Br /> <br /> People who do not know Austria very well may not understand how important the setting is for this story. Jelinek (like other great Austrian writers such as Thomas Bernhard) suffers from cold and accident in Austrian families and society. Austrians (at least, residents of Vienna) often cannot articulate their pains, desires, they suppress their emotions, so there is often no real love, affection and intimacy in their families. In a society where it is more important to show the perfect façade to society (even if it means defending crimes in the family, when Erica and her mother defend Erica’s rape from Walters to avoid a scandal) founded psychoanalysis in Vienna. Erika has a cold and distant relationship with her mother, they are only very tough and do not like at all the time when they share some emotions. Erika replaces her hidden emotions with a desire for violence so that she can finally release some of her feelings. But she has no one who really wants to talk about her emotions, so in the end she must stab herself to ease her inner pain. <br /> <br /> Isabel Huppert shows her best work in her career (as well as most other actresses). With an unsmiling face, you often see only hints on her face, a quick smile, a look with her eyes. And at the end of her pain is masterfully displayed without a single tear. <br /> <br /> Benoit Magimel and Annie Giradot also participate in powerful performances, but the film belongs to Huppert.
