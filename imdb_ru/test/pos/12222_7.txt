This DVD is a complete, widescreen, 15-episode series Surfaces, a television show created by Universal in 2006. The total playing time is 10 hours and 34 minutes, plus a few bonus features (deleted scenes, interviews with actors, special effects). It was a relatively expensive show, and most of the budget falls on the screen in the form of high-quality design and special effects. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 10+ hours is a long time, and, as is usually the case with such things, the overall quality begins to fall in later episodes. The first 7 episodes (Discs 1 and 2) seemed to me extremely interesting, and the rest - disappointment. The Surface was produced, written and directed by Josh and Jonas Pat; and it looks like they were surprised by the success of the series and are unable to put together enough good follow-up material, as they rushed to fulfill the order for additional episodes. It seems that additional authors were attracted for the later episodes, because the characters (who were already the weakest part of the series) lack consistency with how they were played in the early episodes. The series was canceled, and although the last episode gives a kind of conclusion, much remains hanging. <br /> <br /> This is basically a fantastic story about genetically created dragons; a kind of television mix "Jurassic Park" and "ET". The story begins with a riddle, when a submarine without a crew is at sea, boatmen on Lake Texas are flooded in a whirlpool, the lighthouse in Africa is destroyed by a huge monster, etc. And so on. And as long as things remain In this vague tension and a lot of tension. The human element is represented as three American families, one on each coast and one in the Gulf of Mexico. Laura Docherty (Lake Bell) is a California marine biologist who discovers a strange creature rising from an undersea heat hole on the ocean floor. Rich Connelly (Jay R. Ferguson) dives with his younger brother in the Gulf when such a creature takes his brother away (they will never see him again). <br /> <br /> Miles Bennett (Carter Jenkins) is a teenager from Wilmington who finds strange eggs floating in the ocean. He takes one house where he hatches a dragon of the type "ET". He will spend the rest of the series, trying to hide his strange pet from his family and from local authorities. These dragons may look like lizards, but they look more like indestructible electric eels, trigger electromagnetic impulses, cause lightning strikes, empty the sea of ​​fish and multiply like a bunch of extraordinary rabbits when they find underwater thermal output of boiling water. It is unclear whether they are intelligent, extraterrestrial, or harmless, the premise is interesting. As soon as you begin to suspect their origin, everything becomes very tired and predictable. <br /> <br /> Jay R. Ferguson (a terribly bad actor in the tradition of David Hasselhoff) essentially plays the character of Richard Dreyfus from “Close Relations of the Third Kind,” so you know that with the best actor and Best Director it could be interesting character. You will hate this character more with each episode. Unfortunately, what begins with the fact that the three parallel storylines soon condense into two, as Ferguson and Bell (a low-budget version of Sandra Bullock) soon come together and participate in a series of moronic adventures, almost as incredible as the material " Jason Bourne. " gets himself into You expect holes in the plot and the need to suspend disbelief in this type of show (which may even be part of the fun), but their adventures are not just completely implausible, they are completely and completely boring. There are three consecutive episodes in which Ferguson and Bell come together in an underwater vehicle that makes you crave an exciting actuarial conference all day. <br /> <br /> Jenkins (Miles) is the strongest cast member, and his favorite dragon (Nimrod) segments often intersect with Ferguson-Bell's boring material to keep you in sight. And these segments benefit from the presence of the gorgeous Leighton Mister (the recent Gossip Girl fame) as his sister Savannah. Apparently, the producers realized the importance of this “teenager” for their target audience, and one positive thing they did with the later episodes of the series was to present Lincy Godry (Caitlin) as “first love” to Miles. As screen time in Savannah decreases, Kathleen is gradually introduced. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, they needed a third storyline for the audience to be busy enough, and it would be better to limit adult melodrama in favor of the second group. young actors. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
