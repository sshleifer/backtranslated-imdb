It was a very energetic and well-played show. I saw it in the year 98 and my friends, and I still joke about it. Every time I look, it's always as fun as the first. I also like that everyone can relate to him in their own way. I look forward to seeing more of my own scripts and the works of John. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I cannot find it anywhere for sale, and I searched for a lot. If someone knows a website or a store to which you can refer, I would be very grateful, as I am looking for his other live performances. Please send me a message if any of you have information on this topic. Thank.
