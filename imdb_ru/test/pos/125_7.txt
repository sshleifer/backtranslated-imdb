This is my first Deepa Mehta film. I saw the movie on TV in Hindi with the character "Sita" presented as Nita. I also note that it was Radha who passed the allegorical test of fire in the film, and not Nita / Sita. And yet, what I liked about the film was the script of Miss Mehta, not her direction. Characters, big and small, were well developed and seemed insane towards the end - something like the end of "Mazursky" Unmarried Woman. " These are brave women surrounded by cardboard men. And one cardboard man (Ashok) seems to come to life in the last frame, which we see about him - with his disabled mother Bigi. It seems that he finally takes responsibility for the future, with the exception of celibacy and adherence to religion. <br /> <br /> Ms. Mehta seems to be messing around as a director (however, compared to most Indian mainstream cinemas, she looks brilliant) because she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family which it represents, except to represent a glimpse of the Chinese micro-minority in the social environment of India. She even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter (and not her father!), But her Radha reminds of serene days with both parents in the mustard field. Compare it with Mrinal Sen, Ador Gopalakrishnan, Muzaffar Ali, and she surpassed all these giants, given her competent Canadian production team and financial resources! The film Mehta about two bisexual women in the Indian middle-class household may be sacrilegious for some, but simply reflects the atrophy of middle-class homes that do not seem to aspire to anything better than its immediate survival in a limited social space. The films Kannada, Malayalam, and Bengal focused on parallel themes in India, but did not have wide publicity that surrounded this film, and therefore were not seen by a wide circle of knowledgeable film fans. <br /> <br /> Ms. Das, Ms. Azmi Mr. Jafri and Mr. Harbanda are trustworthy, but not outstanding. Ms. Azmi is a talented actress who gave excellent performances under good directors (“Handar” by Mrinal Sen, “Paar” by Gautama Goze, “Ankur” by Benegal), whose brilliance is noticeably absent in this film. Mrs. Dass flashed because of her presence on the screen, not her acting ability. In general, the strength of the film remains in the structure of the script, which is above average in terms of international cinema. I am confident that Mehta will be able to hone his writing talents in his future scenarios.
