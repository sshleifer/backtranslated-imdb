After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is that damn well worth the wait! "Rush in Rio" may well be the greatest rock DVD ever. I am not kidding. This is incredible! The whole fuss about how crappy the sound is is true, but that does not make the concert unusable. I think it makes you feel that you are actually in Rio, watching a concert from the audience. This is one of the reasons why I love this DVD. It makes you feel that you are actually there. In addition, Geddy, Alex and Neil were never in better shape! Geddy's vocals are flawless, Alexâ€™s guitar playing is still incredible, and Neal has absolutely no words to say. I must say that the camera work at this concert was very good. They gave us a good look at everything that happened on stage and in the audience. Kudos to the operators! In any case, enough of my nonsense! See "Rush in Rio" for yourself. You will be amazed. I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
