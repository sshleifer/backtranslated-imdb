I have this film in the collection of inexpensive B-films. It was not restored, in fact, the sound was difficult to distinguish during the first few minutes. <br /> <br /> At first, he seemed like a typical haunted home movie and is very similar to Clue's predecessor, Murder. Death, House on the Haunted Hill, etc. <br /> <br /> For about half an hour in the movie, the storyline takes a really interesting twist - it turns from a cliche melodrama into something completely different and far more interesting than I thought at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Check it out, it's great fun, even if the long clips and wider shots (and almost no music) make him feel a bit creaky todayâ€™s standards.
