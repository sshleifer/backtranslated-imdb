Middle and high school teachers will find The Cure as an excellent study tool, both as a companion to Huckleberry Finn and as a separate lesson. Although it is assumed that AIDS is the main theme, a strong text of friendship and love, developing between Eric and Dexter, is a powerful message for teenagers. Written tips centered around the symbolism of tennis shoes are especially effective. I also propose to direct class discussion about how Erik turns from a manipulating user into a loving friend.
