Yes, indeed, we have a winner - a winner in the best silent action movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I decided to vote for this film is 10, because it is so incredibly bad that it actually becomes Funny. <br /> <br /> “Night Hunter” is mainly about Jack Cutter, the vampire hunter (apparently, vampire hunters have been in his generation for centuries), and his mission is to kill the last one left. Vampires. <br /> <br /> This movie contains one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in my life. Not to mention the really bad gun shooting scenes. When people are filmed in this film, splashes of blood are thick like ketchup everywhere, the film seems so cheap and lame that you just lose interest. The constant camera shake is what annoys me most during the fight scenes. I believe that this is done to create an “effect of action”, although, in my opinion, this has no effect. This is completely ridiculous! <br /> <br /> All the stunt scenes are very poorly made. For example, a scene where a dead leader of vampires is thrown off the roof. When the corpse falls to the ground, it jumps like a wobbly rubber doll. The scene where Jack sniffs the ground, getting a vision, was so lame that I laughed hysterically. <br /> <br /> Limping music, stupid scenes, bad behavior and simple stupid shooting techniques are obviously the features that make this film a problem. To say that this is a good film is tantamount to saying that nuclear bombs are useful to people. It is clear that those of you who say that this is one of the best fighters have not seen many in your life. <br /> <br /> Basically this is a B-class action movie, deserving 0/10, but which I will give 10/10, just for its ability (the most disgusting action movie I've ever seen) make me laugh and because I just can't live without it.
