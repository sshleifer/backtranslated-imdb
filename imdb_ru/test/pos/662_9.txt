Okay, so the next review is rather a quick review than it contains spoilers, but it’s better safe than sorry to avoid being blacklisted, right? Right! Consider yourself officially warned and read on ... <br /> <br /> In this parody / tribute to the greatest time in the history of horror films - the 1980s - a group of stupid teens get together to arrange a session in the House of the Infamous The murders of McGee, who several years ago had killed his whole family and buried them in the backyard. As I am sure, you can guess that things are getting worse and worse faster than you can say: “Where's the beef?” And in the typical horror movies of the 80s, the deaths are bloody, the dialogues are stupid, and beautiful women take off their clothes with each opportunity case. Good times ... <br /> <br /> Neither clicks nor clichéd characteristics of the 80s horror movie are presented here. In fact, not a single stone remained safe and sound? we have a cool hero, his innocent girlfriend, a gothic chick, a sturdy thug (think John Bender), a hot blonde who constantly loses his shirt, a shy moron in love with a hot blonde who continues to lose his shirt, a pair of gorgeous half-naked lesbians and two big geeks. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the actors are pretty big. Usually, big throws are where things can quickly fall apart, with one or two sour apples breaking a whole barrel. Not in this case though. Not a single cast left me disappointed. The game was very well done. Everything from the awesome hero in his thriller in Jovan Meredith's jacket to the gorgeous gothic chick Rene Dorian performed by Geeks One & Two by Corey Assink and Jonathan Brett ?? they all played right, brought their great game and knocked it out of the park. If you are a fan of Gary and Wyatt in "Strange Science", you will immediately fall in love with geeks. <br /> <br /> The director / co-author of the film Jeff S. Smith is the guy who needs to be watched for the future, believe me in this. If this is what he can do with a small budget, he has only good things ahead when he gets more money for future projects. The characters were dead; the atmosphere was perfect; the laughter was huge; blood flowed, squirted and beautifully sprayed? it was like watching a horror movie from the 1980s. Call it "BREAKFAST CLUB meets the night of demons" !!! The slogan speaks for itself and speaks about it honestly - “EXTREMELY VIOLENCE; CHARITABLE BUDGET; BUDGET ZERO ”- there are no false ads here, guys! As fans of this genre, we have to look at indie and support these hardworking people who burst their humps, bringing us original stories so that we never get stuck in a world filled with a big studio diluted with PG-13 “horror” or meaningless remakes, such like "hitcher." No, thanks - no longer for me. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I must honestly say that stupid teenagers must die! definitely one of the best indie films that I enjoyed watching this year. This is a damn good time, and it repeats. From dialogue to characters and wardrobe ... even the final love theme for the last credits (which, if it doesn’t cause laughter, recalling the powerful ballads of the mid-80s from REO Speedwagon - clearly expressed R in each word starting with 'R '- then I’ll eat my DVD now) ... the bottom line is that if you are a horror or horror fan in the 1980s in general, do not hesitate - this film deserves your attention a collection !!
