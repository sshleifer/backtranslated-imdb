One of the most successful shows in the history of television is back. Now I admit that I never entered the original show ... Ok, so I never watched it at all. But the new show is impressive. <br /> <br /> The science fiction premiere of the first two series, Rose and End of the World, took place this weekend. We meet Rose, a twenty-year-old clerk who is pursued by remote-controlled mannequins. She was saved by a mysterious stranger who calls himself a Doctor. Using the Internet, she finds a conspirator who warns her that wherever the Doctor goes, death follows. When her disgusting boy Mickey is replaced by an impostor, the Doctor tells her about a plot to use Earth as a springboard for more of these plastic monsters, with whom the Doctor fought in space and time, traveling in the Tardis disguised in the 50s. in the style of a police box. <br /> <br /> She helps him save the world - otherwise there will be no show - and decides to join him. But when he puts her life in danger, he is confused and wonders if her company was worth the risk. <br /> <br /> Although the special effects are a bit flimsy, and some scenes are a bit volatile, Doctor Who is (after two issues in the US) a clever, well-written work. Apparently, the second season has already been aired in the UK, so I predict the same success here.
