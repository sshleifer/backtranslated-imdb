It seems that this is the Czech version of Pearl Harbor. He has the same story, both guys fall in love with the same woman. And add to this turn, the woman is in fact married, whose husband went missing for a year. I do not think the storyline is too strong. The younger guy is pretty naughty, that's cute. It made me watch because of the emotional music and pleasant scenes one by one. It also has some strong visual special effects. Best of all, love stories are fully integrated into the story. <br /> <br /> I think that if it were in English, it would be such a big blow to all the states. It is a pity that not many people are open to foreign films.
