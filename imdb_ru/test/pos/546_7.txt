This film is about a single mother, who is happy, so lucky that she is almost irresponsible, and her sensible teenage daughter, who is experiencing teenage riots. <br /> <br /> “Anywhere, but here” is a fascinating film beginning to end. Both Ann and Adele are described well from the very beginning, so we will find out how different their personalities are. Collisions inevitably occur, and they appear attractive. I feel so attracted to their state of mind and their circumstances. I seem to live their life, I feel what they feel. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon gives another great performance in Anywhere, Here Here. She is charismatic, happy, happy, hedonistic, warm and loving at the same time. I have always liked Susan Sarandon, and I think she is greatly undervalued. <br /> <br /> “Anywhere, but here” is an exciting emotional journey.
