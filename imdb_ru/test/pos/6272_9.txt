This film must have been quietly released on the other side of the world, perhaps even in English. I hope no one understood a word, in any case, this film has nothing to understand! Haahaa! Call me crazy, but I think this is one of the best movies ever. Why did I come to this conclusion? Because this is my national time when I sabotage horrible films, and this one begs every minute! When I became a fan of Myster Science Theater 3000, I had no doubt that they would find it anywhere and use it. Of course, enough! The version they acquired was called “Cave Dwellers”, in which strange introductory frames were used, not even from the film itself (obviously, they were ashamed to use frames from their OWN film!) I can not say that I recommend buying this film. Rather, I highly recommend getting the MST3K version. Be sure to find it anywhere DVD MST3K, do not miss!
