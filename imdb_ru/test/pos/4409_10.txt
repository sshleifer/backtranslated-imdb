Just to correct something in the previous review, I do not believe that this film is intended only for people who know London, this is a case of a very specific situation used for universal comments. Jack Rosenthal in the preface to the published script says that it is intended for characters who, after passing this grueling knowledge test, will get some measure of self-knowledge. <br /> <br /> I think this is one of the most beautifully written dramas I’ve ever seen: technically, he’s extremely skilled at conveying quite complex details, but also pleased with how he appeals to you. In the beginning, you don’t know more about this London Knowledge test than the main characters, but you will be with him until it becomes vital for you. You become extremely proud of those characters who succeed, and you are crushed for those who do not. Especially the one whose fall, without giving anything, will make your hands fly to your face. <br /> <br /> Also as a fact, the character of Nigel Hawthorne, Mr. Burgess, is called a vampire, not Dracula. You do not need to know about it, I do not say that it is important, but it is a measure of drama: as soon as you see it, you will want everyone to know it, and you will preach every detail. <br /> <br /> I hope you see it. <br /> <br /> William
