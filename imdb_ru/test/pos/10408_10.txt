I have never published anything here before, but after watching “Nora” I just felt I should write down my thoughts about it. <br /> <br /> First, don't compare it to Blair the Witch, this film deserves much better than this! Simply put, Norah (probably) is one of the best horror films I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot!). <br /> <br /> I really liked the way the film presents itself not as a standard horror film, but as a documentary film shot by a reporter (I think?) by the name of Kobayashi and his cameraman. Not much indulging in the plot, I can say that it begins with the fact that Kobayashi begins to explore a series of seemingly unrelated events, which, it turns out, are connected with something darker and more sinister. <br /> <br /> Although the story itself may not be so original, that really attracted me to Noroy in an incredible eerie atmosphere. If you are looking for cheap panic and jumping scenes, this film may not be for you. This film is all about the mood he presents, with haunting images and a general sense of anticipation of anticipation. Documentary-style filming just makes the farm more believable. <br /> <br /> A great game also helps a lot, although it is not ideal for the main part of the movie! Much better than most other films of this genre. <br /> <br /> Enough talk from me, I highly recommend Noroi to everyone, this is a tense, creepy, well-played first film that frightened me in age.
