I found the film very easy and enjoyable. Someone knows that the story does not look like real life, but the image is great. <br /> <br /> The lyrics are really good, and John Travolta is in his usual style. I like the scene in which he, like an angel, throws his own things to bring back the dogâ€™s life.
