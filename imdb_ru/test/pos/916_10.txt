"Rouge" is part of the trilogy, but stands out very much on its own. This is not a continuation of any kind. The end itself, which I will not disclose, links the three films together, but not seeing the other two, it does not make it too confusing. <br /> <br /> This film amazes me because it is so sparing, so subtle and simple, but as effective, emotional and intellectual as any big-budget play or melodrama with the participation of all stars. Kieslowski here explores the phenomenon of chance and fate. Both themes are loosely woven into stories. The film is very mysterious, but the essence is quite simple: everything happens for a reason. Love is in all our destinies, while we are open to it. The name “Red” refers to the French flag, where red represents “fraternity” or fraternity. Color dominates the visual elements of the film. I tend to think of this as a representation of love, passion, or the blood of life. It's great when the film gives you the freedom to do it;)
