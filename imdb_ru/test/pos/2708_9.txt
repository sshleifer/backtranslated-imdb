Unlike some former commentators, I was (and I) an ardent admirer of carpenters. Admit it, Christmas will never be Merry Christmas without Carpenters. However, I believe that the film did a good, not an excellent job of portraying Karen's life. The film was a pleasure to watch on television in prime time, but its content was a bit behind. I suggest you all take a look at getting some of the special offers from Carpenters that were shown in the 70s. You can't believe how cool drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not catch the talent of Karen. In addition, Karen was beautiful, but she had a bad hairdresser. My choice for the game Karen - Hilary Swank. I would like to see a more meaningful story, because Karen knew more than it seems at first glance when listening to We Only Only Begun. I have a ton of unpublished Carpenters music, and it is absolutely superb. (Her singing about California, which she dreams of dying).
