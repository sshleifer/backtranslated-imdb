Niagara, Niagara is a terrific and heart-rending story about two outsiders Seth and Marcy. Robin Tunney gives a fantastic performance as Marcie suffers from Tourette Sydrom, getting worse and worse as the film progresses. This film is not very optimistic and very emotional, but at the same time very romantic. It's hard to explain, but see for yourself. It is definitely worth it.
