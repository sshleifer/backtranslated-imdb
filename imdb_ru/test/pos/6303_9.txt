“Le conteguenze dell'amore” (2004) is a beautifully made film, in which small, carefully thought-out steps are taken to end it, which must be savored in order to enjoy them. From contrasting landscapes to the tightly closed world in which the hero lives, the director takes us under control and controls from the moment you enter the hotel. We, as a hero, will never escape the stifling tension and paradoxical monotony of his criminal, mafia world. The fact that the film is opposed to the stereotypes of the mafia, and at the same time enjoys them, makes it even more successful. The concrete grave, the inevitable cruel execution and overwhelming masculinity are exposed and exposed by who they are. Just cruelty and business, and no more. Life is to be part of a corporate machine, which is organized crime, and not in love or life for yourself, family or others. Our hero is truly a hero in the sense that he gives his life for the touch of a beautiful bartender, for resolving the suffering suffered by his only neighbors in the hotel, and for the sake of escaping from his decorative prison. The consequences of love are really beautiful and cruel at the same time. See it !!
