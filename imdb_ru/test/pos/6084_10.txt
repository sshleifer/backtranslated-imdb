I will not go to generalization and say that this is the best love story of all time, as some have said. This is normal, people are very deeply concerned with this film, you either love it, I believe ... or just hate it. I do not want to say what is best, because it is too “wide” for me to make such a statement. Nevertheless, I am very passionate about the English patient, like millions of other people. <br /> <br /> The awards speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> I disagree with critics on many levels, however, I couldn’t agree more with those who chose this one. <br /> <br /> 9th oscar. <br /> <br /> 41 victories. <br /> <br /> 37 other nominations make this love story atop the group. <br /> <br /> The story flashes on the screen from director Anthony Minghella, and as Mr. Peterman (from TVs Seinfeld) said: "Elaine, I just can't take my eyes off this!" In this case, I do not agree with the answer of Elaine . But the story is built and it takes the right time to make it beautiful. Cinematography (John Force) also received many awards, as expected. I still have not paid much attention to Juliette Binoche. Well, not quite right, I liked her performance at Sabrina. The beautiful story of a somewhat complicated relationship, next to Harrison Ford. But it was just an incredibly different character for her, and no matter how deeply talented she was, she simply shone with her subtle and graceful way, she was exactly what this film was looking for, I am sincerely glad that this was her performance and not another actress. Ralph Fiennes was also impressive in the depiction of Count Laszlo de Almasi. I have a new respect for his abilities, seeing it! What can you say besides, see this picture again. (*****)
