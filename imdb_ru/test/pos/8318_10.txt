“Walking with dinosaurs” is an amazing documentary in which both ignorant and dinosaur lovers (like me) learn. I admit, I was very young when I saw it at Discovery, but was immediately obsessed with it. (Spoliers !!!!!) The series contains 6 episodes, beginning in the late Triassic, when dinosaurs were just beginning to develop until the late Cretaceous, at the end of the reign of dinosaurs. When I first saw this movie, I really traveled through time. The greatness of Diplodocus, the adventures of Optalmosaurus and the caring maternal version of T-Rex impressed my family and me. This is an amazing film, and I believe that the BBC managed to do exactly what they intended to do. Good job!
