* Minor spoilers * I just wanted to say that for those who like entertaining baseball movies, this is definitely in my top three. Only the Little Big League and the Major League can compete with this in my memory. I would also like to thank the authors of this film for creating such a pleasant dialogue! Without being too specific, I would say that the lines are very suitable for each character. It seemed that Tom Selleck had no problem creating a realistic character in the role of a baseball player. His hostility to playing overseas in Japan sets the tone for a comic, but meaningful interaction with his new team, the Dragons. He must adapt to life in Japan (“Wash first, then bathe!”). In the end, he comes face to face with his trainer and sets himself the goals of spending this last season of greatness, albeit in a completely different environment than he ever imagined! So for any baseball fan or anyone who wants to see a good baseball movie, Mr. Baseball will not let you down!
