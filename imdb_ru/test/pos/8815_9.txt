This movie was fun. It gave a somewhat funny look at the British club scene, which, if you really look at it, is funny. The characters in this film were so realistic for those of us who watched here at my place that it was like watching a movie about ourselves. <br /> <br /> There were several key scenes that really made this film work: prepare scenes; the scene "Find me a real doctor"; a white background scene showing each character in a state of total collapse, ending with the infamous "what did I say?" and scenes of sunrise and sunset. I lived these moments myself and found that I was hysterically laughing at my own ridiculous behavior. <br /> <br /> I can’t give this film 10 because it doesn’t fit Groove, which I thought was from this world, but it certainly has its moments. The stage and camera work are excellent, the special effects are worth mentioning, and the acting is fantastic. <br /> <br /> After a long wait to watch this movie, I am glad to say that I was not disappointed. I hope to see more from a writer / director in the future.
