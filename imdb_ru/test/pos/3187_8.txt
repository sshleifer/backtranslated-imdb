I'm trying to find somewhere to buy a DVD / VHS copy of the film "Isn't it shocking?" I was 7 years old when I watched this film and I lived in the city where it was shot. A couple of things from my family were used as a prop in the film, and a couple of my friend's houses were used in several scenes. The shooting took place quite well in the city and its surroundings. Initially, I saw the film only once, and I would like to receive a copy so that now I can show my family the film. I did extensive searches on the Internet, but no luck, and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas about getting a copy of this film?
