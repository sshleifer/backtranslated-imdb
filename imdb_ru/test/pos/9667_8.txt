Romanian cinema is little known from Romania. None of the directors from Romania drew the attention of the international community, as some of the other Eastern European countries, such as Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Yugoslavia, did. One of the few great directors in Romanian cinema is Lucien Pintili, who 35 years ago made a wonderful film “Reconstituirea” - quickly withdrawn from production by the communist censor. After that film, which is still a reference to Romanian cinema, Pintili was not allowed to create freely in Romania until communist rule fell in 1989. <br /> <br /> “Fury” reminds me of a Pintyle film 35 years ago. The name means Rage, and I can't imagine why distributors decided to translate it differently. This is about a lost generation. While in the classics of Pintily, the root of evil lies in the oppression and lies of the communist regime, here young people have to deal with the emergence of subculture and moral mud that filled the void left by the totalitarian rule. The end is tragic and painfully awaiting. <br /> <br /> The film is well-placed, and the acting is good. Without much difficulty, he manages to create an emotional connection between the characters and the viewer. One could say that some situations seem like 8 miles or Fast and Furious, but look at the production date! This film was shot at the same time, if not earlier than Western peers. If this is really the first film directed by Dun Munteanu, as IMDB says, this is an outstanding debut. In any case, a good film can compete and sell well in the western market. <br /> <br /> There is hope for a new generation of Romanian films, which, if they are lucky and get a good distribution, will find their place in the international cinema scene. <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale.
