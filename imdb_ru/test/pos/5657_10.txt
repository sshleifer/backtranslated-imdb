This is one of the most anti-traditional war movies I've ever seen. Instead of typical films that emphasize fame and, perhaps, superhuman characters (such as John Wayne), this film is the complete opposite - emphasizes dehumanization, which also occurs in war. The story concerns the Japanese, who ended up in the Philippines after the US returned in late 1944 - early 1945. By the time the movie began, the Japanese were clearly beaten, but because of Bushidoâ€™s insane logic, they could not afford to give up. In one of the many critical moments, the protagonist is told at the beginning of the film to go to the hospital because he is not able to fight because of his tuberculosis. The problem is that the hospital will not accept him, so his commander tells him to go to the hospital again - and if they do not accept him, he should blow himself up with a grenade! Well, this happens only in the first five minutes of the film - this soldier and a few stragglers will suffer much worse things, because they do not give up. In addition, in the film there is a case when a soldier tries to surrender, but he is shot. This happened much later during the war, because very often the surrendering Japanese soldiers mined themselves to explode as they approached. In addition, the film shows the brightest depiction of hunger and the accompanying madness of any film I have seen. In addition, cannibalism, cowardice and betrayal accompany this very sandy, realistic and depressingly realistic film. You just could not make the best movie of this type. Awful, but great.
