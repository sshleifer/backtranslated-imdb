Critters 4: This film was continued after the 3rd creature film. This one was released in the same years as Critters 3 in 1991. Critters 4 sends you into space when they hunt for people in a spaceship. I doubt that there will be Critters 5, because the ending of the 4th was a pretty good ending that brought the end of the creature, since it no longer remains. I give this film 10 out of 10.
