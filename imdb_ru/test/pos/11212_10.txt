It took me about a year after watching this movie to write about it. The Lord knows what I wanted when I saw this, I realized that I had seen what I had not seen before, but I did not know why. Now, after thinking for a long time, I know that I still cannot stop thinking about these characters. <br /> <br /> Distantly and slowly tells the story of a relative (Yusuf), who came from the villagers will not live long with a wealthy photographer (makhmut) in the city hoping to find work. However, it becomes clear that after Yusuf put forward the hypothesis that he is a sailor, and his employment prospects are clouded, he is really looking for something else, some kind of goal in his life. <br /> <br /> Thanks to this search for the soul, we are received through seasonal surroundings, which are filmed exquisitely. The context in which they occur makes the scenes more powerful in two specific cases where the girl followed by Yusuf suddenly meets her significant friend, and Yusufâ€™s look when he looks at the fish basket and the shot and the light is reflected from his tormented person. This scene in itself should be one of the most beautifully filmed parts, of which I am a witness, I do not know how long. <br /> <br /> In the end, Mahmut also has his own demons, but eventually encounters his relative. that he is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave, in a scene that is very simple, but causes a feeling of a real broken heart. <br /> <br /> The viewer has much to ponder and reflect on these two people, in which everyone can see a piece of themselves. You do not have to set aside the tempo of this film, it is really worth every breathtaking second. <br /> <br /> Rated 10 out of 10
