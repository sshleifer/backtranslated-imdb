This film makes several hints at various sci-fi movies. The prologue reminds me of the original theatrical version of the THX-1138 (BUCK ROGERS trailer, there were clips from the early Japanese television series SF). Then, in the first picture of the city in 2345, a dragon flies overhead with a billboard that immediately resembles BLADERUNNER. The aspect of BLADERUNNER becomes even more pronounced when we meet a hero who is called a replicant (he is blond, his name is Rio, a tribute to Roy Batty, the character of Rutger Hauer in BLADERUNNER?) Soon, a battle scene begins that immediately resembles MATRIX. The government that forces people to take drugs is similar to THX-1138, and the main performer, although it looks like a cross between Elvis and Dan Aroyd, turns out to be a robot, very similar to the TERMINATOR. The final battle is reminiscent of TERMINATOR 2, and the end result is hilarious. Probably not one of the best SF films out there, but it is pleasant, of course, much nicer than jokes like BATTLEFIELD EARTH.
