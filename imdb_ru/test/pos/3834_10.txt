This should be one of my favorite 3 episodes from the original series. <br /> <br /> What makes it great is the battle of wits between the Romulan commander and Kirk, as well as Mark Lenard's first-class game, which later began to play on Spock's father in other TV shows and movies. This is the case when the surrounding people rose to the level of talent around themselves, and Shatner, Nimoy and the entire cast showed outstanding performance in this episode. <br /> <br /> The writing and plot is also excellent, and I love the direct approach used to show us the characters, as well as the feelings and thoughts of these characters, and how freely they are expressed by the actors. <br /> <br /> This very interesting episode takes 10 out of 10. AMAZING! Dessert buddha
