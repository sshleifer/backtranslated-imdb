“Five Fingers of Death” is a classic of kung fu cinema of the 70s. As a film that “broke out” with HK cinema in the west, this is a must-see for any serious fan of the genre. It's also a damn exciting movie with a tough, non-stop action film, a solid and mostly believable battle choreography and a great dubbing of the 70s era (“Oh, I understand ... so you want it DIFFICULT WAY !!” . <br /> <br /> Five Fingers is a story of revenge that I only dreamed of ... and I mean literally, an eye for an eye! It's nice to see Luo Li portray a hero. Later in his he played so many great villains in his career, including Pai Mei in the classic "FIST OF THE WHITE LOTUS", who was one of Tarantino's characters, using They were inspired by the creation of “Pai Mei from KILL BILL”. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that I would like to have a better quality DVD - mine looks like it was a VHS program. Overall, This is a great movie - don't miss it! <br /> <br /> Bart Blackstone Film Club - Hollywood, California
