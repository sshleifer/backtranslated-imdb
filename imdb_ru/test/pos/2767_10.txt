Previously, this film was constantly watched on the Disney Channel when I was a little younger, and I really remember that I liked it. However, at that time I didn’t have a good taste (not to mention what I’m doing now), so I cannot vouch for my nine-year-old girl too well. The film was probably 7/10, but there was good music in it, so I gave him an extra point. Yes worth a look. I know that some fans of this film are wondering what kind of song that appears when it gets into a car accident. The song "Play a Love Song" by Jaguars is VERY difficult to find and receive. Actually this movie too. I can not find it anywhere on the Internet, on DVD or on VHS. I would like to see it again so that I can evaluate whether it was really a good movie. Well.
