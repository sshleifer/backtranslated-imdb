I first saw it at a friends house. It turned out in the hands of his parents by luck; some kind of video shop / bike repair shop !! went bankrupt and considering how it was before the bouts. We saw it twice in a row and almost wet pants, how much we laughed. <br /> <br /> I have seen historical documents, such as the Ninja Mission and Plan 9, from space, and they still remain in second place compared to this. <br /> <br /> Almost 15 years after the first contact, he is considered the best cult film of all time (in my circles); I showed it to all my friends ... Now we have a tradition of searching for films in the same category: priceless. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to explain or revise in any normal way, because every scene, every take, every move contains at least one mistake concerning editing, dialing, directing, etc. <br /> <br /> For any fan of the cult film, this is the main prize, the gem of all gems. <br /> <br /> Rating: As for the craft, it cannot be evaluated, because it will even be an insult to home videos about birthdays and weddings. <br /> <br /> As for pure entertainment, this is the funniest movie I've ever seen; funnier than any comedy ever made in the past or present. Anything less than 10/10 should be considered an insult to our common sense.
