I am very grateful for being in a small college town of Abingdon, Virginia, near Bristol, Tennessee. and the house of the famous Barter Theater, where Gregory Peck once acted - managed to organize a feature film festival and show this film there. Abingdon is two and a half hours from the place where I live, but the trip was worth it in every sense of the word. UZAK / DISTANT is an amazing, brilliant, sharp, emotional, exciting movie. As Turkish-American, this film was not only evidence of what life in Turkey is like; but on a larger scale, it tells the world how to be Turkish, whether you live in Istanbul, Berlin, Montreal, New York or Omaha. It may take two hours, not five minutes, but this is, in fact, our song by Bob Marley. There are so many great scenes in this movie. It is very difficult to choose only a few random ones. But for me, one illustrative scene takes place in the Beyoglu cinema (in the center of Istanbul). The title character, played by Mehmet Emin Toprak, who unfortunately died in a car accident shortly after the film was finished, follows a very attractive young woman down the stairs to the main hall of the cinema. She enters the "Vanilla sky". Since the image of Tom Cruise is reflected from the glass, we feel that Turkish men are competing with Tom Cruise for their own female affections, although Tom Cruise is nowhere in Beyoglu. Scenes filmed on the Bosphorus shores are also quite revealing, as they symbolize beauty, but desperate empty bays, which are a painful fact of life in Turkey. In this film, the abyss separates lovers and families. A simple empty pack of Samsun cigarettes (a Turkish brand) and a dying mouse jump off the screen, as the gulls did in the 1982 Serif Goren-Yilmaz Guneya Yule film. Many of Guni’s films, including “Yol”, “Suro-Herd” (1978 - completed by Zeki Okten) and “Baba-dad” (1971), were recognized by many of the best Turkish films ever made. Without the sometimes bloated social and political anger of Guni (especially in his latest film, the 1983 prison drama “The Wall of Duvara”) “Distance” very remarkably captures the essence of Turkish life. This is the main achievement for the director, who, in my opinion, can already be declared the Turkish equivalent of such directors as Tarkovsky, Bresson and Ozu. I can't wait to see his other films!
