I would like to present the following nonsense. <br /> <br /> During the scene on the bridge, soldiers step into the river, asking to be taken away and trying to escape. Some of the soldiers approach Captain Willardâ€™s boat and try to sit with them with their suitcases. Soldiers are not issued and do not carry suitcases to the combat zone. They have duffel bags, bags and chests, but not suitcases. Using a suitcase in this scene is absurd and inappropriate. In addition, if you look closely, you will see a suitcase floating on the surface of the water. This is probably a very good sign that it is empty, otherwise it is sinking.
