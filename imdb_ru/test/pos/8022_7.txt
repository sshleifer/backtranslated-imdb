I must say, I did not expect much from this film, but it turned out to be not bad at all. The most striking, of course, was Aidan Quinn's performance. I would never have expected to see this wonderful actor as an action movie hero. The great thing about this is that he really builds his character (Annibal). I mean that Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis did not do this, he was sensitive and modest. For example, he is very upset when he kills someone. I also noticed that some clich√©s were excluded. When Annibal learns, you can easily expect him to be a rebel and behave like any average American in such a situation, ask what is happening and refuse to cooperate. But Annibal is a professional naval officer, he does not give up and tries not to lose the courage in which he succeeds, except for a brief break on Christmas Eve, which I think was very realistic. I am glad that Aidan Quinn was able to show his other side (actually two, because he also plays the villain), although the film was not so successful.
