I went to see this movie out of curiosity and settle an argument. Currently, the film is best known from Sergei Prokofiev’s musical suite, extracted from episodic music for the film, the “Troika” movement, even pop-up in pop arrangements. The overall plot is well known from the notes on the covers of various recordings. The clerk randomly generates a non-existent lieutenant Kizhe on the list, which will be presented to the king. The king is interested in this man, and instead of telling him that he does not exist, the courtiers and officers pretend that he is real. Kizhe was exiled to Siberia, recalled, promoted, married, again promoted, dying, arranged for a state funeral, revealed as a waste and posthumously demoted. <br /> <br /> I heard contradictory stories about how the Clerk invented Kizhe using ink stains and sneezing, but I heard that the film was lost, so there was no way to find out what was going on. Then the film appeared in the Barbican in London as part of their Prokofiev festival. For reference, it turned out that all that is happening is that the clerk mixes two words when writing an order and turns Kuzhe into Kizhe. Since the king is in a hurry to see the order, there is no time to correct the mistake. <br /> <br /> I expected historical curiosity and was pleasantly surprised. The film is very funny, and the public, including me, was constantly laughing. Although most of the film was filmed directly, mainly in the palace, there are several “tricky” shots where several images appear on the screen. For example, the royal army is represented by a small group that repeats across the screen. Four identical guards perform the perfect exercise in perfect unison. Two identical servants wash the floor. <br /> <br /> One small flaw was that it was very difficult to understand who everyone was. There were two women who could be the king’s daughters or a daughter and a servant or someone else. And very few people have been named. But in general, the film is pleasant, and I am surprised that it was not seen more often.
