Three children are born at the same time, during a lunar eclipse. Just before their 10th birthday, they start a deadly fun. Bloody Birthday is a typical slasher from the early 80s. These are pretty ordinary things with lots of nudity. evil children never create any threat, and there is almost no expectation. There is also no casserole or fear in Bloody Birthday, but the film is slightly entertaining. Unfortunately, for children there is no real explanation for the sudden murderous mania. Murder scenes are pretty awful, for example, we have a death from a pistol, a baseball bat, jump rope and blades. So if you're a fan of the early 80s, director films, take a look at this.
