Good. Here's the thing. I read the comments of other viewers, some of whom smashed the film, and some said it was the funniest, darkest, most black comedy ever made. Smells of Tarantino, etc. Well, not quite. But guess what? It is still a pleasant and, ultimately, funny movie. Not brilliant, not rubbish. Liv Tyler plays great, and you can't take your eyes off her. She is a woman with very strong ideas for decorating ... Matt Dillon, a strongly underrated and underused actor, is as beautiful as ever. He always manages to pass this fine line between mud and soul, and he perfectly removes comedy. The same is John Goodman (although religious overtones, perhaps funny in the script, do not really work). Paul Reiser is very good - definitely better than he was on TV. <br /> <br /> The usually unbearable Michael Douglas is really great in this role. As for his hair, well, watch the movie. Between this and “Wonder Boys” you are actually reminded that Douglas can act. The film will make you laugh piece by piece. Okay, not quite a laugh, but definitely in the “I'm surprised, I'm very surprised” category. If you rent it, expecting to see another Pulp Fiction, forget it. But if you want something like a trendy and funny one, this is a damn good choice.
