Human Traffic is a regular weekend for a group of friends, itâ€™s a picture of the life (and minds) of flies on the wall that will show you how this group of friends treats each other. There are many things that everyone can relate to, for example, being outside your skull at parties and talking trash to strangers. All characters are people with whom you can communicate, and they are believable in the roles they play in the film. The situations in which they find themselves are all situations in which we all find ourselves, and it is here that this film succeeds. Themes about sex and drugs are worked out great, so as not to interfere with the relationship of the characters with each other. The story of the film is not everything, but it is not a criticism. This is a film about people. This is a well-written film with a soundtrack for which you can die. Pete Tong from D.J collected a great selection of tracks for this file, and all this makes it one of the best films I saw in 1999. After watching this movie, I felt like I was going to parties all weekend. Fantastic movie! Joe Brand as the voice of reality - Need to say more! <br /> <br />
