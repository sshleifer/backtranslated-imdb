This often slanderous film is a must for fans of Blake Edwards, Julie Andrews, Henry Mancini, or Hollywood musicals. Other authors commented on changes in tone, confusion in the plot, etc., But there are many recommendations in the film. The score is one of the best in the work of Henry Mancini (and he wrote many wonderful ones), Andrews sang some songs, Julie has a nuance, and she is decorated with some beautiful clothes (she has the most beautiful here) Several fun sight type inspector Klose, which can be downloaded. Rock Hudson mostly called in his speech, but he is tolerably good. The real subject of curiosity is that it was the last major film shot by Julie in 10 years, and in many respects preceding Victoria / Victoria. It is a pleasure to watch and listen. When will it be available on DVD ??? When this is the case, I would like both versions - a longer and shorter uncut version. Since in C.O.B. they let him go, they would make an excellent package of two pieces!
