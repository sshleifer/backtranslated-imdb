I can’t understand forever why this movie’s rating is so low. It was one of the most beautiful films I saw this year. It really struck me. I had been expecting this film for several months, and I thought to myself that it could not justify the expectations that I had from him ... seeing how I built it in my head just like me. Well, of course, he not only met my expectations, but also surpassed them. Jordana Brewster and Cameron Diaz were excellent in every way. Their acting is great. They were both in their element and completely natural for the roles. The places were absolutely gorgeous. Each footage shot was perfectly captured and perfectly combined with the mood and atmosphere. I found this film very touching and took it very close to my heart. I would even think to say that this may be one of my favorites for all times. At least, of course, I could see it again and again. <br /> <br /> I swear I have not found a single error in this film. It's hard to say this about any movie. I highly recommend it. It is touching, meaningful and talks a lot about human nature and family. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. Well done.
