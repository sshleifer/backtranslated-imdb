There are other films about boarding schools and the antics of students and staff, but the Beauties of St. Trinina tower above them! The plot was carefully summarized by other authors, so I will not talk about the same. I just want to say that it is a shame, that it is finally on DVD, but in a format that cannot be used in the USA! :-( <br /> <br /> Enjoy, admirers in New Zealand and Australia! And if any readers have any problems with this, PLEASE, help release it on DVD with Region 1 encoding! receive email notifications when (I won't say “if”) will it be released on DVD in the United States? Thank you!
