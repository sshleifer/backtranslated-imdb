Antarctica, the winter of 1982. The US research base surprises a couple of crazy Norwegians who chase a dog in a helicopter and try to kill it. All the Norwegians were killed, and the Americans were left with nothing but a dog, a pair of bodies and questions. This is the beginning of the biggest horror / thriller movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning to the very end, you feel a tense, paranoid mood. Helpless and lonely in no man's land. Ennio Morricone was nominated for a Razzie award at his expense. Why I do not know, because, as I understand it, his assessment is simple, eerie and very good. It really gives you a good mood. <br /> <br /> The game is great! The best performance is probably given by a dog that is simply awesome. As for Russell and the others on two legs, I can’t say anything less. <br /> <br /> You might think that 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive? Well, think again! You did not see all this until you saw it. The bodies fall, and the creatures change forms ... Rob Bottin did an excellent job with the work, which became a milestone in the creation of special effects. <br /> <br /> The film did not receive a great response when the big screen first appeared due to other alien films of that time, and therefore is not very well known. In fact, you can think of it as an almost unknown film. None of those whom I asked, heard about it. However, the film managed to survive for more than twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a lot, and besides a haircut, the film is still pretty much relevant. This film is considered a classic. <br /> <br /> This film is without a doubt one of mine, if not my favorite. I have seen it several times, but it’s as good as the first time I saw it. Like the Norwegian in this film, I don’t like what MacReady continues to call the Norwegians Swedes!
