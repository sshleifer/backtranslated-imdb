Latcho Drom - a cinematic review of gypsy music from several countries. It is touching, sad and joyful. Most of the segments seem to be completely uninstalled, not rehearsed. The music, from the sensual flamenco music of the Spanish Gypsies to the sad music of the Central European Gypsies, is very sophisticated. If you like gypsy music, you will find Latcho Drom absolutely beautiful. <br /> <br />
