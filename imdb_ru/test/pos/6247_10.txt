Well ... I've seen almost everything .... and some consider it a classic that should not be (like all those Halloween movies that suck shit or even Stephen King's trash) ....... and some are considered just fine, that it is really cool ..... (like a carnival of souls) ........ and then some are simply ignored ............ as (evil Ed) or (Pumpkin head and brain died, "Butt Court alone"), then one day a stick stuck into your head and never left ........... that's what it did to me ........ and my money is much better than in the last house after and ............ the last house was great until the end ... then he blew up the pieces ..... what kind of mannequin is the person who just killed his children was blown by a blowjob ... completely stupid. .. find the movie "bully" or even "funny games" if you want realism and slide out ....... ... but this damn thing has been stuck with me for years ......... Chuck Connors has always been scary ......... two Tanya Roberts - the best female victim ever ... ... three chicks being strangled in plaster is still one of the worst film kills of all time .. ...... and the 4th case with telekinet With my ability to explode my mind and become completely unexpected ....... not to mention the figures of wax figures of the puppet, etc ....... it should be right there with the loony, the last house, the Texas chainsaw and t .d ....... this is a classic .............. and deservedly so ...........
