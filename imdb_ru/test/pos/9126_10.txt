Jean-Pierre Melville’s Le Cercle Rouge talks about the lives of two criminals: Vogel (Jan-Marie-Volonte), a murderer who kills policemen while he is transported from one city to another by train; and Corey (Allen Delon), a thief just released from prison. Fate decides to join these two men to carry out an exciting robbery. In the background is Matey (André Burville), from whom Detective Vogel runs away, inexorable in his pursuit and sometimes ruthless in his methods. Along the film, the viewer meets other minor, but fascinating characters, the best of which is Jansen (Yves Montand), a disgraced ex-policeman and a great shooter. <br /> <br /> Melville has such a unique style that does not exist. You do not need to watch many of his films in order to gain popularity. Le Samourai, Un Flic and Le Cercle Rouge are clearly made from the same fabric: symmetrical corners; long shots; silence; coats, hats and cigars; quotes at the beginning; amazing looting, fatalism; stupid and inglorious criminal life. Everything that is wonderful in Melville is here in great shape. <br /> <br /> This time his shortcomings didn’t really bother me: the illogical, bewilderment of his characters and the confusing storytelling that prevent me from enjoying his other films here are almost invisible. Since Le Cercle Rouge was preceded by Un Flic, this does not mean that he recovered over time; maybe I'm just getting used to it and reach thinking when it doesn't bother me anymore. <br /> <br /> Melville made unique crime films. No matter how old they are, they show more ingenuity, realism and grace than modern techno-thrillers, in which tough thieves use James Bond’s computer systems and devices to commit impossible crimes. Melville's criminals are not cool: they are lonely, socially clumsy, and probably know that they are not good for much more than the planned robberies. They are undesirable for society, live at night, always one step ahead of the police in the game, which, as they know, will eventually lose. There is nothing romantic about them. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, for a movie of this type, the police are also not complete idiots. Matei is clever, cunning, patient and even compassionate. He is not an unlikely villain or cliché, he is just an old man who does his job and does it right. He knows when to use force, and when to use brains. Many films could learn from him. <br /> <br /> It is this down-to-earth, non-romantic style that makes Melville films so joyful to watch and puts him on a special pedestal as one of the great crime masters of cinema.
