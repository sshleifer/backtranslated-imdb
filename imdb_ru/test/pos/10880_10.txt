This is my favorite game for the Nintendo 64 platform. I played many different first-person shooters, and I never liked any of them, but there is something in this game that I can't understand, which makes it incredibly exciting. Maybe this is an extraordinary detail in the game. Maybe this is a smooth movement of characters. Maybe it's gadgets and weapons. Maybe this is the courteous character of James Bond. Be that as it may, this game never seems to get old, no matter how many times I play it.
