I had the chance to watch this film at an early Brea show, and since then I have been crazy about it. The film is based on Shakespeare's "The Twelfth Night," which I read, loved and saw on stage several times, so I certainly liked the links. But whether you like Shakespeare or not, it does not matter - the film is on the stage. This is super funny, witty and charming. Amanda Bynes is hilarious, as is David Cross. In fact, the whole cast is great - I'm just a big fan of David Cross. The cast is hot, and the soundtrack produces a lot of cool bands, and some of them I have not heard before, but I know that they have a CD, so I will definitely buy it. Everyone in our audience laughed from start to finish - all age groups. !!!!
