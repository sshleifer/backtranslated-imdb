Being a big fan of hip-hop and Turntablism from the very beginning, I always knew that I would love this movie. However, I was not prepared for how good the documentary really is. It covers almost all the important aspects of the only element of hip-hop that has been there since the very beginning. “History” begins in the early 70s and follows the evolution of the turning movement as an art right up to the beginning of 2000 (Turntablism fans will point this out as significant). <br /> <br /> Editing is almost a perfect movie. In addition to the excellent visual scratching techniques they used, the quick cut between the interview and the footage is fine, giving the pace of the film when necessary. Sound editing is also very good, with some nice wide sounds used to help with transitions. <br /> <br /> The absence of the narrator was also welcomed. We don't take on the story, and as a result, the audience can make their own assumptions easier. Every DJ has a different side to the story, and it's so interesting to hear about the unknown hip-hop stars, especially those who were there when hip-hop avoided the music business left, right and center. <Br /> <br /> Although there are many great things in this movie, I have a few flaws. The biggest of them is the absence of several famous DJs, such as Ca $ hMoney and Jazzy Jeff, as well as DJs from outside America, such as Scratch Perverts and DJ Noise. However, if you look at the DVD commentary (which I highly recommend), the producer and director will tell in detail how they regret not being able to show them. The removed scenes contain many interviews with Ca $ hMoney, Jazz Jeff and Scratch Perverts. <br /> <br /> This is by far the best documentary about the hip-hop culture and music I've seen. It stops to show the true potential of Turntablism; for this, I highly recommend checking out the DMC and ITF video. However, this is a minor controversy. I highly recommend this movie, not least for the phat soundtrack, with great music. (9/10)
