A film about a girl who does not go to the fire just because on this night she is sitting with a child. There is nothing strange in this, right? Bye ... Phone is ringing. Bye ... The phone is ringing again. And again ... And again. This is not some silly jokes. This is for real. If you want to see the reaction of the girl, just watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Great atmosphere filled with scary sounds. Very well performed by young Camilla Belle, who won the lead role. I see great potential in her to become a good actress. It's more than just a decent thriller, I have no idea why he is so undervalued. In any case, in my opinion, this film deserves more than 4/10. 24% of all voters rated the film as 1. Get serious, people. You could not get the best thriller for such a title.
