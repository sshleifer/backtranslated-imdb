This is the very first Three Stooges shorts with Schempe, which I saw, and he is one of my favorites! <br /> <br /> This is what I really liked about Schempe, when he returned after Curly’s punch, he didn’t try to be like Curly, he was his own character, and I admire it! Shemp is my favorite third puppet, I like him more than Curly, but I like Curly more than Shemp. Shemp is great, he's funny, he's stupid, he's SHEMP! <br /> <br /> I really liked the scene where he threw the nickel, and Mo sat in the cockpit with him to find him, and as a result they got entangled in the wires and really suffered a lot! <br /> <br /> But what I really thought was scary when Shemp had a broken face on the glass of a telephone booth, he looked like an ugly professor Snape! <br /> <br /> Poor Shemp, he has had a lot of bad things to happen to him in this short time, but these are typical “Three Puppets”, a lot of bad things always happen to them! <br /> <br /> This short film is another one that must be seen for Three Stooges fans! <br /> <br /> 10/10
