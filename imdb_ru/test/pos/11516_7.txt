“The Fires of New York” initially began as an experimental short video of the Vitaphone with two drums, which eventually turned into the first full-length film. Helen Costelle allegedly was one of the most beautiful Hollywood actresses and sister (in my opinion, a real beauty) Dolores Costello, who seemed to have received all the charms. Poor Helen is best known for starring in this rather boring film that brought revolution to Hollywood! <br /> <br /> Two bootleggers on a Main Street treadmill convince a couple of small town hairdressers to try their luck on Broadway. Eddie (Cullen Landis) and Jean (Eugene Palette), hairdressers, do not realize that their hairdresser’s will soon become a cover for illegal bootlegging. Soon they understand this and regret the day when they left their small town. The only thing that supports them is the credit Eddie’s mother gave them and which they desperately want to repay. Eddie again meets Kitty Lewis (Helen Costello), a girl from his hometown who felt good on Broadway. Kitty worries about “Hawk” Miller (Wheeler Ockman), who always hangs around her, but Eddie innocently thinks she is exaggerating, because “Hawk” already has a girlfriend Molly (Gladys Brockwell), but to calm her down, he gives her a little gun scare unwanted fans. The “hawk” who killed the cop and brings the “feds” closer decides to substitute Eddie. Meanwhile, Molly is fed up with treating her "Hawks" and after the showdown, where he tells her that he needs a chicken, not an old chicken, for which the scene is Killing !!! <br /> <br /> The fact is that it’s not really terrible, except for the fact that the gangsters and dancers perform in the same way in their best voices of eloquence, and this is still happening in films in 1930. Gladys Brockwell (if a bit melodramatic) and Eugene Palitra (quite naturally) were fine and were the most experienced actors in the cast. Neither John nor Ethel Barrymore was visible - Cullen Landis and Helen Costello soon returned to the darkness from which they emerged. I also did not notice much of the “hidden microphone” —when people needed to be grouped around different subjects, such as a telephone or sitting on a sofa, before they could start a conversation. People who saw this in the cinema probably began to think that all the policemen were talking in such a flat monotone, since this tendency continued in many early conversations, for example, in Little Caesar (1930). In any case, they were probably intrigued by the novelty of a fully conversational film - with some songs and dances - of a 1928 film. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
