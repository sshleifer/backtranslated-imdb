In the world of "short" (most of which are not), this film is a pearl. <br /> <br /> A quiet, laconic look into the world of a young woman reading a blind woman, this is star Elizabeth Franz - this film contains textures, layers and visual narration of a beautifully painted still life. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is minimal, the cinema is awesome, and the direction is confident, clear and convincing. I saw this film at a film festival held in the noisy and crowded bar Tribeca - and during the first two minutes (and for the first time this night) the crowd subsided. <br /> <br /> This speaks for itself
