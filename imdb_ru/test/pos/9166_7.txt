This film turned out to be much better than I expected. After a couple of Will Smith films that weren't as good as me, Robot, he again became likeable and funny about it. Smith plays, Hitch, doctor's date. Most of the film is about how he teaches Albert to be himself and to meet Allegra Cole, the rich celebrity with whom he works. Albert is stupid and stupid and always stumbles on his feet or something else. All that Hitch does is teach him how to behave more abruptly and not be nervous around Allegra. <br /> <br /> During all this, Hitch meets with Sarah, a gossip columnist who curses people. Hitch fascinates her, so of course they come out. But Hitch can teach other guys how to make a girl fall in love with them, he doesnâ€™t believe in love. He has never had a girlfriend since he was dumped in college. But he likes Sarah, so she continues to haunt her. Sarah's friend suffered from a guy who, in her opinion, went to see a doctor. So Sarah tracks down the doctor, only to find out his stop. So of course she thinks he is a pig. Then it's time to explain to Sarah and Allegre what he does, so they both forgive. <br /> <br /> CONCLUDING REMARKS: Well, laughs a little and entertains. I recommend it.
