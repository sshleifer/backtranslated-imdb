If all films were to be destroyed and only one could be saved, Death in Venice should have been that. This is a monument in the history of cinema. We are criticized for being slow, boring and too obvious in presenting their essence (the old man discovers beauty in a young boy and tragically collapses, first mentally and then physically), we must appreciate this film for what it is. Morte a Venezia was shot dead over 30 years ago, and it depicts a period even further, at the beginning of the twentieth century. <br /> <br /> Life was then slow compared to the current. People had to behave in a certain way, hiding their true emotions even from themselves. Directed by Visconti and Dirk Bogard, the lead actor, excellently show how the aging composer von Ashenbach reveals his romantic interest in a little boy. For a man like von Ashenbach, at one time it was too strong a shock to be put up with. We see his inner struggle, mainly on the face of Bogard, against the backdrop of beautiful Venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music written by Gustav Mahler. <br /> <br /> This film is slow, it can not be denied, no special effects, car chases or fights to keep the audience in their places. No perverted sex scenes either; The interaction between a man and a boy is limited to stolen looks from afar and a casual smile. <br /> <br /> So, in principle, nothing special happens in this movie? Not if you want your feelings to beat like a base drum. If you want them to play like strings of a violin in a romantic concert, this is the film that does it.
