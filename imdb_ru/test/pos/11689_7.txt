Wow. At first I thought who wrote these things! How difficult is this choice between a man who offers you and your children wealth, respectability and security, unlike a husband who offers you only oppression, violence, humiliation and poverty. However, our choice is not always as clear as you might think. Indeed, the rich gentleman was everything a woman could strive for, and yet ... the attraction of her husband, her sexual desire for him was almost overwhelming. What to do, what to do ?? As a spectator, you were just as confused and confused as she was. Anyway, I actually came to this site to find out what my admiration for the English voice is, although in fact it is the voice of the Irish singer in the film. Looking at him, I discovered that it was Glen Hansard, whom I had never heard of before. What a find I am so grateful. Wow, what a voice! What a day! Thank you BIFF!
