In the middle of a documentary about his parents, the director's mother dies, but he continues to make a documentary, revealing a story he did not expect. The result is a thrilling drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of the word, where the cute but not knowing narrator unwittingly gives the audience privileges. Thus, the narrative has a double weaving, a story of a documentary and a story of a director. <br /> <br /> We admire the director, not only because we stubbornly pursue his story, although we put his whole idea at risk. the relationship of his parents, but also to never give in to sensationalism or melodrama. Although the Hollywood items are hidden in the details, Doug Block treats history as much as everyday life. For those of us who have always thought about the lives of our parents before we went on stage (or after we arrived, but, although we were too self-absorbed to notice that they lived independently of us), 51 Birch Street gives a fair warning: There are amazing things in the country, but be careful if you decide to go in there. <br /> <br /> But this is a warning for the public to slowly wander through the details of their parents' past. This is not a warning for those who offered to look into the lives of Blokâ€™s parents. The film surprises when the mother comes to life as an energetic and passionate, but introspective person who makes their informed decisions during the 50s. The special success of the director is that the audience really sees a young woman behind an elderly parent and grandmother and grandfather. We all know that our parents were once young and energetic, but at 51 Birch Street there is a mother. The father, who was distant while the director and his sister grew up, ultimately remains distant in the film, but this is due more to his elusive character than to his image. This biography has turned the autobiography into a dramatic, rich and unforgettable. She will probably send viewers a closer look at their own family albums, but will not dare to look at the downsides of these photos.
