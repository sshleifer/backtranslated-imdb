I see nothing wrong with this movie. Of course, the main singers may not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they certainly can carry the melody. Bert Baharah and Hal David are talented songwriters, and I really like their songs, especially “The world is a circle,” “Things I won't miss,” and “Ask me, the answer. Some people claim that the choreography of Hermes Pan is terrible and that the snowy mountains look as if they were made of plastic; I disagree on both points. I have seen powder snow before, and the snow in those mountain scenes looked realistic to me. And most of all, in defense of this film, it is suitable for a family audience (at least, I remember that it was when I saw him at Christmas a few years ago). With all the resentment about sex and violence in the movies these days, I am pleased to note that this film deserves a G-rating. And they do not utter this disgusting word "F" every ten minutes, like some movies I've seen. Thank God. Thus, although this film may not be a cup of tea for everyone, it has a certain value, and I give it ten points out of ten possible. This is my story and I stick to it.
