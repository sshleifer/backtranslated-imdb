This is an excellent film in which the problem of racism is solved in a delicate and balanced way. Great performances, but absolutely outstanding actor play Sidney Poitier. <br /> <br /> He makes this movie alive and alive. His image of a guy who fights against discrimination and violence is just overwhelming. His actions are strong, delicate and thin at the same time. A truly worthy Oscar, Poitiers had to wait (because of the color of his skin) for many more years before the Academy recognized the sheer brilliance of his game. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes also played superbly, shot, worried and realistic, as it became his hallmark. He and Poitiers superbly oppose the forces of cowardice, courage and human transformation through friendship. <br /> <br /> The film is enjoyable and at the same time deeply intimidating the image of racism in the United States. The irony is that this somehow reflects the realities in which Poitiers was supposed to work.
