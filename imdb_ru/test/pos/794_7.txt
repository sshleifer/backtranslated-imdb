This Metro film is episodic, but represents an almost constant series of harassment, mostly in an attempt to escape from the police, real or imagined, since Buster is mistaken for an escaped criminal. It is consistently inventive and interesting. Its greatest value lies in documenting what Hollywood looked like in the early twenties, since 95% of it is filmed on the street among the streets and builds the exterior of that time. There is one gemstone moment and one sequence of gems here. <br /> <br /> A great moment is when a train at a long distance quickly approaches the camera and finally stops just next to it - Buster sits gloomily on the catcher for cows and thus, moving from a long shot to a close-up view seconds <br /> <br /> Excellent consistency occurs with the phone booth next to the elevator - one is constantly taken for the other with floor-to-floor racing - one of Keaton's great jokes. <br /> <br /> Print Cinema is clear and sharp - almost untouched. There is accompaniment for violin / piano. This is one to seek and enjoy.
