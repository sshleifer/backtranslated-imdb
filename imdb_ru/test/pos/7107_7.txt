"House of Dracula" is not so bad in the film, and sometimes it is pretty decent. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Arrive at the house of Dr. Franz Edelmann (Onslow Stevens) in his seaside house, Count Dracula, (John Carradine), carefully looking for a cure for vampirism. He begins work on a potential medicine related to blood transfusion, and the wolf man Lawrence Talbot (Lon Cheney, Jr.) arrives at his estate searching for a cure for lycanthropy. Working with two patients, he discovers a possible cure in the mold found near the laboratory, and after searching the area, he discovers a Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange) buried nearby. Becoming obsessed with the rebirth of this, Dr. Edelmann continues to disregard the requests of Dracula and Larry, and after they demanded that they heal instead of working on Monster, they join each other during the disassembly. <br /> <br /> Good news: it was a pretty decent movie. There is one main idea that is quite creative and creative. This is the first film in which the idea of ​​vampirism as a blood disease is openly proposed, and one that can be passed from person to person through the exchange of bodily fluids, something that could be considered in later genre works, but rarely as directly as that, there is even a parasite microscope slide, which is believed to be responsible for the condition. This works in some fairly well-used ideas and seems like a pretty elegant idea, even if some of the performances are a bit outdated. The fact that each of the creatures has at least one outstanding scene is a well-made idea. The Wolf Man has a wonderful scene where he turns inside the prison cell into doubting members of a search party and goes crazy. Dracula’s initial appearance in the form of a bat and flying to a sleeping figure, and then appearing in human form looks really impressive. The rampage of monsters is well handled and the corresponding amount of damage caused. The big bat that Dracula turns into always looks decent and quite realistic. This is quite a decent deal. <br /> <br /> Bad news: there are a few things that are not so good at it. The fact that the film brings together so many potentially intriguing plots and ideas that he really does not know what to do with them. There are several different histories that should be mixed together and that should be clear enough to go well with each other and appear coherent. It really has none of this. The plot is rather unconvincing and in fact does not give preferential treatment to any of the stars, instead it concentrates on one, and then on the other, and then includes all three in the final. It seems that the monsters only embrace each other for the smallest reason, which is very distracting. The ending this time is a big disappointment, and it looks like it changed at the last minute. There are a few small things that were not so impressive, and to a large extent also contribute to this. <br /> <br /> Final Verdict: This is a pretty decent movie, and it manages to survive most of the time with an entertaining style. It does not matter, the classic status of the debut functions of each monster, but it is quite a good watch for fans of monsters and Universal films in general. <br /> <br /> Today's Rating-PG: Violence
