Peter Coyote was the only name I recognized from the cast list, so I didnâ€™t really want to watch this movie. The only comment on IMDb was positive, so I watched it late on television. I would recommend this movie as a good late night viewing. This is better than many of this genre. The plot is excellent, the acting is not brilliant, but not bad. I usually don't like memories, but they work in this film. As I said, I did not recognize a single cast by name, but I recognized Michelle Lee, who showed decent and hard work as a woman who wants to support her man who lies to her. (Was it Knots Landing?) In any case, she is very well dressed. Note: you might like it more if you miss the first few seconds of credits. I did, and it helped me. When you see the end credits, you get what I mean. The character Wayne Kennedy, who is really strange, takes this value to 7, not 6.
