I admit that I have been a fan of Harrison Ford for many, many years, so I was not surprised that I liked his performance here. But I also enjoyed the storyline, and thought that the casting was done well. I don't know if I buy Kristin Scott Thomas as a congressman, but she is a good actress and a beautiful woman. I noticed her in the first Mission Impossible. Although her role was small, she appeared on the screen. <br /> <br /> Here she and Ford play people whose spouses died in a plane crash. They sit together, and this is where the plot takes off. Obviously, Ford, a police detective from Washington, USA, discovers that his wife had an affair. He also discovers that the affair originated with the husband of a congressman from New England. <br /> <br /> This story takes on many plots, since Ford and Thomas are united in exposing their marriages, disclosing deception and pure grief and anger because of the loss of a loved one. <br /> <br /> I think the film is worth it to shoot or catch on the cable.
