This short film, directed and starring Rutger Hauer, was based on a short story by the Dutch writer Harry Merlisch. <br /> <br /> After 10 minutes of the film you will see all your life as “Harry” reveals his long-time passion for the room, which he constantly passes in his youth. Returning to the city many years later, he found that he had rented the same room. <br /> <br /> Using black and white film, textures are emphasized in this delicate tale story. The voice of "Harry" draws you into your world. <br /> <br /> A subtle, intense rendition of Rutger Hauer and two non-speaking characters. Wonderful soundtrack from the Dutch musician Dyzack. <br /> <br /> At the moment it’s difficult to see this film, as it is only available on DVD region 2 “L'infidele” (Liv Ullmann) as a bonus track. But it should appear on the re-released DVD "The Hitcher" - another hard, but very excellent performance from Hauer! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you can!
