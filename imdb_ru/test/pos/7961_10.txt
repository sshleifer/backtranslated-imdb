The last time I checked in here, I think there was no more than one comment. I am very glad that more and more people caught this film now, and all the more, you all dug it too. I caught it on the night of Christmas 2004 and found that I could not change the channel on my TV, although it was an Asian film, and I, unfortunately, really used to not give anyone any chance. Hollywood products. However, I made this night and deeply thank God for that. I have not been able to shake this film out of my system since then - not what I tried or wanted - and it still amazes me - in an extremely grateful way - that such a wonderful, beautiful experience came in such a way, quite unexpectedly, Christmas miracle. Please, if you have the opportunity to go see this movie, buy it or rent a bootleg or something else, but watch it. I guarantee it will affect you. I have no time, but I have not finished my assessment here, so I will return as soon as I can.
