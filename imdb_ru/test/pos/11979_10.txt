This film deserves 10 points, which I give him. <br /> <br /> But this is not 10 points that you would give to films like “The Godfather”, “Goodfell” or “Psycho”. This is the type of 10 you give to a film that makes you laugh again and again! This is the most terribly written and uncut film, but it can not but entertain. It has the most amateur effects, but you enjoy every moment! I saw this movie today on TV and I didn’t want to leave! Read the following dialogue to find out why! <br /> <br /> (There is a college around Manisha that just attempted rape, and the guys who tried to rape ask for forgiveness) <br /> <br /> Bad guy 1: Please forgive us! <br /> <br /> Bad guy 2: Yes, we will not do it again. <br /> <br /> (Maneesha does not respond) <br /> <br /> Akshay: Forgive them! <br /> <br /> Maneesha: I don’t know ... <br /> <br /> Akshay: You are a beautiful woman, and even dead men can excite you! And these are live young men! Do not blame them! <br /> <br /> Puncholi: Yes, Maneesha .. <br /> <br /> Maneesha (Sunielu): What if they try to rape your girl ??? <br /> <br /> Suniel: I would break their arms and legs and kill them. But in any case, just forgive them. <br /> <br /> Akshay: Yes, if you do not forgive them, then you will be too arrogant about your beauty! <br /> <br /> Now this is a real masterpiece of dialogue! This film never ceases to entertain, mainly because there are so many stupid things and unreal situations in it! A bad guy (Munish) can do almost anything. He can blow a sandstorm out of his mouth, or he can take a motorcycle from his back and just as easily make it disappear again. <br /> <br /> Each actor speaks in turn ... One line from Akshay, then from Suniel, then from Arshad, then from Aftab, then from Nigam. This is the main rule followed by the director, so equal screen time is given to each guy. And then there is a powerful suspension that can make even a high-speed car pass through you without your harm! All this makes the film enjoyable, and I can watch it again and again. I think that this film can enter the hall of fame comedies, if there is one. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that he didn’t try to be funny.
