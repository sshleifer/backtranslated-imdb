This is a well-made story with beautiful music, lots of dancing, a lot of interaction between the older and younger sisters (almost all of it is positive) and lots of desires. There are funny moments that older children and adults will enjoy, for example, when King Randolph exclaims: “They're just SHOES! Isn't that so? ”And such tender moments as, for example, when Princess Genevieve comforts her younger sister Lacy after a slip. <br /> <br /> The animation may not be as good as Disney’s, but still very good. The facial expressions are nuanced, especially for Genevieve, King Randolph, Duchess Rowena and her servants, Derek the shoemaker and little Princess Lacy. The only thing I can say about the animation is dance sequences, where dancing princesses become absolute exact copies of each other without the slightest deviation - even the three youngest copies dance steps perfectly. I would like to see a little more individualism in dancing, given that these girls are not professional ballet dancers or choristers. <br /> <br /> The solution to this story is thoughtful to get rid of the villainy without actually hurting it. In this story, the guards are abused, and the villain monkey is evil for other animals in the story. <br /> <br /> My 4-year-old daughter loves this film and watched it repeatedly, and I found it quite acceptable for her to watch.
