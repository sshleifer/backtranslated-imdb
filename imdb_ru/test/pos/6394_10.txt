This show is wonderful for many reasons. On this day, the father and mother can communicate with their children. It is so great to see a real family, and not some sultry replay family. I watched it once and got hooked. It's so great to see a black family on TV that is worth watching. This show came out too soon, but at the exit it concerned pregnancy, sex, drugs, bad dates, death, etc. Great show for the whole family ... I can't tell you how many times I sat, watched this show late at night and sometimes laughed. Great pg 13 rated show. I really liked this show.
