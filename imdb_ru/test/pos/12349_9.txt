In fact, I first watched “One Dark Night” in the theater and wrote a review of the film for my school newspaper. Then I liked it, and I still love it. The storyline revolves around two people. First of all, one woman finds out that her father has telekenis after his death. She then feels affection for the strange powers of her father, even after his death. The mausoleum in which he is buried takes another main person, a high school student, doing everything possible to join a group of girls who just want to torture her and dare her to stay in the mausoleum all night to join their group. They return at night to scare her and find fears for themselves. The cast is led by Meg Tilly with supporting roles for Adam West and one of my favorites, Elizabeth Daily, also known as E.G. Daily. Check it out, if you like 80s movies and raw horror movies, you will not be disappointed.
