Well, unfortunately, I can't help but feel a little disappointed after my very, very much anticipated viewing of Just Before Dawn. Jeff Lieberman is a terrific director, and he undoubtedly can do great things with a small budget, but I nevertheless expected to see a much more sadistic and horrible slasher of the early 80s. But in fact, I'm starting to think that it's not Lieberman who is to blame, but WE! It is more than obvious that Lieberman intended to make his view of the backslider slasher look like “Liberation” and absolutely NOT like “Friday the 13th”, which the subzhan extremely popularized a year ago. The horror and constant sense of threat mostly does not come from crazy maniacs with their machetes, but from truly sinister and isolated Oregon forests where this film was made. In the event that the film seems slow and without incident, it is only because Lieberman is not in a hurry to present the dark forests and eerie mountains as additional characters in his film. We almost never see the murderers personally, but it always seems that someone is luring from behind trees or from under mountain lakes. Taking this into account, “Just Before Dawn” becomes an extremely admirable effort and is actually much better than its modern blood-soaked colleagues. Among the almost endless selection of bloody and disgusting slashers, Lieberman successfully focuses on tension and character development. The plot revolves around five-twenty-something friends going on a camping holiday in the forests of Oregon, where one of them owns a small piece of land. Forests are deserted, and, of course, tourists ignore the advice of forest ranger Roy (George Kennedy!) Return to civilization. Soon after, they are brutally confronted by an inbred family, whose twin sons are prone to murder. All five main characters are surprisingly pleasant and convincing! There are no annoying stereotypes for which you still do not feel sympathy, such as dissolute girls or football athletes. As a result of this “natural” character, you automatically support them, even when they eventually turn into savages themselves. Excellent camera work provides the film with an sometimes unbearable level of tension, and the frightening electronic rating of Brad Fidel only adds to this effect. “Before Dawn” is a great bit of horror from the early 80s, if you don’t want blood to drip from your TV.
