Dan Breeze Mannen is one of the best films of all time and tells about a man trapped in a world in which there are no feelings, no feelings, no love, no truth, and definitely no freedom. A world in which people begin to fear when someone expresses his opinion, expresses himself or shows affection, a world in which no one is free and no one has any idea what all this means. Just as the world in which we live, the world in Den Breeze Mannen is a world of lost souls trying to achieve satisfaction, but focus on the exact opposite of what satisfies them, materialism, social acceptance and mediocre satisfaction. > Den Breeze Mannen deserves the full attention of every human soul, because we could all use a fresh wake up call.
