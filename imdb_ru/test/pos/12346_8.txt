The famous and mysterious hermit Reimar, who is a kind of deadly telekinetic psychic vampire, suddenly dies under strange circumstances. Pretty high school student Julie Wells (warm and sympathetic performance by beautiful Meg Tilly) desperately wants to be accepted by the snobbish clique of “Sisters” (played by Luli Speets, Robin Evans and ever-pleasant Elizabeth Daly with contented bitch perfection), so she agrees to spend the night she and her mother and her child in the evening, she will join her child. where Raymar’s body was buried as part of an initiation ceremony. Naturally, Reymar still has his extraordinary abilities, so it will be a very long and painful night of pure nervous horror for poor Julia. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter / co-writer Tom McLaughlin (who later gave us a pleasant mocking “Friday, 13th part VI: Jason is alive” (“Jason Lives”) avoids a graphic smell in favor of creating a brooding and creepy atmosphere, but not able to accomplish this particular feat, because the first hour is too slow, talkative, and without incident to be remotely scary or disturbing. Nevertheless, I still found this spoiled fright film strangely attractive and interesting. Large fluffy hairstyles, stupid follower awesome montage of music, poorly planned false fears (including a ubiquitous hand on your shoulder!), a scene in a brilliant video game arcade, children happily smoke pot, and a cheerful blunt jargon on a teenager (“dummy”) Brain "!?) give this picture some charmingly strange 80's charm: Hal Trussella's beautiful, polished cinematography (especially I pulled out the smoothly sliding Steadicam tracking footage), eerie, but at the same time, funny hum'n'shiver synthesizer and amazingly eerie makeup of Tom Berman - everything is in order. Infinite Adam West of the television fame "Batman" simply takes place in nothing of the secondary part. The mausoleum creates an impressively wide and disturbing location. The grand finale, with a bunch of horribly rotting corpses protruding from their coffins and floating around, qualifies as an amazingly creepy drum kit. Undoubtedly, this child is definitely not some undeservedly unrecognized gem, but he still delivers a lot of pleasant silly and distracting fun fun.
