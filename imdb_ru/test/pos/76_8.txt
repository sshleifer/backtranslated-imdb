I suppose I like this movie as much as I know; she is not perfect, but under the title “Americanization of Lily” this charming and memorable semi-musical satire that I could offer was rated more highly and is still loved by those who recognized her special, created by Blake Edwards spirit of meekness, intelligent humor and solid story. Incredibly, the adorable storyline follows Lily Smith, a fringe-type spy for the Germans in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; Lily Schmidt, passing as Smith, helps her uncle, who is also patriotic for Germany, but not cruel and not political, but simply opportunistic. Lily's goal is William Larrabi, a charismatic commander of the US squadron who can provide her with valuable information. The plot thickens when Lily falls in love with Larrabi, opens her eyes to the consequences of her spy game, sees the consequences of a battle for the wounded in the hospital and understands what this may mean for his men, with whom she has met, and like it. She envies her opponent for Larrabi's affection, then realizes that she can no longer do what she did and abandons the spy business. The logical end of the film comes when, after the terrible World War I ended, when she sings in the gloomy theater the main song of the film “Desire”, members of Larrabi’s squadron, including her lover himself, appear one after another, indicating that they have forgiven her and their former opponents; and even uncle Kurt enthusiastically joins the singing “It's a Long Time” to show that everything is in order with the world. This is a bold and sometimes brilliant plot idea, written by director Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatti from John Goldfarb. and this is a wonderful story. Larrabi Squadron, including the drunk who continues to fall, and other cute types who inhabit this lively film; and the feeling of this stylish and vivid film is almost epic, both in its scale and in its realization. We must pay tribute to Jack Bear and Donald Brooks for their creation of costumes, Reg Allen and Jack Stevens for the sets, Fernando Carrere for another beautiful staged design, Henry Mancini for his sensitive and suitable musical score and Russell Harlan for his brilliant cinematography. In great shots, the main actors are Julie Andrews as Lily, Rock Hudson as Larrabi, Keremi Kemp as Uncle Lily Kurt, Michael Whitney, Lance Percival as the intoxicating pilot, the magnificent Gloria Paul as the stripper Lily and many other great actors in the smaller ones parts. It is difficult to say enough good words about the pace or tricks of the broad comedy; This element was introduced by Edwards to ferment the horrors of real war, for example, the almost comic operatic approach by which people began the war in the more innocent era of human civilization. This comedy also helps set the stage for Lily to turn from uncritically accepting debt to the German state before accepting the reality of what she is doing and potentially what she might be causing. This is a rare film about “life” about “Americanization” of Lily, her statement about herself in the real world, and then about others, before a tragedy can happen. I find it attractive and beautiful in many ways. I consider this a masterpiece by Blake Edwards; and under the name “Americanization of Lily”, I believe, it is unlikely with any changes that it could be recognized as a polished sapphire film, by all standards known to me.
