I came out of the Dark Blue World, feeling (sighing) “so sad,” but still it was definitely a film that needed to be made, and it was really well made from Czech Republic. This is interesting, despite the "sad" premise. He is full of feelings, friendships and, undoubtedly, true friendship between the two main characters - one matured lieutenant pilot (Ondrej Vetchi as Frances) and a young and very impatient novice pilot (Christoph Hadek as Karel), the inevitable love triangle and a reminder of the grim prison situation in Czechoslovakia in the 50s. This is all in one film, filmed by his father, screenwriter and son of director Zdenek and Jan Sverak (previous achievement - “Kohl”). <br /> <br /> This is not as long as East-West (French Est-Ouest) 1999, which was a heartbreaking, multi-layered story about a returning Russian doctor and the misfortunes of a French wife after World War II in Russia. The plot of "Tmavomodrý svet" (the name in Czech) is quite simple and has a light humor. Music, songs of the Great Patriotic War, sung in Czech language, modest special effects of pilots and aircraft in the sky are not as carefully thought out as in Hollywood - there is no need to constantly beat, beat, thunder, demonstrating scenes of air battles. Sadness was explained at the beginning (two paragraphs in English) and completed with the subsequent paragraphs. The film is not fully subtitled, only when translating conversations in Czech - everything else is in English, whether in British or Czech style. (So ​​this is a foreign film with English and includes British actors.) <br /> <br /> Three main performances, especially two Czech pilots, were wonderfully presented. There are nuances between them, although he is relentlessly adult and young. I always appreciate Tara Fitzgerald: yes, there is the 1996 Brassed Off along with Evan MacGregor and Pete Postletveyt; remembered her from Listen to my song in 1991 along with Adrian Dunbar and Ned Beattie; along with Hugh Grant in the 1994 Sirens and “The Englishman Who Rises from the Hill and Descends from the Mountain” 1995, in addition to her appearance in the PBS Masterpiece Theater mini-series. <br /> <br /> “So sad” is the fact that heroes defending their country can be so badly doomed for so long (40 years). Thank God for worthy memories and unforgettable prints of friendship. Hence the pause for a ray of sunshine through a stained glass window (ironically, or a coincidence that this is a church where hard work was going on) is a symbol of hope, never give up ?? <br /> <br /> Other recent films that have stories had to be told: “Kandahar” (with Nelofer Pazira as Nafas, a Canadian from Afghanistan traveling to Kandahar with a personal “mission”), more than look for the veil of the Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf. “Everything is connected” (with Radha Mitchell as a new mother who faced SID - the sudden death of a child), an insightful film by the Swiss director Mark Forster and he was talked a lot about the scandalous film “Monsters' Ball” (I haven't caught yet) with Halle Berry Billie Bob Thornton and Peter Boyle. Watch movies without prior expectations or comparisons with movies before. Just have a look.
