A film that tends to be buried under prejudice and prejudice - This is a remake! Doris Day is at it! She sings! - Hitchcock's second track in the film “The Man Who Knew Too Much” is his film with the most undervalued rating, and, perhaps, a full-fledged masterpiece in itself. <br /> <br /> This is, in many ways, the Doris Day movie. Not only did she give the best performance in her career, more than alone against James Stewart, but the entire film is finely structured around her character, not his. In the end, this is a film in which music is both a motive and a plot. What could be better than casting the most popular singer of her generation? Think of it: Joe McKenna of Day abandoned her career on stage to live with her husband and raise a son. It seems to be a mutual decision, and she does not look unhappy. But look at how Stuart teases her in the horse-drawn carriage because of her concern for Louis Bernard, implying that she is jealous that Bernard did not ask her any questions about her career. This is clearly a repetitive joke between them - she replies “har-de-har-har”, which means familiarity with this gag, suggesting that she has a certain hidden resentment about her conclusion, and that they both are aware of this. br /> <br /> After kidnapping her son Stewart insists on doping her before telling her the news. This is a brutal scene, brilliantly played by both actors, which illustrates the imbalance of power in their marriage - he seeks to control and restrain her reaction, in essence, using his professional knowledge to suppress her voice in marriage just as his medical career suppressed his singing career . <br /> <br /> The potential of this voice is demonstrated in the sequence of Ambrose's chapel, when she has to reign in her highly qualified clarity and loudness to harmonize with the gathering of female slums - they almost act as a warning about what will happen to her continue to suppress his talent. In Albert Hall, she needs to cry, train these impressive lungs that save a person's life, and in the final of the Embassy, ​​it is her talent and reputation that allow them to find their son. On the contrary, all male activity of Stuart is counterproductive - his visit to the taxidermist reached a dead end, he remained in the church, and all the rest went to Albert Hall, and his efforts there only managed to kill the murderer, thus depriving the police of potentially useful information. Only when his actions join the voice of his wife, saving Hank from the embassy, ​​does he really manage to do something useful. <br /> <br /> Far from being forced to film, to give Day the opportunity to sing “Que Sera Sera” acts as the first musical device in the film, foreshadowing a nightmare that is about to swallow up McKennas; “The future is not ours to see” really. It also neatly sets the stage for the finale, in which the close ties between mother and son through music will allow Doris to save the day. <br /> <br /> The most famous sequence in the film makes music a central feature - preparation for the assassination attempt at Albert Hall. This long wordless sequence may be the only most unusual thing that Hitchcock did for the film, the highest expression of his belief that films should be narratives told visually. We see people talking in such a sequence, but we never hear the word they say. We do not need - the images say it all. It is also its most sophisticated indecisive sequence, with parts moving slowly into place as the music builds. Editing is incredibly dense, perfect for music. There is no frame inappropriate - everything that is not directly related to the murder, gives the viewer a sense of the environment, the geography in which all this takes place. It is built slowly, but by the end the wait becomes almost unbearable. When Joe screams, it's not just a relief for her, but for the audience. <br /> <br /> The sequence of the Ambrose chapel is witty and especially effective for all those who had to serve in the especially non-conformist church "fill in the mud." The Embassy sequence seems a bit flat after Albert Hall preceded it at first viewing, but the second time actually seems more effective, with a final walk at gunpoint, really benefiting from the magnificent use of Day's singing in the background, reminiscent of music like ambient noise in the "rear window". The score is generally small, which makes it possible to effectively identify music from screen sources. <br /> <br /> Bernard Miles is a humble villain, a bit trite, but with a dry mind. He eclipsed Brenda de Banzi as his wife, who draws a fine line between the sinister and sympathetic. Just look at how she smokes a cigarette while her husband prepares the killer - her position is a pure gangster spectacle contrary to the appearance of Middle England, but she clearly has a soft side and, perhaps, motherly feelings for Hank. <br /> Stewart is superb, although if Hitchcock really always used him as “Philistine,” as the director’s daughter seems to think, this confirms that Hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience. Stewart played the hypocritical intellectual who supported the Fascist ideology in Rope, the voyeur who mistreated his girlfriend in the back window, and the obsessed necrophilist in Vertigo. The day is nothing short of phenomenal. Just look at her reaction to the news that her son was kidnapped - she never overzeals anything, but she does not sell it for short. This is one of Hitchcock's most emotionally effective films. He never lets us forget what the stakes are for McKennas; they feel most full of people from all its central characters.
