This is an amazing film, and it is very clever in the use of several actors and scenery. It is also very shocking - physical and psychological torture (both explicit and implied) are mixed with calm and even funny sites. So horror is always unexpected and cruel. I'm not soft, but it would be the most shocking movie I've ever seen. The message of this film is definitely delivered with a sledgehammer. This is a film about which I will always remember both actors.
