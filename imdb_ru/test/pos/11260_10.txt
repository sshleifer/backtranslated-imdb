What can I say? I couldn't sleep, and I came across this movie on MTV. I began to watch it with every intention to change the channel if it began to limp, as many anti-drug films do, but I got involved in this film and could not stop watching. Nick Stahl did an amazing job with his character, and in my opinion, he really made the film worth seeing. I was interested in acquiring the soundtrack for the film (or even the film itself), and MTV.com did not help, but, believe it or not, Amazon.com is taking pre-orders for the release of the film on August 5 on DVD, I know that it was difficult track it down, and I'm sure that other people might have the same problem. I buy my own copy so that I can drool at Nick Steel, while at the same time stunning my eyes thanks to the emotional storyline!
