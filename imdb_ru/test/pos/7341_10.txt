Thank you for such a wonderful escape. This is what I love about movies. I am so impressed with the live films, the way they were shot, and the time was so dynamically perfect with the music. Being a dancer himself, and being part of many dance films, choreography is usually cut, diced, and sometimes even rhythm ..... "Showgirls" film. Relationships between ladies are always present in the movement. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the last one when it is stopped. I saw the movie before, another version, and the last time I no longer loved my husband. This time I felt a little sorry for him. It changes my attitude towards the birds of female love. It's all so magical.
