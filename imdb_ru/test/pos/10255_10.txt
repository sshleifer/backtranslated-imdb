Coolie High is considered one of my best films ever. It certainly reminds me of the days of my youth in Cleveland and Chicago in the early, mid and late 1960s. What happened to Brenda and Puter? Someone has to track down these two. Brenda for her beauty and Puter for his innocent wit. They both deserve recognition even 31 years after the debut of this film. I think many fans of this film would like to know what happened to them, as well as to others who played in this funny film. I, of course, think that this film should be introduced into some type of movie. All the actors of this film were great. My opinion on "Coolie High" is to turn the clock back, these were fun years.
