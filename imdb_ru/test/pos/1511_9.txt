“The Cat in the Brain” is a series of extremely cruel episodes, linked together by a plot, which is more like a review describing the most notorious years of director Lucio Fulci. The film can also be viewed as a sort of dark comedy that effectively fakes various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life. Fulci goes further than this, he acts as a star, the central figure of the film, thus showing the audience who is the man behind the whole cinematographic roof. “The cat in the brain” is not telling a clear story or following it. Instead, he ridicules some of the clichés that have surrounded the horror genre for years. <br /> <br /> Lucio Fulci plays himself as a horror director, trying his best to keep his humanity intact. Years of brutal filmmaking finally began to reach him. Everything starts slowly, his meat and steaks as a whole start to hate him, his colleagues assure Fulci that he needs only rest. But this does not help, and soon the grotesque ideas for his films begin to suppress his everyday thoughts. Trying to find a cure for his dangerous mental state, Lucio begins to contact a local psychiatrist. Unfortunately, it does more harm than good, and Fulci finds himself in even more disarray, as the psychiatrist turns out to be a psychopath who mimics the killing from Fulci films in real life. <br /> <br /> The film preserves all the trademarks of Italian film-weaving, good or bad, they are all here. Therefore, any comments about the actor or technical aspects and budgetary constraints have nothing to do with the quality of the film. This is a visual experience, no doubt about it. Fulci adds an incredible amount of violence, easily surpassing nearly everything he did. Amputated by the limbs of a chainsaw, cannibalism, child murder, beheading, these are just some of the many grotesque actions that can be seen in Cat in the Brain. Some of them are obviously reworked from several less director-directed films, but they do not stand out from the context and actually feel at home here. As I noted earlier, the film is much better, as a satire of the genre, and not a serious play. The way violence is described helps to establish this idea. Such sequences, soon after the climax, are rejected by the reality in the film, since they, as it turns out, are in fact scenes in a film directed by the character Fulci. This kind of “movie in film” somewhat reduces the effect of blood. But this in no way facilitates watching a movie. Oh, no, it is much higher and higher than the levels of blood found in the main horror, and the combustible ones will no doubt be satisfied with this fact. <br /> <br /> Lucio Fulci was a very polarized figure. People either hate his work or love it. “The cat in the brain” will not convince any of Fulci's ill-wishers in the opposite, but, nevertheless, this is an interesting part of his filmography. One that fans should really check out.
