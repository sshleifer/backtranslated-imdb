One of my favorite films of all time, I've seen it three times already. He does a great job of summing up life in Israel, the humor and seriousness of Israel, as well as on most of the problems that Israelis face. The universal theme of the desire to be accepted, and to be accepted for who you are. Good subtle humor, and it is the charisma of the characters that makes this film magical, and says a lot about the culture of Israel, about the recklessness, contradictions and humor, in which there is a great actor Oshree Cohen. I highly recommend him to everyone, and this film is ideal for almost everyone, a family film, a film about a boy / girl, and also says that, in addition to Israeli culture, he wants to be accepted, first of all, how important is the family with all its variety and disadvantages. <br /> <br /> Great great movie.
