where do we go from here? This is the main question of this film. And make no mistake, “basically ETC.”, The work of director John Jansen in 2003, asks many more questions than answers, but none of them is as sharp or as strong as this one. <br /> <br /> The film sounds like a constant conversation between you and your college buddies, and I’m sure that you will find out many of the questions raised by the main characters in the evenings of drunken debauchery. however, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given the answer. Questions are being raised ?? everything from worldly to deep ?? but jansen skillfully forces his audience to explore and answer these questions, practically without the help of the characters. <br /> <br /> Side 1 opens with an increasingly complex and well-organized system of non-linear segments to introduce us to the main characters. Do we meet with them on the morning of April 8, 1994? The day Kurt Cobain committed suicide. And it is Cobain’s death, and a trip to him after two days later in Seattle, serve as the background for the film. Studying Cobain’s life, music and death, the characters try - with varying degrees of success - to understand and come to terms with their lives. <br /> <br /> In some films you will find what you need. can be expected from a low-budget indie film: the performances range from obviously mediocre to outstanding, the strongest from Jessica Scott (Holly) and Noel Wood (Daniel); some dialogs are admittedly a bit tough, but never completely go unreal; and there are some minor problems with sound, especially when we get on the road, which sometimes make it difficult to track actions on the screen. <br /> <br />, but despite the flaws, “mainly ETC”. This is a hard, deeply affecting part of the movie. Among the moments of pursuing wit, ridiculous humor and intimate confusion, jansen cleverly weaves all the threads of character together and illuminates their own struggles, while making them accessible and attractive to us. and since we can see a reflection of ourselves in one or more of these characters, we can identify ourselves with the questions and problems with which they struggle, and we can look back and remember where we were on that day in 1994 when for Many people changed the world. <br /> <br /> While Jensen takes responsibility for writing, editing and directing the film, he should also be given credit for his photographs. Possessing a supernatural look and an amazing ability to capture and draw us into each of the worlds of characters, Jensen managed to make a shot-by-frame, which stuck in me for a long time after the credits rolled. <br /> <br /> And no review of this film will be complete without an amazing soundtrack. the music in this film is used to an amazing effect; at times subtly emphasizing action, sometimes occupying a central place, but never interfering or turning into a kitschy music video. the soundtrack sounds like the best hits, although I suspect the label is probably not very well directed by the director. <br /> <br /> The new double-DVD archive offers several deleted scenes, trailers, music videos and a cobain documentary. Deleted scenes provide some insight into making a movie with alternate opening and closing episodes, and it is certainly a pleasure to have a rare and beautiful video of the Raining Kind. The cobain documentary is good, although a bit worse for wear, and, of course, more extensive documentaries are available for hardcore fans, and the director’s commentary is clearly missing, and I can't help but wonder if he plans to reprint him at some point tidbit. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that the next time you are looking for a strong job from a talented director, I recommend that you take on board.
