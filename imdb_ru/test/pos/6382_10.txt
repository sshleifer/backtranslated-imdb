I saw this on a test screen at Chatsworth a week ago or so, and went with a group of my girlfriends. We all enjoyed it very much. James Franco is awesome and so hot, I would only see it for him !!!!!!! but Sienna Miller is also very good and plays a southern girl who loves him so much she can't let her go. David Caradin, who was in Kill Bill, plays a cowboy, and he is perfect for that. The story is a bit strange, but if you believe in the power of love and magical things, you will love it !!! It's really original, and it's also very funny, and everyone laughed a lot, but by the end, everything becomes more serious and we all end up crying. I am going to see it again with my friends as soon as it comes out, it is really good !!!!!!!
