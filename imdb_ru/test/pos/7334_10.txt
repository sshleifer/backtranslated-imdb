I just saw this film in Austin, Texas, at the Austin Gay and Lesbian Festival, and it was my favorite festival. Gymnast is a movie not to be missed. This is an honest story about how to agree on relationships, self-knowledge, growing up and the courage to change and move forward. This is not only a good story, but also Draja Weber and Eddie Yungmi's magnificent air performances will take your breath away Watch this movie! It will soon come to the festival next to you. This film deserves to be immediately filmed in a large network or studio. I will definitely buy it when it becomes available on DVD.
