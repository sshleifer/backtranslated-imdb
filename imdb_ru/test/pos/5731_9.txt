This program was quite interesting. The way the program was displayed made it even more interesting. String theory is also very interesting to listen to. All three hours, in my opinion, were worth it. I enjoyed listening to the ideas of physicists. Extra dimensions are really amazing. If you have a chance, watch this amazing documentary.
