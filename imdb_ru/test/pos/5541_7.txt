I'm not a fan of this brand of comedy - stereotypical characters turn their way through the farce of the police and robbers. But cute characters are enough to keep the interest. Michelle Pfeiffer is amazing, but the person who really carries the film is Dean Stockwell, who steals every scene as the main thug (no less by the name of Tony). <br /> <br /> In fact, I am writing this review (and the only reason I recommend it) is Stockwell performance. You will tickle his screen time. He plays the great mafia boss, with comedy touches in the right places, and he manages not to become an authoritative cliché. In fact, Stockwell is a complete delight: the master of the “double double” and the real “handsome” in these cool costumes and felts. <br /> <br /> Meesa Says: A good film that can be viewed by folding laundry or eating leftover food.
