Musical biographies are carved from the same fabric. Encouraging struggle, success and, finally, the victory of the girl, but this - the life of the Irish tenor, Chaunce Olcott / Jack Chancellor - has more chances for this than ordinary attributes. He has great charm and sincerity, and all the participants play him great. Dennis Morgan is playing a leading role, as Arlene Dahl is in his love interests. Andrea King’s supporting role as Lilian Russell is much better than Alice Fay’s lead biography in a film about her career. William Frawley is touching as an aging tenor champion, William Scanlon, and Sarah Olgood is as beautiful as Alcott's mother. George Tobias, Ben Blue and Alan Hale provide good support. There are over 25 songs (a real treasure chest): Come Down My Evening Star; My blue eyes are Nellie; You tell me your dream; Wait until the sun shines, Nellie; Will you love me in December? The light of the silvery moon; Days of the Minstrel; Polly Wally Doodle; Natchez and Robert E. Lee; Miss Lindy Lou; If i sleep; We Rose Killarney; Shake hands; One little girl; A little sky; Mary; Innescarren Sweet; Tiddely Um; When Irish eyes smile; Mahri's mother; Fair Kerey; The room is in my heart; My wild Irish rose. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film earned only one Oscar award - for “Test” - and deservedly, it also deserves praise for the “Artistic Guide” and “Costume Design” - luxurious and beautiful in Technicolor. <br /> br /> The reasons for which this is not in the video can be associated with a lot of time spent in the atmosphere of the Minstrel show - at least a quarter of the film - with a lot of material, quite politically INCORRECT for a modern audience. This is historically accurate, however. <br /> <br /> This is a real gem worth looking for. It leaves one with warm heat.
