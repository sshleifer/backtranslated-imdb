Anyone who goes to the Manhattan Hospital Center takes their lives in their hands. This includes the Hospital staff. <br /> <br /> I have never seen the Hospital before, and I was intrigued by how similar the characters and plot situations are to this other masterpiece by Paddy Chaifsky, the Net. In the character of George S. Scott, there are elements in which there are both Al Schumacher and Howard Beal. <br /> <br /> He is the administrator of the Hospital, he is fucking angry and is not going to tolerate it anymore. He is completely alienated from his wife and children. It takes a character like Faye Dunaway in the face of Diana Rigg to get him out of this. One roll of hay is with her, and he returns to reality in shock and the fact that he can still contribute to the world. <br /> <br /> But first he has a real problem. Someone kills the hospital staff, four of them in 48 hours. And the most pleasant thing is that their death can be attributed mainly to the general incompetence of the medical bureaucracy. Here comes the comedy. <br /> <br /> In the person of Barnard Hughes, father of Diane Rigg, there is a real character like Howard Beal. However, its end is not as dramatic as that of Beale. <br /> <br /> On my work days, it was part of my job of paying providers. Some of them can be as big creeps as in a hospital. Black comedy satire had for me a real bite. <br /> <br /> George S. Scott was nominated for the best male role, but, having won and refused to accept the Oscar for Patton last year, he was not about to get a second chance. He lost to Gene Hackman for the French Connection. However, his work with this role is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try viewing the “Hospital” with the Network and see how many similarities you have noticed.
