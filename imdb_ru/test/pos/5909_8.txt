Billy Wilder has created several regular biopic films about the flight of Charles Lindbergh. He structures the film, extensively using memories, to tell the story of Lindberg, which led to the famous flight across the Atlantic, which is currently taking place in the film. Flying by plane hour after hour is not something that worries, and Wilder is not going to deviate from his theme of Lindberg as a hero of a simple man, so everything is predictable. However, James Stewart is well-played and quite believable, like Lindberg, and many of the obstacles he must overcome in order to lift his plane into the air are forced to watch. <br /> <br /> The film is most successful as Wilder weaves the pieces of the story together in a way that creates tension, then relief, then tension again. The cinematography is pretty good, Franz Waxman's score improves the plot, and Stuart really seems to be animating Lindberg, making him believe that he could be Lindberg. In the end, there is a little religious schmal of the 1950s, but overall direction, action, and high production values ​​overcome the predictability of history (does anyone REALLY see this picture and DO NOT know that Lindberg did it across the Atlantic?) To make a nice movie that aged better than most movies of the time. Billy Wilder made films of various types, and this is one that represents his best masters.
