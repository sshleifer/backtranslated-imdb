If you are a long-time fan of the Doctor and you cringe when you hear that they are doing another series, be quiet - this is more than what the high expectations of the original are. The tempo is much faster than the original shows, more often fitting into 50-minute episodes than the average 90 minutes. The writing is excellent, the acting is great. The most difficult - and the best - to which one can get used is the production values ​​of the new series. Compared with the original, now it is. (Although I will always have pleasant memories of monsters with bubbles and hand puppets.) If you are not a fan, or if you tried the original and could not cope with it, jump with both feet now! Everything you really need to know about the Doctor, they will tell you along the way. This series was written with minimal references to the vast background of the Doctor specifically to attract new audiences. Admittedly, I only see the first new episodes now, as they are shown on the Sci-Fi channel (in other words, probably shortened to tapes due to time constraints), but I look forward to future episodes on either television or DVD. (July 4th can't come soon enough!)
