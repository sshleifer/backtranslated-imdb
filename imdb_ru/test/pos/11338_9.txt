as in many Wong films, many find them boring and confusing. Well, I like them, and I also like this movie. I went out and rented it on DVD, and I watched it 3 times. This is a very thin film that gives an intoxicating experience. for those who did not get pleasure from this ...... you just spent 2 hours of your life .... very bad ...
