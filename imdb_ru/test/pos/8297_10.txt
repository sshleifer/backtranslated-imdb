Once a year in America, Saturday morning is replaced by new cartoons, usually in America. At about the same time that school began. <br /> <br /> I think it made it impossible to go to school on Saturdays more tolerant. <br /> <br /> One Friday evening before the premiere of the new Saturday cartoons in the morning, the film appeared. <br /> <br /> "At the Earth" I had no idea who Cushing and McClure were. Obviously, they were not from the same country, so I could not understand why they traveled together. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing the mechanism in the mouth of a fire-breathing monster. <br /> <br /> What connects this film for me is the discovery with molten metal, and suddenly we see how the band plays when we see the factory. <br /> <br /> How do you end such a movie? Again the music, and the two stunned cops, when an exercise appears behind them. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I remember that I watched this film that night on Friday more than any new cartoon that came out the next morning. /> <br /> This was definitely in the late seventies. <br /> <br /> It would be during the mania in Jurassic Park, cicra '93, I think, before I watch this movie again. <br /> <br /> Yes, people in suits. Again was fire-breathing. <br /> <br /> Still loved the two-cop ending. <br /> <br /> Finally, it will be almost a decade before I go to the movies on DVD. <br /> <br /> Now I just look at the beginning and the introduction. <br /> <br /> Oh, I love most of the film. Of all these science fiction films by Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, ERB, this one is my favorite. <br /> <br /> Now I notice that one of the cops starts spinning too early, and then turns back, then he and the other cop synchronize when they turn inside again to look back at the drill. <br /> <br /> Perhaps for me this film is the best of Saturday morning shows, which is why I like it so much
