In this film were my best 2 actor - Robert Ryan and Robert Mitchum. <br /> <br /> Ryan can play anything from Shakespeare to Arthur Miller, and play it great. In this film, when he starts his speech “... people with names like Samuels and others with names that are hard to say,” it’s awful to look at him. <br /> <br /> Robert Young is a policeman who is called to investigate the killing of Samuels (Sam Levine), a civilian who talks to several soldiers in a bar. Mitchell - a soldier wanted in connection with this - his wallet was found in the apartment. But Mitchell is a mild soldier who misses his wife only. <br /> <br /> The story is told from different points of view. Mitchell and Samuels make friends and return to Samuels’s apartment. Samuels seems to know the loneliness that Mitchell feels. “For many years you have been concentrating on one peanut, but now it’s not, you don’t know what to feel,” he says of the war. <br /> <br /> Ryan is great, like Monty, a psychotic racist. <Br /> <br /> Robert Young (with Dick Powell) was an actor whose career was re-rejuvenated by the film Noir. “Crossfire”, “They won’t believe me” and “The Other Woman” are excellent examples. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum is his usual calm person, like the philosophical Keely. <br /> <br /> Gloria Graham and Paul Kelly as a “weird couple” are also outstanding in their short but significant roles. <br /> <br /> This is probably the best racism film ever made.
