This film is based on the true story of Christopher Beuys and his friend Downton Lee. This exciting story takes place during Whitlam’s dismissal, when Christopher, being a clerk at TRW, was involved in secret correspondence that allowed the CIA to participate in Australian political and trade union circles. The film shows several scenes with the participation of Gough Whitlam (broadcast on American television), where events occur that confirm the secret documents that Christopher had read before. The removal of Gough Whitlam was an organized CIA coup. Elsewhere in the film, it was mentioned that most people have no idea of ​​the level of deception that goes on, ultimately, to make sure that the US is used as a means of promoting a particular policy according to the will of everyone else. In this era, nothing has changed. <br /> <br /> Christopher’s life was deeply affected, shocked when he learned what and how the CIA forms foreign democracies, including the democracies of allied countries in the United States. Christopher probably did not respond in the best way at that time, selling top-secret information to the Soviet Union with Downth Lee, acting as his exchange. In the end, Christopher and Downton were captured and convicted of high treason. <br /> <br /> On May 23, 1982, while in US prison, Christopher Beuys agreed to a single interview with Ray Martin from 60-minute Australia, because it was an Australian connection that deeply influenced him. This caused a stir in the Australian media for a week, then subsided. <br /> <br /> I liked the symbolism of the film “Falcon”, and in it Chris was called “Falcon” and “Downton Snowman” (a drug). connection), but actually the name “Falcon” was not something that was used by Chris. <br /> <br /> Christopher Boyce: Perpetrator or Man of Conscience?
