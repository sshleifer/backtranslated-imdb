I think this film should be one of the most exciting and heartbreaking lately. <br /> <br /> The film begins with suicide in the school toilet. You do not see who it is, then the beginning of the day starts from there, and we recognize 6 characters, and they experience rather heavy things, one way or another, in the end one of them will commit suicide. <Br /> <br /> I have been teaching physical education in schools for 8 years now, and never in the film have I seen such an exact picture of what “really” happens in school life. <br /> <br /> The film is beautiful and sounds incredible. <br /> <br /> The ending is so shocking, and what can not be said, this is what will haunt me for many days. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a must see. <br /> <br /> I think that the fact that the director / writer attended school only a few years ago is one of the main factors contributing to the expression of pure honesty. in film. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in two separate “modes” if you want. First, there is a smooth style of observation, where we recognize characters in their school environment, when they go through their drama, but the most amazing part of the film is in the interview sections, where we learn the stories of the characters and their stories. the deepest, darkest thoughts. <br /> <br /> You continue to wonder who it will be (who commits suicide), and as the drama unfolds, you continue to change your mind until BAM hits you in the face in the last five minutes. I am everywhere in my work, but I just saw it at an Australian media show, and I'm still in shock. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Australian films I've seen in recent years.
