A good old-fashioned western avenger, who received a zest and light attraction, incorporating into his plot a small black social history. Led by Mario Van Peebles who does everything well, a gang of losers on the run from the (at first glance uncontrollable) army of Billy Zeyna has worked well, their adventures are believable, but at the same time amusing and exciting. There are some good moody scenes with memories of the hero's mood and his background, a good shootout ends when our heroes protect the city from greedy white landgrabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin is not bad in this pleasant, quite powerful western.
