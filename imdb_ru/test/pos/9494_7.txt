“Don't Change a Husband” is another comedy in a soap opera by producer / director Cecil B. De Mille. This is known as the first of several films that he starred with Gloria Swanson. I think you could also call it a kind of continuation of his book Old Wives for New (1918). <br /> <br /> James (Elliot Dexter) and Leila (Swanson) Porter is a forty-year-old couple where James went to plant and became untidy and lazy. he has a penchant for smelly cigars and eating raw onions. He takes his wife for granted. Leila is trying to get him to straighten up, but to no avail. <br /> <br /> One evening, at a dinner at Porters, Leyla meets the dashing Schuyler Van Sutphen (now known as nickname), the nephew of a swimming boy, a secular Mrs. Hackney (Sylvia Ashton). She invites Leila to her home for the weekend so that James "misses her." Once there, Schuyler begins to move toward her, promising her pleasure, wealth and love, if she leaves her husband and goes with him. The sequences in which Leila imagines this promised new life are generously staged and predict de Mille's epic dramatic costumes later in his career. <br /> <br /> Leila, who is bored with her marriage and her disinterested husband, divorces James and marries a playboy. In the end, James realizes that he has lost the only thing that mattered to him, and begins to correct his ways. He shaves his mustache, trains, avoids the bow, and acquires new manners. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, not everything is so rosy with the new marriage of Leyla. Schuyler seems to love gambling and has taken up the gold-searching Nanette (she is Tootsie, or some similar name) (Julia Fay). Schuyler loses all his money and steals Leila's diamond ring to cover his losses. <br /> <br /> One day on the fateful day, Leila meets the “new” James and perceives his changes. James will take her home and find out about her situation and ........................................ ......... <br /> <br /> This film marked the beginning of the rise of Gloria Swenson as a superstar in a career that will compete with Mary Pickford. As soon as she turned 20 years old, she began her career in two-component comedy films of McSennett as a teenager. Elliot Dexter was at that time almost 50 years old, but he and Swenson make up a good team, although it's hard to imagine anyone getting tired of sweet Miss Swanson, like in this film. <br /> <br /> Dexter and Sylvia Ashton appeared in the similar “Old Wives for New”, where the wife went to sow, and her husband was offended. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast, De Mille’s permanent faces are Theodore Roberts as Bishop and Raymond Hutton as a player. ,
