As you probably know, Norway is the most developed country in the world (regarding the HDI; Human Development Index). This film cleverly reveals our future to us. Our future will be the future of Norway, as we all do our best to achieve the best and offer the least. The life shown was perhaps an exaggeration, but comparing today's problems with the problems of our ancestors, it is not something far from reality. <br /> <br /> Watching this film without all our preliminary assumptions, we can find both our faces; the one who laughs at the brilliant scene of Andreas throwing his girlfriend, and the one who watches the magazines for hours to choose any stupid chair among the silly collections. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a hole with the hope of lightness was another great movie idea. Light glory; so far the only one, and the efforts made to achieve it, make us feel closer to Andreas. <br /> <br /> Although I was mostly attracted by the idea and production of the film, Trond Fausa Aurvaag played quite well and the atmosphere of the film was quite comparable.
