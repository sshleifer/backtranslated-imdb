Being an Israeli Jewish sarcastic nature, as well as a lover of different and independent cinema, I always enjoy watching a film that tells about the Holocaust, which is sensitive and respectful, as well as original and unusual. Until I read the book ?? or, for that matter, heard of its existence before watching the movie ?? and therefore cannot, like some other reviewers, comment on how they add up in comparison, “Everything is lit up” gave me great pleasure, and I can certainly comment on this. <br /> <br /> Mark "All lit" - a film about the Holocaust. it would make it a big injustice, even if it’s about the Holocaust. The same could be described as a comedy or a film about travel, although it is a question of travel and is as fun as it is moving. Is everything covered about Jonathan Safran Foer ?? played by Elijah Wood in minimalist perfection, in the most impressive dramatic performance I've ever seen him, with a poker face that shows nothing and shows everything ?? a young American Jew and an obsessive collector of family relics and historical artifacts who travels in Ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. This is also Alex, his guide to Ukraine and Alex’s grandfather. What is striking about these characters is that at the beginning of the film they look like comic relief to balance the melancholic nature of Wood’s character; but both Alex and his grandfather are undergoing exciting changes throughout the film and are at least as important as Jonathan. In fact, Boris Leskin as a grumpy, self-proclaimed blind grandfather, turns out to be the most dramatic performance in the film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the surrealistic character of the film and its characters, a wonderful mixture of original acoustic music and Russian folk music, sensitive cinema and chilling contrast between the beauty of landscapes and the horrors of history. What made everything lit up for me is a powerful and exciting experience, that from Alex and his grandfather we get a completely different and original point of view on this painful subject; Several excellent films, such as The Gray Zone and The Fall, have already given us the point of view of lower-level Nazis, who are presented as people who are not necessarily fully aware of the moral consequences of their actions, but are trapped in the reality of war. Everything is illuminated - this point of view is rarely seen before: the point of view of Alex is the point of view of a young man who was born many years after the war, who considers this almost more than a cold historical fact to face the horrors of his people ?? and maybe his own family ?? were capable of. A change regarding Alex ?? and grandfather ?? In relation to Jonathan, to the Holocaust and to the Jewish people as a whole, the film becomes a fascinating and original study in character development. <br /> <br /> Everything is lit - a terrific directorial debut for actor Lie Schreiber and one of them. of the most original and unique films of 2005. It is highly recommended for viewing, especially for those interested in the Holocaust and World War II.
