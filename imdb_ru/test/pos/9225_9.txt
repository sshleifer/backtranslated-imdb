RAINBOW BRITE AND STAR STEALER, in my opinion, are an excellent masterpiece. I was warm and tingling when Rainbow Bright (voice of Bettina) and Rats (voice of David Mendenhall) decided to take revenge on the princess (voice of Ronad Aldrich). If you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical. For me, she deserves to be Rainbow Bright and the Rats take revenge on him. However, I liked her castle, as well as the rest of the decor. In addition, I thought that Lurki (the voice of Pat Fraili) and Murka (the voice of Peter Cullen) were devilish. Before finishing, I would like to say that everyone was in perfect composition, the direction was impeccable, and Disney achieved great success. In conclusion, I highly recommend this magnificent masterpiece to anyone who has not seen it, especially inflexible fans of the series. I guarantee you, you will like it.
