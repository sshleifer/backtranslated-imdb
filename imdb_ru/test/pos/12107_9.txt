This film offers you a fascinating journey through one of the most interesting cities of our time - Istanbul - and its musicians. Do not wait for the compilation of Turkish folklore or something like that. Alexander Hakke, a German musician and member of the cult band "Einstürzende Neubauten", is sent to Istanbul to get acquainted with the music scene. His rare voices about what he is experiencing are a guide in the film. But mostly German-Turkish director Faith Akin allows various artists from Istanbul to speak and, of course, their own music. <br /> <br /> You meet a variety of personalities, big stars and street musicians, young and old, people playing in different musical styles. But this film not only introduces you to the sound of Istanbul. He also paints a convincing picture of today's Istanbul and how Turkey has advanced over the past decade. The film characterizes its characters with a subtle humor, but not without respect. They all share a passion for music and faith in its power. <br /> <br /> Akin again shows his talent to accurately depict diversity when he brings you closer to completely different musical scenes. After her award-winning feature film “Gegen die Wand” (Head on), Vera Akin proves that Crossing the Bridge is equally capable of touching, entertaining and directing her audience in a documentary. If you have never been to Istanbul, you will want to go there after watching the movie.
