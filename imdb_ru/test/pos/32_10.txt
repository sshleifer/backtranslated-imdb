“LACKAWANNA BLUES” is a wonderful stage play by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and an even more beautiful film, as the author adapted his own life story for the screen. This brilliant film lights up the screen with rich colors, beautiful music, great editing, great directorial skills of George W. Wolf and such an amazing cast that they make an encore viewing a must! Yes, it is so good. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the author’s life when the child “Young” (Marcus Karl Franklin) grew up in the inimitable house of the mentally sensitive Rachel “Nanny” Crosby (S Epata Merkerson), a woman who devoted her life to helping civilians deprived rights by transporting them from the south, from mental hospitals and from the streets in Lackawanna, New York. The boy remembers all the lessons he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house - strange characters with painful past - and from the collapse of his racially mixed biological family, rescued by a nanny. Countless characters at home are too numerous to outline, but they are portrayed by some of the best actors in this business: Terrence Howard, Rosie Perez, Mos Def, the lovely Carmen Edzhoi, Louis Gossett Jr., Jeffrey Wright, Ernie Hudson, Charlein Woodward , Jimmy Smits, Patricia Wettig, Macy Gray, Liev Schreiber, Kathleen Chalfant, Lou Myers, Hill Harper - the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> In the course of the film, we become acquainted with the cruelty towards racism, the history of desegregation, the dynamics of drug abuse and violence, the infectious joy of the contribution of African American music to our musical culture and the courage of a beautiful woman who struggled with all the difficulties, which the world can endure in order to maintain the dignity of those with whom it has come into contact. S. Epata Merkerson is completely immersed in this role, the role that she makes shining like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos. She offers one of the most amazing performances in recent years, and if this film were released in theaters and not as an HBO film, she would no doubt have added an Oscar to put it next to the Golden Globe award. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is exceptional, and Wolfe controls the acting and story as a master: like the riffs in a jazz piece, he inserts tiny moments of conversation with each character and Junior, along with flashes of scenes from the story of the dance festivals matrix in local clubs filled with incredible blues, jazz, dancing and joy. The film crew set up this little miracle of the painting with the utmost care, and never for a moment distracts attention from the impulse of history. Highly recommended, almost obligatory viewing!
