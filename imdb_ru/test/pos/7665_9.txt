I have never read a good review of the Vanity Fair and cannot understand why. For something that was “urgently sent in ten days,” it all happens surprisingly well. Although admittedly "Becky Sharp" is the best movie and Miriam Hopkins is the best Becky, nothing prevents it from getting a good 9/10. At times, Myrna Loy may seem too cute and sweet to play bitch, but sometimes she just needs to squint, and the air temperature drops to a dozen degrees. Meow! The transition to a more modern environment did not work against Vanity Fair, and the only thing that really causes conflict is casting. Barbara Kent (Amelia) was less than 5 feet tall, and few of the leading men were very tall too - it all unites to make Loy look like an absolute amazon! <br /> <br /> Vanity Fair is like Craig’s wife in that no matter how bad the main character is, you have to love her. And you know that she deserves her punishment, and then a little, but you still feel sorry for her when she receives it. Although this version is based on the same story as Becky Sharp, she had a different ending, which is interesting to see, because most of the rest of the films were almost identical. As for pleasure, the ending of Becky Sharp is ultimately more enjoyable, although aesthetically and in the course of history there is no doubt that the ending of Vanity Fair is better, regardless of whether you like it or not. It.
