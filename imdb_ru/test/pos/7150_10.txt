I was surprised that Forgiveness Franklins did not cause more noise at this Sundance festival. There were times when the laughter in the show that I saw was so loud that you barely heard the movie. The film has a great acting and story that really makes you think about broader issues. You know little problems like Religion, sex and truth. Many comedies seem to rely on the same old clever situations, many make you think: â€œI know they tore it off from some comedy film. This film takes its own unique direction. I really think Jay Floyd did a fantastic job with a limited budget in this film.
