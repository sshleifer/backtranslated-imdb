"Ann Christie" was Garbo's 14th film and the first to feature her hoarse Swedish voice. She plays the main character, Anna, who struggled with being abandoned by her father Chris (drunk owner of the barge, played by George F. Marion), and with the misfortune of life that she has to lead to keep her head above water. br /> <br /> A meeting with Irishman Matt (Charles Bickford) can be a turning point for her ... or not? Garbo looks and sounds great in this drama, which, despite the fact that it looks rather clumsy and moves at a slow pace, still manages to interest and attract the audience almost 80 years later. Marie Dressler has an impact on the role that gave her a second flash of film success in films such as Min and Bill, Dinner at Eight and Emma; while Marion and Bickford are more than adequate. <br /> <br /> An interesting part of the history of cinema. In subsequent years, Garbo performed better, but “Anna Christie” will always be remembered for the first time when she spoke on the screen.
