I just saw a very original film that I would recommend to everyone, including “young and restless.” However, I think that some of the profanity, violence and sexual hints in the film are not suitable for "all your children." In any case, before the sand fills the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: "Nurse Betty." Renee Zellweger plays the role of Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who goes into a trance and thinks she’s a real character in her favorite soap opera. Because of this, she travels to Los Angeles to reunite with her alleged soap opera actor, Dr. Rubella. To add fuel to the fire, she is also pursued by some ruthless killers "don't live one life", who think she stole their drugs. We can say that this is exactly how nurse Betty spends "the days of her life" throughout the film. This very “uncommon” situation ultimately leads her to the “hospital” staging of her favorite soap opera. However, the only problem is that Betty thinks that all this is real. As if her mind is in a "different world." Good! Enough! I wipe my mouth with soap and do not mention more soap names. I have already registered my vote for Rene as the best candidate actress Oscar. In addition, the performance of Greg Kinner in the role of Dr. Rubella was as good as in his acting biography. To summarize, my final diagnosis is that everyone should call "nurse Betty." ***** Well
