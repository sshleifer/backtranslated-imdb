It was the last silent movie of Laurel and Hardy for Roach Studios. However, since the public was experiencing a real thirst for “chatter,” the same short plot was redone by the team just a few years later, with minor changes in the plot. Gravi's laughter was essentially the same story, with the exception that Stan and Ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their grumbling host - and not a goat, as in ANGORA LOVE. This whole corner of the goat is the worst part of the film. While you could understand that the boys want to keep a cute dog (after all, it’s snowing on the street), why they bring the goat home, it’s just made up and meaningless. According to the plot, the goat followed them home, and they were tired of driving him away and holding him. Yes ?! It just doesn't make any sense - if it was a giraffe or a cow, would they do the same ?! In addition to the unconvincing plot, the film itself is pure Laurel and Hardy, with a familiar plot and familiar roles for comedians. In this film, a lot of laughter, but unfortunately, this is not one of their best films to complete their silent career. It seems that this aspect of their career ended in a whimper.
