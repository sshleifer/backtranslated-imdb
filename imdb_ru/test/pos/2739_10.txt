MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that has been stuck in my head for many years and finally decided to look at it, which was pleasantly surprised, and also surprised people associated with the production. If I remember correctly, we had to watch it at the UHF station, which meant that in those days UHF converter was used, which was not part of conventional television, to tune in to the local station to watch a cartoon on the days that made the series more interesting. mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald talked about. Excellent memory from 50+ years ago. I need to see what other memories may be hiding on the Internet. By the way, I'm trying to make computer animation where johnl3d comes into the picture
