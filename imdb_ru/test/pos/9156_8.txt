This show was really good in many ways, although it was certainly an atypical western with a hero (?) Who rides a motorcycle rather than a horse, due to the situation of 1914, very “late” for a western that usually tends to be established between 1866 and 1890. I remember some controversy about canceling it at the time, but I didn’t actually watch it during NBC. When I came to watch and love him, it was a decade later, when I was in the army stationed in Germany, and this was shown every week from the very beginning on Armed Forces television. By then, Margot Kidder had become known as Lois Lane, but I will always think of her as Nichols' friend. In many ways, Nichols was very much like Maverick; both were much more inclined to get rich without much effort than they fought. It was in a small TV magazine that they distributed to PX (not actually an authorized TV Guide edition, but made so as close as possible to him, without going into copyright problems) that I first learned the real story behind cancellation. I really wonder what the next season would have been with a more cruel double, if they really did it as planned. Of course, by the time this television was created, the “western era” of television was in decline for about ten years; I hope that someday I can write that the “era of reality” has been in decline for so long! While Gunsmoke and Bonanza were still working, they were both nearing their end, and the years passed when the new western really gained popularity; I think this trend has done a lot to deter Nichols, and was the main reason why NBC leaders doubted that she would ever find a large audience. But for me, a good West, in contrast to the show set in the modern era, is somewhat out of time, like the other "period" of the show; fashion changes and the like do nothing to make them look more “outdated” than they should have been, and I think watching this show, 10 years after its creation, really led me to it. In addition, this show is an early mix of Garner and Stuart Margolin, who is truly one of the greatest friends of all time, and not only in westerns.
