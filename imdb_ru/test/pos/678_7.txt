The film with its only set, minimal actor and simple photograph (with the exception of a few short special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60-minute drama productions that were popular in the early years of television. However, the wait hangs heavily over poor widowed warfare Ida Lupino when she tries to deal with her semi-psychotic master Robert Ryan, before one of his mood swings kills her. And who better to play a problematic role than this great actor Ryan. He was not very versatile - watching his comedy essay almost hurt. But no one was better at wounded idealism (On a dangerous land) or the heartache of this film. Few of the actors can express with their eyes as much as this slim and tall figure. <br /> <br /> Lupino’s problem is that she’s locked in her house with a man who is kind and gentle at one time and then furious. The wait comes from her various tricks to keep him happy, trying to escape. This is a nail puller completely. This is not one of the many beautiful "soulful" parts of Lupino in which she was so good. Instead, this role that many smaller actresses could play quite well. My favorite scene with Ryan and busty teen Margaret Whiting. Ryan is already having difficulty with his masculinity and what others say about him. Then, when Whiting enters and finds an attractive Ryan wiping the floor, she starts to be shy, flirting with her nascent sexuality. Feeling trouble, Ryan sharply drives her away - the trick is not his strong suit. Insulted Whiting attacks his masculinity, calling his work "women's work." It does it. Up to this point, he was polite and professional with Lupino, trying to get on the normal path. But Whiting hit him on the nerves. Now it's damn expensive when Whiting runs out the door, leaving Lupino to pay for it. This is an exciting scene, artfully done. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is one of a dozen films shot by Lupino and her husband at a time when viewers were moving away from these small black and white in favor of widescreen glasses. Very bad. What an incredibly talented figure she had behind the camera and behind her. She deserves, at least, an honorary Oscar from the film industry, to which she has contributed a lot.
