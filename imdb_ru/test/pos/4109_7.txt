A huge cast composed for this remake, which, unfortunately, was a bad box office, despite the excellent sound track. I can not say that it was exciting entertainment or a cure for insomnia. Nevertheless, I liked the film - it provided me with an escape in the afternoon. A good look for those of us who are looking for the perfect life, albeit a fantasy. Expect some trite moments, a bit of thrill and casual laughter.
