Well, I have to disagree with Leonard Multin in this animated short film. He loves it and claimed it was fun. I enjoyed it, but did not see any humor. He doesn't even love hockey or knows nothing about it, and yet he loved history. Living right across the border from Canada, for 50 years I have been watching hockey there and in Buffalo ... but I didnâ€™t really think about this cartoon. Oh, it was interesting, and I know what happens if you put on a Toronto jersey in Quebec - a disaster! This is especially true in the years of Canadian fame. However, this does not make the story funny. <br /> <br /> Back in the 1950s, everyone in the Quebec provinces worshiped the Canadians of Montreal and their star player Maurice Richard, and everyone wanted to be like him. When his mother orders a new sweater, it shows the emblem of Toronto from maple leaves, so the child does not want to be caught dead, wearing it. When he finally does this and goes to a local rink, he is ostracized from his other hockey buddies. What's so funny? I could see the same thing happening to a kid in Boston who is standing firmly on the Red Sox, and his mom gets him a Yankee shirt! Scary stories! You can not wear it, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> Maybe this situation seems strange and ridiculous to someone who does not play sports at all, for example, Maltin ... but this is a fact of life or any little sports fan and his favorite team. It was an interesting and quite believable story, but nothing that made me laugh. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to look at this art, almost like a long series of pencil drawings made by a talented schoolboy. The French Canadian accent was also good. This film was part of the DVD "The Selected Animations of Leonard Maltin from the National Film Council of Canada."
