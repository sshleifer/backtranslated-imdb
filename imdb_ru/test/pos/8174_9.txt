I found this epic amazing, amazing, even heartbreaking beauty. Some kind of monumentality in beauty and decorative wealth, magnificent dramatic movement and dynamism. Here the choreography is incredibly pleasant, the actors are very pleasant. I was a big fan of CROUCHING TIGER ?? also, but this one was even better. They have Kitano's ingenuity in enjoying what pleasure is. This confirming beauty adventure film is an act of courage. When was the wait so refined and genuine? And the art of showing huge crowds, giant armies ?? The film has something deeply satisfying, and enduring good taste. It is a great pleasure to do such a deliberately impressive and clean show. It is good beyond words. Few, a few adventure films, not to mention the epics, gave me such a continuous delight. <br /> <br /> A fan can be monumental. “Not monumental art”, but monumental fun, as in the films of Leon, as in some epics of the 60s also like the hobbit trilogy. This is great fun.
