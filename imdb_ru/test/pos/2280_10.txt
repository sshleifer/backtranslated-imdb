Mr. Baseball was a fun video rental with my bride, Susan Naouss. Susan said she was looking forward to watching the movie. Ken Takakura Oda, as a tough but honorary manager, makes sense. Ken Takakura made so many great Asian films, I correct one reviewer and say that Takakura is still a cinematic presence in films like Hotari. Of course, everyone likes Tom Selleck, but Ken Takakura is the best drama actor of the two. Today, someone accused me of being a yakuza, well, I say that my Great President Uncle of the Shadows Jack F. Kennedy himself and others are part of the legitimate Human leadership in our Universe, and thanks to our creators with all the woes that President Kennedy said in his inaugural address. Honestly, in Canada, food prices are very low. In honor of our creators, please stop eating reptile amphibians and eggs. I hope that one day there will be a continuation of Mr. Baseball with his father Ken Takakura Oda, who will still be the manager. Thanks IMDb for supporting freedom of speech, which is supported by my President George W. Bush and myself. IMDb support.
