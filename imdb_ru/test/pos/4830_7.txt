This is by far the biggest surprise of the festival to date and, without a doubt, the best that the festival could offer. I entered this film with little or no expectation after learning that the director was responsible for the terrible Forsaken film about vampires. and I was pleasantly surprised. The movie stars Laurie are addicted to fame In Crowd as a young mother whose husband has just passed away. She moved to an old family house in the mountains with her two daughters next to the mine, which is the grave of overworked children. Unlucky for them, the children returned with revenge, killing and eating everyone in their path. The film works on many levels. This is well done, hard, it has good cinematic shots and excellent performances of Compton. The atmosphere is eerie, but a little enthusiastic, the assessment is decent, and the effects of makeup are terrible and simplified. The film retains an eerie and anxious tone, and children with pale skin, torn lips and hollow eyes are rather scary and ruthless. The film is original and inventive, without being fanciful or complex. I cannot see this film become widescreen without any kind of trimming and little tweaking. But they definitely have a good product in their hands, and they should be engaged in theatrical distribution. However, the theater in which I saw it was terrible. The sound was badly flawed, which seemed to me, for the most part, was torn off from the film, and stopped in the middle because they could not center it on the screen, which killed the mood a little. Overall, although it was the most satisfying of horror entrances, perhaps because it had the least expectations, but it was nevertheless a welcome addition to genre films.
