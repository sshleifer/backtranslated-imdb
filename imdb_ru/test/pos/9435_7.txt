Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) were hired by the British government to protect the Swiss scientist Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Junior). He has a bomb that the British want to win in the war. Unfortunately, the evil Dr. Moriarty (Lionel Atville) works with the Nazis and will stop at nothing to get a doctor - and his invention. <br /> <br /> Moving Sherlock Holmes in the 1940s sounded like a stupid idea, but it works for one reason - Vasily Rathbone. Perhaps he is the BEST Sherlock Holmes ever to appear on the screen. He plays a character so well (and accurately) that it does not matter in which epoch he uncovers crimes. As for Nigel Bruce as Watson ... everyone has problems with that. He plays Watson as the awkward old fool ... this is NOT Watson from the books. You seriously wonder why Holmes tolerates him. However, it grows on you (in a sense). Then Atville has a whale of time, playing Moriarty - the discussions and the battle of wits between him and Holmes are just great! I never liked Dennis Howe as Inspector Lestrade - he is such an idiot. Makes Watson look like a genius. And the post-junior is pretty good in the role of Tobel (although his accent is funny changing!). <br /> <br /> This film is made thoughtfully and lasts just over an hour. However, he has slow spots, and I never understood the secret code section. <br /> <br /> However, it is worth catching, if only for Rathbone and Atville.
