First of all, let me say that I spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a skateboard, before I realized that I was completely uncoordinated. I always thought it was cool to watch cats know how to be extreme when they are doing their job, but I have never been a skateboarder and have never watched sports. At the same time, I thought that this is a very informative and interesting documentary. Some reviewers say these guys waved their own flag a bit, but what the hell? It seems to me that these guys probably deserve the same respect as any other for giving impetus to the skateboarding world, and they provided some good cadres of their innovations to support this. It's great that viewers are allowed to see these guys both then and now, and the shots they took when they grew up in California give some interesting nostalgia that goes beyond sports riding. I would never understand where the extreme skating rink came from, but this film binds everything together and gives us an informative documentary. I am sure that this is at least a little biased, but are not all documentaries? It is worth seeing for anyone interested in sports or, as in my case, for everyone who grew up in the 1970s.
