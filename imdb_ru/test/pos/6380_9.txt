For all intents and purposes, “Teen Devian” may seem just another lightweight Bollywood musical. To some extent this may even be true, especially because the producers had to be sure that the film was a success with the masses. But somewhere behind the scenes, either Sadashiv Brahman (who had the “idea” for this story), or Amerjeet (who directed the film) decided that there would be a common formula, and perhaps even exceeded their own expectations. br /> <br /> This is not just a handsome man, flirting with 3 women, not deciding who to choose as a life partner. Dev Ananda's character really loved each of the three women at different times, and they are with him, despite the fact that they knew about the other two. The relationship of Dev Anand with Simi and Kalpana is particularly interesting in that each of the women is highly dependent on him. There are quite a few teasers in the body language of the stars, which are amenable to the imagination depending on the maturity of the viewer. The topic is surprisingly adult, and yet it is a shame that the final was tame, clearly intended to please the masses and reject criticism.
