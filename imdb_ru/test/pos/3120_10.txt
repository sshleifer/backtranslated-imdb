For my money, probably the best film - or, at least, the most cinematic film - directed by Ford. Dialogue is fast, cut to the point. The story begins at the very beginning and ends only with the final captions. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with enthusiasm and scope of epic proportions. Darkly realistic, warmly funny, brilliantly played (it’s hard to believe that Johnson couldn’t become the lead man after that) with the best photos and montages in any American black and white film. He owes a great deal to Sergey Eisenstein’s editing technique, but he has never been as cool or “scientific” as Eisenstein often came up with. And a great musical score. A magnificent panorama of an important and poorly understood episode in American history. <br /> <br /> One small talk: it is not clear why the Mormons are involved in the film, which, as far as I know, were never Quack pacifists and were Amish. This confusion leaves a bitter aftertaste. <br /> <br /> However, the rest of the film is a celebration that is easy to ignore. Otherwise, a true masterpiece of American cinema, which you need to reanimate and look at it again (and again, and again).
