After the business coup of 1941, Max and Dave, the Fleisher brothers were removed from their own studio by Paramount Pictures Corporation. Former employees, such as Seymour Knitel and Izzy Sparber, were put in charge of the new operation, which is now renamed Famous Studios from Paramount. Previously, the finished product Famous was indistinguishable compared with the recent release of Fleischer. The existing series (Papay, Superman) continued as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> Today the theme JAPOTEURS is one of the SUPERMAN shorts of an early famous studio. <br /> <br /> AS was a custom, SUPERMAN Cartoons is a great combination of elegant, spiritually appropriate music. This concerns the theme (overture), as well as all background (random) music with several moods. It was if each cartoon had its own background music, because everything was fresh, apparently recording it again with each picture. <br /> <br /> As for the JOPTER, we have to remember that this was filmed during the first year. The involvement of the United States and the characterization of the enemy were very stereotypical, short and outright evil. The dialogue and individuality of the evil Japanese saboteurs were strictly from the serial characters of the old magazine stories, each word was said in sarcastic, completely insincere politeness, as the characters flaunted their composure because they made themselves the most demonic of outrageous and outrageous actions against the world. <br /> <br /> JAPOTEURS is visually vivid and sublime, is thoughtfully thought out and uses some multi-planes or desktop animation to give its flight sequences real depth. <br /> With proper use of the links between the animation films, the SUPERMAN radio salon then sounded on the mutual broadcast network; the cartoon is very similar to the comic page and uses the same talent for voice acting as Bad Collyer and Joan Alexander from the radio show. <br /> <br /> We rate it with *** Â½ stars. <br /> <br /> Poodle Schnitz!
