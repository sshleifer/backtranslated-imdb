There is nothing worse than the genocide of the history of our world. This film attempts to describe the horror faced by one particular family — the usual narrative device — in the world of the Hiroshima atomic bomb. The most memorable parts are the graphic and sad images that the people of Hiroshima encounter after the war. This story, however, is more about influencing a particular group of people and how they cope with their lives; In other words, if you do not care about them, the film becomes boring. It's hard not to care when the family's homeland is destroyed. I'm not sure if I recommend this film because he speaks very little politically and, frankly, did not support my interest in the troubles of the family.
