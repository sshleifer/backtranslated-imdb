A pretty nice set for kidnapping people in New Orleans, but in my opinion, its main downfall is that it has too much political intrigue and double crossing, and lacks sexy young actors, vivid scenes, original cinematic style and biting. humor. These aspects combine to give a refreshingly bold film that makes a whole bunch of recent things look unbearably boring. Let's hope that Sebastian Gutierrez will continue in the same spirit - he looks like a talent to beware of. The mismatching handful of little scammers in the film are clouded by the investigative partnership of Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, whose humor is very necessary to make the film what it is. The couple shoots their obligatory southern tyan as well as the Yankees, and it is very nice to hear how these two strong British cinemas stretch towards each other with smoothness in the style of “Lethal Weapon” ... it's just a pity that only scenes they can steal exclusively them. In any case, with a little less policy and authoritarianism (!) The film would be almost perfect, so I will give it 8/10 and I hope that several people remember it a little better than the box office.
