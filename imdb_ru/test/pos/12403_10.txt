This film as "Breakfast Club" meets "Mad City". It has one plot twist after another with Justin Walker, Corey Feldman and James Remar delivering really great performances. However, this film is not for everyone. If you do not like movies that “go to the end” regarding violence, do not watch the last twenty minutes. My wife had to leave the room. Of course, I could not take my eyes off the screen. This is really sandy, realistic teenage drama. I can't believe it came from Bi-Roger King Roger Corman. This film is a must see for those who are not discouraged. Highly recommended.
