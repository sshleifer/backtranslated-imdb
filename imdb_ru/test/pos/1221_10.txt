This movie was great! Tangi Miller and Flex did a great job. They both look good together, and both took it off. Tasha Smith was as funny as her cousin, and she could not stay away from her business. Essence held it back for her girl when she needed her. Aloma was sweet and played dear grandmother, she really reminded me of my grandmother. And I can not forget about the stripper, he was so found, and I did not know whether I should close my eyes or smile while I watch him reveal his sexuality on the big screen. Heck! He was fine! Tanguy looked flawless and sexy, and she climbed a step higher than Felicity. There was a lot of “A” throughout the film, a list of actors and actresses. It was fun, sexy, insane, touching, loving, emotional and wonderful. This film is a must see! Go go to the DVD now if its not there!
