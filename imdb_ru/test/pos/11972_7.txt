I love dogs, and the most interesting character in this film is a golden retriever. He is smarter, looks better and more interesting than any of the human characters. Like many other authors, I have not read the book, but I doubt that this would change my opinion about the film. This is predictable from the first five minutes. No surprises. Mad scientists create a monster that falls out, and the adolescent boy and his wonder-dog come together to destroy him. In general, the film is a dog. But, as I said, I love dogs and therefore I will give this film a rating of 7/10. Watch it, if it appears on TV, rent it if you are bored, and no longer catches the eye, but do not buy it if it is not on sale.
