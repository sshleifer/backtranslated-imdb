“They made me a criminal” - a remake of the earlier Warner Brothers film, “The Life of Jimmy Dolan,” in which Douglas Fairbanks Jr. played the lead role as a runner-up for the race. <br /> <br /> Even with the restrictions on production in the Hays Office, this remake is actually better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is terribly mistaken as a fist fight. John Garfield, with his past and style, plays the role he was born to play. <br /> <br /> They made me a criminal, directed by Busby Berkeley, whom Jack Warner believed in the employment between musicals. In fact, Berkeley will soon leave Warner Brothers for MGM. <br /> <br /> Berkeley does an excellent job with his task, keeping the movement at a good pace. I especially like the scene where four of the Dead End Kids and Garfield swim in the water tank and get there when the water level drops. They get it from this rather narrowly and with some good ingenuity. <br /> <br /> In addition to Garfield and other children who remember, there are Mae Robson, who runs the summer camp for children, and Claude Raines as a possessed detective on Garfield Trail.
