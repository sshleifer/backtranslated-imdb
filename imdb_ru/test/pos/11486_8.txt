As soon as the slow start begins, the film begins and really becomes quite funny in many unexpected ways. The composition of the ensemble is really good, with Heather Graham, perhaps the weakest one. Casey Affleck, like her brother, is really good and very cute if you understand my drift. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the movie if you just want to have a good time. Teens should really enjoy this film - it talks a lot about relationships.
