The opera diva has an accident that leaves the door open for her understudy to take on the role. Betty (Marsillach) is now a Mac Beth star, but someone who is hiding in the trenches has planned his own opera. He takes pleasure in what Betty ties, puts the needles under her eyes (so that she cannot close them) and kills the members of the opera troupe on her eyes. <br /> <br /> “Opera” is undoubtedly one of the Argentinean games. In more ambitious films, such as mixing it with Shakespeare's Macbeth, there is of course the fact that the opera performed in the film is a version of Macbeth by Giuseppe Verdi, as well as Argento, in the same way as Shakespeare uses ravens as an omen of death and unhappiness. And, like the ravens surrounding Dunsinan Castle, anticipating the death of the insidious Macbeth, the crows at OPERA play a key role in the death of the murderer. In addition, as in the old play, the killer acts on the call of his beloved. But I don’t want to go that far, saying that OPERA is intended for a remake of Phantom of the Opera or Macbeth, the resemblance is too subtle. This is just a typical Argento masterstroke, and at the same time, it gives this rather simple thriller a vivid hue of gothic mysticism. <br /> <br /> Although there are flaws in this film, like a heavy metal soundtrack, it just doesn't fit with this film and the final scenes in this film is a bit strange. <br /> <br /> In general, “Opera” is a kind of erroneous masterpiece, but still good.
