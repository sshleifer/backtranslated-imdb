It's great to see a new series of chaos dolls in this series. I found this chapter very fun. In fact, this is probably my second favorite in the series. This film has very little violence and only a PG-13 rating. This is markedly different from other R-rated puppets that have been filled with blood and violent chaos. Lack of violence does not diminish the fun. This film also has noticeably better special effects than the last film in this series. Good.
