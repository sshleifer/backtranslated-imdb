Looking through the hundreds of comments that IMDB loyal readers have placed in this film, I find very interesting, like few comments, “middle of the road”. Everybody either loves it, or they hate it. Having seen “Apocalypse Now” about 30 times, and having recently analyzed it on DVD (as we lived without these magic digital machines ?????), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this movie. "Why do you need a film that is so confusing?" ask many of my partners. The answer is: forget about war, forget about cruelty ... This is the classic story of a society that protects itself from those who refuse to comply with the status quo. Brando represents a person who has his own way of doing work. They (Big Brother) sent him to work, he does it too well, not adhering to the generally accepted "standards" of death and destruction (I am the only one who is worried about the fact that we have "standards" of death and destruction ????) therefore, they send a "Compliance Police" to destroy a person. Hmmmmmm ... draw any parallels between this and the things you see every day? With deep respect for Mr. Coppola, whom I consider to be one of the best directors of all time, I think he surpassed his original intentions in the film and probably did not even realize it before the release of the film. The subtle subtext that permeates the entire film has too much to plan and portray; instead, he seems to have “grown” himself, like a wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden. I have to repeat again: I think that F. F. Coppola did a great job on this whole performance, like the actors and the film crew, but the amount of the film exceeds the individual efforts tenfold. Therefore, if you have not seen the film, rent it, watch it, and then watch it again, and maybe several more times, and look for all common parallels with everyday life. Only then judge the quality of the film. Those of you who have seen it watch it again with the previously described thinking. I think you may have a completely new movie score. Or maybe not! It doesn't matter if you love it or hate it, see for yourself and thank Coppola for his masterful style of narration!
