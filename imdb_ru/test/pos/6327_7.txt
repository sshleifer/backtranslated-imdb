Just three and a half years after he chose a monthly run (October 7-31, 1953) at the Broadway Coronet Theater (on West 49th Street; after renaming to O'Neill), MGM relied on the play's earlier success in London. to create a magnificent cast and - for the most part - to carefully “open” the production according to the sadly curtailed script of this sly subversive comedy on the boulevard and were rewarded with a modest hit. <br /> <br /> Ava Gardner - The increasingly disappointed wife of Stuart Granger, a globally successful and fully self-satisfied workaholic (before the term was coined), uses constantly frustrated David Niven to try to rekindle passion in her spouse. When Gardner invades Granger on the second honeymoon cruise into the trio leaves (and Granger’s dog) left on the island in the southern sea (were there any others who survived? This is for later conspiracies), he continues to rule the control of the outside world - to build a big hut for him and his wife and a small part of the name for Niven - or an unattached man. <br /> <br /> The essence of the actual plot of the play becomes about halfway through the film when Niven assumes that Granger and he replace each other as tenants of the Little Hut - sharing the only woman on the island, since Granger was ready to share a single pair of shoes ( his). <br /> <br /> The reason (which Granger considers his strength) reigns and disappointment reigns for some time. <br /> <br /> David Niven and Ava Gardner are excellent in their assigned roles as courteous potential seductress and temptress, and Stuart Granger is usually called just to be beautiful and courageous in combat roles and strange delusions lty (screaming handsome as Apollora in The film “Caesar and Cleopatra” in 1945) is one of the best actors in his cinematic career as a husband who can actually be as smart as he thinks he is. 33 years later, he would again show this suave urban life opposite Rex Harrison in the first (and BOTH of their last) Broadway bout in the resurrection of THE CIRCLE MOUSE OF THE CIRCLE, which ended only in Harrison's death. We would be much richer if Granger used these skills more often. <br /> <br /> No matter how promising it may sound, this is, after all, a very British tabloid comedy and Hollywood in the 1950s, that is (unlike the original game) there is actually very little sex. Honestly, if you don’t surrender to ideas that lead to contrivances, it will get a little silly (the same main plot is much more satisfactorily designed three years later in the film Cary Grant / Deborah Kerr / Robert Mitchum / Gene Simmons) (Stuart Granger's real wife) “Grass is greener”, based on an even less successful game, but for some reason the excellent trifle was not a success at the box office. <br /> <br /> As generously as MGM put on the play, there were unsuccessful blunders — a folly that ends up on the island, caricaturedly anticipating what should have been a moment of real excitement — by flooding a yacht that DELIVERS them to the island. In the end, we get only three-quarters of an hour of the real Little Hut, but ninety good minutes from David Niven, Ava Gardner and Stuart Granger, which makes the film an exciting entertainment. Not a high culture, but a worthy sense of guilt. <br /> <br /> We even have a very good side dish in Walter Chiari (he is believed to be Ava’s true lover at the time). As one of his best speeches says: “Bula, bula!”
