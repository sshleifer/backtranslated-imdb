Having seen “only” about 200 Hong Kong films in my time, I must say that this film is one of my favorite ones. Not only is the plot attractive (and in some ways surprising, which is rarely seen in any film these days), but the chemistry between the two leading actors is excellent. Top quality casting! And although often even the most serious HK films tend to embed a bit of humor between all the dramas and actions, often spoiling the mood a little, here the jokes remain subtle and interwoven into the plot, even improving the character’s relationships. The music is also very well done, and the two main themes are very beautiful. With the release of a special edition of HK, they even cleared the picture (the first issue was grainy) and the subtitles, even if the quality of the translation is still missing (there is nothing new there). In general, if you need to watch an HK movie that is not made by John Woo, or there is Chow Yun Fat in it, it should be at least on your short list! Really fascinating and entertaining hours!
