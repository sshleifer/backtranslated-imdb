I don't know why critics call it strange and gloomy. I really do not Dark eyes, strange - no. It is sad and with a lot of emotions, especially with the story of Penguin. They say there are S & M elements in it, but I really donâ€™t find anything like it except the Catwoman whip. <br /> <br /> This film is deeper than its genre, and villains are not just crazy freaks dressed as a masquerade. They have strong motives with strong feelings. Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer's excellent performance!) Is not just a sexy girl who loves steel jewelry - she is in her personal crusade and Penguin ... well, by the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him (Danny DeVito's strong performance) . Again, I think Michael Keaton is the best Batman, and he wears his costume well. <br /> <br /> You can fully see that this is a Tim Burton film because he has an unusual style and he is a very talented guy. But also the music is fantastic and matches the emotions.
