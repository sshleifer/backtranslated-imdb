I consider Saboteur the first “American” Hitchcock film, because the story is completely happening in the USA. <br /> <br /> There are brilliant scenes in this movie. The scene of the Statue of Liberty, Barry Kane, jumping into the water from a bridge, the waterfall scene is amazing. It’s not Hitchcock’s fault that he didn’t get the actors he wanted. Hitchcock initially wanted Gary Cooper to be in senior positions at Foreign Correspondent and Saboteur. But Gary Cooper was not interested in creating a thriller. Another reason Hitchcock did not get big stars was because he was not one of the top directors. Although Rebecca was a huge success, much of the success of the film went to producer David O. Selznick. For example, David O. Selznik received the best picture of Oscar for Rebecca. And Hitchcock didn't get Best Director Oscar for Rebecca. Hitchcock began to attract some attention after Foreign Correspondent (1940). But the Universal gave it a low budget for a saboteur (1942). Hitchcock tried to get Joel McCray for this film because he was ready to work with Hitchcock again with a low salary. He liked working with Hitchcock in Foreign Correspondent (1940). But he was unavailable. So the role went to Robert Cummings. Hitchcock called Robert Cummings a "competent performer." I thought he did his best. He was a less well-known actor who was ready to play a role when many major actors refused to play the main male role. <br /> <br /> With regard to the main female role, Hitchcock wanted Margaret Sullavan or Barbara Stenvik for the lead role, They were also not interested. Therefore, Universal decided to transfer the role of Priscilla Lane. I read in the book that it was one of her favorite films. <br /> <br /> I also liked the scene in the house of the blind. This is my favorite scene. If we listen to the dialogue closer to the scenes that take place in Uncle Philip's house, we will see how intense it is. Uncle Philip (The Blind) studied the character of Barry Kane as soon as he entered his house. The moment Barry entered his house, he heard Barry handcuff. During the conversation, he realized that Barry Kane was not a criminal at all. We also see his ability to hear through these scenes. For example, Barry hears the sound of a car that says: “Is this car coming?” Uncle Philip says: “2 cars, I think.” Uncle Philip was right. We see 2 cars in the next scene. Priscilla Lane did an excellent job with her role. She was not a big star. But I thought her performance was really good. Another brilliant scene in Uncle Phillip's house is the scene in which he asks Priscilla Lane (Patricia Martin): “Are you afraid, Pat? Does that make you so cruel? ”I thought Otto Kruger brilliantly played the villain. Hitchcock wanted Harry Carey to be a villain. But he refused. Harry Carey is known for his role as Mr. President in the movie "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." I want to mention more about this movie. But I think my post is getting too long. <br /> <br /> Every Hitchcock movie is different in its own way. I'm sure Hitchcock fans will love this movie. I rate 10 out of 10.
