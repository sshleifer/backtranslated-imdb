I am surprised by the questions and problems that this documentary raised in the reviews here, especially because they are really interesting questions. Of course, those who could best address this would be the filmmakers themselves. However, I think I can shed some light on what I think is missing, which, in my opinion, is the purpose of the film, what is it about and what is it trying to convey. What is this message after all? At the risk of pointing out the obvious, I will begin by saying that the filmmakers have an intention. They are trying to tell a story, extract meaning from it and convey meaning. With this in mind, we can bring down many of the criticisms, especially those related to what people expected, in contrast to what the directors really tried to show. Causes and consequences of violence? The film is not about that. Is this not “educating non-Brazilian audiences” about the problem of Brazilian favelas? Well, who wanted to do this? Is AfroReggae one way or the other and supported by? It does not matter in this context. Not enough women in the film to your taste? This is not about equality or feminist reason. Every little detail about the life of Anderson, mother, son, family and all aspects and the work of the AfroReggae movement? Well, don't be so picky, because it doesn't matter. A story can have so much length that it can no longer become a film. If the authors showed everything that everyone expected, they would have to make a 6-month series instead. If you expect all of this, you are wrong with the film. <br /> <br /> The film tells about two people who started the movement. Two people full of ideals. Two people who want to change. Two people try to do something when they commit crimes. People who went to the bottom and wanted to get up again. It's all about finding a purpose in life, gaining inspiration from suffering, changing destiny and becoming something other than what they are destined to be - criminals and drug dealers. It is about achievements and hope, not about the brutal reality of violence in Rio de Janeiro, although this is an integral part of the film, given that the characters are constantly surrounded. Suddenly, and not without reason, the film is in the center of attention of Anderson due to difficulties in life. This is because they faced Anderson's accident when they were making a movie. I’m not sure about that, but they may have even seriously thought about the end of filming, leaving behind all the effort. But Anderson wanted to keep going. So they did, risking losing the film with a small identity crisis, given the sudden change of course, but winning to show someone who overcomes such a destructive event. For those who watch it, it’s quite obvious that the film begins with AfroReggae and ends with Anderson. It is very unique in this sense (changing the storyline). Perhaps their only sin does not make this clear in advance, which may initially raise expectations that are not justified. <br /> <br /> With regard to the importance or routine of Anderson, I would say that not everyone wants to change the whole world. end any violence, feed all the hungry, be it Mahatma Gandhi, be as famous as Mother Teresa or any other famous person. It is much easier to communicate and take inspiration from someone who, like everyone else, is actually trying to change their harsh lives, raise problem children, cope with permanent injuries or illnesses and even have time to pay bills the end of the month. To understand the film, you have to see that it leaves behind the past enthusiasm for drugs and crime, compensates for it and tries to convince others not to take the same unpleasant path. Although you can criticize if the method they have chosen is effective, and to doubt the ideology of the method, you cannot deny their intentions. <br /> <br /> In addition, it may seem that Anderson is special or elected. This is partly due to the fact that the filmmakers became very involved in the lives of the characters they portrayed. As much as make friends with them. There is no way that it would not embellish the entire film with a more favorable light over Anderson. If, as a result of an accident, your dear friend is paralyzed, it is not just a fact, you make a big deal out of it. And this is not necessarily bad. Not only do they treat him as a “chosen one,” but also because they go to great lengths, trying to show him as a seed for transformation and a source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, do not watch this documentary about the scenes of the reality of poverty and crime, which it contains, see that it is a much more inspirational story. <br /> <br /> Nike-Ad-like? It seems to me that it is damn well and professionally done, and it does not affect or detract from the intentions of the film. Romanticized? Think of his credentials as a documentary, if you will, but why not, when should this cause a reaction and inspire? Is it not trying to improve people's lives with the help of music and dance - the essence of what actors are trying to do is to romanticize their own reality? Sorry, but reporters only do what they show, and you can watch them on TV every night. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to be a director, I would like my first film to be just as wonderful.
