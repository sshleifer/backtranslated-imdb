beautiful romantic comedy. Errol Flynn shows what a deft feature he had in comedy. a talent that probably shows some of his true prankster. The comedy record in this movie is superb. Eleonora Parker does an excellent job with the work of the ex-wife Flynn, who Errol is trying to play. Eleanor is also easy on the eyes. the scenery exudes the charm and style of the 1940s, where appropriate. <br /> <br /> Flynn's comedy time and wit are displayed here fully, watch his double blows, his ability to verbally withstand a blow with a quick return or act as a direct person and his full believability and sincerity, where required, this guy could act ! It is a pity that Errol did not get a chance to play more such roles in his entire career, he was talented to the extreme. If you liked “it happened one night” with Gable and Colbert, or with some of the comedies of William Powell and Myrna Loy, you'll like it. <br /> <br /> Good pace and lots of laughter. lost diamond movie.
