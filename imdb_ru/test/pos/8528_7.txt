In 1965, producer Kevin McLaurie, who owns a part of Bond's film partner with EON Productions (Harry Zaltsman and Albert Broccoli) for creating Thunderbol, the fourth film of the 007 franchise. The star, of course, is Sean Connery. <br /> <br /> In 1982, McLaurie won a lawsuit and could make an “independent” Bond film. “Never Say Never” (NSNA) is one of two “unofficial” 007 films shot outside of EON (the other is a parody of the 1967 comedy “Casino Royale”). NSNA is a remake of "Thunderball" and is filmed in the original Bond, Sean Connery, who returns to the role after many years of absence. <br /> <br /> The film is released several months after "Octopussy" with Roger Moore. , The 13th episode of the EON series. At that time, the press calls it the “Bond War” ... Both films were very successful in 1983, even if Octopus earns more money at the box office. <br /> <br /> NSNA is a splendid film made by superb technicians directed by Irwin Kershner, who led the Empire Strikes Back, by Douglas Slocombe, the filmmaker of Raiders of the Lost Ark, and screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr., who wrote “ Three Days of the Condor "- among others ... <br /> <br /> The cast is great with Connery, then relatively unknown to Kim Basinger, Barbara Carrera, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max von Sydow, Edward Fox ... <br / > <br /> Although All That For The Movie remains inferior to the original "Thunderball". In order to become a real Bond film, it lacks many basic components: there is no traditional weapon barrel sequence, there is no “James Bond theme”, M and Q are not performed by traditional actors ... This is the reason for copyright: only EON is allowed to use these elements. In short, the classic cinematic atmosphere of 007 is missing from NSNA. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is exciting and enjoyable. Brandauer is a very good villain, and women (Basinger and Carrera) are sensual and gorgeous. But the main highlight is Sean Connery! He is great again in this role, he is older, but he looks more healthy and pleasant here than in Diamonds Forever, his last appearance as a British super-spy before NSNA.
