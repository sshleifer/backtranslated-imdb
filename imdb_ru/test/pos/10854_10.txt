As a lesbian, I am tired of being portrayed in movies and on television as a sad person, always vacillating between suicide and murder, but I am never destined to find happiness? <br /> <br /> If you, like me, are fed up with the anti-lesbian propaganda of Hollywood, you will breathe a sigh of relief from this amazing proposal from the BBC. Nan Astley - restaurateur's daughter Oyster House, who "wonders why she can't feel what she should think about Freddie" (one of the local guys who looks at her). She falls ?? and hard falls ?? for Kitty Butler, a male wannabe with a visit to the theater troupe. Does Nan accompany Kitty to London as her dresser ?? <br /> <br /> Not everything that happens with Nan is pleasant in this story, and some of her actions are not too pure either - but she will win your heart, and her story of victorious love will leave you with a beautiful lump in your throat in the end. <br /> <br /> If you are a macho-hating lesbian or a homophobic housewife, or some religious fundamentalist who believes that homosexuals should die and go to hell, this series is not for you. But if you have a heart, and you believe in love, you will cry as much as I do!
