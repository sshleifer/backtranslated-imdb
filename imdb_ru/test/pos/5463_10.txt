as a former television editor, I can say that it is as authentic as possible. This even led to the fact that the producer Letterman (who is considered to be the source) resigned (eventually) in real life. Letterman was outraged (well, so one nonsense is that he throws softballs on a tire swing on his estate; full production), but the basic information is very cheerful, starting with the silly war for Letterman, when he decided to leave NBC for Leno. problems with an agent who was not ready for a big time, but whom he allowed to start the show (almost to a catastrophic exit) because of his famous loyalty. If any of you guys don't understand why Letterman is jealous to this day, watch this tape.
