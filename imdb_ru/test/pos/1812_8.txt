For the most part, romantic films have never been my cup of tea. But “The Valley of the Girls” is one of the few romantic films that I can not only watch, but also enjoy them. Nicolas Cage is great in her first role, and Deborah Foreman is cute to the limit. There are some side stories that tend to get confused, but not enough to shrink this film.
