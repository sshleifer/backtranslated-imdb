This movie is just superb. It is funny as in hell, and as old as in the mountains. The acting is gorgeous, and this is an exciting spectacle of post-war Britain and how we behaved in those days. It seems that it was some kind of preliminary video in the films “St. Trinian ”(given the link between Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford - there is also a very young George Cole who appeared in many films of“ St. Trinians ”), but I do not understand the connection myself. This was shown on BBC4 recently after the biography of the creator of St. Trinian's Ronald Searle, however I missed enough biography to miss the connection with this film. In any case, a great movie in itself and something that should be preserved at all times!
