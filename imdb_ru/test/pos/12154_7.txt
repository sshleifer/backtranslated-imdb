I would be interested to hear from director Barbet Schroeder, why he decided to make Sea his first film, or rather, that he is interested in hippies - or, rather, in this form of Euro-hippie paradise - and about their death. The film is, at least, truthful enough to interest him, but, in truth, it is strange, biased. This heroin (aka “Horse”) is a terrible thing, rotten, a conclusion for many stupid drug users who believe this is all-end-all, because it is basically like this: after this, everything else stops it becomes life, and it is either a continuous run for the same, or death. “More” begins with a novel between a girl from New York and a man from Germany, but becomes something else, for better or for worse (sometimes in the same scene). <br /> <br /> These are mainly about two “young people, Estelle and Stephen, who meet in the city where Stephen came as a wanderer from his native country. She, too, is roaming and, perhaps, too friendly with a great pusher named Wolf. They find themselves on a remote island somewhere nearby and, after a somewhat brave fight for some kind of “horse” Estelle, they also find a litter in the form of a seemingly remote house on the seashore. Schroeder's comment about youth, sex and drugs is not too simplified, which makes the film really meaningful and smart after many years. This is both direct and subtle, more about the characters, and then about the fact that what he portrays may be in other hands just a propaganda picture of hippie exploitation. Perhaps the most pleasant thing, and this is just an assumption, Schroeder uses a kind of long sequence from Bergmanovsky's “Summer with Monica” as inspiration: two children in unrelenting communication, some good, some, certainly, not very good, tuned ?) Perfectly shot landscapes. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I have to mention that there are problems, some of which are really serious. The performances are not very convincing; some scenes hit some power or have actors in good communication with each other, but Klaus Grumberg plays himself, even if he is a wicked German by nature (in this case, I would prefer Klaus Kinsky in this role to make him crazier but enough deep for the subject), like Farmer in his own degree. And in the script there are gaps of naivety that do not allow it to be as deep as it really seems. On the other hand, there are two big goals: Nestor Almendros, the great cinematographer (that is, “Days of Heaven”) is DP and is a great impetus for a new director such as Schröder. Almost every image is seen with an amazing purpose or skill, whether it be a picture of rocks by the sea or the sun or something as simple as the seemingly natural light of a room. <br /> <br /> Another thing is Pink Floyd, probably the main reason why I and many others heard about the film in the first place (years before I really understood who Schroeder was, I saw the soundtrack " More, whenever I looked through Pink Floyd albums). Everywhere there is very good music, sometimes an amazing variety, which gives them the reputation they deserve. Some of them are also a bit tedious, even though this is a film about free love and a lot of drugs, and sometimes at the same time. I would not rate it somewhere as high as Meddle or Animals, of course, not Dark Side, but it also helps to raise the subject to another step, especially when someone expects the least of it, or in low tones, or swims inside and outside buildings. like Stephen or others walk the streets. This is almost a better atmosphere than the film itself deserves, but in general “The Sea” is still worth seeing, as a sketchy period, but powerful, as a less ambitious, but more substantial Zabriskie Point.
