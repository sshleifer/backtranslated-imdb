I think that this short television series was absolutely wonderful and gave both a comprehensive and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the moment. It was most certainly David Attenborough at his best. I personally thought it was one of the best documentaries in the last decade. It is definitely worth the money people! <br /> <br /> I also found a little about the abyss and deep water in the most exciting and interesting part. It was incredible to know that the Blue Planet team discovered more than 10 new types of underwater life! <br /> <br /> In this documentary, Attemboro almost certainly justified its high reputation. <br /> <br /> It was a masterpiece, and it will always be considered one of the best contemporary documentaries. <br /> <br /> Many people congratulate the Blue Planet team.
