“Who will love my children?” The saddest film I've ever seen. Certain 10/10. Released on television in 1983. The film was released on VHS. A DVD release is required rather than later. A mother dying of cancer must find a home for all her children before she dies, because she thinks that her husband and the father of the children cannot take care of them after her death. She manages to find homes for children, except for one, a boy whom no one is looking for because he suffers from epilepsy. Very sad when you did not want. In a really good tear, get in the hands of this film. I am a man, even I cried when I watched this movie. Do not miss.
