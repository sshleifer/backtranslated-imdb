Felix watches as the actor rehearses his lines: “Ham, ham! My kingdom for a ham sandwich !!! ”A dramatic guy who tells Felix that he“ will have to sacrifice his art and go to the movies. ” He is in tears. Felix just looks at him like he's crazy and shrugs. The old man tells Felix to “go ahead” and find money to pay for a trip to Hollywood. Felix thinks: “How does he expect me to get the money?” Of course, after a few minutes (this is a cartoon), he notices that the owner of the shoe business exposes a “bankrupt” sale on his store. Felix has a plan to save him, and a man promises a cat $ 500 if it works. <br /> <br /> Well, yes, but the man wants to go alone and leave Felix at home. In the outrageous scene, Felix turns into a briefcase, and that’s how he gets into Hollywood, turning himself back into a cat when they get there. <br /> <br /> Then we see Felix trying to get into show business. His listening scenes are very funny, especially with his imitation of Charlie Chaplin. In addition, there are caricatures of some famous silent film stars and executives. In general, there is a lot of material in this 9.5-minute cartoon. It's amazing how much more you can get in an extra 2.5 minutes, assuming that most animated shorts last seven minutes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there was a lot of laughter and even more fun things you could do. Look only in the cartoon, like Felix has a sword duel with giant mosquitoes! Crazy things.
