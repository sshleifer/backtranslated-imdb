I watched this film in my French lesson, as part of, say, "French culture." I thought how it was filmed, and the editing was really good, but it was mostly interesting, especially the guy who played Wendy's brother. In addition, the storyline was really good, as well as believable and at the same time adventurous. <br /> <br /> Favorite part: when William makes fun of a German student and when he plays out how flies multiply! :) <br /> <br /> My French is not very good, but with subtitles I can understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> LOOK!
