This film was supposed to be the funniest film I've ever seen in my whole life. I laughed so hard that I almost burst out. After the film was made, I laughed for about an hour, thinking about the last thing I saw in the film. It's definitely 100 times better than in the first Jakas movie. I loved seeing them all together again. If you are squeamish or do not like rough children's humor, you will not like this movie. If you can enter with an open mind and not take it seriously, then you will laugh at your ass. Surprisingly, no one was killed in this film. Each seen in this film is so original and so different from the next that you will not know what to expect. <br /> <br /> Mike Webber
