I went to the preview "Rory O'Shea was here." I like this film better than I expected, because great actors and powerful work. This is a film about the friendship of two young people with disabilities. Rory - free spirit of a young man who wants to be independent regardless of his muscular dystrophy Duchenne. He can only move with two fingers, but he can eloquently speak and help his new buddy Michael, who has cerebral palsy and has a significant speech disorder. I suppose this is enough to start with a weeping drama. Well it is. But with inspirational messages and deeply exciting actions. It made me look at my life for what I take for granted. What would I do if all I could do was move two fingers? I should feel grateful for what I have and what I can do. This is a good movie, although it could be better.
