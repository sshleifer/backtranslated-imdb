Boogie Nights is one of the best films of the 90s, and I would even say that it should be in the top 250 IMDb. I can understand why many people will not like it because of the subject. However, I personally feel that many, judging by the statement of the audience and critics about this film, say that he makes first-class films. <br /> <br /> Direction and actions in this film are superior to good and reach the level of brilliance. This is not one scene in this film, which is not surprising. Individual characters reach out and touch you. Given that this is a film about the porn industry, one would not imagine sex scenes can be handled with such sensitivity, but they are. This is one of the best directions I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies. <br /> <br /> The film does not tell the story of one particular person, but about many. This is a study of character. about people who have many layers and who are perhaps the ones in the industry most of all find aliens, but who still dream of the same dreams and have both bad and good ones for them. “Boogie Nights” draws you into their story from the very beginning, and although the film is long (I think it's almost 3 hours), you honestly don’t even notice. And when it ends, you don’t seem to want it ... <br /> <br /> I’m not so easily impressed, that is, there are not so many films that I would rate 10 out of 10, but this is one Besides studying several characters, this use of music in the film. I have never seen in all the years of watching films that the music tells the story in the same way as in this film. This was such a perfection, you know, this is not something that you will see every day. <br /> <br /> Bert Reynolds’s performance was probably the best that I’ve ever seen him, and Mark Wahlberg is incredible (I'm amazed that there are people who say that he is not behaving badly. I don’t know as someone who sees it might think so), but the person who really surprised me was Heather Graham (Rollergirl), who is absolutely fantastic in his role, in particular, one memorable scene with Burt Reynolds in a limousine is closer by the end. <br /> <br /> Again I will repeat other IMDb reviewers, saying that this film is not for everyone. But I still think it was Topnotch 10 out of 10.
