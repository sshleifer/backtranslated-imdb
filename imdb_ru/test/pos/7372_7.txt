"Campfire Tales" consist mainly of three creepy stories that a group of friends tells after they get into a car accident in the woods after a concert. The film begins with the classic “Hook” story, and then we meet a group of friends who are going home from a concert. They smash their car, extinguish torches and light a fire in a small abandoned chapel, waiting for someone to arrive with help when they warm themselves around the fire. To pass the time, they decided to start telling classic scary stories about terrorized newlyweds, a girl who falls prey to an Internet predator, and a motorist who takes refuge in a haunted house. As they tell terrible stories, each story is becoming more and more horrifying, but the real shock that awaits them is still to come ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the last story they tell is probably the most terrible and some authentic, frightening effects. The first story was fine, and the sequence of motor homes at the end was a bit creepy. The second story caused a lot of obscurity, more than any other, but this is a non-original plot, because it is a fall. I remember watching this movie a long time ago, when I was eight years old on HBO, and the third story scared the hell out of me, although now I'm not scared. You are likely to recognize some of the actors here, in particular, Amy Smart from the first story about “interception”, and Christine Taylor as one of the main actresses in the film. The final turn was also quite interesting, I know that I did not expect this, I thought it was all skillfully connected. <br /> <br /> To summarize, if you're looking for a horror movie that is worth the time, rent it, you should be happy. This is a magnificent anthology of some of the classic urban legends, and the whole movie was neatly connected. This is much better than one would expect. 7/10.
