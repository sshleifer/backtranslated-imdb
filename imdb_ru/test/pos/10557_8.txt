My father-hero was my favorite movie when I was younger. We are talking about Andre, a divorced French man who wants to take his beautiful daughter (Katherine Heigl) on vacation, hoping to get closer to her. But of course Nicole isn’t easy to get along with, she’s just starting Puberty, I suppose. She is angry and offended that her father has never been near her and decides to give him trouble. Once on the beach, Nicole meets a beautiful Ben, and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad. The whole island is being drawn in and the film turns into a fun-filled, wild entertainment film. I would give “Father to hero” 8/10
