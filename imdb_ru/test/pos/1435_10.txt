I saw this film about 12 years ago, and I still remember it, as if I had recently seen it. That is what influenced me. <br /> <br /> Considering that this is a film from the 50s, I think that it was ahead of its time. I was surprised at how he maintains his integrity in this matter, and some then considered it a taboo. Very realistic shows a noisy and heartbreaking journey that the addict decides to go. One can only imagine how the audience was affected by the realism of this film in those days. <br /> <br /> I personally think it was one of Frank Sinatraâ€™s top five performances on the big screen. <br /> When others discuss films about mental illness and / or addiction, I always recommend "The Man with the Golden Hand" as one of the top five to watch.
