HOOT about these three teenagers who are trying to save a bunch of burrowing owls. now it seems to me that they are correctly opposed to what is right and what is not. In this film, a child named Roy Eberhardt (Logan Lerman) moved from Montana to Florida. and as soon as he gets on the bus, the name of the bully, Dana Matterson, finally begins to mock him, the next day, Roy hits the bully and runs off the bus, chasing the mysterious running boy. after all that Roy finally meets the Running Boy, whose name is Mallet Fingers (Cody Linley), and in fact his nickname that his half-sister Beatrice (Brie Larson) gave him because he can catch Mallet with his bare hands. In any case, Mallet Fingers and Roy become friends, and together with Beatrice, they stop building a new pancake restaurant. Mullet Fingers is the one who is behind all the vandalism that happened there, and later he was bitten by one of the dogs who were sent there to guard the construction site. so they stood in front of the filth that the bulldozer was driving, and everyone saw the owls, it turned out to be a great movie because it showed where children can change their lives by confronting right and wrong. that's what's good about this movie. He teaches a lot to all about wildlife and its importance.
