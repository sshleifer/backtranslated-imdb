Hypnotic film Nortforka Michael Polish - a film that will remain in memory for a long time. This exquisitely created film, written by Michael and Marc Polishy, ​​is visually one of the best things that came out last year from the world of independent films. The film is superbly photographed by M. David Mullen, and Stuart Matthewman is stalking him. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen the movie yet, you should probably stop reading here. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​setting up a film in Montana was a big coup for the Polish brothers. Never before have the majestic views of the country and the mountains were not so vividly captured as in the "Northforka". We do not need color! Beauty in the dark tones of the film, which reinforces the story of devastation in this distant outpost. <br /> <br /> In the center of the story is Irvine, a sick child under the care of the mysterious father of Harlan. This boy is seen in his bed, where a good priest prescribes medicine for his body. But is he really there at all? We observe how he interacts with the strange group that we first encounter in the cemetery. There are two newly opened graves. Will one of them be for Irwin? <br /> <br /> At the same time, another storyline plays parallel to this first theme. We see six men in black who came to the area to remove as many people from the area as possible. It will be a bed for an artificial lake to be created. Their reward is one acre and a half of property on the lake shore if they move a certain number of people. <br /> <br /> The third storyline focuses on a mystical group consisting of Flower Hercules, a Cup of Tea, Cod and Happy. They follow the possibility of communication with an angel who was wounded in this area. When Irwin meets them at the cemetery, he offers help only if they take him at least a thousand miles away. We watch the quartet inspect the feathers that the boy put on the pages of his bible. Can Irwin be that angel? <br /> <br /> The final sequence shows us that all sides are leaving Northfork in different directions. Men in black ride in their cars, perhaps go home to enjoy the newly acquired objects, which they are given as a reward. It is evident that the mystical group sits on a plane and takes off to a higher place. We also understand that the child in Father Harlan, despite the medications and care that he received from the holy man, is dead. <br /> <br /> Michael Polish received one of the best ensembles from all the leaders. Nick Nolte, like Father Harlan, makes a low image in his depiction of this kind man. James Woods, like Walter, one of the men who work for the developer, does an excellent job with his work. The biggest surprise is the duel Farmer, which makes a great impression like Irwin. This children's actor, with the right guidance, makes a big promise. <br /> <br /> Daryl Hanna, Robin Sachs, Ben Foster and Anthony Edwards, a man with funny glasses, are brilliantly acting in a mystic group. Peter Coyote, Mark Polish, Ben Foster and other actors are flawless under the guidance of Mr. Paul. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film lies in its simplicity. The vision of Mr. Polyash will haunt the memory. Images of Montana, as perhaps unreal landscape, - one of the best things in American films for a long time.
