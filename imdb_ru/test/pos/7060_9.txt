This is easily the best movie about summer camp. In fact, few of them are even honest, not to mention having fun like this one. <br /> <br /> The film is just good, clean, funny. Many people who went to summer camp in childhood will see that he is represented here exactly as usual, but with a mixed farce comedy. Bill Murray, as the camp's chief adviser, Tripper, leads an excellent ensemble of actors, and is usually located in the center of lush rubbish. Tripper has excellent commercials, which usually broadcast their jokes in the form of pseudo-announcements on the camp alert system. <br /> <br /> Several excellent actors acted as camp participants and consultants, creating many fun and interesting stories all the time scattered among many incidents in the high-jinx camp. Spaz (Jack Bloom) and Fink (Keith Knight) were two characters, especially well done. The adventures (and misfortunes) of these two are fun. Everyone has classic lines, and they are symbols that you like and support. Look for Spaz in the disco dance crowd. <br /> <br /> The girls in this story are also realistic characters. They are not stupid, naive, bizarre, overly preoccupied, nervous, or from any other overly common, disgusting stereotypes about teenage characters. Christine DeBell, Kate Lynch, Cindy Deving and others make these characters believable. <br /> <br /> The necessary lottery draws abound, usually at the expense of the director of the camp, Morty (Harvey Atkin). The nature of these jokes begins with outrageous and progresses from there. However, despite all this nonsense, Tripper and others have their serious sides. For example, Tripper befriended a shy lonely guy, Rudy (Chris Makepeace), and took him under his wing. <br /> <br /> The story ends with a sporting competition against a rival camp. This is a great final "root for losers." When the chips don't work, Tripper's motivation for “It just doesn't matter” is inspiring, and this is one of the best moments in the film. And get ready for the root: "Spaz. Spaz! Spaz !!!" "
