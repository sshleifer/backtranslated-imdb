I heard about this film a long time ago and finally found it on ebay for five bucks. I did not expect much, but wow, I was ever surprised. This story is about a boy and girl in love, trying to escape from the evil king, who wants a girl for himself and is in a huge castle, reminds me of ICO for PS2, because some shots gave you a feeling of dizziness. It sounds pretty standard, but this film is insane! It is hard to believe that such an original animation was made in 1952. In addition, the king was probably one of the most creepy characters I have seen in a long time, with a feminine walk, strange eyes (usually crossed) and a soft but terrible voice. The only problem I encountered in the film was that the boy and the girl had no personality and hardly had any features, except for the summoning of Mr.. wonder bird (big talking green bird) to save them. The animation was fantastic in most areas, but some cells were missing in some scenes that were lame. It's incredibly original with flying cops and giant furs, and even laugh out loud from time to time, it's a real shame, it's such an obscure title, because it's a really good movie. Check it out sometime.
