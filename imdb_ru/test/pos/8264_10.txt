I was lucky to record this wonderful drama, both parts, when it was originally shown at the Masterpiece Theater. I loved it, but I lost it. Then one day, looking through old records, found him again. I recorded it on DVD, looked and ... WOW! I still love it! The leaders are excellent, and my only complaint is that I wish we had seen more Kester! What a man! And Prue. She is so strong and wonderful ... living in times and ages when her illness and how she copes with it is viewed as unhappiness and evil. Even her own brother tells Prue to her face that he doubts that a man will ever have her. * sigh * Unfortunately, my copy is not the best, with wear and tear over the years, and I would also very much like to have it on a professional DVD if it ever happens.
