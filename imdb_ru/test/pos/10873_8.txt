Debbie Vickers (Nell Schofield) and Sue Knight (Jad Capel) want to be one of the class girls in their school. Ugly and ugly girls had two options, be it a mole or a prude! Debbie and Sue imitate them using their cheating methods on the exam. Two tough guys, Harry (Goff Ro) and Danny (Tony Hughes), ask for their answers, and they all fall into the trap. After a scream from the school principal (Bad Tingwell), the cool girls meet them on the playground on the street and tell them about "are they all kind." Since Debbie and Sue didn’t have cool girls, they invited them to the “bunnies” to smoke. Then they start spending the weekend with them on the beach, watching all the boys surf. Sue ends up going out with Danny and Debbie with Harry. A lot of the usual teenage activities happen, including sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Harry has a possible overdose of heroin, because of which Debbie is faced with the inequality of life, and she decides to learn to surf, and not just watch the boys. They are not happy, but they are watching her, calling her names, and in the end Debbie masters the board. Cool Australian film of the early 80s.
