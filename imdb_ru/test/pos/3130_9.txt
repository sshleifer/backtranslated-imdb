Watching the Wagonmaster is unlikely to lead to deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films, such as The Seekers, My Dear Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and The Grapes of Wrath all, he will cause a sense of awe and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a Mormon wagon get to California. Along the way, they encounter a man whose mules have escaped, a group of bank robbers and several Navajo. There are many adventures and excitements on the path, and the film is saturated with fun and beauty. The music is absolutely beautiful. The landscape, again from the Monument Valley, is as beautiful as ever. Also, how can you go wrong with James Arness? Wagonmaster may not be one of the most famous films of John Ford, but, nevertheless, you should definitely see it if you have such an opportunity. 9/10.
