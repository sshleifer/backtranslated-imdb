Usually I am not one of those who play well in dramas and films, but as soon as I saw the Radio trailer, I could not resist. This is not only a great movie, but a great game. Cuba Gooding Jr. did an excellent job portraying James Robert Kennedy, known as RADIO. Ed Harris also did a fantastic job as a trainer for Jones. I was pleasantly surprised to see this and comedy. So for an excellent story, a great game and a small comedy, I give Radio 10 out of 10!
