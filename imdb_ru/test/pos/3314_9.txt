Growing up in the print pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were able to turn a beautiful feast into a delicious day-to-day meal, this film is striking in its popularity. Good day. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this film in order to play opposite the typical GORGEOUS Susie Parker. Everyone wanted to be there, and I believe that everything went well and survived over time. Best on-screen kiss between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd. <br /> <br /> It may not seem like any of this is plausible, but in fact it was, and probably still is, even frightened by sexual harassment. I thought that the film was well shot, except for the terrible game of Evans. What a fat ball, but he found his niche somewhere else. In addition, all came to the plate.
