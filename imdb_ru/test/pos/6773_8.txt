If you do not mind the subtitles, you like comedies and really interesting characters, as well as the taste of something different from the mainstream American cinema, then take a chance and rent this movie. <br /> <br /> Two contrasting friends, (one very neurotic sweater, the other - a strong, quiet, lonely type) working for a butcher's jerk in a small Danish town, decides to get together and independently open a butcher's shop. At first, they were not crowned with success, they included something new in their recipe and instantly became a hit for the village. <br /> <br /> This interesting humorous film is permeated with even more (friendship, romance, crime, death, personal tragedy), which makes this film so funny, but riddled with many subtle interests that make it so interesting funny, but at the same time warm and blurry. <br /> <br /> It is necessary to mention the created characters and the actors make them believable. You may have a better script, but if the characters are not believable, it can sink the film, and with this, the direction, the acting, the credibility of the character and the plot are so well combined that they make this film very interesting. <br /> <br /> So, if you are in a mood of stretching, you want to see something very good, but done a little differently, then I suggest you make this film while I am leaving to learn more from the director Anders Thomas Jensen. ,
