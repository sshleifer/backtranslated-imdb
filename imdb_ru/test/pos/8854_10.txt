The The Thing is an important stage in making films and remains one of my favorite films of all time. Despite the roots of the film in science fiction, it is ultimately a horror film that brilliantly balances the spray with psychological trauma. Today, twenty-five years after its release, the special effects act as an example of sheer brilliance and effects. Rob Rob Bottin suffered a complete physical collapse for his art. Today it would be impossible to make the same film, as the studio will most certainly insist on the role of a female character or the character of Paul-Walker. <br /> <br /> The American science team in Antarctica, made up entirely of men, is in turmoil when an alien life-form is capable of perfectly absorbing and imitating other life forms, penetrates their camp. Their trust in each other steadily collapses when they become increasingly uncertain about who is real and who is imitation, and in this scenario of “body hijackers” their number gradually decreases as one after another, they become victims of the Thing. When cornered, it manifests itself as another nightmarish creature, metamorphosis is always terrifying and irresistible. <br /> <br /> The helplessness, isolation and claustrophobia of a team of desperate men who have no way out of their position and no way to help them achieve their qualified skills. The long hours of darkness and the growing snowfall create a dark background for the horror that unfolds. Directed by John Carpenter carefully selected a team of brilliant characters, actors, and each team member fits perfectly into the role they play, be it a young and street chef, an elderly and wise Doctor, or a bitter and cynical helicopter pilot. The fact is that here no one comes close to being a completely American superhero with blond castles and six packs, and the real strength of the film is in no small part due to this absolute realism. People who suffer on the screen are recognizable in our daily lives. <br /> <br /> Things remain invariably pleasant and influential even after repeated views. Now I watched the film more than twenty times, and my surprise at the quality of direction, actions and special effects is unshakable. My girlfriend prefers the release of the film for the high school "Faculty", which is good and solid entertainment, but much more carefree and insightful. However, she still loves and acknowledges the magnificence of The Thing, and thank God for it ... Because I could not stay in the company of someone who did not like this film. <br /> <br /> Classic and then a little.
