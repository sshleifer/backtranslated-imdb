I saw this movie on the A & E channel last weekend. The secret was in order, I could not guess the culprit until the end. But I liked the characters and their development is much more than a mystery. In some of them there was a mystery, especially George Abernati, performed by the wonderful Michael Fassbender and George's cousin, Suzanne. In fact, the story of these two characters left me wanting to learn more. Judging by what I was trying to say about the book of Agatha Christie with the same title, this film did not correspond to the letter. The very good performances of the actors involved, especially Fassbender and the lady who played Cora / companion.
