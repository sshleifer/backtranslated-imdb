If you liked the film on cyborg "Nemesis" of 1993 (erotic, sci-fi), then you will definitely like this film. I liked it as soon as Elvis Pompadourâ€™s hero pulled a samurai sword during a shootout. Like Nemesis, it happens in the post-apocalyptic slum of the future. Both are police thrillers, where a well-armed hero must fight well-armed rebels to unravel a conspiracy against unwashed masses. but the similarities end there. The ambiguous mayor, alive or dead, is trying to keep the masses from drugs that he sells. The rebels, assisted by mercenaries and cyborgs, are trying to slow down his suffocating grip on their subjects. After several unsuccessful attempts to stop the rebels, he sends his chief policeman to kill the rebels. This film follows most adventure action films, but is not afraid to color beyond the limits.
