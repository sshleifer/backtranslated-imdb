A breathtaking view behind the scenes on how a really good film CAN be made if producers, directors and actors simply “refuse to leave.” These guys faced serious obstacles during the two years of the project (a small budget, problems with the script and the author of the script), so the finished product was not what it was intended for the first time, but it probably turned out to be more interesting than the film that they intend to which shows that the punk mentality "just do it" ... with or without any support, money or help ... understand it on the fly and do what you want to do. I really liked this documentary, and I know that the audience will see and learn something they did not know before. This film is really “one of a kind ... it is difficult to classify it, because it contains fragments of“ sci fi ”and“ obscurity ”, as well as“ how to make a film. ”It tells the truth about how films are made, which can go wrong and how to overcome. I especially liked the music written by Ed Ivey. These guys know how to make a good film on a string, because they are creative and know how to create props, dolls, staging, lighting with the help that they can dig up ... pretty amazing things.
