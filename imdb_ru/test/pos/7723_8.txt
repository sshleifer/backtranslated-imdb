This film is a fairly honest adaptation of the Prosper Merimee novel. In Merimee's novel, he himself is a character, Don Jose from Navarre (northern Spain, and historically the Basque zone, they can speak Basque). They are in Seville (Andalusia, Southern Spain) and speak only Spanish with an Andalusian accent, but in no way speak Basque, but Carmen explains to Don José that she lived in Navarre. You can believe it or not, in any case, this is a version of the book, then you cannot criticize the film about it, be with the book! You should note that Merimet’s novel and Bizet’s opera differ from each other, and this film is an adaptation to the novel, at least in the opera Don Jose is still a Spaniard from Navarre, but never French. Why do so many people think that Don José is French? I don’t know, but I think it’s because the novel and the opera are written in French, although they are supposed to be in Spanish. <br /> <br /> The only important difference between the film and the novel is that in the film “Don Jose” he also kills the “torero” lover Carmen and in the novel he does not (either in the opera). I guess they wanted to keep the film a bit more bloody! Anyway, I think the film is pretty good.
