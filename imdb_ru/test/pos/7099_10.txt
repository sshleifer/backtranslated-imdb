This film looks and feels like it was made in a few days, like Plan 9 from space. Regardless, this is still a classic ranking among my favorite Creature Features. ***** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD ******* Earl Dracula and Larry Talbot; he's Wolfman, come to Dr. Edelman's lab, looking for a cure for their nightly antisocial behavior, such as killing people. Meanwhile, courtesy of Dr. Edelman discovers the body of the Frankenstein Monster. Having become obsessed with bringing him back to life (a common character trait among scientists, insane or not), he goes against his best judgment, which leads to chaos and madness of monsters. One of the latest universal classic games of the time (Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein followed 3 years later), she ranks 10 with this reviewer. Onslow Stephen stole the show because the good doctor got messed up after being infected with Draculaâ€™s blood and becoming a semi-twisting / vampire being, which led to a tragic end. At 1 hour 7 minutes. it's pretty strong hit. A worthy addition to my video collection. <br /> <br /> Rating: ***** out *****
