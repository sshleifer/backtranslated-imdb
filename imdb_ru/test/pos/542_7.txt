Everywhere, but there is nothing new here, but the magnificent performances of both main actresses have made him worthy of attention. Sarandon and Portman are a mother and daughter who move from rural Wisconsin to sunny Beverly Hills, California, in search of a better life. The main conflict arises from the fact that Natalie would prefer to stay in Wisconsin with all her friends and family, and she felt she had to go to California with her domineering mother. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) Despite the fact that the film is generally disappointingly predictable, Susan Sarandon and especially Natalie Portman give such good performances that the material seems almost new. “Anywhere, but here” doesn’t cover any new topic, but it has a rare quality that allows you to take on an overly used item and make it quite interesting again. This film also shows the most heart-rending facial expression in recent years, which can be seen on Natalie Portman's face when her mother throws her on the side of the road, and she watches the car disappear from a distance. The ironic story of how Natalie's mother pushes her to become an actress deserves special attention, as well as the very convincing performance of Shaun Hatosi as one of Natalie's very close cousins ​​from home. His death is a tragic cliché that can almost always be seen in films like this one, but the rest of the film compensates for many flaws like this. Not really, but everywhere, but definitely worth a look.
