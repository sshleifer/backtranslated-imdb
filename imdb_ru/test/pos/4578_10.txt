I like money! I stumbled upon this brilliant movie at a local video store last week. I wasn't sure what to expect. Brought it home, set up the player, and then my journey began in stupidity. At the first viewing I laughed a lot, though I did not laugh out loud. This continued until the second viewing of the film, and humor became much funnier. It reminded me of Austin Powers: at first everything was fine, then real fun began - to tell people about it, just to tell about each scene and setting. I make all my friends watch this movie, everyone I know. This film may well be one of the most accurate "Future" films ever made. This film is more than just 84-minute entertainment, a warning about the future of our civilization. Mike Judge, the fantastic mind that brought us office space, brought us a vision of life in an automated future. Luke Wilson's dead humor in the role of “Average” Joe significantly improved the film. Watch this movie when done, READ MORE! Write more! THINK MORE! For the future, if not for yourself!
