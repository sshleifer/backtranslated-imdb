I have no idea why everyone hates this film, calling it rubbish a parody, an unacceptable sequel, just unfair, I mean, what else could they do to continue. Because seriously. I think it should have continued (Rodney Dangerfield) says: hey, everyone was going to be packed and then a little dancing gopher, and this is what the end of Caddyshack was though the second was (PG), it was still very fun. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
