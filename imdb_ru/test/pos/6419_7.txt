Footprints is a very interesting film that is rather difficult to classify. "Psychological Thriller" - the most appropriate description that I can think of. The main character, Alice Cespi, discovers that she doesnâ€™t remember anything for the last three days. The only clue she has is a torn picture of the hotel. She is also haunted by a recurring, very vivid dream about a science fiction film that she thought she saw many years ago. In pursuit of the truth behind the amnesia, she does not trust anyone, but it is gradually becoming obvious that she has been to the city where the hotel used to be. This is an exciting film, the main advantage of which is that it is almost impossible to predict how events will unfold and, in particular, how they will end. The unusual loneliness of the protagonist and the unreliability of all the others ensure that the good old paranoid feelings are present in the film, and the beautiful colors and some effectively filmed episodes make this film also visually appealing. An important part of the only Nicoletta Elmi, the beloved and hated child star of the Italian horror of all time, is an added bonus.
