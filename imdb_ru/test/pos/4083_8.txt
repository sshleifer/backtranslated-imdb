I found out about it on local Mexican television at 2 am, and I decided to give it a chance, because it is based on a real case concerning the murder of a typical All-American family (father, mother and little son). ). <br /> <br /> At first, hints indicate that Walker is a murderer because he had a serious disagreement with his father. Shortly afterwards, Walker and Luke were taken to the sheriff's ward. to the fact that he is checked by a lie detection machine, everything turns out to be completely different ... <br /> <br /> Also, when Walker and Luke attend a meeting with their fatherâ€™s lawyer, they find out that Luke will receive $ 200,000 and Walker outside heresy. Luke immediately buys a convertible. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is a great mysterious film, which tells about the betrayal, ambitions, feelings and cold, very cold blood. <br /> <br /> I know the real names have been changed, but the experience is the same. Try this movie. I know that there are stations "based on real murders" or similar events, but it is really worthy. Pure quality of the game, direction and plot.
