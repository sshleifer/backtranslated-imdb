I saw the Messiah: “First Murders” and thought that this is absolutely one of the best programs I have ever seen. It was one of those programs that you think oh, no, I can't watch the rest, but you feel obliged to watch it just to see who did it. Jamie Dreyven was an absolutely amazing actor, he had the ability to switch between two completely different characters, one of whom is the evil, nasty man who did this, and the other person who is Jez Clifton, the cop. To be able to do it, well, I definitely couldn't do it, well, anyway, without hacking. I really love and care for Jamie Draven with all my heart, and I will always be, to the end of time, I think Jamie is the sweetest, sweetest, sexiest guy in the world. I absolutely love Jamie in the Ultimate Force also because he looks damn sexy in the blacks that he wore. I love Jamie Love, Paula Draven. <br /> <br /> -X-
