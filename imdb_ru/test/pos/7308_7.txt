Norma spent most of the twenties playing a great game, but her first actress played her as a brass actress in The Trial of Maria Dougan, and she came with flying colors. Since then, her sweet and sweet intentions have been discarded, and she has split into parts that throw her as sophisticated women of the world or public girls for thrills. “Let Us Be Gay” was made earlier, but released after “The Divorcée” and was an unusual twist in the dramas of the upper crust that Shearer made. <br /> <br /> Norma first appears without makeup, like the dismal Kitty Brown, whose main goal in life is to indulge her very disrespectful husband Bob (Rod La Roque). She is in a hurry to take him to the game of golf, but in fact he is going to see his mistress. When Helen, the mistress, comes to the house for a showdown, Kitty faces a politeness situation, but behind closed doors she has a lot of emotions, and Bob leaves forever. <br /> <br /> Three years later, Mrs. Cortland Brown (Kitty) comes to visit the eccentric Mrs. Bucciult (“Buxi”) (Marie Dressler). Kitty is now a knockout, and Buxy has a job for her. She wants Kitty to shoot an affair with a guest at home, who, in turn, removes an affair with granddaughter Diana (beauty Sally Eilers). Shock !! Horror!! - man is none other than Bob, her ex-husband !!! Kitty is fond of meeting with sophistication and wit - “it seems that something strangely familiar in this man” !!! - and no one will be wiser. <br /> <br /> The film then turns into one of those early very "talkative", boring "comedy" comedies. Kitty bewitches all men, and Bob desperately tries to start over. Women play all the strong roles in this film - men are just puppets. Raymond Hackett seems to be in the film as an additional butler - “give me a pillow”, “bring me a drink”, “move this chair” instead of the exhausted groom Diana. Norma Shearer is, of course, the whole show, Marie Dressler adds “Buxi” to her list of eccentric images, and Sally Eilers is really watching how magnificent Diana is.
