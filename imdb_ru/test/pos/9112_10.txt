I am a HUGE fan of Tenacious D and I think that this is not the funniest film in the world, but the most entertaining. This is not laughter per minute, but this is not what D. intended. I entered the film, watching all the HBO shows, remembered both albums, and it made it even more pleasant. A lot of jokes from previous Tenacious D albums and HBO shows. Since I already knew the new album, I knew 40 minutes of the film, because this is a musical comedy. I would say that he has the best first 5 minutes of any movie and the best last 5 minutes of any movie. Hands down. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie now!
