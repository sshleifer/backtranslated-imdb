I have a video store with hundreds of documentaries. I have seen many of them and love all the wonderful information there. Only a small handful, although close to an offer of information as important as this. I read the reviews of other people about this film and I can not help but notice that the main things that people criticize do not matter. Such as “This is very one-sided” Such a pathetic critic, wherever you look in society, you will see the other side, and if you still need help, go to globalpublic.com. "They are the same people over and over again." Eh, one would believe that these people are experts, so perhaps they are the best people to interview. “The shooting style is the same, headshots with few exceptions.” If you want flashes and glare, see Micheal Moore, if you need information, see real documents like this one. As you can see, none of these complaints are related to the information contained in them. I guess these people just miss the point and don’t want to give up SUVs. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: watch this. Learn from him and continue your studies in such subjects. This is a very important material for ALL.
