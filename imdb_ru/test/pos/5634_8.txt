What gives this film its individuality is knowledge, after all, that all this is true. Despite the fact that this is a persuasive and humorous documentary film that borders on the mock-ups in some parts (are they staged or does it really happen with humor?), He seems to be a little moving to an end. <br /> <br /> The film is funny in places where it should be and flows relatively well. Reminds movies of Christopher Guest, if you like these films or "Adaptation", then I recommend you pay attention to this. <br /> <br /> b +
