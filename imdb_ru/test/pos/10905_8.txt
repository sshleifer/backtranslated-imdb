This film is very funny and enjoyable, with suitable, funny and experienced actors. I like this film not only with elements of humor, but also with music in various scenes. Kevin Kline, a good comedian, did a good job of being funny in many parts of the film with Tom Selleck, who is surprisingly different from many of his other films. The humor in this film is stupid, which causes various exaggerations in many scenes, especially at the beginning. Joan Cusack is also surprisingly funny and exaggerated; and the same applies to all other casts. There are a lot of silly elements of humor in this film, and it is pleasant if you want to laugh.
