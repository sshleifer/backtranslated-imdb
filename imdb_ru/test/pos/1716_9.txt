Russell T Davis was instructed to recreate a piece of my childhood: to hide behind the couch, to see how scary monsters are fighting Dr. Who. He and his team are undoubtedly true supporters of the original series. <br /> <br /> In much the same way that Star Trek films used their budget to make Gene Rodenberry’s original concept much more believable, Russell T. Davis has the money and the benefits of an excellent CGI to create better monsters. I’m sure that this series has been drawn up with a budget that provides for both export and sales of DVDs, and in fact it seems that no expenses have been saved. <br /> <br /> The accompanying Dr Who Confidential series shows the work that goes on in each of them. episode, which is really useful for understanding behind the scenes. Interviews with actors and screenwriters help to retell the story from the point of view of each character and much more useful than just reviewing the entire program again. <br /> <br /> How does David Tenant take place in the pantheon of his illustrious predecessors? Time will tell, but tonight, seeing Billie Piper playing along with Elizabeth Slaiden, who was the Doctor’s companion in the 1970s, confirms that she has both acting ability, screen presence and screenplay to be No. 1.
