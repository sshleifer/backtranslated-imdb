I first saw this wonderful film, and Alyssa, my star *, who plays Francis Ella Fitz, was so good in this film! It was so real, and her little dog is so cute! I saw him for the first time when I was 11 years old, and it was the best movie I've ever seen, and you know what? I still think so! 10/10 ********** = the greatest of all!
