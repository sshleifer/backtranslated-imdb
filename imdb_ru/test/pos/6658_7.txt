Well, I expected that for all the inventions and Oscar, the epic drama of the Civil War (and something with the “value” of the “English patient” given by the same director). This film is not of epic growth, but it turns out that I was glad that it was not. This is a love story amid the horrors of war, when young people are sent to fight, deserters are tracked down and killed, and women and children are left alone with the house while there are no men. <br /> <br /> In any case, I thought that Nicole Kidman and Renee Zelleweger were pretty decent and knew little about Jude Law, everything was fine with him too. It seems that Rene Z. had a more cheerful role in 3 leads and knew how to play a smart, furious wife with tremendous aplomb. In addition, it was nice for me to see an actress, Katie Baker ... someone whose talent should be more recognizable / recognized. <br /> <br /> This film is worth seeing - I cannot explain why, actually, but perhaps because it is a piece of American. <br /> <br />
