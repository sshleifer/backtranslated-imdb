I have always loved dolls. Although most children's entertainment then was not as pleasant as that of Muppet. The muppet is very, very funny. They are probably the most pleasant children's characters. <br /> <br /> Muppet not only organized their show. They also starred in many films. from the Christmas carol Muppet to the treasure island of Muppet. The first Muppet film, the Muppet film, as well as other films, was excellent. <br /> <br /> The Muppets film tells how they all started. Kermit the frog lived in a swamp. Until one day the film director tells him that there are auditions of frogs in Hollywood. So Kermit flies to Hollywood. Along the way, he encounters many people, such as Fozzy Bear, Gonzo the Great and Miss Piggy. In addition, an evil man is trying to capture Kermit. <br /> <br /> All Muppet films are very enjoyable. I mean, they are all very funny. This film has many movie appearances. Such as Steve Martin, Mel Brooks, Elliot Gould, Carol Caine, Richard Pryor and Orson Welles. The Muppet films are all very nice. I heard that Jason Segel will soon be removed in one of them. I can't wait to see it.
