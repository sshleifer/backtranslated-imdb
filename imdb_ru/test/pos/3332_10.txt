These cartoon authors are relentless with their banal (and funny) word games. The first shot that we see here is an island prison, above the large gates of which the following is written: "Alka-Fizz prison - No, the loop is a good loop." Inside the prison is the first sign that we see: "Welcome: sit down." Then they show the electric chair. <br /> <br /> The roots are inferior to the clever, however, since our beloved wolf is seen behind bars. With a pen in his hand, he literally draws a door next to him, and then runs away through it! In an instant, he crossed the United States, swept across Canada and is in the northern part of this country. It is there that we see the Canadian Royal Mounted Police and, of course, our hero Droopy, known here as "Sergeant McPood." He is tasked to catch the criminal in general from Alka-Fizz. So, with his faithful little blue horse, he goes to heavy snowfall in order to hunt down a wanted wolf. <br /> <br /> From this point on, we get a normal story: Droopy is always one step ahead of the wolf, no matter what the last one does ... and both characters are involved in some kind of wild and very funny spectacle. Saliva even jumps out of an eagle's egg on top of a mountain. The wolf has nowhere to go - or do (plastic surgery!) To avoid the fearless "Sergeant McPoodle." By the way, no one in the history of cartoons has any more exaggerated reactions than this wolf every time he sees his sworn enemy! His screams, faces and body, each time stretched in horror, make up most of the spectacles. <br /> <br /> You might think that this cartoon with one joke will become monotonous, but it is not. These are more of the good things from Tex Avery and the gang, just one of the 24 "Complete Theatrical Collection" DVD cartoons with great looking restored visuals.
