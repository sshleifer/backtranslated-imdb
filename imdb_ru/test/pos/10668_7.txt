Written by science fiction veterans Jerry and Sylvia Anderson. This cosmic fantasy is successfully directed by Robert Parrish. An experienced American astronaut Colonel Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) agrees to a manned flight to the far side of the Sun. The mission will be supervised by Jason Webb (Patrick Weemark), and his scientist from the Euro Sec space agency John Caine (Jan Hendry) will accompany Ross. They will explore a newly discovered planet that is on the same orbit as the Earth ... except that it is always hidden on the other side of the Sun. Ross - the only one who returned to Earth, and he has an incredible story. Special effects can be a better storyline. However, fun to watch. The cast also includes: Lynn Loring, Loni von Friedl, George Sewell and Herbert Lom.
