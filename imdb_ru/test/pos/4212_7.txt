It is always good when the film delivers the goods, when you did not expect it. Dead End Kids / Bowery Boys turned out to be in many jagged films, and, as a rule, played a better supporting role, like in “Angels with dirty faces”. Here their presence as a background to the story of the boxer created for the murder gives them a lot of time on the screen, without distracting from the main action. <br /> <br /> John Garfield - light heavyweight champion Johnny Bradfield, a left-handed striker who is very different from the image that he portrays in the world of sports and the press. When a newspaper reporter accidentally finds out that Johnny is a party lover, his plans to pour this information in the column are interrupted by a bottle of whiskey in the head from manager Johnny Doc Ward (Robert Glekler). In turn, Doc urges girlfriend Johnny Goldie (Ann Sheridan) to run with him to avoid a legal problem with the death of a reporter. When both escape, the police chase ends in a fiery car accident, and Doc's body is mistakenly identified as Johnny by the gold watch he wore. <br /> <br /> Claude Rains accepts the ridicule of Edward G. Robinson, who does not. I do not work as a detective who was brought into the details of the morgue after a bad arrest several years ago. His character is Monty Phelan, and he has a pretty good premonition that the body in a car accident was not Johnny. He sticks to his boss in order to hand over a closed case to him, and he is charged with taking him out of the city and keeping him out of the way. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Johnny seeks counsel from his lawyer. even worse, when he is deceived for most of his savings of ten thousand dollars. Making his way over rough terrain, Johnny gets to the farm Rancho Rafferty Date in Arizona, which is managed by a sharp grandmother Rafferty (May Robson). The farm is the legacy of a grandmother's brother, the late priest from Brooklyn, and is now home to a group of street guys in a rag suit (The Dead End Kids) who work on the farm. Billy Halop is the boys' nominal leader in this, and his sister Peggy (Gloria Dixon) is becoming a romantic interest for Johnny, now called Jack Dorney. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the historical perspective offered in these films before the war. When Johnny and the boys go on a farm truck with pleasure, they refuel at a gas station for $ 1.28! Tommy (Helop) comes to the conclusion that refueling at the farm will be a good way to earn extra money, and with this thought Jack Dorney decides to take the attacker to the box, offering $ 500 per round to anyone who can stay in the ring with him. The clichéd premise turns upside down a bit when Jack is knocked out in the fifth round, but by then he has earned enough to give the fruit farm his own chance to fight. Perhaps Grandma Rafferty should have been in the ring, she almost killed everyone who was sitting around her in the ring. When Johnny / Jack arrives in the locker room, Detective Phelan is on hand to take him into custody. Knowing that he can restore his reputation with this collar, it is difficult to know whether Phelan will survive his arrest - you will have to watch a movie to find out. <br /> <br /> I like dead-end films in which Leo Gorsy answers, but he has nothing to do with that. Nevertheless, he makes a big film of flames at the box office at the gate of a boxing match. Another thought - wouldn't it be great if the painting on the wall of the priest that was ever present was the image of Pat O'Brien? <br /> <br /> In general, this is a pretty good recording in both the John Garfield and Dead End Kids filmography and an exciting way to spend an hour and a half. If there is one drawback, then for a beautiful Ann Sheridan there is not enough screen. The film might have been even more satisfactory if the roles of Sheridan and Gloria Dixon had been reversed, since the screen chemistry between Peggy and Jack Dixon seemed more forced than natural.
