I recently bought Lost Horizon on Ebay, having vivid memories that I will not miss from my childhood (I'm 29 years old). I also recently completed the novel on which it is based. I was so pleasantly surprised to find the real treasure. The wonderful cast brings such warmth and depth to the beautifully simple and elegantly told story, subtly updated from the original film (and now a completely separate entity into a much more intellectual and thought-provoking book by James Hilton). Sally Kellerman, in particular, shines as the suicidal neurotic Sally Hughes, who gradually warms the spell of Shangri-La. Only Liv Ullmann hesitates in her wooden image of a school teacher (a role much more suitable for the type of Julie Andrews. The fact that Finch, Ullmann and Hassi are all duplicated is not important, as it is almost impossible to say. surpasses the lyrics, but still it is a vivid and exciting film that really deserves a proper DVD release and much more recognition.
