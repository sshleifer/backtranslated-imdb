This bright, funny English comedy about school antics is an abandoned gem. An important question: where is the audience? Most voters rate the film at 10 points, but how much is it? They no longer make such comedies, because the films do not spread and do not look. I would never miss the chance to see this old classic house of art again. But where is art home?
