Speaking relatively, if only now one could see “Pixote” by Hector Babenko (1981, Brazil; pronounced “pee-shot”), after watching a whole series of films dedicated to homeless children, juvenile delinquents, children in distress. (Truffo "400 blows", Bunuel "Los Olvidados", "Shoe Shine" de Siki, "Salam, Bombay!" Naira, Bresson's "Musket," Nugroho's Leaf on a Cushion, etc.), One may fear that The plight of the child depicted in the film may no longer affect him, being "synthesized" after passing through an emotional rollercoaster ride set in motion by previously quoted films. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this will not be the case. Because Babenko talks about his film in such a manner (“ingenuously”, as one reviewer put it in a positive light) and that its main children's performer, Fernando Ramos da Silva (13 years old at the time, the street kid himself) gives such carefree, wounded ideas, rude in their simplicity (this is a hardened face, those lonely and wistful eyes) that it is difficult not to pierce. (Such a feeling can achieve such heightened realism when a person finds out that a child lived only a short life, being involved in street crimes after the film and subsequently killed.) <br /> <br /> Around the first half of the film Pixot and his colleagues - street children and offenders spend time in a repressive state correctional school, where cruelty and humiliation, rape and murder are the norm and culture where they are forced to confess to their “crimes”. on the uncertain idea that, according to Brazilian legislation, juvenile offenders are not “punishable” for their crimes. For these children, the dubious freedom offered on the streets is more preferable than the harsh rehabilitation that these supposed authoritative authorities carry out. Within the walls of this supposed defense institution, these young souls will soon discover that the love and care of the parental figures are also nowhere to be found, if not to an even greater degree. <br /> <br /> (For Pixote, the only form of salvation is by blowing off the grass and sniffing glue secretly transported inside the correctional institution.) <br /> <br /> When the children broke out in a petty “riot” to finally express, and then fulfill your collective desire. Return to the outside world — their “home” —the intensity and form of this kind, that it is impossible not to think about the rebellion of schoolchildren in Jean Vigo’s influential Zero Behavior. Only in "Pixot" "uprising" appears at the level of the gutter. <br /> <br /> As soon as Pixot and his small group return to the streets (the second half of the film), they engage in looting, pimping and drug trafficking to stand up for themselves, with the result that they meet Sueli, beaten up, but friendly prostitute Suely willingly accepts four lost souls in such a way that she allows them to rob their clients and that she provides not only maternal care (at least to one of the children). <br /> <br /> One would have thought that street children finally found the only person who can give them the love and warmth that was so lacking in their lives. But just as dubious as the freedom that these children believe is provided by the streets, this newly found “mother figure” cannot but remain forever. <br /> <br /> Jealousy, quarrels, disagreements and murders only single out children - and forever. And during that defining scene, where Pixote, prompted by the circumstances, gets the opportunity to shoot not only arrogant American client Suley, but also his partner-street hedgehog Ditto (more than Suely’s son), after that he literally returns to “infancy”, so as he sucks a disoriented woman from his right breast, immediately materializing his long-standing desire for parental affection, the image itself is sad and disturbing. <br /> <br /> It is so that Sueli probably returns to her “feeling” pitying Pixeus from his “nutritional” position and rejecting him forever. Thus, in a quiet, painful moment, Pixot, with that young face and those sullen eyes (not quite different, albeit in a different context, from the young boy’s views in the heartbreaking “Come and See” Elem Klimov), gets up a pistol (yes, a pistol!) and goes nowhere, walking along railway tracks, and the morning light is just beginning to appear. With this scene, Babenko may just do a tribute (among many other honors found in various films!) Before the iconoclastic final scene in 400 strokes of Truffaut. <br /> <br /> But then, as we learned that Three years later in Antoine Doinela, in the short film “Antoine and Colette” (as well as in three other feature films of the next years), we are left in the dark about what awaits Pixot after he finally disappeared from the last frame, this is the last time we will see this real street child (despite the fate that ultimately befell him in fact). <br /> <br /> “Pixote” may not be as nearly as capricious as “400 Beats” or as hallucinatory as “Los Olvidados”, but it still stands out among films of similar subjects and textures. its simple, brute force.
