I first saw this documentation in the UK in the 1980s and found myself intrigued and then surprised how such good intentions could go wrong. Previous commentators (who are Australians) explained the details of the unfolding plot better than I ever could, but I would like to make a comment on what may lie behind the sovereign power of the United Kingdom by the governor-general. All modern laws, as I understand them, need an ethical or philosophical root in order to exist first and foremost and become the Law in general. In that case, and if, say, the Conner / Hemlani mess might have been created (how many businessmen / millionaires served Chemlani, presumably without complaint), then the Labor government could have been the victim of a “takeover” "Governor-General" until he saw that the budgetary confrontation was the real result of Whitlam's helplessness, and NOT a complicated provocation sponsored by "a person or an unknown person"! If the fact is that Kerr, in fact, should not have invoked the law, because financial circumstances prevail over everything, then “royal power” borders on unreasonableness; The implications in any Commonwealth country are that the “fiscal” rules are literal and that any person or organization has a blank check to break any other rule, physical or mental, provided they ultimately control the wallets!
