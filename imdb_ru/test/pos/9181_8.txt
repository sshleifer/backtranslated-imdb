Good, good, I must say that I was impressed. It’s hard to say what impresses me more: my ability to choose the right romantic comedy to watch, so that I don’t knock out the eye, or the movie itself. In any case, "Hitch" was damn good. Hey, it was enough for me to look twice. Will Smith was cheerful and kind. Kevin James was just jovial and absolutely necessary for the film. No matter how this movie is around Hitch (Will Smith), without Kevin James, he is simply not the one. <br /> <br /> The story is that Hitch is a matchmaker who helps a guy to get from a girl. His job is to give the girl a chance to spot a guy when she wouldn’t. After the meeting, everything else depends on the guy to make or break a relationship. It works only on the recommendation and remains largely unnoticed during the process. Albert (Kevin James) this time is a Hitch project, and Albert looks at Allegru Cole (Amber Valletta), the figure of Paris Hilton. While this plot unfolds, Hitch himself looks at Sarah (Eva Mendez), a harsh, independent, fanged gossip columnist who wants nothing to do with relationships. <br /> <br /> These two stories create some funny moments and they tie together a little swamp. Of course, no love story will be complete without the necessary misunderstanding, misunderstanding or accident to send a guy in pursuit of a girl. Fortunately, they make it short and miserable. Hitch was a funny and funny movie that looked very good and rolled without interference.
