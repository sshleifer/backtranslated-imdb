Thursday is undoubtedly a derivative of the “new wave” of crime films released since Quentin Tarantino stormed the genre with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction in the early nineties, but he has enough of his own ideas to make it an interesting little film. Thursday uses several characters mostly in one place. It works because every character is fanciful enough to be remembered, and when you put it together you will have a very funny little thriller. Little can be found in the plot, but this is not important, because no one goes to this film, expecting a life-affirming experience. The plot follows Casey; a former drug dealer who went straight and now lives as a successful architect in the suburbs with his wife. The couple wants to adopt a child, but the situation changes when Casey comes to visit his old criminal partner Nick, who brought with him a suitcase with the heroine and a lot of money stolen from the police. Thursday will be a very interesting day for our former criminal ... <br /> <br /> The first scene sets up a pretty good film and ensures that we know what to expect. We see that the order of coffee goes wrong, which turns into a murder scene, which the criminals immediately hide when a policeman comes for a treat. The scene is saturated with dark humor and witty dialogue, and this continues throughout the film. Thursday is a very funny movie, and scenes like those in which visitors of the adoption appear at an awkward time ensure that the movie is not to their liking. It is true that the film does not bring anything new to the table, either in the cinematic or in the plot, but the fact that he is happy to wallow in his mockery ensures that the absurd situation will have more time to build the central characters. Acting is quite decent, the whole cast is clearly having fun with this plot. Thomas Jane keeps the film well in the lead role, while funny images from James LeGros, Polina Porizkova, Michael Jeter, Glenn Plummer and Mickey Rourke support him well. This film is unlikely to impress an experienced fan, but if you just want a funny little film with some nice twists and turns; Most likely, Thursday is enough.
