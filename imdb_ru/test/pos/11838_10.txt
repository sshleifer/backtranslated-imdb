This comedy of 1931 gets better with each viewing due to the comedic talents of Marion Davis and the stunning performances of C. Aubrey Smith. Smith plays a rude old man who collects his grown-up children (from his younger age, like a rake) in his passing years. One American (Davis), one Englishman (Ray Milland, who is about 18 years old) and one Italian (Nina Quartero). There are some surprises as the plot moves along with Ralph Forbes (who had no attraction) in love with Davis. <br /> <br /> Davis and Smith are wonderful together and very touching. Davis can also do several dances and make some “big” entrances. And of course, Davis is great. <br /> <br /> Holliwell Hobbs, Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray, Guinn Williams, Edgar Norton and colleague David Torrens. If in 1931 they were handing out awards in support of the Oscars, Smith could well have been nominated. He is simply gorgeous in this gem.
