I saw this very emotionally painful image, and it was exciting. The conflict between Williamsâ€™s public and private individuals and the pressure he was under is highlighted so that even those who know something about him will be surprised. The cast was great, but Michael Sheen was outstanding. I just realized that it was him when he saw the previous comment. He looks completely physically different in this role, from any other role in which I saw him, or like himself. Williams autobiography differs markedly from his diaries featured in this film. The film sometimes grieves to see, because of the emotional torment. Nevertheless, this is a worthy experience and a film that can be highly recommended.
