"Aristocrats" - a classic Disney at its best. He is not considered the ultimate Disney classic along with the more famous Disney films, but it’s a well-made and fun movie that certainly deserves to be a Disney classic. "Aristocats", of course, pleases children, because it has all the components for a fun children's movie. I really liked it when I was a kid. I'm not sure that this film will really appeal to adults who can watch Disney classics for the sake of nostalgia, but I still enjoy this film as a young adult. <br /> <br /> Storywise, “Aristocats” may not be so complex or innovative, but it doesn’t matter. This film was made at a time when the creators of the film followed the motto that the characters are a story, and vice versa, which, of course, shows “Aristocats”. Characters make a movie; they are all pleasant, funny, have excellent features and interact well with each other. Voice actors also play an important role in creating such compelling characters (Eva Gabor as Duchess, Phil Harris as Thomas O'Malley, etc.). The dogs of Napoleon and Lafayette could be a delusion, as they are show shoppers and have nothing to do with the real story, but, fortunately, they are funny and funny characters, and the scenes with them are pure gold. <Br /> <br /> "Aristocats" is both interesting and cute, but it's also a very funny cartoon. The animation style and appearance are perfect for the French setting of the film (the city of Paris looks especially great). Animation and character design are great. And the songs are really catchy. My favorite is "Scale and Arpeggios", but the title track is a cute song, along with "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and a memorable blank for the show "Everybody Want to A A Cat". And George Burns' score is perfect for a movie of funny and emotional situations. <br /> <br /> In general, “Aristocats” is, in my opinion, the best Disney cartoon of the 70s, and this film deserves to be seen and remembered. So what are you waiting for? Do yourself a favor and share this classic Disney with your children. It deserves to be in their memory.
