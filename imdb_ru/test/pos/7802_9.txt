Soon it will be 10 years since this movie was released ... still makes me laugh .... If you like this movie, try the new "Gera Ferry" ... it's just as fun. And my favorite episode of the film should be when Salman realizes that he has no bullets left in his pistol, when he prevailed and everything is at gunpoint ... and he actually says it out loud !!! You just want to beat him ... but you know that you can do it only if you stop laughing !!!! Fantastic movie .... 10/10
