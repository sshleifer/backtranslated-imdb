I completely forgot about Midnight Madness until I found it while surfing in IMDB. Now everything comes back to me .... <br /> <br /> It was one of the first films of Noton (and Fox), and connoisseurs of keen eyes will also choose Kaplan (Henry from the Alice series). ), Fidler (he is voiced by Piglet in the cartoons "Winnie the Pooh") and Blocker (Dan's son "Hoss" from the television "Bonanza"). <br /> <br /> But the two that stand out In my opinion, First (from Animal House) and Superdud himself are Eddie Diesen. This time, Furst plays the villain and shoots one of the best scenes when he asks his father: “Why can't you just accept me for who I am?” His dad looks at his fat, sloppy shape and gives a simple answer in one word: “ Ugh! ”<br /> <br /> And Dizen ... well, he is a show in itself. Like Jerry Lewis in recent days, he stumbles, sneaks through mini-golf ponds, puts halves of melons on his ears and ends with Maggie Roswell falling in love with him. My hero. <br /> <br /> With regard to the film, this is a typical nonsense of the early 80s, when children from college do not go to bed after curfew hours and arrange a citywide hunt for a garbage man to prove which unit of students is the best on campus. : athletes, nerds, rich children, feminists or a group consisting of a bit of everything. <br /> <br /> Who will win? Who cares, you’ll get a lot of fun watching the first Disney Pictures raid on PG territory before making Touchstone Pictures. <br /> <br /> Seven stars. Catch Midnight Madness in any way! <br /> <br /> Long live Leon!
