This is not a "direct movie", but in fact its opposite. The second part of the Gypsy Trilogy directed by Gatliffe, this French work, created by Michel Ray-Gavras, is a cinema masterpiece, not a pure documentary, no fiction. Instead, Gatlif chose various places from India to Spain, where Roma people are present, and with the help of art directors, he put on several musical numbers that tell us how Roma live, sing, dance, fight and survive. The film may have strong opposition from those who question the hypothesis that the Roma tribe is of Indian origin, mainly challenged by those who see a direct connection with the Jews (therefore, it is not surprising that they were also persecuted by the Nazis.) But above Any anthropological argument is a work of great beauty, bright colors and beautiful singing and dancing.
