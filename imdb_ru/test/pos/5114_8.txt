This is a really good movie with amazing humor. Jim Verney, as we know, was very good with facial expressions and shows a lot of this in this film. This is by far the best of the Ernest films. I would certainly recommend him to any Ernest fan. I have great taste. to the movies, and I'm sure someone will like this movie. In the film (Ernest) plays 2 roles, a bad guy and a good guy, and plays them pretty well. I really like exaggerated humor when things just seem impossible, like, for example, in films about naked guns, and there are a lot of them in this movie. I bought this movie right after I saw it. Good direction, good script, worth renting.
