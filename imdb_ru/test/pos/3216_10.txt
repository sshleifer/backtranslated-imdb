honestly .. this show warms my heart, I watch it EVERY day in the fox family, and now that the new season has begun, I am even more passionate than before ... the characters are so well developed, and their relationship is so real ... I I would recommend this show for any woman, mother and daughter ... Lorelei are super fast, witty girls who really inspire you, and sometimes the show is hysterical and never too serious, but serious enough to cause complete addiction. This is the hour, which is a major plus, because you never get enough Gilmore! even in one hour ... Emily and Richard Gilmore - KIKI (parents of Lorali, grandparents Rory), you are average wealthy parents ... Emily, president of DAR, and Richard, a well-known lawyer and graduate of Yale University. Rory follows in the footsteps of her grandparents, and this could not make them happier, of course, Roryâ€™s mother was very proud of her, but her whole life was working to end up challenging her parents, and Rory, who went to Yale, did not helped her on this journey, but believe me, with each episode she is getting closer;)
