This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is really original. Equal parts of porn, fairy tale and musical comedies - this film is certainly a strangely slightly adult movie history. <br /> <br /> Alice is a sexually naive librarian who ends up after the rabbit in the “miracle.” where she meets all sorts of "experienced" eccentrics, such as the Mad Hatter (who likes to pull out her dong whenever possible), Humpty Dumpty (who broke her sausage with her shell), Tweedley and Tweedledum (brother / sisters sex) -crazed duet and bisexual queen. - among others <br /> <br /> This version of Alice in Wonderland is actually quite tame by the standards of that time - this is the time when a lot of porn was RMS energetic and nasty (as the “gross” subgenre noted) - this one The business is pretty funny and strangely cute. This is what you would show your children - if it were not for graphic sex. A little leisurely to get to the "good things" ... but really entertaining. Oh, and some musical numbers are ridiculous. If you are a drinker, there are a few; if you smoke, drop a pair and do it. 8/10
