I have seen this film twice, and its theme is invigorating. I have been working with computers for many years, and this film inspired me in a technological sense, like the new love that warmed up my poetic passion in the heat of insanity. A very original idea, a great attraction in the way she holds you, because she tells her story to people who need relief from the everyday realities of this life.
