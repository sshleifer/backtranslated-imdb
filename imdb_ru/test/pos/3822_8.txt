Ah External Limits. I love this show. It was incredibly creepy or completely mysterious. I loved all the genres of the series, from horror to thriller and mysticism, regardless of the genre, it was good. I think I should have started watching the path after it was canceled, when Sci-Fi showed it as replays, or played the marathons of it. It was a really good show, I don’t know everything about the seasons and everything, but I remember that every time I saw the screen go crazy, the voice on TV said: “There’s nothing wrong with your TV. Attempting to customize the picture “I would scream with delight. It was a good show, and I like to watch it if it takes place. I give it a healthy 8 out of 10.
