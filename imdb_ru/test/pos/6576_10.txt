Nearly 4 years after the events of 911, if you ask what comes to mind that day, most people will probably comment on such things as the kind of strayed planes and the collapse of the twin towers, the many dead, acts of terrorism and heroism mixed together and etc. everyone who was alive at that time will never forget this day. yet for most of us the memories, though moving, are not on a personal level. now comes an extraordinary film that gives everyone who has not lost a friend or family member a chance on a personal level to take part in what we have lost on 911. This is a film that needs to be watched.
