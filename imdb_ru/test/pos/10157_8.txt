James Stewart plays Dr. Ben McKenna, who along with his wife and son are tourists in an Arab city. They find themselves in the center of the murder scene. The victim whispers something in Dr. McKennaâ€™s ear and is told to do something. <br /> <br /> Later his son is abducted. The kidnappers turn out to be a man and a woman whom he knew, but a woman is a bit softer than a man. <br /> <br /> The song "Que, Sera, Sera" (whoever we are, we "I will" is one of the best songs ever sung in any movie. <br /> <br /> Doris Day plays Stewart's wife, and she sings the song mentioned above. Her performance is worthy of Oscar. I am surprised that she was not even nominated. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
