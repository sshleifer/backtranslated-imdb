It was a great show ... I don't remember much about it, but I remember watching it and love it. I remember mother and father. I really like Grandma. She was like a grandmother that you really could not appreciate until you became an adult. She was very knowledgeable and no nonsense. My favorite song on the show is Sardines in the Morning. (it may not be the name) I remember when I saw this show and heard this song, I went to Cleveland, Ohio to visit my cousins, and my sister and I sang this song so that left all my little cousins, were singing that too. I would also like to find it on DVD.
