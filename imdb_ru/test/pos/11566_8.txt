I watched this show when I was growing up. When I think about it, I remember it well. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things that I remember very well are the intro part and the song. In addition to this, everyone was ideally. The letter was also very strong. The performances were also top notch. I hope that some network will return it so that I can see every episode. Before finishing, I would like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory forever, although I have not seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, if some network ever returns it, I hope you catch it the day before it goes on the air for good.
