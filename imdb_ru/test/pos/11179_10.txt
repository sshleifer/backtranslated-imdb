This was my second experience in the Monkey Island series, a full seven years after I was shown the first game. What was my answer? "Oh, great, we play a cartoon." I'm glad that my brother shut me up and continued to play, because the jokes again caught my attention, as well as Armato Guybrash's excellent dubbing - not to mention that everyone else was successful (I still think that Elaine from CMI sounds better EMI 's). Catscens succeed to illustrate something going on, and the art of playing and the cutscene is superb. When we found the CD of the originals, Secret and LeChuck's Revenge, we were both delighted and worked on the clock for Revenge - one of those moments was that we just sat down and blew it up for half a day. However, CMI should be a game on Monkey Island, which I played the most, especially for the return of the sword fight and the battle on the high seas. The moment you come across Kenny, he says he left straight, and then: “I run with weapons!” My brother and I cried with laughter. And this is not the best part of the game.
