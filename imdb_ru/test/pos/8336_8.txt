SPOILERS AHEAD ?? During the first ten minutes of Star Witness, we’ve read a quote from a typical urban American quote from a nameless city, which is another way to tell the version of New York from Warner Brothers. With the exception of small children, including charming Dickie Moore and the cheerful Sally Blaine, they are rather depressing, their conversation at the dinner table is tiring, and we would like the story to develop and lead the star of Walter Houston. But wait, guys, wait. Suddenly, a serious gangster action begins, attracting the family against their will, and after that this child never gives up. There is a suspense, an Oscar-nominated script, a good acting game; all you want old movies to be is here. I doubt the performance of Chic Sales; he must be an acquired taste, but his presence is decisive for the conspiracy. He has a special status in the credits, so Warner Bros. there were really high sales, but the way his banal old man fits into the audience, then something is lost for me. Perhaps this is lost for a period of time, an incomprehensible factor that you should have understood, like a 1931 moviegoer. In addition, the climax is usually melodramatic. However, this is right now the best studio release for the year I’ve seen so far (however, I’ve only seen eight, so maybe this is a flimsy look). Don't miss it when TCM shows it. 8 out of 10.
