Broadcast News {dir. James L. Brooks, 1987} <br /> <br /> **** / **** <br /> <br /> Although it lacks the emotional effect of the Brooks opening function, (“Tenderness Conditions”) Broadcast News This is an excellent film, with exceptional performances from each of the three main characters and a script that seems as authentic and well-developed as the press report. Let it be known, first of all the character of the film and the second satire. In my opinion, it is successful at both levels on its own terms. The heroes of the film get an amazing depth and dimension, and the satire remains sly and never bitter. Comparisons with the Network are not needed, because films have two completely different goals and relationships. “Network”, although an excellent film, is cynical and tedious work; in other words, it's insanely damn and tired of the state of television. Network style satire seems more extreme and partisan. On the contrary, characters living in the news halls of Broadcast News love and live for their work (sometimes to the detriment of their love life). They enjoy the stresses and pleasures associated with news coverage, just as the audience enjoys watching a sweet and romanticly realistic masterpiece.
