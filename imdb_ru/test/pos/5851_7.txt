Rating: 7 out of 10. Directed by Barbet Schroeder. If you like Hitchcock's Rope, then you will love this movie. The star of Murder by Numbers Sandra Bullock is a psychologically troubled but brilliant police detective Cassie Mayweather. Her partner is Sam Kennedy, the non-discriminatory detective played by Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Teenage killers are schoolchildren Richard Heywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt). These young psychoses are trying to prove their superiority by committing a perfect murder and getting away with their hands, but the proximity of the capture excites and excites at least one of the killers. <br /> <br /> Some of the secondary characters include the police chief, the district attorney’s assistant and the high school janitor, in which the killers link the murder. The film reminds me of various Hitchcock films, crossed with the series Law and Order. We see a lot of police work, and it’s really interesting to see which clues follow the detectives and which ones don’t. <br /> <br /> Another plot in the film is related to the past and former prisoner Cassie Mayweather. -husband. Most viewers found this aspect of the film unnecessary and slow, but I found it in the most intriguing part of the story. <br /> <br /> “Murder by Numbers” is a great movie if you are looking for a safe or I must say dangerous, murder mystery. For more thrills and anxiety, try `Se7en 'or' Dial M to kill 'Hitchcock.
