Joseph Conrad's eternal novel Heart of Darkness was featured in a 1994 film. I read the novel by Conrad, and I must say that, although I prefer the novel itself, the film was a great image. The set design and costume design revived Conrad’s novel on the screen as we followed Marlowe’s journey. The game also revived the characters through manners, voices and personalities. If you read the novel, I recommend that you also watch this movie. If you have not read the novel, however, the film may be more difficult to watch. The heart of Conrad’s darkness is too full of action, emotion, and information to be turned into a movie just over an hour and a half long. Therefore, if you have not read the novel, the plot in the film may seem too cluttered to follow. Overall, I gave this film seven out of ten. The main plot of the novel was presented on the screen with magnificent scenery, costumes and acting. However, nothing can replace the original work of Joseph Conrad.
