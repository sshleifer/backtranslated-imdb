This film reminded me of watching old black and white movies with my father. More life-loving characters seek love, fall in love and lose it. Old story fresh look. Larenz Tate was as stylish as Cary Grant, so the character may have been in an awkward situation, but the actor did not let him look stupid and cut out of cardboard. Nia Long has always been my favorite, she is sweet, even when she is strong, almost like Katherine Hepburn. This is one of his best works, showing that he is better than an evil black man always plays. <br /> <br /> This film is a classic, great acting game, well written, a true love story, created in Chicago. can you ask? <br /> <br /> SuperB Black Love Story
