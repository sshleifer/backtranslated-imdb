I can't see how some people can't find this movie funny, I saw it end on Sky Movies in 2001, I thought I would be on DVD since I laughed with my own lines, such as Rick Mayall's laughter HAHAHAHAHAHA ”and Eddie“ Hi Nights Porter ”, when they don’t receive any phone calls at all, I think this film is very funny.
