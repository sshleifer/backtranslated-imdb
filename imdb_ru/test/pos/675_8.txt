Carefully, my favorite came from a play written by Mel Dinelli, who obviously loved writing about scared women. His first and best effort was the Spiral Staircase scenario. A couple of years ago, he starred in a thriller with Loretta Young Cause For Alarm. The play, written by Dinelli, was originally called “The Man,” and during the season of 1950 she performed 92 performances on Broadway. This was Dinelli's only effort on Broadway, which starred Dorothy Guiche and Richard Boone. <br /> <br /> The roles played by Guiche and Boone are occupied by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan. For some reason, the RKO thought to eliminate the age difference. Dinelli himself rewrote his play for the screen, so I wonder what he thinks about it. Of course, the problem with fragility was completely excluded from the history. <br /> <br /> This was not the only thing that was eliminated. All people wear vintage clothing from the First World War, but there are no references to the time when this story happened. It seemed to me strange, and then, when the repairman of the telephone company arrived at the residence of Ida Lupino, I noticed that his truck was an old one from the same era. <br /> <br /> The film is almost entirely shot in the house of Ida Lupino, where she hired an itinerant stranger in Robert Ryan as a master. The film is a great visual lesson in not hiring strangers without a link. It turns out that Ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons Lupino in her house for about one day. <br /> <br /> Both leaders do an excellent job even with the changes made. Films like Beware My Lovely are what have worked best for a small studio like RKO. If this were done in MGM or Paramount, the glossy attributes would be overloaded with a solid history.
