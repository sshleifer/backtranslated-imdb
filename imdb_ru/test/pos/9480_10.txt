When I first saw this DVD, I was not only happy, because for the first time in decades the band released something, but also because the DVD itself is very loud. I think Jimmy Page clearly cannot live in quiet music. I have to say that during the concert at the Royal Albert Hall they expanded "How many more times" and "Moby Dick" for too long. Besides this, it was exquisite. My favorite song of all time is now on this DVD. Trampled by the feet. This is either the one or "At the time of my death." Jimmy plays this thing really well in this song. Have you ever seen Randy Rhodes playing? Well, Jimmy plays just like him, except that his guitar is lower.
