When Pixote was released in the early 1980s, he presented to the Brazilian society the problems of young offenders and the impact of this on Brazilian society. I can't watch the movie at the time, because I was too young, but now I had a chance, and I watched it a few days ago. This is a very cruel film, but everything is absolutely true and sad. pixote is the name of a 12-year-old boy who lives on the street and survives with misdemeanors; he remains for some time in the detention house, and when he leaves him, he continues to plan the robbers with other buns and a prostitute played by Marilia Per. the boy is still addicted to marijuana and smells of glue with other teens to forget his sad reality. image quality is not the best, but the film is absolutely realistic about Brazilian issues, and you need to watch and admire it.
