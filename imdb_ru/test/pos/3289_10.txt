I saw Chomps on time - about - 2 days of his theatrical release. This is a delightfully cute and funny film in the spirit of "Benji", although it has been greatly improved and focused more on the actors than on the dogs. A simple depiction of life difficulties in a humorous form, accompanied by hooligans and villains who receive them only from the desert, is both sympathetic and warming. It also makes you wonder. With dexterous subtlety, this film affects the realization of cruelty, personal behavior and bullying. Films have different kinds and different goals. This film, which is amazing for all ages, offers an interesting, humorous look at our own experiences. Everyone learns the personality and behavior types of themselves and others. Everyone will see humor. Humor makes the movement enjoyable and brings understanding of life situations to a new level. <br /> <br /> Chomps is a great choice for a little laugh and well-being. Memorable.
