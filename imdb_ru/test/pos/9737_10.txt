As a child, I loved Flash Gordon, and watching a TV show on DVD again gives me such pleasant memories. Every 15-minute episode tells about the adventures of our hero Flash, the beautiful Dale Arden and the fearless doctor Zarkov on the planet Mongo, where Flash escapes death at every turn: Sharks almost drown him, he meets the Fire monster in the Tunnel of Terror, and he is in mortal danger in the Static Room! <br /> <br /> The characters are still funny: Buster Crabbe is a blond hero of blue dreams, and Jean Rogers is a gentle and beautiful Dale Arden. Princess Aura still plans to steal Flash for herself, King Vultan Hawk-men still have a booming laugh and angel wings, and Ming the Ruthless, the Emperor of the Universe, still gives everyone the evil eye and goosebumps. <br /> <br /> This series would probably not interest children today with its hockey effects - oh, this space ship! - but this is a funny nostalgia for those who liked it for the first time. Actors play straight and do not diminish children. I appreciate that the young viewers should have read the brief reviews of the chapters in which were quite loud words. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it came out on DVD. It's very interesting to come back to this classic sci-fi series.
