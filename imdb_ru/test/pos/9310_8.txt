Well, maybe that's because I ended up in Yangchun, China, when I saw this movie. Maybe it was because I finally had something on TV that I could understand or at least read the subtitles, or maybe it was just ridiculous. Whatever it was, this film was worth the time. <br /> <br /> I just arrived for a foot and head massage when I was given a remote so I could watch TV. Normally, I would turn off the damn thing, but I stumbled upon this crazy movie and got hooked. <br /> <br /> The plot, if you can call it a plot, revolves around a culinary competition, and this is a love story. and the food in this film is a real star. If you like Iron Chef and many other cooking shows currently in reality show mode, then you will love the scenes with food in this movie. <br /> <br /> Everything goes fast, and the subtitles work so fast that you better be at the speed of reading for this. However, the action basically comes down to the fact that you do not always need to read the entire subtitle to get the idea. <br /> <br /> The main actress is a sweetheart, and it's good to watch the main actor too. They are both worth seeing. Finally, if you have time to kill and want to laugh, this is not a bad choice for both. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t say a word of Chinese, but I could fully understand the cultural humor of this film. For those who speak Chinese, perhaps this is even better. Overall, I give it 8 out of 10, and now I'm even looking to get a copy while I stay in China, and save when I get home, it will be a good reminder for me about my stay in Yangchun and Stupid Day in a massage parlor with watching a silly movie.
