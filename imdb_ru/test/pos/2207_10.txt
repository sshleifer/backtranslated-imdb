Dark and gloomy scenery, exciting music that pierces you like a knife (or razor), the perfect leadership staff of the great Broadway Hearn and Lansbury. This exciting theater is impeccably moved to a small screen. Sondheim is the most talented songwriter of our time, and Todd is his masterpiece, starting with the Brecht introductory ballad and ending with the darkly humorous finale of the first act, “Little Priest,” where Lovett and Todd fantasize about the victims who fall into their meat pies, this game does not cease to excite, excite and satisfy. Betsy Joslin also stands out as Johanna, even she, since playing plays seems a bit crazy. Edmund Lindeck turns into a representation of bravado as a corrupt Judge who craves for Joslyn and is the subject of Todd's vendetta. Lansbury and Hearn run the show as soon as two great actors / stars can do. Other musical events include Todd's “Joanna” Lovett’s “worst patties in London” and act II, opening “GOD THATS GOOD”, and this is the name that describes this production!
