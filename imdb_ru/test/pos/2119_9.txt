Not all films are worthy of an Oscar, but let's face it, sometimes such films are more interesting to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression. This one left me smiling and happy, and I couldn't wait to hug my own son. Anyone who has a pet (no matter what type) knows what it is to lose. I believe that most people identify with Buddy, almost losing his best friend, whom he raised from birth. Bruce Willis was great, because the tycoon turned into a good guy, and Joey Lauren Adams was convincing, like a good mother. I really liked the film, and the whole family liked it. Thank!
