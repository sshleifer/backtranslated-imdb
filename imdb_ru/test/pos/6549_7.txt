Last night we watched Uzumaki, and immediately recalled two early Peter Weir films from Australia: “The Last Wave” and “Picnic on the Hanging Rock”. These were films filled with atmosphere, but they lacked real horror. Uzumaki, in my opinion, is clearly influenced by these films. It has many pretty mundane scenes that become more significant the deeper you are immersed in the film. It also has more scenes of outright horror, and although I do not think that the film actually corresponds to these two films, it is worth the time of the most thoughtful fans of the unusual (not necessarily horror). 7 out of 10 seems fair, but I have to say that years after watching “The Last Wave”, the film still remains with me, and it is the unresolved ending “Picnic in the Hanging Stone” that makes it so ghostly. postscript All the people who criticize the acting game ... pullleasse ... in this genre?
