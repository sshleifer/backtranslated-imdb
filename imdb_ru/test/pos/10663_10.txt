Initially it was assumed that he was only part of a huge epos of 1905, depicting the revolution of 1905. Potemkin is a story about the rebellion of the crew of Potemkin in the Odessa harbor. The film begins with a team protesting against meat worms and a captain who orders the execution of dissidents. A rebellion takes place during which the revolutionary leader is killed. This crew member is brought ashore to lie in a state. When the townspeople gather on a huge flight of stairs overlooking the harbor, royal troops appear and go down the stairs, breaking the crowd. The naval squadron is sent to capture Potemkin, but at the moment when the ships enter the zone of action, their crews let in the rebels. The unhistorically exact end of Eisenstein is open, which indicates that it was the seed of the late Bolshevik revolution that flourished in Russia. The film is divided into five parts: "People and larvae", "Drama on the block", "Call of the dead", "Odessa steps" and "Meeting with the squadron." <br /> <br /> Eisenstein was a revolutionary artist, but in genius level. Not wanting to create a historical drama, Eisenstein used the visual texture to make the film look like a newsreel, so that the viewer felt that he overhears an exciting and politically revolutionary story. This technique is used in the “Battle of Algeria” by Pontecorvo. <br /> <br /> In contrast to Pontecorvo, Eisenstein used the typography or the casting of non-professionals who had astounding physical manifestations. The extraordinary faces of the cast are what they remember from Potemkin. This technique is later used by Frank Capra in the movie “Mr. Deids goes to town and meets John Doe.” But in Potemkin no one acts as a hero or heroine. The story is told through a series of scenes that are combined into a special effect, known as editing - editing and selecting short segments to create the desired effect for the viewer. D.W. Griffith also used editing, but no one could handle him as well as Eisenstein. <br /> <br /> Artistic photography of the team sleeping in their hammocks is complemented by elegant waving tables suspended from chains in the galley. On the contrary, the confrontation between the team and their officers is charged with electricity, and the clenched fists of the masses demonstrate their fury from injustice. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein introduced the technique of demonstrating an action and repeating it again, but from a slightly different angle, in order to demonstrate intensity. The destruction of the plate that says “Give us our bread today” means the beginning of the end. This technique is used last year in Marienbad. In addition, when the ship's surgeon is thrown over the side, his pince knight hangs down from a snap. These are the points the officer used to check and transfer the larva-infected meat. This sequence associates punishment with the corruption of the tsarist era. <br /> <br /> The most famous sequence in the film and, possibly, in the entire history of the film is “Odessa Steps”. The wide steps are filled with hundreds of additions. Rapid and dramatic violence is always offered and is not explicit, but the visual images of the death of several people will forever remain in the mind of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Corner shots of hiking boots and feet going down the stairs are cleverly underlined by the long, menacing sun shades at the top of the steps. The pace of the sequence intentionally varies between marching soldiers and several civilians who gather courage and implore them to stop. A close-up of the face of a woman, frozen in horror after being struck by a soldier’s sword, is the direct predecessor of the bank teller in Bonnie in Clyde and creates an indelible impression of the horror of the tsarist regime. <br /> <br /> The death of a young mother leads to the fact that the baby carriage is knocked down the steps in a sequence copied by Hitchcock in Foreign Correspondent, Terry Gilliam in Brazil and Brian DePalma in The Untouchables. This sequence is repeatedly shown from different points of view, and the result is what was probably just a five-second event. <br /> <br /> Potemkin is a film that perpetuates the revolutionary spirit, glorifies it for those already committed and propagates it for the unreacted. He is full of fire and roars the senseless injustice of the decadent tsarist regime. He had the greatest influence on students who borrowed and only slightly improved the methods invented in Russia several generations ago.
