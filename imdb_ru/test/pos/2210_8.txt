I was surprised that I liked this film, since I was from school "check your brains at the door and have some fun." However, this film touched my heart. I have friends, such as the mentally retarded Emily. I have friends, such as the unsociable Evie. And I was in Evie’s shoes, chasing the opportunity because of fear and because of loyalty to others. <br /> <br /> Amy Madigan’s frustration in her daughters was almost palpable on the screen and in awkward moments when she tried to bridge the gap with Evie was raw and painful to watch. And, perhaps, I am denser than most, but I have never seen a turnaround with the arrival of Father Evie. I usually take these things pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> My orders are similar to others placed here. I thought that the wonderful, responsive character of Christopher Lloyd (I thought it was a completely different role for him) is underestimated. What happened to him when he realized what was going on with poetry? Will he, like James, try again ??? Secondly, the ending, whatever it was, seemed to solve nothing and not reach. I did not expect the pieces to be matched, and all the ends neatly tied, but I felt that I had differences with the characters, that there was no real healing or any real healing efforts. <br /> For the rest, elegant, lyrical and anxious, and for some very, very true.
