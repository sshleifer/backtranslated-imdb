The Last Days is a VERY VERY independent film. And compared to many modern, more modern films, it is lacking in many parts. Shooting sometimes seems quite amateurish, the dialogues can be a little split, and the characters are not very impressive. So do not rely too much on this film, because, as I said, it is very independent. But all that is missing in specific aspects of the film can be overlooked because of the charm of the story! I cannot say that the plot is extraordinarily original, but the story is still beautiful and soulful in many ways! It is not about being gay, but about being honest, but about faith and how you decide to live your life! This is a stupid story that makes you cry and smile at the same time! Therefore, honestly, the last days are far from perfect, but I really liked the film, and I highly recommend it! This is very critical to the religious aspects of our society, and there is homosexuality here, but come to this with an open mind, and I am sure that most people will like it as much as I do!
