I remember going to the hotel with my parents and sister. I was in the 5th grade, and still was a child, and after four years the disc stopped, but the film still remains in my memory. An adult film that a child finds interesting. This is a sign of excellence. Hoffman is one of the best actors in Hollywood, and this film proves it. I like the way Billy shoots the ice cream scene, and I remember the SCTV version of the movie I shot at the factory. Remember how Joe Flary cries. Please email me if you like the SCTV parody. Not a bad film, this is a story about a father and his son. Touching and having fun, I like the part where Hoffman talks about Killroy and how the streets change. It is worth the second hours. 7/10
