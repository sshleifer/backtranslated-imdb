The sad feature of Frontline is that, after seeing three or four episodes, you really begin to understand that this is not too far from what happens in real life. What is really sad is that it also makes us very funny. <br /> <br /> Frontline team in the first series consists of Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence) - a man who truly lives and dies simply because of the ratings that his show receives. Occasionally his stunts for achieving these ratings lead him to encounter his line producer Emma Thompson (Alison White); a woman who has not lost all of her journalistic honesty and is ready from time to time to defend moral values. What can not be said about Reporter Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) - the reporter who sucked all the substance out of her - so much so that during an interview with Ben Elton she should be told to laugh. Her reports usually consist of interviews with celebrities (with whom she had or did not “cross over” earlier) or with scandalous unethical messages, which usually have unpleasant consequences. Martin De Stasio (Tiriel Mora) is a reporter with whom the team relies on seriousness and dignity, as he has the mind of 21-year-old journalism. He doesn’t have as many principles as what makes a good journalistic story, although he holds a random line. The parade on this chaos (by name) is Mike Moore (Rob Sitch), a selfish, naive reporter who cannot see that he is only a pretty face for dirty journalism. He often finds that his morality is compromised simply because Brian turns to his vanity and allows his stupidity to do everything else. <br /> <br /> Front Line is a kind of show, which should be more, because it shows that while nowadays happiness, safety and deep political insight are interesting things; It is much easier to appreciate the scandal, fear and tabloid celebrities.
