When I saw the preview for this film, I thought to myself: “Here is another stupid television film written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera,” but when I saw it, I was surprised. The Tiffany-Amber Thyssen star (and proves that she can really act if she is given such an opportunity) as a woman who falls in love with a man and marries him (Eric Close from Now and Again), but begins to lose confidence in him when begins a series of rapes to take place in her community. At first, she is blinded by his assurances that he is innocent, and by her love for him, but over time she continues to suspect him. <br /> <br /> Although it sounds like preparing for another boring melodramatic TV movie, it's really much better than this, because the characters are well played by Thyssen and Kloz, and the script of the film allows them to be much more complicated and smarter than you expect; these are not just caricatures or cardboard characters that exist only to advance the plot, but real, three-dimensional people, and we really care about them. And the film is smart enough to provide an exciting, exciting climax of the story, without resorting to stupid scenes, meaningless cliches or cheap melodrama. Instead, we share the protagonist's internal conflicts and fears, and we are given a realistic idea of ​​how she could resolve them and do the right things. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to give this Look, please do it. Its production values ​​are not entirely first-class (after all, this is a television film), but if you look at it, there is a great story that you can enjoy.
