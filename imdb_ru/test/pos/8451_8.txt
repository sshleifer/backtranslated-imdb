One of the best and most exciting of all conspiracy thrillers (there were many such films in the 1970s). This is about the accident at the Nuclear Reactor and attempts to hide it. Jack Lemmon is an employee who understands how dangerous a plant is, and Jane Fonda is a television reporter who tells a story and both players are at their best. <br /> <br /> The events described in the film are, of course, scary and by no means far-fetched (much of what happens here happened in real life on Three Mile Island), and although now it looks as something historical, it nevertheless emphasizes how fragile and dangerous the world we have created for ourselves. Soon, expect a series of similar films about the effects of global warming (and not rubbish, like "The Day After Tomorrow").
