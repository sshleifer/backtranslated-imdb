This review contains several small but significant spoilers. <br /> <br /> --- <br /> <br /> I just finished watching my copy of Noroi ... <br /> <br />. ..and it was great! It may sound silly, but several times during the film I forgot that it was not a real XD. Acting is convincing, although Masafumi Kobayashi's acting skills (playing himself, I think ...) seem a little ridiculous from time to time. Marika Matsumoto (Yuka in Takashi Shimizu film) seemed to change the level of credibility throughout the film: sometimes she is REALLY good, then the next moment she becomes really cocky (especially at the end of the exile and subsequent re-ownership. <br /> < br /> In the beginning, the ridiculous character was Mr. Hori, a man covered in tin foil, who believes that â€œectoplasmic worms" eat everyone. In the beginning, he provides unintended comic relief (acts as a stereotypical victim of abduction but at the end there are some really creepy scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot was very interesting and made me think about how everything is connected. There are some things that are not really explained (for example, mass suicide in Park in Tokyo). and where did the reincarnated boy-kagutab come from, but everything else turned out well. The end MUST be one of the most unnerving, if not the most terrible episodes I've ever had the pleasure of watching. <br /> <In general, Nora is a very fu n way to spend 2 hours, and the new Hong Kong DVD R3 provides excellent picture and sound (most importantly, English without subtitles!) for a great J-Horror experience. I highly recommend picking this up.
