Seeing only once and at dawn hours, I can not forget this ghostly film. The combination of mystery, suspense, and a heartbreaking novel reminds me of dizziness. The actors, although not very famous, are good, especially Joan Hekket in one of her best performances. the freedom brought by her love, and, in the end, by her irresistible pain. The plot is ingenious and compelling, and not credible. Direction and technical things, of course, may be better, but they do not jeopardize the overall effect. And he has one message: do not let revenge blind you, you can be his last victim. It is a pity that he was not altered, but perhaps this period is better left alone.
