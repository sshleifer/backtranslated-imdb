Norma Shearer blinds, turning from a homeless housewife with a smart brain into a seductive potential divorce. Most films of the 1930s have a creaky edge - camera work is sometimes rather sluggish - but we have to forgive these pervasive pleasures for their long "qualities." As a guest of the eccentric wandering around the world, Marie Dressler - Shearer mixes with a strange assortment of lovers, including her long-lost husband. The dialogue is hilarious, often clever, and on-call performances. Shearer and Dressler shine the most. Shearer even demonstrates his experience of playing the piano in musical short. Her strange, but attractive pose and “romance with the camera” are obvious everywhere - and she hits every emotional note, sincerely and to the goal. For its time. . good show.
