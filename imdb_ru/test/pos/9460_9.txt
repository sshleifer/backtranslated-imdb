I caught this film right in the eyes when I walked past a hall with posters in a nearby cinema. The slogan was a bit confusing, and immediately after reading it, I thought that it looked like Dorm Daze from National Lampoon. I liked this film, in addition to a huge collection of such genres, I decided to hit it in cinemas immediately after passing the stress relieving exams. <br /> <br /> Amazingly, I went from cheek to cheek and had an equally large amount of laughter in the bits and moments of the film. Amanda Bynes definitely started it better than Keira Knightley in the movie “Bend like Beckham”. Being an actor, both male and female, is definitely not so easy, especially when faced with the similarity of life, combined with reactions to which the actress must respond. This film requires a lot of confusion to confuse ourselves and us, the audience at the same time. The only way to handle this is through this film. <br /> <br /> The director is obviously very funny and serious, the girls are equally sexy and beautiful, like the actors. I would recommend this movie to anyone who needs a weekend getaway, and don't worry, throughout the whole movie you will laugh. This is a definite guarantee.
