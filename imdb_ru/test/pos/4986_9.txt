One type of Western style that I really like is when it is weak, clearly unwilling to fight and respond to the challenge of the strong, finally decides that there is no other way. There is a wonderful moment in this film when John Parrish (Glenn Ford) enters the salon and decides to confront the shooter Wade Matlock. This is the type of scene that brings applause to the audience. In my opinion, Violent Men is a great Western, I would refer it to the best. He makes extensive use of the wide screen, breathtaking landscapes of the mountains. Women play an important role. Caroline (May Winn) is engaged to Parrish, but you feel that she uses it only as a means to get out of there and move east. She wants him to sell the ranch regardless of price. Martha (Barbara Stanwyk) is tired of helping her mutilated husband, Lee (Edward G. Robinson), but she will do everything to always have more ranches and more power. In the meantime, she is betraying her husband with his brother (Brian Keith). Her daughter Judith (Diane Foster) sees everything that happens, but feels incapable of reacting because she does not want to hurt her father. Parrish unites all small farmers and uses a strategy that he learned in the army to go against the anchor ranch. As he warned Lee: “Don't make me fight, because you won't like my way of fighting.”
