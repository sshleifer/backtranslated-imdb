Kennedy Miller could hardly cope better with a very difficult task: to make dry political events work like a human drama, and provide an impartial view of explosively controversial subjects. <br /> <br /> The key to his success in the first account is a brilliant game, although I was not impressed with the performance of Max Phipps in the role of Gough Whitlam than some other commentators here. The clear winners for my money were John Stanton in the role of Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter in the role of Rex Connor. The latter must have been one of the easiest choices in history — Hunter could not have been more ideal for this role. In the second show, the series avoids the “myth of objectivity” trap through the narrator, who expresses the sympathies of the director (Philip Noyce, who only recently demonstrated his left wing credentials in the Fence-Protected Fence), while being thoroughly impartial. and sympathetic in his dramatic portrayal of all parties. The adherence to the theme of Lady Kerr / Lady Macbeth, popular among Labor partisans, was perhaps a bit partial, though not destructive. In particular, one should pay tribute to the sympathy shown by Kerr and the unusually difficult position in which he found himself, regardless of what one might think of his actions. <br /> <br /> However, there is one sour note for which the producers were probably not entirely guilty - the image of the novel by Jim Cairns / Junie Morozi. Those who come to the series without the history of these events will have the impression that Cairns and Morozi were innocent victims of a smear campaign conducted by a careful press. Producers may have been limited in this regard by Australian libel laws and the recently demonstrated willingness of Cairns and Morozi to use them against those who suggested that their relationship was sexual (which Cairns eventually admits a year before his death). However, one could have done even more strange ways that Morozi managed the office of Cairns as a treasurer. <br /> <br /> Speaking of defamation, there are a couple of disorienting cases where the dialogue is hidden due to judicial injunctions made by the offended principals - with a sound signal in one case and a very loud phone call in the other. Another curiosity: the DVD release cuts a string from a comic relief scene, where a customs officer (played by the late Paul Chubb) serves Tirat Khemlani on arrival at Sydney Airport. Next in line is the disheveled hippie, who now receives only a disapproving look from Chubba when he presents his documents. In the original version, Chubb said something like: “The drug crisis in Bali, eh?”. Obviously, this line no longer sounds plausible in connection with the Chapelle Corby case, which clearly demonstrated that those who were arrested for drugs in Bali can expect much worse than deportation.
