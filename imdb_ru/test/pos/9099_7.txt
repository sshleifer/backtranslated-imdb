For those who loved "Wayne's World" ... "Blues Brothers" ... and, hell, even the "Raiders of the Lost Ark", you will find a lot of things that you like (but probably not love) in "Tenacious D: The Pick "Fate", a fictional epic about the formation of the group JB (Jack Black) / KG (Kyle Gass). Two non-working loser with a love for rock and roll face a dilemma when the CG's mother stops sending him rental checks; JB and KG make tracks for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after a music store clerk (inspired by Ben Stiller) tells them about the title peak (a funny animation sequence of tapestries gives the background). Along the way, our zeros meet a stranger with straight teeth (Tim Robbins game), Sasquatch, security masons, chicks of the female society and Satan himself (ironically abandoned Dave Grohl) in the climatic sequence that you need to see to believe (and preferably play at high volume). I rarely see comedies in the theater, but Peak is a very pleasant change of pace ... it may not reach 11, but he sings a coarse and clever tune for a good 90 minutes. And the songs are inspired by low brow fun. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10
