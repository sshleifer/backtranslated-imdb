Feels like an impressionist film; if there is such a thing. <br /> <br /> The story is well told, very poetic. characters are well developed and well played by translators (or interpreted by actors :)). <br /> <br /> Sometimes a movie impresses with its luxurious emotions and works well, unless you hate such emotions in movies - In my case it is not. <br /> <br /> This is a very humanistic film. <br /> <br /> The landscape and even the unusual situation of the internally displaced are very poetic in their own right. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> Good classics for any good movie collection.
