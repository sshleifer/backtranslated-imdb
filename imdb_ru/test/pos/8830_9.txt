I first heard about this show in 2005, first online and then browsing (and, of course, buying) a typically great book about BBC connections. Then I got a DVD; it did not disappoint! For many years, I was hoping that someone would create a science fiction program with an emphasis on the thrill of discovery, not aliens, fights with laser weapons and other tricks of Hollywood boogeymans! Thank you, Joe Ahern (also for working with Doctor Who, and Ultraviolet - a mini-series; no bullshit of the movie of the same name)! What made me write it now (2 years later) is that I just saw SUNSHINE last night. And what turned out to be in the same family that SPACE ODYSSEY has turned into (about 2/3 of the way), Freddy Krueger meets 2010! That was when SPACE ODYSSEY really stood out as a positive example of how to make a REAL science fiction film; more science, less fiction! ODYSSEY (like SUNSHINE) also dealt with astronaut flaws (unsuccessful EVA Zoe, Ivan overvoltage on Venus, disagreements with mission control) and the apparent danger of exploring new planets with unknown hazards (a fatal outbreak of radiation on Mars). I would easily pay to see it in the theater (I-Max, anyone?). And on top of that, not only were the space jaws stunningly beautiful, but the characters were well drawn. I found their interaction to be more realistic than the exciting story of the SUNSHINE Icarus 2 team (Icarus; the stupid name of the solar mission - did anyone read the Icarus mythology ??). Sometimes it takes a not-so-good movie to get him to rethink the best movie. As a cosmonaut, I would trade my passage on Icara for a place in Pegasus any day. In all fairness, however, SUNSHINE's visual effects are quite staggering and catchy. That is why I supported so much that he became a successful sci-fi film. So, although this review is almost a secondary review of SUNSHINE, I hope that it is read as it should be; strong support for the BBC TV movie, which succeeds where most bloated cinematic glasses with a big budget fail. SPACE ODYSSEY (a.k.a. PLANET TRIP here in the States) whets the appetite for solid science fiction and holds a banquet. I also liked the pseudo-documentary approach. As for the time / delay of light, they are addressed if you pay attention. Where SUNSHINE melts, ODYSSEY keeps cool. If you are going to go to the cinema for another dose of SUN, stay there; instead, go for a real SPACE ODYSSEY!
