I watched this mini in the early eighties. Sam Waterson showed himself a great actor. In fact, when he started the Law and Order, I was disappointed in him because it was not such a strong role. Unfortunately, good roles do not pay bills. I wish I could find a copy of this rare series and watch it. This is both fact and interesting. Everyone needs to see this in order to know what really happened. I was so moved that I bought and read the Pppenheimer-Destroyer of the Worlds book. And he saw this man become an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight. If you have a chance, be sure to watch this movie and see what kind of performance Mr. Waterston can really provide to viewers. Enjoy the movies!
