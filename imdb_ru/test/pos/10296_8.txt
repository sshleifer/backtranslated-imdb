Forget about the recent terrible American remake, which, unfortunately, cast a shadow over the reputation of the French original in connection with the directorâ€™s participation in both. This is a cleverly drawn romantic noir of the 90s with many twists and turns. It works best as a Gallic ode to Hitchcock's Rear Window, because the concept of voyeurism is a constant theme that launches a complex script. The story is amazingly realized, like the Picasso picture, offering different perspectives of the same event and requiring the viewer's participation in everything. The settings, music and ghost glasses are beautiful, as well as a great contribution from the actors. Watch it more than once.
