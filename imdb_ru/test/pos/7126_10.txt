Most of the time I laughed so hard that people looked at me because they could not hear my laugh. I literally fell from my place at a certain point. <br /> <br /> I’m a Bartender and a Bouncer to live in the Real World (note that I use the term Real World, unfortunately, it must always come first) and whenever I tell someone Something that I play role-playing games usually follows one of two questions: 1. What, like D & D? I played it in high school. <br /> <br /> 2. Really? I searched or group forever! Is there room for another? Very rarely, people do not know what D & D and Gaming are. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, almost everyone who watches this movie can extract something from it. Even if you are not a gamer, there is a possibility that there is something in your life that you are a “geek” about which you can make fun of frivolously, and this in itself means that you can relate to hijinx in this film. It's just a carefree happiness in an hour and a half.
