I thought One Dark Night was great! It deserves 10! As for the statement made by one user, the dead were actually zombies in this film. A dead person brought back to life is a Zombie, regardless of the method or reason he was brought back to life. The zombies in this film are used to scare girls, rather than eat them, like traditional zombies. This film is a definite star among the horror films of the 80s. The score and the atmosphere are pretty creepy, and the audience is in suspense throughout the scenes of the mausoleum. The game is really convincing, with a sincere expression of horror at the sight of the undead. Although I like all zombie movies, this movie is a great addition to the typical zombie movie that eats meat.
