Any film that has a dialogue line that looks something like this ... "Judy is preparing to date, Buttol!" should be good! I found this on a DVD without ads, without editing and was pleasantly surprised, a lot of work was done to create this film. I really enjoyed it more than the many 80s films I saw. A great addition to my movie collection. <br /> <br /> The build-up was great, it terrifies the rest of the movie. Loved GORE and T & A. I never thought that the hollowed out eyeballs would look like pop-up boils, the color of eye splashes was rough! I keep thinking that the “Horn” looked like Tiger Woods, but more black, does anyone agree?
