It was easy to dismiss this film as hyperbole at the time of its release. Fonda, Douglas and Lemmon were famous “left-handers”, but the accident on Three Mle Island provided a shocking context for this fictional drama. <br /> <br /> This film works on many levels, filming both utilities and television news. The year 1979 was the zenith of the notorious television news format “Happy Conversation” (see also “Ron Burgundy”), and it is shown here in all its glory. The sonorous anchor darkly reads the story of a "head-on collision" before it is fun to present Kimberley Wells (Fonda), talking about a veterinarian who calls from home (or is it an "aquarium"). The producer of the show and the station manager are arguing about the content - or lack thereof - behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> There are several technical errors. A shot from PR (James Hampton) shows the Foundation and Douglas the necessary model of a pressurized water reactor system built by Westinghouse. Later, when Lemmon and Wilford Brimley (perfectly playing Lemmon’s friend / colleagues between debt and loyalty) struggle with a sudden crisis in the control room of the station, they obviously manage the boiling water installation (built by GE.) How many details the writers correctly understood. <br /> <br /> Like any good drama, the film asks more questions than it answers. The real crash in TMI proves the main premise of the film. The working title of the film was originally “Strength”, and you will understand why. Since nuclear power is preparing to return gas for $ 3 these days, China’s Syndrome is as relevant today as it was more than 25 years ago.
