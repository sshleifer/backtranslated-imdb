In the 70s, in Afghanistan, the Pashtun boy Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi) and the Hazara boy Hassan (Ahmad Khan Makhmudzad), who is his loyal friend and son of their servant Hazar Ali (Nabi Tanha), are brought up together in the house of Amir's father, play and ride on the streets of peaceful Kabul. Amir feels that his wise and kind father Baba (Khomayun Ershadi) accuses him of the death of his mother during childbirth, and that his father loves and prefers him to Hasam. In turn, Amir has great respect for his father’s best friend Rahim Khan (Sean Toub), who supports his intention to become a writer. After Amir won the kiting competition, Hassam flees to bring Amir a kite, but he is beaten and raped by the cruel Assef (Elham Ehsas) on an empty street to protect Amir's kite; the coward Amir is a witness to the attack, but does not help the true Hasam. The day after the birthday party, Amir hides his new watch in Hasam’s bed in order to expose the boy to a thief and force his father to dismiss Ali, freeing his conscience from reminding him of his cowardice and betrayal. In 1979, the Russians invade Afghanistan, and Baba and Amir flee to Pakistan. In 1988, they had a simple life in Fremont, California, when Amir graduated from college for the pride and joy of Baba. Later, Amir meets her compatriot Sorai (Atossa Leoni), and they marry. In 2000, after Baba’s death, Amir is a famous writer and receives a phone call from Rahim Khan’s terminal, who reveals the secrets of his family, forcing Amir to return to Peshawar, Pakistan, on an atonement journey. /> <br /> I am not familiar with Afghan culture, and I did not read this novel, despite the recommendations of my daughter, and yesterday I decided to watch this film on DVD. I have found a good story about loyalty, cowardice, betrayal and redemption, with a brief understanding of the recent history of Afghanistan, from the peaceful period of the 1970s to the present day with the Taliban. Actors and actresses have excellent performances that lend credibility to a realistic story. China’s arid regions are reminiscent of images we see on television from Afghanistan. In the end, I found "The Kner Runner" a good movie. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “O Caçador de Pipa” (“Kite Hunter”)
