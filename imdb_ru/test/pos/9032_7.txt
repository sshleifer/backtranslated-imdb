Very strong drama of the small town of Faulkner in the south, associated with the murder of innocent black locals. Striking cinematography and a good story (through memories) lead us through the uneasy relationship between the suspect and his lawyer's son. Still a strong story that precedes Sidney Poitier's films about racial prejudice. Porter Hall plays a big role the father of the murdered. Quiz: It was actually filmed in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford, Miss. With many of the residents used as extras.
