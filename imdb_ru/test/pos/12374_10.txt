This film is just a masterpiece. Especially the double exposure made by the operator Julius Jenson. This is skillfully done even with the standards we used today seventy-eight years later. Director Victor Sestrem also plays the main character David Hill. On the night before the New Year, he dies in battle, and legend says that the first to die in the new year will have to work as a collector of souls in the form of a transparent ghost. Each year a new shower collector will be appointed. <br /> <br /> A scene in which alcoholic David Holm rises from his dead body (as the soul leaves his earthly body) in the churchyard. (where the fight took place) - a real reward for cinema-loving eyes. Also, when the current shower collector arrives with his horse and carriage, this is a beautiful, but also scary scene. David Holm recognizes this soul collector as a drinking friend from an early age. Now it's his turn to take over. Like Scrooge in Dickens's novel “A Christmas Tale,” David shows what his life and business have led the people around him. <br /> <br /> This film is about the dangers of drug abuse, in this case alcohol. It is based on the book of the Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlöf. Victor Sestrem removed several of his books, but this book brought the best results, perhaps because this book is the most cinematic of them. <br /> <br />
