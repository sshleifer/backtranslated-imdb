This is an excellent film, full of complexity, themes and excellent dialogue. The characters are well drawn, and Phil is the biggest loser of all time. <br /> <br /> Adam Haddrick's character is the worst thing I've seen on screen since Alec Guinness portrayed Adolf Hitler in â€œHitler: The Last Ten Days. <br /> <br /> I would like them to get away with all this. But without giving away too much, there are some situations from which you just can't break free.
