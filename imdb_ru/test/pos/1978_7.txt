Now, being a fan of science fiction, the trailer for this film also looked a bit like, so to speak, Hollywood. But after watching, I can happily say that it made a big impression on me. Jude is a cool actress, and Miss Lee does it better than Delores Clareborn. It resembles films like The Matrix, The 12 Monkeys, and The Cage, which may not seem so attractive, but it is truly one of the best films I've ever seen.
