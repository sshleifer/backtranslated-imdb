I'm not a big music fan, but this is one of the few people I really love. Unlike many other musicals, such as “The Sound of Music”, none of the songs is dedicated to gratuitous things. Each song is a social commentary, insight of war, sexuality, rebelliousness, spirituality and freedom. Particularly surprising are the songs “Easy to Be Firm”, “Era of Aquarius”, “Hair”, “Flesh Failures / 3-5-0-0”, “Walking In Space” and “Hare Krishna”. Totally revolutionary and beautiful. I can not wait to ever see him live!
