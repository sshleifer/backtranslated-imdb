(Very soft spoilers; main plot plan, no real details) <br /> <br /> IF you go to this film with rather low expectations. I saw this film in a free show a few days ago in Maryland, and the only reason I agreed to go ... was because it was free. I expected a few chuckles, but since I was never a big fan of Tenacious D, not much more than that. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes of the film are hilarious, as we are given a glimpse of Jack Black's modest Christian background in the American mid-west town. Then the film takes us to the future, to the first meeting between JB and Kyle Gass, the second half of Tenacious D. We see the formation of the group and the origin of its name. Finally, as the name suggests, the second half of the film details their quest for the legendary Pick of Destiny. Again, the beginning of the movie was funny, funny, and most of the movie, at least, kept the smile on my face. However, there were times when he felt a little long; it's only 100 minutes, but it still seemed like it should be a bit shorter. The story is as absurd as it sounds, and this is not the film that you see if you want a real plot. Which is good, except that it means that many of the jokes are very hit or missed ... and when they missed, they missed badly. Same with the songs; it's a musical, but many songs have lost their appeal after the first minute or so ... then they continued anyway. <br /> <br /> I will say that the rating of R really saved this film from the bombings; Humor Di simply could not work without curses, sex and drugs. But if you are not a real fan of the group, or at least know that you appreciate their style of comedy, I would recommend you save some money and rent. "Pick" makes you laugh a little ... but is it worth 9 bucks? I do not think so. I had a desire to rate it as 6, but since I think that many will like it to justify watching it in cinemas, 7 seems more appropriate. Just make sure this is your style.
