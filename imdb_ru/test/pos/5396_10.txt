Some might think that “Imaginary Heroes” is a movie similar to “Igby Goes Down,” but this is not true. In Imaginary Heroes, the director lets us feel the family of Travis and the people around them. <br /> <br /> The film itself is great and the acting is very well done. Acting on Weaver and Hirsch is believable and helps make the film what it is. Actors, director / screenwriter, Dan Harris, made a film that should be watched by many people. Do not think that this is just another film for teenagers, this is a film about family and their problems. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10/10, because I think that this is not the best movie that no movie can have, but it comes closest to the ideal.
