NOROI follows documentary director Masafumi Kobayashi, who slowly reveals something mysterious and evil, leaving behind a trail of dead bodies. After an interview with a woman who claims that she hears loud cries from a child coming from a neighboring house (where there is no child), Kobayashi goes to her neighbor. He is met with hostility by an upset, disheveled woman (Maria Takagi) who opens the door (and quickly slaps her face) and looks out the window at her 6-year-old son. Strangely enough, both the woman and her son disappear only a few days after his visit (leaving behind a pile of dead pigeons on the back porch), and the woman who first complained about the noise, as well as her daughter, both died under mysterious circumstances. an accident soon after. This is of interest to Kobayashi, and he goes in search to find out what is happening. Soon, he discovers that people with extrasensory abilities and extrasensory perception seem to tune into something sinister, inexplicable, and perhaps even apocalyptic. The famous 10-year-old clairvoyant and television celebrity Cana (Rio Canno) seems to think that we can all be doomed, but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of great help. Another psychic woman (Marika Matsumoto) is participating, as is Mr. Nori, a mentally unstable eccentric / psycho who wears a hat and jacket made of aluminum foil and thinks that people eat from what he calls "ectoplasmic worms." Clues ultimately lead to the site of a small village, which is now covered by a lake, and the legend of an ancient demon known as Kagutaba ... <br /> <br /> Unlike many other hand-made horror films, this one depends on the plot how much and from the reactionary alarmists from the first person. Fortunately, there is something like a plot, very interesting and confusing about it, so it does not rely on glimpses of terrible things through spastic camera work to maintain your interest. The way Masafumi travels in the footsteps, leads in search of truth - with well-placed jolts - reminded me of the CHANGES at his pace. The film also does not consist entirely of frames shot by a documentary filmmaker, but is intertwined in news reports and television variety shows, as if what we are watching is a finished documentary. It helps to break the monotony, usually associated with films made in this particular style. The performances are good enough not to damage the realism of the "real" frames. In general, this is a well-made horror film, with a lot of changes of plot, some uncertainty and many really creepy moments that are worth checking out. The only thing that bothers me is that he could use a little pruning here and there, and it seems too long. Otherwise, pretty good stuff.
