I had no idea what I was going to see when I decided to watch this film, and to my surprise, this is just a very well-made horror film, which is definitely one of the best in the 1970s. The film is, of course, low-budget, and this is a great example of how the plot and style of the film create a cold, not special effects! Stroter Martin is one of the greatest actors of the characters of all time, he has a rare main role here, and the film also makes a good friend of Martins L.K. Jones and Green Acre by Alvi Moore. Jones and Moore also helped produce this film. The TV veteran Charles Bateman is a star, and the beautiful “Enter the Dragon” - Ahna Capri is his girlfriend. Capri in a bikini at the beginning of the film, and she is just gorgeous! The film does an amazing job, staying with the story and not adding the fake feelings of a good ending, and I really liked how the movie ends. Great atmosphere, interesting story and well directed by Bernard McIviti. Martins' performance is also top notch, as he is not at all restrained and really throws himself into the role of Doc. Good and underrated movie!
