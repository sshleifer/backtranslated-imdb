I don’t know why people thought it was disgusting or unpleasant; This is not an American pie or something like that. I do not know why people are offended by universal forks; Since this is part of the plot, the advertisement is forgivable. <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie with good dialogue, subtle wit, good story, good moral (which, fortunately, is not too contrived), BIG acting style and tender ending. <br /> <br /> (minor spoiler) The basic premise here is a classic story about a little cowherd boy (Munise) who lies so much that no one believes him when Wolf (Giamatti) is included. So he gets his best friend Kaylee (Bynes), and they go and drive the Wolf crazy. <br /> <br /> Frankie Muniz can be annoying in other roles, but not like Jason Shepard. He does an excellent job with the courteous confidence of his character, and the fact that, at first glance, does not seem expressive enough, is in fact a completely reckless vigilance. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes. What else can I say? The girl has a gift. She is fun, talented, versatile and very, very attractive. (I am only 6 months older than her. I need to get to California soon.) Actually, the role of "best friend" was originally a boy, but became a girl as soon as the creators saw Amanda’s interest. This works well, as this role would be pretty boring without the blessing of Baines' abilities. <br /> <br /> Paul Giamatti is a very talented person. While some will play Marty Wolf as evil and diabolical, Jamatti made him - not just a jerk, notice, but LIKE, a jerk who animates the screen, rather than deliberately dims it. And I doubt that many other actors can also cope with the psychological breakdown that Wolf is experiencing. <br /> <br /> In general, a great movie. I liked to see how Jalil White can mock himself. I enjoyed seeing all the little links and stuff like that built into the movie. (one of the guests at the party is director Shawn Levy, the other is former Bains Kenan Thompson's colleague) I really enjoyed seeing Amanda in these costumes ........ Take a DVD if you can. He has all sorts of great extras, and beautiful Miss Bynes is your menu guide. :)
