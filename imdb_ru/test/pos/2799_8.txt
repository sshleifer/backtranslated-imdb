The first thing I wanted to do after watching this movie is to watch it again (because I missed a lot with all my laughter). I am European, I studied abroad and lived as well as I lived with the Spaniards, French, Italians and Germans. The film was full of stereotypes, which, more often than not, made people confused, and, reading some other reviews, I see that he was making people angry. But this film gets stereotypes, so I can not blame him. Except, perhaps, for how the Frenchman became a drunken party-goer. The English guy was the perfect stereotype of eccentric. Drunk, annoying, insulting, but translucent at the end. In addition to stereotypes, the film correctly studied the emotional aspect of studying abroad. At first he is shy, does not know anyone, misses home, does not know how to manage. Over time, he becomes his home, and when it comes time to leave, it becomes extremely difficult. A feeling that people can understand only if they have experienced it. I highly recommend this movie.
