in fact never seeing anything from this lover louvie, not to mention the setting of the merchant Venice, I can not comment on how true he is to the previous adaptations of the play, so I will consider it as another film that tries to be more novocaine for the eyes of MoV - this exciting movie about young lover Bassanio (fiennes) and his friend merchant Antonio (irons) and Jewish money lender Shaylock (Pacino) <br /> <br /> Brief description of the plot <br /> Bassiano went bankrupt and he needs money to care for a fine portion d (Collins), he goes to his friend Antonio, who sympathizes with his friend in a difficult situation, therefore he borrows money from Shylock <br /> <br /> now Antonio does not do as Jews in general and Shylock in particular and Shylock bitter and distorted from the ill-treatment he suffered from Antonio in particular, and Christians generally agree to lend Antonio money, provided that if Antonio does not repay the loan in due time, Shylock will cut off a pound of meat from Anthony <br /> <br <br > Comment on the movie <br /> <br /> the film is stunningly beautiful, and it says so in a way that makes you think about what each line means, which, in turn, makes the viewer get an idea of ​​the characters and their motivations <br /> <br /> it seems to me that this is a film of choice, which makes Shylock, and how the wrong choice leads to the death of shaylock <br /> <br /> From the moment Shylock demands his pound of flesh, he is doomed because the rest of the world is against him and indulges his fall. <br /> <br /> This really bothered me, usually in the film, when the victim gets a chance to take revenge on those who hurt him, or the victim will succeed, or make the villain see the mistake of his ways leading to a big hug <br /> <br /> the victim does not quickly become a villain in the MoU and loses his luck and faith <br /> <br /> This film is a powerful and subtle image of random anti-Semitism, showing how the whole society can turn a minority and it seems that the victim is criminal. <br /> <br /> I was amazed by this movie 10/10
