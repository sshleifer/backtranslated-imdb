After The Fifty-Foot Woman Attack with Alison Hayes opened the door for women who were as dangerous as men, obviously the market was open for other films to raise and carry a torch, and that a better actress than Dorothy Provin from "It's Crazy, Crazy, Crazy, Crazy World" to play the role. Shrinking is that the cute and blond Provine can be too cute and innocent to step into size 50 Allison Hayes shoes. This role really needed someone with a smoldering sexual attraction; The province is more like a neighbor. She may have taken and fulfilled this role to prove that she may be sexual, but the material fails her. Lou Costello, however, proves that he can be in a film without Bad Abbott, and he even inserts a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he does not turn to Gail Gordon as the main character of the gags. Gordon, however, claims that all he can be is noisy, agitated and energetic, in many respects the same character that he creates later in “The Lucy Show”. Charles Lane also plays the same role in everything he does: a straight man, and his screen time is limited. The special effects are convincing this time, but I would like Dorothy to be a little more than cheesecake and sauce, and at least I was allowed to become dangerous. As the protagonist of the film, she takes the second account of Costello, who disappears several times in the entire film with Dorothy, as the plot. The entire film, taken together, simply cannot decide whether it will be fiction, comedy, or just a parody of the classic Allison Hayes. There are a lot of good scenes, a bit of funny humor and a very funny camp that affects the rest of the movie. However, I like this film for being empowered by women; there are not so many films like this one. If today this film could be redone, I would highly recommend Courtney Cox and Jason Alexander in the lead roles and would allow me to completely rewrite the original script. Courtney heads my lists of actresses who, I believe, could and should be worthy of playing gorgeous giants; though, I have to admit that if any of the titanic beauties of Allison or Dorothy come after me, I would go easy!
