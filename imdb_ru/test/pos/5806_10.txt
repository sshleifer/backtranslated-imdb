This concert - the type of concert that is held approximately every twenty years or so, “Confessions of Madonna in the Age of Dance Floor” will surely be remembered as one of the highlights of her career. She is 48 years old and she looks simply divine, she does not lag behind the dancers who are almost twenty years younger than her. I am also very happy to announce that all the songs were performed live, which is good, because in fact it sounds better live. Each song was so unique, the visual effects were amazing. The performance of “Live to Tell” was fantastic, and I was amazed, “Isaac” was exotic and magnificent and was rich in political symbolism, the Arab horn, the American eagle, which was released. I especially liked the rock performance “I love New York”, I almost got up in my living room and was delighted when she told her critics to suck George Bush ****. And then again I was impressed with the 70s inspired music (hell remix). This exciting hereditary concert caused me faith. <br /> <br /> Verdict: strongly recommended with a capital H.
