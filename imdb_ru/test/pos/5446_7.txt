Man of the Year tells the story of Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams), a political comedian (like John Stewart or Stephen Colbert), who has his own television show. On his show, he talks about a variety of things, but his main focus is on political issues, about which he is very self-confident. Once on his show, a fan from the audience raises the idea that Dobbs should run for president of the United States. After the episode was aired, millions of people gathered online to create various petitions and give their opinion on why Dobbs could be a great presidential candidate in the United States. A few weeks later, Dobbs decides to run for president and low, and now he wins the election. Everything seems to be going according to plan, until a woman named Eleanor Green (Laura Linney) appears and starts a dispute regarding his position. Funny, but serious political thriller <br /> <br /> Anyone who comes to this film and expects brainless comedy will surely be disappointed. I always wonder how some people become marketers when I see how their marketing campaigns are misleading. Man of the Year is an excellent example of bad and misleading marketing, because everything from a poster, a trailer to advertising on the Internet makes this film look like a comedy. I would honestly say that 1/3 of the movie is funny, and the rest is a political thriller, which gives good arguments and allows viewers to think. In this case, I am a little surprised if the marketing was done on purpose, as this film raises serious questions between his comedic routine. <br /> <br /> But enough about marketing, let's move on to the movie itself. <br /> I really liked “Man of the Year”, although I expected to see a comedy instead of a serious movie. One of the many things that I will do justice to this film is that the film does a decent job, switching between comedy and drama, although at first it seems a bit awkward. I really think that after you realize that the film will be a political thriller rather than a comedy, it will be convenient for you. Some may not because they are made to believe that they are watching a comedy, and they do not understand what this film is trying to say at the end, but for those people they can blame marketers for not advertising this film correctly. <br /> <br /> “Man of the Year” talks about many things and seems to have a very strong opinion. As Tom Dobbs says, he says what needs to be said, not about the candy that covers them. I also think that the whole political plot, although most critics say that the film was damaged, probably again due to misleading marketing, was very good. The idea of ​​computerized voting has been rejected in the past few years, and with all the problems faced by computers, the problem addressed in this film can certainly be realistic. The issue of control of large enterprises for voting is also being resolved. <br /> <br /> As for acting, I think that all participants did a good job. Robin Williams had a chance to be funny, but at the same time serious, playing Tom Dobbs. Some say that Williams waited for his reception as a comedian, but I personally still think he is funny, and he is also a good serious actor. This is probably one of the few times when we see how it goes from serious to ridiculous, and I think it works well. It's also nice to see the role of Lewis Black in a decent movie. I love Black again when he appears in The Daily Show and really gets up, but most of the films he was in were terrible. It was a good film for him, because I think his political views fit into the story that director Barry Levinson was trying to convey. Laura Linney is an excellent addition to the cast and proves once again that she is a very good actress, and finally, Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum both do an excellent job with this role. <br /> <br /> “Man of the Year” was written and directed by Barry Levinson, the man who brought us films such as “Rain Man”, “Good Morning Vietnam” and “Wriggle the Dog”. Levinson works great on film and director. As I said, I know that many critics did not like the whole political thriller, but I thought that it fits well. It was actually nice to see a mainstream movie that allowed me to think and laugh at the same time. Barry Levinson did a great job with this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, don’t enter this movie, expecting to see a movie that commercials sell to you. He has a laugh, but at the same time he plays more like a political drama. It's not as stupid or stupid as a marketing campaign makes you believe. I really liked the fact that this film was not a typical Hollywood film. He tried to be both comedy and serious drama and worked, at least for me. I like the fact that the film didn’t really alleviate any of the problems that he considered, nor did he have a typical Hollywood ending. I tried to call the ending from the very beginning, but surprisingly it didn’t finish, as I thought, which made me happy. This is a movie that makes you laugh, but in a few minutes you will be able to think and wonder what will happen next. I think this is a good movie that will suffer from bad marketing.
