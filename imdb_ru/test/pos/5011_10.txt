I saw the film at the Nashville Film Festival on May 1, 2003! It was wonderful! Everything I read about Stouie was incredibly well depicted by Tony Widmer (writer, director, producer, editor), Michael Imperioli (an incredible job as Stui) and everyone else who participated in this. I am glad that he (Widmer) did not give up the “Leaving Las Vegas” routine due to Stui’s bad habits, but instead invested us in his life, family and his gift. Linking the whole story from the room in the motel where he died was a great vehicle and showed his script writing skills. Big "thumbs up" on it!
