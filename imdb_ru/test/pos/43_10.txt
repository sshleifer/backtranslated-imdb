One of the best, Lackawanna Blues <br /> <br /> Great movie, great cast, great music. This is one of those films that are so good that when it ends, I want it to last another 90 minutes, I will watch it many times. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that captures you from the very beginning, twists and emotionally slaps the whole function. The cast is unusual without the slightest hint that someone feels uncomfortable in their role. You feel that you are really there, taking all this into account. Much attention was paid to the scenery, costumes and music of that period. The relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complex, as the film continues, but the stable playing of Miss Merkerson is so strong that the movie ends until we are filled with wonderful losers. Isolating anyone other than Nanny is an injustice because we have very good performances by great veteran actors, including: Jeffrey Wright, Jimmy Smits, Terrence Howard and Delroy Lindo. But it is Marcus Franklin, Macy Gray and Mrs. Merkerson who make this a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> The film is moving fast and short by today's standards, but this is without a doubt one of the best films youâ€™re going to see this year. If you like good historical plays that will give you an emotional challenge, pull you by the heart, lift your spirits and simultaneously tap in the footsteps, then this film is for you. I showed it to several friends, and they all want my copy, that says it all, the film is so good. Check for yourself. <br /> <br /> danceability-1, Amsterdam, Holland
