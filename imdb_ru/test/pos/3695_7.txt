Without going into the details of a good ... if somewhat provocative ... television film, there seems to be a consensus among users that there is "no one to blame." <br /> <br /> I disagree. Yes, the young lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes, may be young and excited (and beautiful), because he does not receive as much as he wants from his mother, this does not mean that he can get into bed and have sex with his daughter. Well, he can use an excuse that he just wanted to watch her on TV, but I don’t buy him. People should be held accountable for their actions. Not only did he “cross the line” by having sex with a very vulnerable teenager when he was supposedly a “responsible adult”, he said: “Your mother should never know about this.” How responsible was he then? Yes, this is a good click, but he understood what was coming to him. Do not be fooled, guys, in what happened, "no one is to blame."
