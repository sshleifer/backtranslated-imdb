Excellent performance by Clint Eastwood and, in particular, John Malkovich, in my opinion, his best so far. Malkovich nailed him to the floor, it is incredible. Eastwood is the agent Mike Horrigan, an elderly and cynical secret service agent who ends his career by eliminating counterfeiters and chasing routine tasks. But one task, which seems to be carried out by the plant, initially turns out to be difficult and deadly serious. Horrigan and his new partner, Al, are sent to investigate the threat for the president from the "crazy." By the will of fate, Horrigan came across not a crazy nut, but a professional lone wolf, who has a big bone that he can find in the White House. As Horrigan plunges deeper into the world of "Bout", he attracts the unwanted attention and rampant admiration of the bad guy. Horrigan was the main agent of JFK and was present in Dallas, Texas, when he was killed and blamed himself for what had happened. Now he feels that he needs to prevent the current head of state from joining the list of fallen presidents. But this killer turned the tables on Horrigan, and now he is a hunter in the game of cat and mouse from life or death. Who will win? Who will die? This is a time trial to save Pres from a chameleon-like enemy who can reach anyone. My favorite movie about the secret service and just as good a rodent as any other.
