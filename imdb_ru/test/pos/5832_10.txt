Oz, it was the first original TV show that HBO put on its channel (in 1 hour format), and it still remains the best ... The story is simple ... Oz is a surrealistic view of the life of high prisoners with the highest level of security in Oswalde, primarily focused on Em City. Now there are a lot of things that can be added to this show, ranging from writing (which, in my opinion, was the best on television when this show was broadcast), directing (at the highest level), acting (the best of the best) and characters. .. This show literally blew up my socks ... This show was a critically acclaimed gem until the Soprano bowed, after which critics sprinkled over this epic tale of trust and family to notice this compelling drama ... Oz - better show than Soprano as a whole, and that a shame that I never won a single big Emmy ... = / <br /> <br /> to everyone who was involved in this magnificent, painful show ... <br /> KUDOS
