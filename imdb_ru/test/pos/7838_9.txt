I just saw a couple of episodes of The Eleventh Hour, but I must say that they were enough to impress me. This series is so impressive and interesting ... I will definitely follow it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I have to say that acting is top notch. Patrick Stewart plays his hero - the scholar Yana - plausibly and coolly, and he makes the audience believe in the character. Other characters, such as Rachel, are also believable, and, although they are sometimes a bit cold — because of how the show was shot — they are interesting. <br /> <br /> The stories told in this series are also interesting. For example, one of the episodes I saw was about cloning and a person who tried to clone people. The way the episode was developed, and how Ian - Stewart - continued to follow the prompts and save people, was amazing. In addition, it made you think about ethics and how good or bad it is. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think this is one of the good TV shows. I just hope that this will continue - interesting, makes you think and with a good game. Despite the fact that it was shot in a cold way - a little lightning, a cold photo, a lot of close-ups - it never ceases to be interesting. Highly recommended.
