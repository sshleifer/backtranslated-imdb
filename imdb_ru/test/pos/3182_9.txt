It was such a great series for blacks at the time. We liked it so much. It was the only show about black middle-class families on TV. at that time. Please release it on DVD. I know many ... many people who are still talking about the show. If it is released, I am sure that many dark-skinned young people will find it useful and interesting. The show covered many topics: racism, discrimination within the race, teenage pregnancy, rivalry between brothers and sisters, raising individuals, peer pressure, and much more. The show ended in such an unexpected way, and his fans were speechless and wondered why he was taken off the air. Since then, we have seen only a few actors and actresses. Please release it to DVD as soon as possible.
