This film is without a doubt the best I've ever seen, and really shows what British talents are capable of. Its effects are extremely good, considering that the film was set in the middle of the 18th century, and all the gloom and disgusting dirt of England at that time were sealed very well. The character develops and comes to life, starting with McClin's clan prank and ending with his transformation into a robber and a publicist “Gentleman Roadman”, which contrasts well with Robert Carlyle, whose cynicism and honor show that you can love a thief and a criminal, because I I quote: “He received more honor in his little finger than any of you, fat bastards! <br /> <br /> Of course, this does not apply to you! But this is perhaps the most exciting and emotionally charged scene that you have ever seen in a film, but you just need to watch it, to find out, suffice it to say that it includes a rope around your neck. <br /> <br />
