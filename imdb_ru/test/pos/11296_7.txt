I just took it in a decent, if not outstanding, one dollar DVD version at Wal Mart. <br /> <br /> Run and buy. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure that this version is a short, incomplete version, released contrary to the desires of the animator in the late 50s, but despite this, this is simply an incredible deal. <br /> <br /> This film was released in small portions in the form of a series for local television stations in the early 60s for children's shows, in which almost all stations worked on weekdays on those days, Mr. Bill and Bozo , “Gang of Monty” (channel 4, Greenville, South Carolina) and “Captain Grady” (channel 13, Asheville) NC - where I saw it). It made such an impression on me, who was about twelve years old, and I immediately recognized him when I saw him at Wal-Mart tonight and grabbed it. <br /> <br /> Great. You should get it.
