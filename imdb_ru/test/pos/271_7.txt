The third entry in the Stepford franchise, but apparently the three unknown sequels made for television are incredibly obscure and difficult to track, while the original 70s and the remake of the blockbuster with Nicole Kidman are widely known and very popular. I have not seen the Revenge of the Stepford Wives of the early 80s, nor the “Husbands of Stepford” of the mid-90s, but this “Stepford Children” is a rather charming and very interesting small film. This is basically the same movie as the original; obviously less mysterious, but much more cheerful and incredibly 80s to the n-th degree. The main difference here, as the name implies, is that not only liberated wives, but also rebellious and punk teens in the city undergo typical and very effective “Stepford treatment” licensed by the local men's association. For some reason, the script tries to defend Stepford's secret to the end of the film, even if no one watches this sequel before checking the original, and probably everyone is also aware of the denouement. The Harding family is all crowded and ready to move from the terrible New York to the small and peaceful community of Stepford. Especially father Stephen is excited about their new life, because he already lived in Stepford and always wanted to return since his first wife, about which his new wife Laura and teenage children Mary and David know very little, died under mysterious circumstances. The city is almost too perfect, with picturesque neighbors and model students, and especially modern teenagers face tremendous difficulties to adapt. Their efforts to modernize this place and set in motion local Stanford youth led to clashes with prominent citizens, in particular with members of the Men's Association, and subjected family relationships to great stress. David meets and falls in love with Lois's latest “normal” girl, but when even she turns into a homemade doll in one night, David can convince his skeptical mother to investigate Stanford's ominous secret. The first hour of "Stanford Children" is slow and rather boring, but the final is trashy and trashy, like promises on the cover of VHS, and, in fact, a thriller from the late 80s. The procedure behind the secrets of Stanford is illustrated in more detail, and I think that horror fans and fans of the original film will appreciate it. At least I did. The overall plot still does not make much sense, and the script is full of irrational aspects, but, nevertheless, it is an attractive formula and, undoubtedly, that which causes an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear. Acting performance is much higher than average. Especially arrogant and unpleasant members of the Male Association portray believable characters, and even teenage players Tammy Lauren and Randall Batinkoff distribute impressive performances. Recommended without hesitation!
