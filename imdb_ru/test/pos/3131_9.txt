It was recorded that John Ford was shooting "big blockbusters" so that he could allow himself to make the "small" films he loved so much. The master of carts with young Ben Johnson is undoubtedly one of his best, if not the best of his small films. Shooting terrain, wagons, hard work with horses and the inclusion of lowland Indians are all Ford brands. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the influence of the great Russian director can be seen in this film. The cast, including Ward Bond, Russell Simpson and Jane Darwell, is excellent, as are many of the secondary characters that Ford used, including his brother (who plays the drums). While Ben Johnson won the honored Oscar for The Last Picture, his colleague in the film Harry Cary Jr. did not reach those heights. Although his father, Cary, Sr., became a Western leading man in Ford's early films, Cary, Jr. spent most of his career in a supporting role. For fans of John Ford, as well as for fans of Western films, this is a must.
