It helps that the characters on which this show is based are among the best Disney ever created. The letter is what really does this show. This is a complete classic. Given, you need to appreciate the type of humor to enjoy it, and it is difficult to explain. Humor is similar to the old Disney school scripts of the 40s and 50s with modern backs. He never turns to jokes or something like that. This is not Adam Sandler's humor, although I liked it. This is exactly the same film humor, only extended over a period of time that allows the television show. So, if you don’t like the movie, you don’t like it here, but IMO The Emperors' new groove was the best thing that came to life after Disney Gargoyles. <br /> <br /> A +
