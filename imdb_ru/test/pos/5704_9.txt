The 1970s opened the door to the largest and most diverse film era in history. Some of the films were wonderful (“The Godfather”, “Conversation”, “Evil Streets”, Chinatown, ”“ French Connection ”,“ Five Easy Pieces ”,“ Jaws ”,“ McCabe and Mrs. Miller ”). such great ones (“The Getaway”, “The Outfit”, “Badge 373”, “Joe”, “The Pelham One Two Three”, “Brewster McCloud”, “Castle Keep”). And others were hardly worth the money. Confession. <br /> <br /> Yet each had a fresh breath of air compared to today's corporate Hollywood. Where each film gives a great weekend to pay back its cost. Or go straight to HBO and take a ride. <br /> <br /> The fact that the “Decade” is doing so well is what connects the sudden and rarely experienced sense of freedom to get money to make and make a film. Perhaps personal. Probably no. Sometimes with a bunch of extras. Sometimes in the middle of a busy street before police arrived. Long before corporate wardens, judicial bodies, committees and lawyers became part of Sistema. <br /> <br /> Comments are excellent. Especially Julie Chris tie and Denis Hopper. While listening, you gradually find out how many major directors today (Coppola, Scorsese, Ron Howard, Dennis Hopper, Peter Bogdonovich) were named “Roger Korman Commandos”. We work long hours with short payment. Filming will take no more than a month. Learn all the steps and tricks of the trade by doing it yourself. To deliver the goods on time and with a limited budget. <br /> <br /> See the message "Decade". And for the long and varied list of movies to watch, shot in these amazingly turbulent years. <br /> <br /> Although, I wouldn’t complain if IFC decided to devote another documentary exclusively to this underestimated Grand Pioneer movie Roger Korman.
