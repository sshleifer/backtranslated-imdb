The 90s were a great decade for the British sitcom, when many popular works, such as ONE KNIFE AT THE SEA, ABSOLUTELY DECELING THIN BLUE LINE, BRITTAN EMPIRE and MEN TO BE ACTED, first appear on television. <br /> <br /> However, MR. BEAN, hands down, is the greatest comedy series of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> mr. BEAN is the first major attempt to return to the era of such quiet greats like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton in several decades. This brings the audience of one character - Mr. Bean - perfectly played by Rowan Atkinson. <br /> <br /> Many people who commented on this page, as well as the bulletin boards on this and other websites, took part in the debate about whether Mr. Bean has mental retardation or has significant learning difficulties because of such a disability. Nevertheless, I believe that this debate is not needed, because I very much doubt that the creators of this show expected that one of the spectators even for a single moment would even consider Mr. Bean in such a context. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean is shown to be a character who has very few friends, he rarely speaks and solves problems himself without any outside guidance. Some of his methods of solving everyday tasks, such as cooking dinner or visiting the dentist, are very strange for those who watch the show. This is where the humor comes from. Mr. Bean is not necessarily a person with mental disorders, he may just be an eccentric person who is used to dealing with things in his own way. And, naturally, some of his methods of performing one task often lead to a catastrophe, which we then see as Mr. Bean tries to solve. <br /> <br /> Sometimes we see Mr. Bean showing a medium or small line, often trying to compete with others or joking those who least expect it. But at the end of the day no real harm is done to anyone, and the results are always encouraging. <br /> <br /> Unlike most examples of British comedy in the last 30 years, MR BEAN is a simple, innocuous, innocuous U-rated entertainment, suitable for everyone in the family. It is for this reason that the series became a hit in dozens of countries around the world. That is why it will still be remembered in a few decades, when many other TV shows will come, go and be forgotten. <br /> <br /> Some critics say that only children like the show, but I just laugh as much on Mr. Beanâ€™s antics as I did when I first saw the episodes in the nineties. Rowan Atkinson used his natural ability to create effective visual jokes that, when re-viewed, seemed as funny as the first time. <br /> <br /> To date, two side films have appeared in the series, BEAN and MISTER. BIN REST. As expected, he who is familiar with the type of humor shown in the series, he does not lead to success on the big screen. These two films are unfair to the show and are not able to truly convey the magic of the episodes. The biggest setback in both films is probably the change in settings. In both films, the producers take Mr. Bean out of his usual British environment to America (first film) and France (second film). As a result, the characters in the film around Mr. Bean react differently to his behavior than their television series colleagues. Both films re-use the plugs from the series, and the facts show that the plugs were done right the first time. In the second film, Mr. Bean does not behave in his own way, and some aspects of his personality are exaggerated to such an extent that some jokes seem silly and not funny. At various times I thought that the character I was looking at was not Mr. Bean, but a pale caricature. It is clear that Rowan Atkinson did not get such pleasure, as in the series. His heart was simply not in the play. After the release of the second film, he publicly stated that he would no longer play Mr. Bean. I understand how he felt. <br /> <br /> Returning to the series, each episode demonstrates careful planning in terms of writing and execution in each individual scene. Even the weakest episode is still very pleasant and far ahead of two films. <br /> <br /> My favorite episodes - the first three - they set a high standard that should have continued. The last episode, I think the weakest, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Summing up, M.R. BEAN is truly an excellent comedy series, suitable for the whole family. Rowan Atkinson - a real comic genius, and evidence - in 14 episodes of this series. My recommendation is to watch and enjoy. But watch movies only if you consider yourself a devoted fan after watching the show.
