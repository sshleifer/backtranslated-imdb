Beautiful story that all families should see. The plot, acting and production values ​​- all first-class. I highly recommend “Checkout!” <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is amazing as an aging actor who wants to decide when he will die, so he can continue to know how it will all end and not be “a member of the audience.” Troy his children rush to New York to confront him and try to change their opinions. Of course, there are unresolved family problems, and the script and the actors deal with them well and with humor. <br /> <br /> A story about a Jewish family, but maybe about any other family. Well, maybe not the WASP family. Brothers and sisters have problems We loved to write and direct as well as play, in general, a humorous and touching film.
