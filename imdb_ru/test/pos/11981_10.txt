Don't let the 5.9 rating (at the time of writing 12-8-02) fool you, this is one great movie. <br /> <br /> I cannot understand how he received such a rating, given his solidity at all levels. Direction, acting, cinematography - all is well. This story is interesting and original, and my only guess as to why the rating is such is that this is probably the type of film that people with ratings usually don’t see. <br /> <br /> I equate this to play modern rock for an 80 year old. You may be young, brought up on it and love it, but he or she was not and as a product of another time and taste — he doesn’t care about it. <br /> <br /> If you like movies and movies in which you can watch movies based more on real people than on crazy actions, huge bright budgets and mediocre talents. Try it the next time you see it on ... <br /> <br />
