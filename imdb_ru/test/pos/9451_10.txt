It was a fantastically written script when it comes to perceiving things from another point of view. The comedy was timely and not exaggerated, the acting was generally stunning, and the storyline served the greater purpose of creating a misconception when we think of people solely on the basis of their appearance. The plot unfolds when Amanda Bainsâ€™s brother / sister character tries to play football in a boys team, finding a new love interest instead. Tatum Channing is what a real delusion is, and at first he does an excellent job with acting, but then he begins to realize that the most important thing in life is friendship, not relationship.
