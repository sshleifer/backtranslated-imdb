Without a doubt, the best movie of Bert Reynolds! Even better than Smokey and the Bandit. It was probably the first real bloody thriller from the policemen of the 1980s, which combines the perfect combination of humor, action, secrets and style that is not found in modern films. <br /> <br /> This has it all: the psychotic Henry Silva exhausted by the PCP, the girls $ 1,000 a night, the assassins ninja and Bert Reynolds, one by one they cut off the fingers with a butterfly knife. The film is based on the novel by William Dil, who also wrote PRIMAL FEAR, another one of my favorites. This film is worth watching to see Henry Silva shot six times, crash through a window and fall thirty floors from the height of Atlanta’s high-rise building. This is perhaps the coolest trick in the history of Hollywood, performed by the legendary stuntman Dar Robinson. <br /> <br /> Robinson also played Mock in Elmore Leonard’s STICK movie, which also starred Burt Reynolds. Stick has another great trick Dar Robinson. Robinson falls from an apartment building in Miami and shoots all six shots from a magnum .44 on the way down. Very cool stuff. <br /> <br /> SHARKY's MACHINE is my favorite police drama. I never understood why this film failed the way it was. If Bert had made more of these films, he would have created a better reputation for himself. He turns out to be a talented director with Sharkey, as well as a talented actor. Bert is supported by Brian Keith, Charles Derning, Bernie Casey, Richard Libertini, Rachel Ward, and the beloved bad guy Henry Silva. PLEASE redo this classic movie! Get Affleck, Samuel L. and some other hot actors, and you will have a great movie awaiting filming. <br /> <br /> I give him 9 out of 10
