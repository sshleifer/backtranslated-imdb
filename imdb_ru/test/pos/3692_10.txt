My husband and I both loved this movie. At first, my husband was skeptical and asked how many points he got for sitting in it. But after several key scenes, he was completely absorbed, and in the end he was convinced that it was one of the best films. Kathleen Bates has never been so beautiful, and the rest of the cast is fantastic. Thank you for this wonderful movie.
