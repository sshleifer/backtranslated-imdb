Robert Florey and James Wong Hou gave this frightening expressionistic look. The scenes are filmed at odd angles - especially scenes with the participation of the figurative and literal killer of women Zachary Scott. His sociopathic behavior anticipates another excellent film with an average “Father” budget of more than two decades. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is great, although (though not through its own fault) it’s hard to think of Joyce Compton as any other than the singer in Terrible Truth. Scott, Bennett, Emerson, DeCamp (especially, and although he played the older woman, who looked great) - they could not be surpassed. Telling a terrible story about a woman in a house against the backdrop of psychiatrists is a risky stunt that pays off well. Nothing banal at all. Handsomely. Nothing trivial. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this resolution patted a little. Not Emerson is going along with Bennett. It makes sense. But Scott goes too fast. I look more like him as Mr. Ripley’s character who could have avoided everything — botulism, murderous rap, jealous sisters — and disappeared into the great world beyond this story. This would not hurt the essentially happy end of the secretary and her boss, finally, gathered together.
