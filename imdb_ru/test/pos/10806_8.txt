This is a great movie to watch, since it was shot so well by director Andrzej Waid, but at the same time I wanted the film to have more depth in terms of its history. This is a historically significant film about the last days of the French Revolution, but, nevertheless, he forgets to focus on the character's motivation, which makes the film perhaps too superficial to be considered a brilliant and relevant film. <br /> <br /> Somehow this does not make the film any less remarkable for viewing. It is made with passion and attention to detail. Every aspect of the film is good, for example, its settings, costumes and camera work. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot is still effective, although at the same time it could be much better and more powerful with a slightly more developed character and understanding of historical information. Guess if you are completely familiar with the French Revolution and the stories of Danton and Robespierre, in particular, this film will be ideal for you to watch. <br /> <br /> This is quite typical for a French film, the story is slow and thin, without going into details. Often this turns out to be charming, but in this case the film could really be a little deeper. In addition, this film is still an excellent example of French cinema, despite the fact that its director is a Polish director, and there are also many Polish actors in it. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is great in his role, although the film also decides to focus on many other characters. Perhaps there are too many characters in the film, but each performance is great, so in fact it never becomes a big complaint, except that in some moments it slows down the story a bit. <br /> An excellent movie that could be brilliant. <br /> <br /> 8/10
