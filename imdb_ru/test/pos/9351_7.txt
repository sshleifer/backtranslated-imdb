** SPOILERS ** In fact, based on the novel "The Brick Fox" about gays who were killed by soldiers on leave because of their sexual orientation. The film "Crossfire" tells about a violent anti-Semitic soldier who, because of his own failures and disappointments in life, supplants him because of the beliefs of the Jews. From whom he is obviously threatened. <br /> <br /> Starting yourself at a local barley processing plant in the District of Columbia with a sober American Montgomry soldier, Robert Ryan, notices Joseph Samuel, Sam Leven, and is starting to get a little over the top, but sarcastically, friends with him. It seems that Montgomery is a little obsessed with Samuel, because he is talking to his best friend and friend G.I. Arthur Mitchell, George Cooper. Samuel is also worried that the Neanderthals Montgomery cannot, for a sensitive young soldier who does art, he is an artist and an artist outside, about the war, World War II, about the war that has just ended. Like a shaky world, if this is what happens with the dawn of the atomic bomb, now it follows it in this very dangerous and unstable world. What angered Montgomery in Samuels most is the fact that he is clearly a Jew. This, more than anything else, is enough for a Montgomery racist to want to make Samuels. <br /> <br /> Semuls invites Mitchell to join him and his girlfriend Miss. Lewis, Marlowe Dwyer, in his apartment to have a Pair of drinks and continue the very deep and stimulating conversation that they started at the bar. It seems to be very jealous and feeling offended and rejecting Montgomery along with him also drunk, but somewhat meaningless, in that Montgomery’s plans for Samuels, friend and football mate, Floyd Bowers, Steve Brody, later that evening remain without an invitation to Samuels. ' a place. <br /> <br /> After the party was over, Mitchell and Miss Lewis left, two very drunken soldiers unceremoniously smashed this place. The fact that Samuels, in the sick and antisemitic mind of Montgomery, stole Mitchell away from him, made him cheer up to a white hot madness. Montgomery and Bowers stormed into Samuel's house, raiding his well-laid wine cabinet. Montgomery made a couple of sips, despite Samuels' strong objections, about very expensive and fine wines and Samuel's spirits, which are not very similar to the diluted and cheap booze that is indecent Montgomery used to eat. All this soon led to a brutal and brutal attack on Samuel by an enraged psychotic and drunk Montgomery, when Bowers froze on the couch from all the alcohol he had drunk, who had beaten the poor and innocent man to death. <br /> <br /> The Crossfire film is becoming long and tedious, as from the very beginning it is obvious who Samuel's killer is, the investigation into why Samuel was a wounded and decorated World War II veteran who received a purple heart in the Okinawa battle . killed by Montgomery, acting as if he were really interested, yes, of course, in finding the killer Samuels, who is actually himself. This is the so-called voluntary action on the part of Montgomery, to throw off the suspicion of himself that he may be the man who killed him. <br /> <br /> Montgomery is so ridiculous and even for a person who smugly considers himself to be very clever, stupid in him, constantly revealing his great thrill and spewing anti-Semitic and racist epitaphs and insults against the dead Samuel! It only throws suspicion on oneself and no one else. I think this guy just couldn't help it. <br /> <br /> It is not enough that Montgomery killed Samuels, who was one of “them” in his sick mind, he even kills his friend, who was scared to death, being involved in this. in killing samuel, bowers! Who in the race of Montgomery racist thinking is one of "us"! Just because he was afraid that Bowers would talk to the police to save his miserable neck and thus get Montgomi's attention to Samuel’s death. <br /> <br /> A detective in the case of captain Finley, Robert Young, does not take so long to see obvious lies and deceptions in Montgomeris, and then substitute him, inviting another "friend" G.I. his Leroy (William Phipps), who was the instrument of all his stupid and racist jokes, raised an arrogant cry. This made Montgomery return to the crime scene, where he killed Bowers, where a trap was set for him. That was all Captain Finlay needed to panic Montgomery when Montgomery saw that the jig was over and ran after him straight into a crossfire of a police ambush. <br /> <br /> A little outdated, but a very strong blow in 1947, when it was released. Crossfire addressed the horrors of anti-Semitism when it was kept under cover and hid in almost every Hollywood film after World War II about the evils of racism in the United States and in Europe. Even after the Second World War and with what happened to the Jews in it. When it had to be given to a very full and honest debunker of a film that had become public, it was rightly deserved.
