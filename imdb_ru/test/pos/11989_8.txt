Amazingly, one of my favorite movies below. I think I can be proud of the fact that I don’t like what the “wide strata of the population” Jackie Mason aspires to be hilarious in this film, like Randy Quaid. I can never get enough of his "strong hand" tactics, as in "Moving." He was also known for the National Lamboon Christmas holidays. Love this guy.
