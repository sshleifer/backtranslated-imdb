I was very surprised to see that, unlike most documentaries, it was written, directed and produced by film critic Richard Schickel. In most cases, when I know where film critics participated in the films, the films turn out to be bombs (Rex Reed starring in “World of Breckenridge” and Roger Ebert, writing “Beyond the Valley of the Dolls”) the power of criticism is used for good rather than evil - and the results are better (although this does not mean much, since the films I just mentioned are some of the worst films ever made). <Br /> <br /> As for the documentary, Clint Eastwood tells him (a pretty good choice), and he manages to discuss his long career - from his silent days to his death in the early 1960s. The only drawbacks, and they are insignificant, is that the film is very short (like most documentaries), and there is very little about Gary Cooper as a person - you really know very little about his life. However, as a good review of his films, he works very well.
