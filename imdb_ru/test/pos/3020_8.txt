The cell is weak on the plot, filled with holes and rather lousy. but none of this matters, because director Tarcem Singh gave us one of the most visually stunning films ever. the whole plot is just a reason to allow Tarsem to fool around and bring you to the consciousness of a serial killer, bringing viewers shocking, pleasant, breathtaking and stunning images. <br /> <br /> This beautiful film image will stay with you for a long time. This film is an ideal case for the theory of "suspending disbelief." forget the stupid conspiracy, just let your feelings be overflowing with images. and J.Lo looks stunning enough to add to the rest of the work of Tarsem. cinematography is painful, the music is haunting and the costumes are simply awesome. <br /> <br /> A film is not a film, but rather a work of art. Just the medium is no longer a canvas, it is a big screen and celluloid. one of the most refreshing films of this decade. The cell is a mandatory observation. A bold new step in making films. <br /> <br /> Fascinating 8 !!
