I also watched it at elementary school in Petersfield, Hampshire, around 1975. The strange thing is that from time to time I still think about it (I'm 40 years old now). The big question throughout the entire series (I don’t know how many episodes are 6 ??) was the identity of the person who was riding the bike! “In the past, I asked friends about this series, and they have no idea what I'm talking about, and I think it was a kind of strange dream. I still do not understand the educational benefits of this, but I thought that at the time it was great, but a little scary. It seems, I remember that there used to be some kind of break in the middle of each episode. I have no idea why. Would love to see it again. Got a short clip through the BBC cult site.
