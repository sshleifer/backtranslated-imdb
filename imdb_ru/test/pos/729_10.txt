It would be easy to complain about the quality of this film (you don’t need to throw a lot of money into a film to make it good, nor does it guarantee that it is worth seeing), but I think that there’s absolutely no meaning in it. If you are expecting fast cars, T & A or a movie that will be understandable to you, do not watch it, you will be disappointed and stunned. <br /> <br /> This film was very enjoyable, left us the edge of our seats and made us really think. The author obviously put a lot of thought and research into this film, and it shows to the end, just do not forget about impartiality. <br /> <br /> Note. The rest was made in Toronto.
