"Inglorious Bastards" is a dark and cruel comic fantasy. Created on the basis of the “Dirty Dozen”, “Inglorious Bastards” abandon the “Dirty Dozen” elongated training sequences in order to immediately plunge into action. In the process, Tarantino fixes one of the main drawbacks of the “Dirty Dozen”, giving the screens of bad guys time to remind us how bad the Nazis were. The Nazis, who have the most screen time, ultimately become the most fully human characters in the film, which, ironically, makes them worse than monsters. <br /> <br /> Ta throwing training sequences, Tarantino can also give us a picture of the whole war, showing us not only British, American and German soldiers, but also giving us an idea of ​​the world of French and German civilians, both collaborating and and resistance. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that any Tarantino film will have a fantastic dialogue, but when Tarantino decided that French characters spoke French and Germans spoke German, in addition to adding a level of authenticity, Tarantino also he ensured that his dialogue in French was as sharp, funny and clever as his English dialogue. <br /> <br /> As an example, during the opening remarks of the Nazi “Jewish Hunter”, Colonel SS Hans Landa (Christian Waltz) interrogates Perrier LaPadite, a French dairy farmer (Denis Menoshe). Landa suspects that Lapadit is hiding a Jewish family. Subtly exerting pressure on LaPadite, Landa asks for a glass of milk. Having swallowed him well, Landa congratulates Lapadit on his daughters and cows: “I don’t know about the family and the vacuum cleaner.” The fact is that in French "vache" means "cow", but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. If Landa was reprimanded for this vulgar pun, he could well say convincingly that he did not understand French well enough to understand it, but Landa did understand that and he considered it a threat. And LaPadite understands its meaning too well. <br /> <br /> This is really a subtle piece of acting and word play that many viewers will never catch, or at least they can understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat. The film is rich in such details. All dialogues in French and English are chosen with the same attention to detail, and although I cannot swear in German, I suspect that it shows a similar level of skill. <br /> <br /> Inglorious bastards begin with the phrase "Once upon a time ... in Nazi-occupied France." Personally, this reminds me of the opening of each book and film by Asterix, another comic fantasy in the war-torn occupied France. Like Asterix, "Inglorious Bastards" are belligerently ridiculous in some places, although the film also becomes grimly serious. <br /> <br /> In more serious moments, the Inglorious Bastards remind us that the first victims of war are compassion and the ability to relax. As in almost all long episodes of the film, Tarantino finds a new way to create violent stress to an almost unbearable level. <br /> <br /> Tarantino also reminds us that the film is dangerous, even flammable, and that its strength deserves respect. . <br /> <br /> If you can see this film, like me, in a crowded theater, filled with knowledgeable fans who get every joke, then you will see this masterful film as it should be. If you are unlucky, all you see is a great, great movie that gives a gloomily funny blow.
