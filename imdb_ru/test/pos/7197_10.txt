I read every adventure of Asterix and Obelix at least 5 times, and I am also a fan of "Les Nuls" and "Les Robins des Bois" and Jamel, so I was expecting a lot from this movie .... and I finally got satisfaction. Unlike Asterix’s first adaptation on the big screen (Astérix et Obélix contre César), which had no real success, except for the appearance of Laetitia Caste, this one really captures the comic’s spirit (and we get the beautiful Monica Bellucci). In the first film, the director tried to be too realistic about the time in which the story unfolds, and this killed all the spirit that made Asterix fun. This is all the clothes, the way to speak and everything is identical to the work of Goscinni and Uderzo ... moreover, it really adheres to the original story with the disadvantage that we know almost everything that will happen, but Alain Shabbat gave us a few surprises at the end. I really liked this movie, and every time the first signs of dullness appear, Jamel comes and makes us laugh like crazy. This film is a mixture of all kinds of humor that I really like, and even if maybe it mixes them too much, I can't help but love it. So, if you like Asterix and the humor of all these young talents, which began in "Nulle part Ailleurs" (French mix of the evening show and SNL), watch this movie.
