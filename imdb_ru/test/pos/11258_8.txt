I did not plan to watch for nothing when I saw the MTV preview, but since I had nothing to do or watch on Sunday evening, I watched it. <br /> <br /> Wasted was not a Requiem for a dream, but this is a very good film, considering that it was made by MTV. One thing that attracted me to watch this was Summer Pheonix, the sister of the departed and wonderful River Pheonix. I suppose the talent works in the Pheonix family, because she was good, like Zhakien, although River. Nick Stahl also perfectly plays the role of a joker. There is nothing more to say about wasted. It was a gloomy, depressing and penetrating glance at the lives of three drug addicts in a small town. I recommend this for those who love the subject. 8/10
