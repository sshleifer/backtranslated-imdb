I saw this television version of Christie's mysterious story when it was shown on Channel 5 in New York in 1980. At that time, I was surprised that she was not shown on Channel 13, a public television station that featured most of the theatrical masterpiece. programs, but (with the exception of some Lord Peter Wimsey stores Dorothy Sayers and THE MOONSTONE), the BBC rarely met British detective stories. Another series, Sherlock Holmes’s Rivals, described the stories of the Victorian and Edwardian periods, so the charm of the period was involved in the transmission of these stories to Channel 13. <br /> <br /> The plot “Why they were not”? ASK EVANS? dealt with a young couple stumbling over a dying man, whose last words are a matter of the name of the story (the novel was originally called “WHY DON'T ASK EVANS?”, but was later renamed BOOMERANG CLUB) who surround the dubious doctor (Eric Porter). Despite the warnings of the hero's father (John Gilgud), the hero (James Warwick) and the heroine (Francesca Annis) continue their investigation - even when it becomes darker and more dangerous. The death of another suspect as a result of suicide increases the apparent dangers, as the killer begins to look into two amateur detectives. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, although I agree that it was too long for one night. entertainment (if this were done as later episodes of Miss Marple with Joan Hickson or episodes of Hercules Poirot, it would be better in two parts). But this has its strengths. One of them is the correct use of Porter as the main suspect, and a more cunning scene in the film, where he seems to be spying on a young couple investigating a secret. If you stick to the movie, a surprise awaits you later. <br /> <br /> But he has one failure. When it comes to Christie's novel, the figures in the story must be in a tight schedule of movements so that the reader can understand the secret of the plot. I will only add that if you hear the dialogue at some point, and how the little boy was almost killed (but not), you will find that all parts of the story come together, and what were the motives of the villain. <br /> Apart from the long time that the TV movie tells about its history, this is a pretty good film, worthy of one of the best programs based on Christie's plot at a time when they were a sudden renaissance in films by the motives of her novels.
