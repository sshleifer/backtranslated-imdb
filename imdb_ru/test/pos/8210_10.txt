Why all the negative reviews ??? You did not expect such a film to be a masterpiece? We have a film that tried to entertain us, and it worked for me. Not Oscar, but entertainment. You can really see how the movie endured, especially with all that the Internet has to offer at the moment. I still remember when it was first released, and the network was still so new. Crazy and scary thoughts when I first saw it; I was 15 years old, and I seriously thought that someone could get your information on a computer and destroy you. But who said that this can not happen ??? I'm not one of those people who find fault with the film to death, analyzes it until it blues my face. This is not my style. Medium acting, intense and once again, very interesting. Sandra Bullock as Angela Bennett is so cute. This is my favorite movie with her because she is like a computer genius that I find very attractive. Of all the films released in 1995, this one should be my favorite, although I did not see it until 1996. My rating is 9/10, because it slowed down a bit.
