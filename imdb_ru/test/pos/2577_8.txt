(My Overview) Rey (Cristina Ricci) was a school whore and nympho who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to meet her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leave Rey alone. Rei is not alone for a long time, because she is an urban tramp who has a need to communicate with a man. After the party, Rey takes a friend home, who eventually beats her half to death and throws her to the curb. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Ray and carries her home. Lazar provides medical assistance to Rei and believes that he can also save her from himself. Rei looks like a dog in the heat, so Lazar puts on a 40-pound chain and his radiator so that she does not go outside in search of men. Lazarus has his own problems, because his wife just left him for another man. Lazarus turns to his blues music to ease his pain. <br /> <br /> (My comment) The film has a deep meaning when you overcome sex and violence. The film has a different feeling for this. The story is raw and almost puts you in a movie, as if you were there. The 40 pound chain is a good metaphor and symbol of a chastity belt. You do not give love to anyone, but save it for your true love. The chain can also be a parallel to the wife chained to the kitchen, but Rei did not cook. Rei just wanted to have sex all the time, but her wife didnâ€™t. I think that Craig Brewer (screenwriter and director) made an unusual film, and Samuel L. Jackson sings a vile blues song. The story is filled with emotions, combining themes of race, religion, music and sex into one. (Paramount Classics, Runtime 1:56, Rated R) (8/10)
