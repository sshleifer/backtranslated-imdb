I am from Texas and my family rested a couple of years ago in Santa Fe with my brother. He suggested that we go see the church with the stairs. I was just shocked by the miracles that happened there. The film is great - Barbara Hershey and William Petersen were perfect for the roles they played. This is amazing, absolutely amazing. If you have not seen the stairs in person, you should visit it. The forest is beautiful, and the architecture is amazing. Just staying in the chapel gives me goosebumps! Read about the history of the chapel, and then see its beauty, is breathtaking. Watch the movie - it's great! Then look at the stairs in person!
