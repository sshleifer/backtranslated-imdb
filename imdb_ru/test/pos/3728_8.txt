I still cannot describe what to feel when I received it on the fnac website. Such a rare film, so unobtrusive and famous, it is difficult to find even for fans, but the contrast between the past and the present is destructive: now I keep a DVD with the film with the best possible quality. As in Atlantis, the friend of the rare Besson film that I bought on the Internet, I saw him at home with all the lights of my DVD and TV turned off and was surprised at this. I did not know what to expect. Evil, I was always looking for some disappointment when I saw the film Luc Besson, whom I had never seen before. But it never came. This film is no exception. From the very beginning I understood that the person who makes such a film as the first role is destined to be great in the future. And so it happened. It won several prizes (including the highest prize at a film festival in my country, which makes me proud), and this shows that this film prepares many more significant things. This may be the most original post-war film I've ever seen, defeating Mad Max in originality and artistic perception. There are no problems in this film: its cinematography is brilliant, as are the actors. I can also proudly say that I finally watched all the films of my favorite director, and I have a copy of almost all of them (Joan of Arc is still waiting for me to buy a DVD). This film is most of all a work of style and dedication, which makes it clear why Luc Besson is the director of my choice: good taste, beautiful creation, excellent use of music (I also admired Eric Serra's first full-length show) and the promise of great achievements. Guomon made a good bet on his genius boy, a man who would later change the face of French-European relations between films and their public. Hopefully, Besson will start working in a new directorial project. I'll be the first to cheer him up. Until then, I recommend this film to anyone who needs to learn a lesson about how to make good films for little money. I liked the atmosphere of the film, which, thanks to its black-and-white cinematography, offers us an even more depressed view of the world after the Holocaust. This film works from the pure magic of films: it shows in pictures what we cannot explain in words. And I'm with all the people who wrote the comments on this film, and I liked it: a good choice! A big hug to everyone who sees it and feels that their life has changed a little.
