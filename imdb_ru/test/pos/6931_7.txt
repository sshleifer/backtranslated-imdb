I was at the world premiere of this film, and even met Todd a couple of times around the city (once in the Olive Garden). Todd is not a bad guy, he is just a small filmmaker with a small budget and no big dreams. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it's good if you like zombie movies with a very small plot and lots of blood and guts. You can see some places in Kansas City and lots of raw meat, what could be better? :-) Look for the same 2 dozen people playing different zombies (only with a change of clothes or hats). With this movie, you can play a good drink piece and take a picture when you see the same zombie in a different shirt.
