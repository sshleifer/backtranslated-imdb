This film won no awards for greatness. But if you have one and a half hours of free time and you want to have a little fun, you can do much worse than watch it ... <br /> <br /> The actors are mostly young and beautiful, there are some really funny moments in the script and the soundtrack is also very cool. Rupert Penry-Jones in the role of Jake seems to have more fun, and Laura Fraser, in the role of Justin, the cutie is sweet and fun. <br /> <br /> I filmed it because I like the Spooks series, in which RPJ currently plays a major role. And here he is young, amateur and perfect eye candy for an evening girl. <br /> <br /> Take some wine and ice cream and have a laugh.
