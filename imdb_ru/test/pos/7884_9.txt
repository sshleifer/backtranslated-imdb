Although I saw this film about 4 years ago, long before I started commenting on IMDb, I decided to watch it now, which is unusual for me, because before that I often watched something right after watching it. What can I say? Well, the best performance is the late Peter Boyle as the protagonist, who, after learning how a man killed his friend’s drug dealer, wants to establish a relationship with him, despite the fact that he is the head of Madison Avenue, who has nothing . shared with a very conservative joe. In fact, at this guy's party there are a lot of funny scenes with Joe making smart and funny comments. Oh, and it should be noted that the actress who plays the daughter they are looking for after she disappeared from the hospital after an overdose of some drugs is nothing more than Susan Sarandon who is debuting in a movie! It was a pretty cool film for the time when it was shot (in the late 60s - early 70s), and it was the persuasive work of screenwriter Norman Wexler (later on Saturday night of fever) and director John G. Avildsen (later - “Save the Tiger, Rocky and Baby Karate). Of course, the final is already gaining momentum! Strongly recommended for anyone interested in the counterculture of the time. Postscript Among the cultural exhibits that can be seen here is a Raggedy Ann doll, a box with Ritz crackers, a Heinz ketchup bottle, and Nixon's poster, unique for that era, asking, “Would you buy a used car from this person?”
