The trio is a pleasant, nostalgic journey to the first hint of desire — when it came to a simple study of the unknown — before we “grew up” and added those difficulties of HIV status, emotional baggage and “run-and-run-my” pager -simply plunged into an emotional mix. <br /> <br /> The anxiety depicted in the picture is a real teen anxiety, but it rings true in all three stories. Their sweetness and positivity make you feel good that you are gay. But such films are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Good news! Boys Life and Boys Life 2 are now available on DVD from September 1999.
