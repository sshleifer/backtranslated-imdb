GZSZ - the longest daily soap in Germany, and this is a cult! I started watching it from day one, and they hooked me from the very beginning. Much has changed over the years, old characters such as Heiko, Elke, Tina, Saskia, etc., have remained, and new ones have appeared, such as Marie, Kai, Cora or John. I have to say that I liked GZSZ more in 1995-2000 because today the series is too focused on young characters. My favorite character is Sonya Vibe, because she is the most intriguing person who has ever been on this soap, and she is also one of the most interesting characters in the series. Tina Bordin was great as the first Sonya, but when Tokessa became the incarnation of Sonya, the character became even better.
