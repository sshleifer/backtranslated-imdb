I wish I could be eloquent enough to say how GOOD this film is. <br /> <br /> I ... it's hard to say. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'll just say what comes to mind. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I really laughed. I could not believe it. I laughed, and it was not a bitter laugh. it was not a cynical laugh. it was a laugh, born of genuine joy. <br /> <br /> joy. This is a foreign word for me. I don't often feel that word, but I felt it while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Will. Maybe this is Will's face. He is a great man. "Smile in my face, and my eyes flicker." This line in one of Will's songs describes it beautifully. He has the "joy of life." Trey is a happy, happy boy who has a dad like Will. Jada is a happy woman with a husband like Will. He is someone ... special. <br /> <br /> Happy. I really feel happy. This is a strange feeling. I do not feel so often. It's so good to see, to see ... other people are really happy. I mean really happy. In this film I did. As Will says in the film: “Maybe I’m not happy with just“ good, ”maybe I want“ extraordinary. ” You know, watching this movie made me think: me too. <br /> <br /> Funny. Being yourself. We all know that we have to be ourselves, but it feels like we are punished if we do it. Perhaps this should be earned. Maybe this is what we show, not being ourselves for a long time. That's why I just loved the finale. Will, Eva Mendez, Kevin James, Amber Valletta, Julie Ann Emery all dance at the wedding. Dancing without brakes. NOBODY THEY WE DO NOT DRINK! except that actually being happy. I can understand that, at least, I think I can (at least I liked to see them happy, really happy). <br /> <br /> Women and men. I know nothing about relationships, but I feel. When I watch this movie, I want to communicate with someone, strive, push, want to be with someone. Seems to make life ... something else completely. I really do not know. I just guess. but I felt something watching this movie. I felt that this connection must have ... should create a life worthwhile. <br /> <br /> This is such a film. It's funny. It's smarter. This is TENDER. It causes a feeling. It made me think that, maybe, just maybe, life is really beautiful. <br /> <br /> Want to LAUGH? Want to feel really good! Want to get some answers about girls (and girls, answers about guys)? Watch Hitch. YOU GET IT ALL !!! <br /> <br /> GO! You are a great man.
