This is a classic Disney cartoon! Clumsy college student Dexter Riley (Kurt Russell) develops a mysterious liquid invisibility formula that actually makes things disappear and helps him save his money-poor college. Further experiments show that it works surprisingly well in humans! Riley's striking discovery takes some funny new twists when a gang of crooks led by the infamous A.J. Arno (Cesar Romero) steals the formula and tries to use it for its illegal activities. Dazzling special effects and a fast-paced story make this lively movie a student comedy tutorial! I love this film! This film has always filled me with a sense of wonder and joy. A nice little comedy that the whole family can enjoy. A little violence or sex and absolutely no expletives makes this film that parents can watch with their children. Only one of the Kurt Russell film series, set at Medvale College. A nice little series, shot in a healthy America in front of terrorists, when people valued honesty more than money! I highly recommend this movie!
