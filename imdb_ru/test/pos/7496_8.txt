Good, so this film is NOT very well known and not very well advertised. I found out that this rather cruel gangster film, which had become a good film, quite accidentally hit one of the millions of Skys channels late one evening on one boring evening, but I'm glad I did! The initial sequence to this film is fantastically comic in a very dark way. This actually sets what I think is the general tone of the film. I think that a lot of critics and movie fans who actually saw this film were a little unfair to simply write it off as a gangster film with a lower budget in Vienna Reservoir Dogs.OK, so there are undeniable similarities between Thursday and some other crime movies. with whom he was compared, but to be honest, I think that this film looks much darker than a comic on this type of film, and the result is an exciting, well-made, funny, if not completely original film. Tom Jane is good at this and deserves the recognition that he now hopes to receive thanks to The Punisher. His performance as a bad guy went well realistic, funny and cold enough to make you believe that Casey really had a bad ass before he transformed. This is another thing that highlights this film for me, characters. In the Nyx gang, you get the strangest trio of criminals ever gathered, a sleek, charismatic, but very cold leader (Nick), a trigger for a happy, blood-loving, sexually predatory bitch woman (Dallas) and a mentally ill Billy with brains inclined to torture (Billy Hill). Throw in the weirdest police detective ever seen on the screen, beautifully played by Mickey Rourke, and you have a recipe ... well, actually, on Thursday. Sometimes it is darkly comic, sometimes brutal, sometimes non-original, but always exciting and worthy of attention film.
