I first saw this film about 15 years ago, and since then I have been fascinated by it. This is such a pleasant experience that I can happily watch it at any time of the year. However, for me this is the best Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that it is shot in black and white does not matter, although I often wonder how it will look in color. You can simply get this warm, radiant feeling by watching the Christmas events unfold. <br /> <br /> Stanvik and Morgan blend beautifully together, and Greenstreet is the exact opposite of his usual character. Sacall is a joyful joy that can be watched. <br /> <br /> This is a slight relief and, of course, not burdening the brain, but makes you glad that you saw it. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to see it on DVD in the UK. I will definitely be at the beginning of the queue to buy it.
