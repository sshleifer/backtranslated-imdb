How good is this movie? Apparently, it is good enough that they plan to remake it in 2011. Jean-Pierre Melville, who gave us the Dow and the Good Thief, wrote and shot this film. <br /> <br /> The film is almost silent. These are people of several words who prefer their actions to speak for them. They live under a code that regulates their every movement. <br /> <br /> There are some great actors in this film - Alain Delon (“Leopard”), Yves Montand (Jean de Florette, “Let's Make Love”) and Jan Maria Volonte (El Indio from “A Handful of Dollars and a few more dollars "). The film does not shine to them; they are together for melville. Melville makes a film; they do it better. <br /> <br /> You see Melville’s work in the films Ocean, but they just get the idea. Can't make it work like it. A great loss in the seventies, but his work remains for our pleasure.
