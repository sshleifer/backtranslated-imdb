Based on an actual event, this epic takes place in 221 BC and tells the true story of the unification of China. An action filled with intrigue, passion, betrayal and unforgettable fighting episodes, he kept my attention throughout his 160-minute duration. <br /> <br /> King Ying Zeng, played by Li Xuejian, is obsessed with the idea of ​​uniting the seven kingdoms of China and becoming his first emperor. His mistress, Lady Zhao, played by the beautiful actress Gong Li, is developing a plot to go to the neighboring kingdom of Yang to trigger a fake murder story that will give the king a reason to invade Yan. However, she falls in love with the murderer as the king becomes more and more ruthless. <br /> <br /> There are side scenes, tragedy and constant high drama. There are scenes of great beauty and terrible cruelty. This is excellent cinematography and brilliant use of physical space. <br /> <br /> The profound description made me think about Shakespeare. And the tragic events that resemble the Greek drama. Yet it is completely Chinese, since it deals with age-old questions about whether the ends justify the means. And it raises questions about life and death, good and evil, and all the blurry lines between them. <br /> <br /> This is the history of individuals against the background of history, the history that shaped China for the past two thousand years. I was gripped by history and moral issues. There are no easy answers, and this was one of the strengths of the film. <br /> <br /> Recommended. But be prepared for violence and blood. <br /> <br />
