When I started watching 3 episodes from this series on the Action Channel, I have to say that of all the TV shows I saw in the ADV release, this is one of the best shows of all time. I had to see it again, and then I had a chance. I bought the entire set from this series at Best Buy for my 20th birthday. And I enjoyed it, and I saw more episodes that I missed on the Action Channel, and the same 3 episodes that I saw. My favorite characters on this show are Silvia, Leon and Nigel. The animation in this series was the best, and the tight costumes were also great. But the show also has a great voice: Chris Patton, Jason Douglas, Christina Outen, Hillary Haag and others. So if you like this show on the action channel, then you should have it on DVD. This is the best, and you will understand what I mean.
