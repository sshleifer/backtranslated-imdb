If you are going to watch this film, by all means do not enter this film, because the expectation of this film will be completely ridiculous, because you will be let down. Yes, sometimes it's funny, but I would consider it a political thriller disguised as a comedy. the performances are very good, especially Jeff Goldblum as the head of the election campaign. although he has limited time on the screen, he makes a lasting impression. Of course Robin Williams is excellent. Laura Linney is also very good, what a surprise. She is one of the best Hollywood actresses, and one scene in particular shows it. This film makes you wonder. What if the comedian ran for president and actually won? Will the country be better, or will the country split into a million?
