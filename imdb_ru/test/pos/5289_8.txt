For readers who have already seen one of the Miyazaki films: he is still in great shape and has received another useful experience. Well, now you do not need to read further. <br /> <br /> I already think that most readers are older than the two heroes of this picture, so I must say that Ponyo is not so much a family film, as a chance to remember the feeling that you are a small child: to discover the world in such a way how you wanted to see it, come up with your own rules and boast a stormy enthusiasm for the first time to do something on your own. Ponyo deviates from the many problems faced by all age films. This is never condescending, all characters have good kind hearts and believable problems. <br /> <br /> The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I have ever seen on the screen. They are not ingenuous, arrogant or naive, just curious, enthusiastic and learning worldly habits. They are so easy to love, but even easier to identify. Many films view children from the outside as an adult looking into a world that only a child can enter. Ponio returns everyone to this world. In Ponyo, there is the first time to find out and choose what excites you the most, which the film appreciates. It is worth remembering to feel it again.
