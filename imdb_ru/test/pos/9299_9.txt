I know that no one should comment on the comments of other users, but I will say that many negative reviews seem to come from people who already knew a lot about the Manhattan project and were annoyed by what was left unattended. (From his book, Smoking in Bed, you can see that the original screenwriter Bruce Robinson is another one of them.) However, I knew very little before watching the film, and found it riveting. Dwight Schulz is absolutely hypnotic as Oppenheimer - a truly compelling, charismatic presence, an inspired cast that makes me wonder why he is not being given better roles and more leading roles. John Cusack and Paul Newman are excellent as always. One could argue with different scenarios or directions, but since this film is extremely intense and at times terrifying, I generally give it four stars out of five.
