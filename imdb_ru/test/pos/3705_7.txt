When his elderly mother, Emily (Gene Bates), is attacked by her resident Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, television news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) is trying to keep her dear old mother from satisfying hunger. /> <br /> Despite the fact that the above summary of the plot conjures images of shoddy, supernatural horror titles of the 80s, such as “Flesheating Mothers” and “Mad Grannies”, in fact, the mother turns out to be a refreshingly original look at the werewolf / vampire / zombie myths (exactly what Emily becomes is never truly clear, but this is not good!), and also a touching study of the close relationship between mother and son: Clay's devotion to his mother makes him give up all his other duties including his work and his relationship with Alice’s pregnant girlfriend (Mary Beth McDonough), while Emily’s love for Clay eventually leads her to self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film can be sharper, with a more stylish direction. and better effects (shots about the creature are kept very briefly so as not to disappoint), and some of the more experienced cast members get upset about terribly stupid performances (Yes, Brion James and Stella Stevens, I AM address you); Fortunately, however, a strong emotional flow in a well-designed story is enough for a mother to be an effective, convincing and sometimes shocking story, which I would not hesitate to recommend to those who are looking for something a little different. ,
