and not much in the history of cinema. "Rouge" seems like a kind of hope. Hope in humanity and in life. But to say only that which can be naive. Kislovsky could find the right way to tell the story of this embittered judge and a twenty-year-old, but wise model. Perhaps this old and disappointing novel will not happen again - this is a new couple with a young judge after the accident. But what to say about this camera wizard? You can not miss a second of the film, because you have to watch each of these faces. Kieslowski loved people, and this is quite obvious from the way the camera treats the actors Miss Jacob and Mr. Tringtinian beautiful. This is not only this film, but also the depressing “You won’t kill” and “Love Story”, which you can present in modern cinema as a way to express the artist’s point of view. Pathetic American public - the average - could not see these films. At least they are not in the dictionary Maltin. And even Baseline does not know what to say about this unique person. Abel Posadas
