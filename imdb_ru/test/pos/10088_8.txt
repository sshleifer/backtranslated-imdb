What can I say about this film, which will not give you any preconceived notions when you see it? Very little. The plot is associated with the return from hospital of a teenage girl after she broke down. What follows this film. This is one of the most creepy most amazing movies in the past few years. Everything in the film is a bit off center, and after the end of the film you feel bad. This is not a perfect movie. The film has problems in the past half hour, which make the already tangled story even more confusing. (If you’ve read a lot of other comments here, on IMDb and elsewhere, you’ll find out that you’ve spent a lot of time trying to figure out what’s really going on.) that he scared me and alarmed me like most famous horror films do. If you like horror, and you do not mind that everything is summarized, I advise you to try it, as this will likely cause your skin to creep.
