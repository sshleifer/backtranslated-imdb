Rowan Atkinson shows an unforgettable experience in the role of a senseless Mr. Bean, who never goes far without his teddy bear. The appeal of Mr. Bean largely lies in his childhood behavior and innocence. We do not know whether he came from the sky or from another planet. He is such a strange character that is hard to come up with. He is often lonely and used to it. It is difficult for him to communicate with speech, which is why we sometimes hear his grunt. There are other characters who talk to him, and he answers. The character of Mr. Bean remains a mystery and a mystery. He lives alone and does the unthinkable when he can do the sensible thing. Mr. Bean is a rather strange man who is not particularly against it. Rather, he lives a simple life with his yellow car and a teddy bear and hopes to get to work in time.
