A good description of the situation in the US, it explains the different types of Islam, and not just a terrorist and extremist show. Islam can be another thing that kills, they show why some people become terrorists and how to be Muslims without being extremists. This is a big series that Muslims and non-Muslims should see. Now we hope that other series or films will be made to change the idea that all Muslims are terrorists and all Americans want to destroy Islam. It gave me an interest to learn what Islam is and what the US and European governments are doing to help the cohabitation of people of different religions.
