A student nurse is not a typical sex movie. Of course, there is nudity and sexual openness, but there is more to it than to laugh. Stephanie Rothman wrote the script for the socially attractive, well-written film “Tits and Ass”, which deals with racism, socioeconomic inequality, rape, abortion, medical ethics, public health issues, human rights, Vietnam War, free love, LSD and of drugs. experimentation. Four sexy college neighbors are nursing internships. Sharon (Elaine Giftos) has been assigned to the nursing unit, Lynn (Brioni Farrell) to the public health department, Priscilla (Barbara Lee) to the gynecology, and Fred (Karen Carlson) to psychiatry. These four beauties have ample opportunity to undress and commit adultery, which they use, much to the delight of male viewers. In the end, it is liberated women at the peak of the sexual revolution, and they are as smart as they are excited and beautiful. Visceral, but low-budget action sequences are interspersed throughout. The headquarters of the resistance movement is a very bloody firefight, in which two policemen, as well as several members of the group, are shot dead. The protest against the Vietnam War, consisting of young men of all races, painted like skeletons in an eerie mood, becomes violent, and the police beat the protesters. An effective beach travel sequence consists of beautiful, weird and intricate sensory and memorable montages with hypersensitive undertones. In short, STUDENT CARE is a thoughtful and irresistible reflection of the times expressed through real women's views (as it was written and directed by a woman). But it is still fun and exciting, despite the sobering attitude to the subject.
