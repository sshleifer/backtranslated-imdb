I have to compensate for all the horrible comments. I love this film. I have a movie and a soundtrack. I watch it whenever I need to pick me up. Of course, this is not similar to the Sound of Music, but it’s just as fun if you don’t choose movies for you. I adored the late (and magnificent) Bobby Bath, and James Shigeta will always and always be the favorite. I saw it when he first came out in cinemas. I'm a big music fan, and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in "The Boyfriend". This is a modern musical, and it can not be judged by all that was before. This is simply the best for dreamers like me who want them to find this place - without diseases, without wars, without drugs, all the bad things in life are gone. This is nothing more than a good movie. This is what all movies should be about. The title song Shaun Phillips is great and explains the whole atmosphere of the film. If the game is not the biggest - who cares. I like the idea of ​​the movie. Peter Finch, a very tough actor, Liv Ullmann, gorgeous as always, Sally Kellerman, a surprisingly good voice, Michael York, typical, and Olivia Hussey, amazing, everyone convinced me that they were ordinary people. None of them acted like an actor in a movie. They acted like real people, just as I did if I found this place. Torn between returning home and staying there, in awe of everything. Yes, there are flaws in this film, but come to terms with it, this is not Citizen Kane, this is a good musical!
