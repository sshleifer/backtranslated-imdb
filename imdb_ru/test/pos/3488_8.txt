"Formula for the murder" - not very famous Giallo, but this does not mean that he is not very good! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind such iconic classics as Antichrist and Burning Magnums. The film was released later in the Jallo cycle, but more than withstands many films released during the golden period in the early seventies. Despite the lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to the competent way that it mixes scenes of death in the style of Argento with some really amazing plot twists and a lot of well-defined characters. The film may not be as exciting as a whole, like many other films in the genre; but this is more than compensated for by the guaranteed way of presenting the central situation to the audience and caused by this tension. The plot begins with a show that a fake priest rapes a young girl named Joanna, and then knocks her down the stairs. Then we fast forward a few years ahead, and the girl is now a woman who, unfortunately, is in a wheelchair. Craig prepares her for a sporting event; a man who also has romantic drawings on her. However, his proposal does not meet the joy of personal assistant Joanna, who also has romantic pictures on her. <br /> <br /> The film shows the turn of the story halfway through, which is the basis of the film, and so far this is not entirely logical; it's nice to watch and hints that you are interested in an interesting film. Director Alberto de Martino is clearly not afraid to show several outrageous bloody scenes, and the best of which in this film shows how a priest beats a shovel to death - and I personally feel free to call this sequence one of my favorite scenes of the Giallo murder! The plot may at times be a little uneven, but overall the action is very good. The director spends what seems like an eternity to conclude a film; but it is completely saturated with tension, and the way it unfolds is good because it uses all the points of the plot that came before it. The musical score, taken from the New York Ripper’s Fulci film, also works well in this film, and in breaking the Jallo tradition, de Martino’s film also features pretty good acting from cult veteran David Warbeck and Cristina Nagy in her only role in feature film. In general, this film is not one of the easiest for Giallo; but it's worth tracking down and is recommended to fans of this kind of movie.
