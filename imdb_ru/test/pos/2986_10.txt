Wonderful film, telling about all kinds of feelings that I experienced when I was much, much younger. I liked it, and the music of Elton John. I remember seeing movies when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I never knew anyone else who saw this movie when it was released. <br /> <br /> The dreams that he inspired in me a decade ago never left me, and, seeing this film again, he again rushed back, but I confess that my children (at the age of 20) did not experience this emotional hype. Generation? <br /> <br /> Why is it not on DVD?
