I am not usually in dark / psychological things like a thriller. Nevertheless, SEIZING ME is a really awesome job. History, acting, shooting, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding - all this is really quite difficult and convincing. Rose rather accurately plays the difficulties and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated approach to energy exchange issues. It was so hard for us to watch that we left three-quarters to “drink tea” and I had to take a shower. The story was exciting, but we were clearly unable to handle all the energy with a single shot. (It goes deep into the rough and dirty side of people, but it doesn't leave you there). I have been thinking about characters and deeper meanings for a long time. I highly recommend it. However, be prepared for an experience you do not expect.
