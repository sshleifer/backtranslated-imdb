It is said that this film has been banned or banned in the United States since its release. Since there is no information about IMDb, I have to rely on other sources and believe in it. If this is true, then the film is even more offensive and frightening, and in any case it is. <br /> <br /> The film is a so-called movie, although I think the topic is too serious, so call it. This creates a scenario in which America looks like a military state, and all revolutionary objects are immediately arrested without evidence. After the compulsory trial, they must decide whether they will go to prison for several years or choose a punishment park. In doing so, they need to walk three days in the desert to reach the American flag, which is hung 50 miles ahead, followed by police and army troops. <br /> <br /> The film itself pretends to be a documentary about these incidents, telling both about the tribunals and about hunting in the desert, shot by European film crews. All facts are explained, interviewers ask questions and take pictures of everything. People are looking straight at the camera, shouting at her. It seems very, very real. Talking about realism here is nonsense. This film is not about how to make a realistic film, but how this film would look like if it were real. And it will certainly look like this. If this will be removed anyway. In such a utopian state, of course, there would be no European film crew that would be allowed to shoot these things. <br /> <br /> There are many things that scare us. The respondents are people from all social backgrounds. Political leaders, musicians, authors, philosophers, the unemployed, etc. They seem hopeless, rebellious or frightened. They are not heroes. They talk a lot in the tribunal, knowing that it will lead nowhere, however, saying everything they said in their performances, books and songs before. One says that he is not afraid to die. It's true? Well, he must not run through the desert, which is hunted by police. The defendants have no chance, or at least their only chance, the decision between the prison and the park of punishments is not really a chance. The way they decide at the end and how the film ends clearly shows that this kind of heroism is suicide. <br /> <br /> These tribunals remind us of many tribunals in the Third Reich. Officials use the same idealistic statements, ignoring all the arguments of the accused, start shouting at them and then tell them that they should be silent. They warn the accused of “watching their tongue” and insult them much more. They ask them questions, the respondents cannot answer, but they never intend to do that. These scenes are a statement of what we call justice. <br /> <br /> Desert scenes are on a different level. When we see prisoners for the first time, we understand that they understand that they have no chance. Seeing the desert and the mountains, feeling the sun and thirst, they have no idea how to stand in these free days. The film crew follows them and talks to them while they try to avoid this madness. They argue whether they should play the game, or run away, or rebel? All this leads to the same, and no one is surprised. Someone will ask, do such parks really exist in such a state? Why not? He frees prisons and allows the government to punish revolutionaries as they wish. This is not a gas chamber, but the Nazis killed Jews before the concentration camps were built. The comparison is fair, because between them there is no difference. <br /> <br /> The film is terrible and depressing. The problems they are talking about sound familiar to ignore. This is not science fiction. Talking about poverty, unemployment and crime is not utopian. The film shows us that the government and democracy in the form in which they are presented to us is not only useless, but also dangerous. It also shows us that revolution is definitely not the solution. The defendants seem confused because they really do not know how to deal with it. They do things, but for nothing. Even if it does not give us a solution, it is still a statement. <br /> <br /> For me the most frightening is the fact of the ban of this film. Here we have a film accused of losing freedom, morality and peace. He blames the government, however, a fictional government, that it is dangerous and inhuman. And such a film is prohibited. Think about it the next time you see an American flag.
