Cheerful from beginning to end, you need to have great courage to cope with the theme of death with a smile, especially when two funeral bureaus fight for control of the market: classical and revolutionary, where all the funeral - the show, the leader Christopher Walken, pleasure as a far-sighted American suicide bomber . But the rest of the cast is also great, and this is another success that only Great Britain is capable of. Surprising among the cast is Naomi Watts, who strikes with another metamorphosis (including an accent). Always with a smile on his face, it seems a paradox that one could take so much comedy from the film, which could be called “Four funerals and one wedding,” but you will understand when you see it.
