This film was a pleasant surprise for me. Honestly, the previews looked terrible, right up until the moment when Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman appeared. So I shot it with a reservation, but I really liked this movie. He had a great game, a few good plot twists and, of course, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. This is definitely worth checking out.
