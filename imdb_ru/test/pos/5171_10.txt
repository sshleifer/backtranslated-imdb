It was nice to see John Denver again, although he died a few years ago. I found that this film is very soulful and a great film when it sits by the fire on a cold winter night, remembering what Christmas is. The scenes from Georgetown, Colorado were great and I want to move there right away. When I sit here in my own grief, seen in So California, I really liked the story and the plot. I hope that everyone who watches this older movie will like it just like my mom. Merry Christmas! Great movie for the whole family, too, see. Enoy and tell others about it. Thank you for the memories. We need more such films to come out of Hollywood.
