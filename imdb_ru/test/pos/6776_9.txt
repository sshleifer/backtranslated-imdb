This is by far the best movie I've seen in a long time. This is a completely original and beautiful plot. It's not boring and not too dramatic. The characters are tangible and realistic, but this does not take away from the storyline. The fact that not in English is most likely the final touch. The end leaves you satisfied as I have never seen in a movie before. <br /> <br /> I wish I had found this film before. <br /> <br /> More lines. <br /> <br /> More lines. <br /> <br /> More lines are much more lines come on, I did
