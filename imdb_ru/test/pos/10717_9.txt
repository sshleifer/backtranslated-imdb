KRAMER VS KRAMER won five Oscars, including the "Best Picture of 1979". This intense and deeply moving family drama follows the advertising director, whose life is turned upside down when his eight-year-old wife comes out on him, leaving him to take care of her son and build a relationship with him he never had. Robert Bentonâ€™s harsh scenario presents us with imperfect but true human beings with a heart, a soul, and a brain. For example, in the scene where Joanna announces to Ted that she leaves him, she does not just run out of the door ... she gives him the keys, her credit cards, a dry cleaning ticket, tells him which bills have been paid, and tells him that Withdrew from her bank account the same amount of money that they had when they were married, no more. This decision to leave was not a whim ... thought about it, and Joanna felt that she had no choice but to leave, if she left, she was going to do it right ... and without any particular plan, she did not considered it right to take Billy. Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his Ted Kramer, a man so obsessed with bringing home the bacon that he had no idea that his home life was falling apart. Meryl Streep also received an Oscar in the role of Joanna, an unhappy wife, to whom we feel sympathy at the beginning of the film, but everything changes when she returns for her son. Hoffman is at the top of his form here. I always cry during the scene where he tries to explain to Billy (Justin Henry, an Oscar nominee), why his mother left, and he does it all in a stage whisper or when he meets Joanna on her return and throws her drink at the wall (Hoffman moment which is not in the script, which was not told to the Strip to get a natural reaction). Justin Henry beats all the right notes, like Billy, a bewildered little boy who doesn't know why his mother left, and doesn't know how to communicate with his father. Jane Alexander also received an Oscar nod in the role of Ted and Joanna's neighbor, Margaret, who changed her loyalty to the conclusion of the film. This is a tense family drama, but there is laughter here too ... Billy and chocolate chip ice cream ... Billy puffs up because Ted is late for a party ... Billy catches one night with his father (Jobet Williams) on his way to the bathroom completely naked but you remember the moments of human drama ... Ted runs through Manhattan with Billy in his arms to get to the emergency room after Billy falls out of the jungle gym ... Ted gets fired right before the start of his custody battle and instead in order to arrange a scene, he whispers a guy ... "Shame on you". And, of course, the finale, where Joanna tells Ted that she doesn't take Billy, and it was a little difficult for me to swallow it. Why would she go to all these problems, sue for custody, and then just change her mind? But this is a small talk about a wonderful film, masterfully filmed by Robert Benton and impeccably performed by a first-class actor. Must see.
