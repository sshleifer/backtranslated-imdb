A hundred miles from the murder scene of a grizzly bear in the American town of Jill Johnson (Belle), he gets a nanny night out. With children sleeping and a wonderful holiday home, she locks the door and sets the alarm. But when a series of creepy phone calls from a stranger says that she “will check the children,” Jill panics. Fear of terror when she tracks calls. And what the police find turns the ideal nanny job into the worst nightmare of a 16-year-old child. There are no other leading actors in this movie. Camilla Belle - the main star with a pretty face. On the day she comes to the nanny, she really has no idea what the hell she is waiting for. <br /> <br /> If I were in a house like the one in which Jill was. I would explore everything around. The refrigerator would be the first person I would look at, but I am a man and I do not nurse. But what seemed ridiculous to me was the size of the house. I thought the movie would have been the same if the house had not been so big? Anyone can get lost in this huge house, but for this film you need a huge house. <br /> <br /> Camilla Belle has a sweet face, a perfect smile, but it’s like a movie, like this leading actress needs someone with experience. I found that Camilla is not so good. I don't know, maybe she thought that this might be her breakthrough role. I like her, she is a nice girl, but in order to play a role in this film, you need to take someone in a different way. <br /> <br /> This movie was not scary. I also found this film to look more like a “tiptoe movie.” I think the only reason this was released during SuperBowl Weekend was that the guys stay at home and watch the game, and the girls go out to look at it. It also looks like a movie in which girls like more than guys. But I liked this movie, but how it is. Girls just love being scared or screaming. It was a pretty decent movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone might like this movie. There are many PG-13 horror films that never succeed. It was on its level. I like this movie. I give it 7/10.
