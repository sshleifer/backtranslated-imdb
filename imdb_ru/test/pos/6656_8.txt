This weekend I looked again at Cold Mountain and the English Patient. The first is the melodrama of the civil war about Inman (Jude Law), a Confederate soldier who leaves the army to return Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) to a girl he hardly knows. Both films were lovingly shot by Anthony Minghella, who does exceptional work. Although “Cold Mountain” is very good, it could be a great movie with the right choice of actors and a less simple, deaf dialogue. <br /> <br /> Romantic epics need convincing heroine. The English patient had Kristin Scott Thomas, who was beautifully played by the clever, alluring and beautiful Catherine Clifton. The main problem with Cold Mountain is Ada, which seems stupid and stupid, and lacks this quality to make you believe that Inman can become obsessed with one kiss. Since the actress Kidman has a limited range, she usually plays harsh women who face difficulties with stoicism. Kidman was also too old to play Love and Love Lowe. The film needed a young actress who was able to play charmingly, warmly and vulnerable. For someone who allegedly endured difficulties and almost starving to death, she seemed ridiculously well fed and disguised. Kidman was so immaculately groomed that it seemed like she spent three hours preparing for each scene. In his youth, Michelle Pfiffer could have played a great role. Even Natalie Portman would be an improvement. <br /> <br /> René Zelleweger was more adequately dressed, but her animated presentation chewed on the scenery, but perhaps she was trying to compensate for Kidman. Jude Law was in his own silent film as Odyssey, but played his part well. Ray Winston was an excellent London / Southern villain. <br /> <br /> During the Civil War, people were probably not very well educated by today's standards, and perhaps they spoke in a monosyllabic manner. However, if you look at the BBC adaptation of Dickens, Austin, or Mrs Gaskill, all will be clearly defined. Maybe this is unrealistic, but it would improve my entertainment.
