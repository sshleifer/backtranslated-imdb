This film was released at about the same time as Pretty Woman. Although the general theme is the same: a rich man meets and learns to love a poor woman from the working class, the characters of Romuald and Juliet are much more attractive and worthy of our time with them. I have never forgotten them, and I think that the film is superior to “Pretty Woman” in many ways. Juliet is a wonderful woman, and the smart ways in which she helps her boss overcome his problems will make you cheer up. The final scenes contain some of the most memorable lines in the romantic comedy. The efforts that Romuald exerts to win the love of Juliet surpass the little climbing scene of Beauty a hundred times. Watch this movie, it will warm your heart.
