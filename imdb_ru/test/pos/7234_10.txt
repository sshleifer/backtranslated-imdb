This is the best movie I've ever seen. And I saw a lot. I'm not even a fan of Tromy. I have never heard of Trome before watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I have already lost hope of seeing a great movie, until I saw “Thromeo and Juliet”. This film is a dream come true. Shakespeare would probably be proud of this modern adaptation of his classics. There is sex, violence, humor and satire. This breaks many taboos. <br /> <br /> This film is not disgusting and not stupid. It is difficult to describe in words how smart, funny, exciting and witty this film is. The music is great and perfect for any scene. The characters are very believable, and the acting is great. I really cared about the characters. <br /> <br /> This, of course, is not only for Tromy fans. This is for all people who have a sense of humor and who love intelligent and believable entertainment, and not absolutely stupid and incredible mainstream films that dare not do what this film does. <br /> <br /> Bad reviews only prove that this film is excellent and something exceptional. You either love it or hate it. Like all true works of art, it is not understood and appreciated by all people.
