Awesome comedy-drama about the power of friendship. Despite the fact that this is a remake of the film of 1939 with the same name, it can probably be compared to the movie "Sex and the City." I would not compare it completely. The story begins with Mary (Meg Ryan), who, it seems, the majority of women would envy, she is happily married, has a good daughter, good friends and a great home. But Maryâ€™s ideal life is not as it seems when she discovers that her husband is cheating on her from Krystal (Eva Mendes) from Zack. Mary is puzzled and does not know what to do. But her four good friends, Sylvia (Annette Bening), Edie (Debra Messing) and Alex (Jada Pickett Smith), try to be with her as soon as they can. I really do not want to give more. But I found it pleasant, and I am a man. Meg Ryan is great, it's nice to see her on the screen again after a series of dips. And the rest of the actors are also great, including Eva Mendez as Crystal. Just a nice carefree comedy.
