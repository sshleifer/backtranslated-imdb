This film sat in a dusty bundle of videos in my house for ages before we watched it. We knew it was there — every time someone wanted to watch a movie, it was suggested. It almost became a joke ... "I know, let's see how to throw mom out of the train" ... I do not know why it was always denied, it just was. Little did we know that we were missing. It still happens to me, why it took us so much time ... I mean, these are the stars Danny De Vito, Billy Crystal and Ann Ramsey (whom we called "Lady of the Gunies"), the cast that should have addressed everything in my house. But there he sat for almost ten years. Until one day it was suggested, and we could no longer reject it .... It was like finding the grave of King Tut ... <br /> <br /> No film I was not forced to laugh so hard, and I doubt that any film will ever be. I had to rewind almost every line, because I was still laughing at the line that preceded it, and lost the ability to hear or pay attention. Not just laugh, but ... laugh, who spends more energy than running ten miles through the cold. This laugh, which you cannot control, causes skating, cramps, tears and snot running down your face, because it's just ridiculous. After I memorized the movie, I’ll say that this effect has diminished, but I don’t think I’m getting tired of watching it and finding new fads in it. I think that is all I can say. I would recommend this film to everyone, but if you don’t like it, please don’t let me know, I’m probably offended.
