I was 19 or 20 years old, at that time I lived in Salt Lake City, Utah, and still remember the new dome theater, called the 21st century. Folding chairs that swung, and a new sound system, a large screen and a huge open space between the screen and the packed theater. We felt all the excitement of the new preview of the film. Ta da da da da da da dada ... I can still hear the opening music, the ringing trumpet and the roar of the cymbals. I loved the interaction of the characters and the perspectives taken. I know that Peter Finch and Luv and Sally had some problems with lipstick, but hey, that was good, go better to the movies! What I regret, it is how they cut a meaningful heart out of it, showed an abbreviated version, and then called it a failure. I saw a shortened version, and I see that she lost her vision, which was in the preliminary release. Yes, I wrinkle a little at Peter’s attempts to make love with music, but, you know, I didn’t see it that way when I left the theater. when they looked at us, when we left, I regret any of my comments that might have altered the original. Then I liked it, and I still see it, listening to music on my album. Most of my family have heard me sing most of the soundtrack, and I can use the monologues of the films in our games “what kind of film”. I would like to have a directing film on DVD available. This is available on VHS, but it is not exactly the same. I would especially like the full serious comment of the Lord about the style of the rings about his origins, wrestling and victories. Picky people should leave things alone. Return it!!!!
