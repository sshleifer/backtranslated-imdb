It is not difficult to imagine what the main problem is for a screenwriter who wants to have 18 equally well-written characters with approximately the same amount of screen time in a film that lasts about 90 minutes. It’s almost impossible to abandon stereotypes, and this is also what filmmaker Ralph Westhoff does here. Very few of the characters can be recognized by people we know in real life, many of them are simply characterized by two or three attributes and remain vague. I know about it, but I still think that “Shoppen” is successful, namely, that he performs only what he wants. This is a film with a very well written dialogue, an extremely good acting game and a film that made me laugh very often. I do not think that this film wants to make a deep analysis of loneliness in our modern society, or that it wants to be a moral commentary on a quick date. This is a film about something that exists and about people and their motivation to use it. Fun and entertaining.
