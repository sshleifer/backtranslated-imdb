Films rarely encounter a problem-solving process and fantastically far-reaching moral issues, and they are a fairly accurate historical film, but Fatty and the Little Boy cope with this trick. <br /> <br /> This is the story of the Manhattan Project - the efforts of the Second World War to create an atomic bomb, described as a conflict between two men who did this, by General Leslie Groves and Robert Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> Historical figures are an excellent study of opposites: military versus civilians, practical versus idealists, emotional versus scientific ones, brute force versus consensus-based problem solving, spontaneity versus long-term vision. The fictional character played by John Cusack is added as a kind of synthesis of two historical figures to show humanity, which strangely eludes real people (and, of course, the obligatory love interest played by Laura Dern). Anyone looking for a direct documentary may criticize mistakes in melodrama (and random weakness with facts, but this is Hollywood for you), but the goal of fiction is to synthesize and stimulate events into more universal truths, so I think it can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> One of the remarkable visual effects in the film is when Oppenheimer witnesses the first atomic explosion: it was made solely due to his reaction, and given the amazing visual effects inherent in the atomic explosion, it is bold and completely effective. a way to describe in an instant the ambivalent influence on people of the disclosure of such power (such things are lost in the typical Hollywood film version of the story). The use of music is especially good in the last third of the film. <br /> <br /> Affordable and highly recommended as a historical film, and the drama of the highest order.
