This whimsical, creepy horror film begins in a castle on the top of a cliff, towering above the sea, in a beautiful place, when a vampire bat flies and crawls towards a sleeping doctor (Stevens Onslow). The bat turns into a man known as Baron Latos, actually Count Dracula (John Carradine). He seeks the help of Dr. Edelman to cure him of vampirism. After all, a good doctor also wants to help his hunchbacked nurse assistant (Jane Adams), Wolfman (Lon Cheney) and Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange). But Dracula’s cunning pollutes the doctor’s blood, and he becomes Jekyll / Hyde’s vampire. This is slightly better than last year’s “Frankenstein House”, less episodically and visually more exciting. There is a haunting scene where Dracula is trying to lure the second nurse (Martha O'Driscoll) into his world, where she initially plays the Moonlight Sonata on the piano, which soon gives way to terrifying music. Directed by Earl Kenton uses expressionistic shadows and creepy music to create many episodes, including the wonderful editing sequence that the studio often used in its horror films. Two performers should be noted: Stevens, with his wonderful voice, sympathizes first and then convincingly threatens. Adams, her beautiful face in anxious contrast with her twisted body, shows great pathos and sympathy. All this ends with the culmination of the flapping typical of the universal horror of the 1940s, a little harsh, with shots taken from The Phantom of Frankenstein (1942). I hope that Universal will release it on DVD soon (this was excluded from their dual-featured releases).
