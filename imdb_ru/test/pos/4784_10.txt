Walt Disney cartoon "Miki the Mouse." <br /> <br /> Steamboat Willie, a mischievous little rodent, neglects his wheelhouse and sports in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> On November 18, 1928, a struggling young genius made his debut in the world’s first successful cartoon with synchronous sound. Neither Walt Disney nor his alter ego Mickey Mouse will be. The financial struggle will continue, but, in fact, the world was their oyster, and Mickey could eventually compete with Chaplin as the most recognizable cultural icon of the century. <br /> <br /> As an entertainment STEAMBOAT WILLIE is still fun to watch, with the wonderful work of the animator Ub Iwerks and showing Mickey with all the passions and indifference of a small child. He must deal with a tyrannical skipper (Pete, without his peg; he appeared in Disney cartoons from February 1925), a wizard parrot (in a few years it will be a duck) and a cute little mouse named Minnie. Together, two rodents quite soullessly compose music on the living bodies of goats, cats, goose, pigs and cows (Klarabella’s predecessor) - to everyone who was comfortable to be on board the ship. The audience screamed more, and a template was set for the following Mouse cartoons over the next few years. <br /> <br /> **************************** <br /> <br /> Walt Disney (1901 -1966) always interested in drawings and drawings. As a boy in Marcelin, Missouri, he painted farm animals on scraps of paper; later, as an ambulance driver in France during World War I, he painted comic figures on the sides of his car. Returning to Kansas City, he created a primitive animation studio with artist Ub Iverx Walt, which provided animated commercials and cartoons for local cinemas. Always an innovator, his series ALICE IN CARTOONLAND created a living figure in the universe of cartoons. The change of business led Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923, where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager and consultant. When the distributor kidnapped a moderately successful series with Oswald's The Lucky Rabbit, the character of Mickey Mouse appeared in Walt’s imagination, ensuring Disney’s immortality. The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut, STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), a huge success for the audience with its use of synchronized music. Soon, Stupid Symphonies appeared, and Walt’s growing team of amazingly talented animators quickly conquered new territory with full color, depth illusions and radical personal development, an arena in which Walt’s genius was unbeatable. Micky's angry, capricious behavior swept millions of fans, but soon other lively companions were to join him: the temperamental Donald Duck, the mentally retarded Goofy and the energetic Pluto. All this was in the process of preparing for Walt's greatest dream - full-length animated films. Despite the blizzard, Walt persevered and over the next decades he admired children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi and Peter Pan. Walt never forgot that all of his fortunes were started with a mouse, or that children's message simplicity and a lot of hard work always paid off.
