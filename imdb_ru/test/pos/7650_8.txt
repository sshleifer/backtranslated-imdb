It would definitely not be my film, but my husband saw it on TV and said it was really good. Therefore, on his recommendation, I bought a copy, since I did not know whether she would ever be on TV again. I have never heard of anyone except Armand Assante. At first it was difficult for me to go down in history, because the first part of the film is a bunch of images, and it does not make much sense. It is only later in the film that it all comes together. Trimming the scene — if it’s called that, is a bit annoying — sometimes it looks as if several frames were cut from each scene, and jerky scenes — but I think it was done to add to the unusual (if that word). The story is changing here and there, and at about the time when you figured it all out, everything turns upside down, and you need to adjust your opinion about who the bad guy is and who is not. Or a bad woman. The game is very good - I kept thinking how Norman Reedus looks like Leo Decaprio. The ending was a real twist, completely unexpected, which I liked. Good show.
