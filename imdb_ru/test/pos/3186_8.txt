This is a great TV movie with a good story and a lot of comic moments thanks to the excellent cast. <br /> <br /> The only problem with this film is that it did not stand the test of time as it could have. <br /> <br /> Despite this, it is definitely worth seeing, especially if you are an Alan Alda fan or Ruth Gordon.
