“I’m afraid you’re talking at the counter where compelled people say anything.” This Shakespearean line from The Venetian Merchant is again reflected in the new film “Transmission”, which introduces the viewer to “improved interrogation methods”, views that began in the Clinton administration and became more common after the September 11 terrorist attacks. 2001. <br /> <br /> The film stars all stars: Oscar-winning Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Reese Witherspoon, as well as Peter Sarsgaard, Jake Gyllenhaal and Omar Metvally. Supporting roles played by unfamiliar actors also help, drawing the audience into the plot and showing how many people can suffer from terrorist attacks abroad, and our ways of investigating them. <br /> <br /> Rending follows the Egyptian-born terrorist suspect (Metwally), who was taken by US officials after his flight from South Africa to Washington, DC, to an unknown prison abroad. His pregnant wife (Witherspoon) goes to Washington to find out about his disappearance through a family friend and a member of the Senator (Sarsgaard). Gyllenhaal plays a young CIA analyst in a foreign detention facility who monitors brutal interrogations. <br /> <br /> This film tells about the emotional situation of the victim of torture (Metvalli) and those who participated in receiving the alleged information from him. Some, such as the CIA analyst (Geellenhall), are clearly shocked and frightened by the methods used, while others, a strict senator (Strip) and a foreign investigator (Igal Naor), consider it necessary and effective. <br /> <br /> The film may be described by some as a political part, but ultimately it is emotional. Metvalli’s presentation as a tortured prisoner worthy of an Oscar. The film is not intended for preaching, but in order to ask questions and inform the audience on a topic that is not often put on a human face. It is known that the transmissions work, but also give false information from innocent prisoners. The film simply describes the emotional struggle of those involved in such a serious business, and does it in such a way as to affect every viewer differently. The film will hold your interest, and you take part in each of the character's disasters.
