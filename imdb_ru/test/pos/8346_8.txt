Lady and the Tramp II is very colorfully animated, and the songs, especially the song Junkyard Dogs, are pretty good. However, the family seems even too idyllic, and I cannot but understand that Scamp is not happy when everything is forbidden. However, I also feel sorry for Angel, who never had a loving family, until she met Jim, Darling and Darling. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is clear that the original Lady and the Tramp is better than this sequel.
