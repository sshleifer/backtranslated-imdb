I saw “The Sea Inside” today, and I liked it. The film's actors are wonderful (especially Javier Bardem, of course), but I thought that Belen Rued would have the best part. Lola Duenas, Clara Segura and, especially, Mabel River give excellent interpretations. And I can not forget Celso Bugallo and Joan Dalmau (the brother and father of the main character). <br /> <br /> I really liked two technical aspects: the photograph of Aguirresarobe and the score of Amenabar himself. I liked the song “Negra sombra” (“Dark Shadow”) of Luz Casal with the music of Carlos Núñez. <br /> <br /> In short, I think the Spanish Academy should choose “The Sea Within” in order to take part in an Oscar competition. I liked other Spanish productions, such as Almodovar's Poor Education, but Amenabar’s film is much better than them. “Sea inside” deserves all the awards.
