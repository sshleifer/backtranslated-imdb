This is Pepe Le Pugh’s first cartoon, and in a sense it’s very similar to the later ones, but in some other strange cases it’s not. While the object of Pepe's affection is a cat, in a strange way she looks like a boy! All this predicament arises because the cat is tired of being insulted by others, dresses like a skunk and tries to smell like a skunk so that it can be left alone. Unfortunately, this attracts our hero, Pepe. Most of the action is pretty typical of the most funny and unexpected finale - and this actually makes this film one of the best cartoons in the series. Excellent animation (although the style is different from later examples), excellent writing and a good sense of humor make it a keeper.
