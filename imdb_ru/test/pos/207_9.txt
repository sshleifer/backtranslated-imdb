Love and war did occur on the other side of the Iron Curtain, and, looking at it with love, love was as strong as in the West, and the war was often more acute (is it worth saying more realistically?). <br /> <br /> In this film, as much about war and love as about the Soviet thaw of the era of Mr. K. It also reminds us that the best war films were not necessarily made in the 1990s with rivers of hemoglobin and millions of dollars spent on special effects and selling actors. <br /> <br /> This film is a classic of Soviet cinema and an outstanding picture of one of the greatest human tragedies: war. <br /> <br />
