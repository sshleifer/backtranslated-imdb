Like the earlier commentator, I saw it in 1980 and could never shake the memory of an exciting story, a great game and a dramatic musical score. It certainly contains some of the best works of Sam Waterston. He and the writers portray Oppenheimer not just as an unjustly persecuted hero, who he was, but also as a naive, alcohol-loving and snobbery, rounded portrait instead of a stereotype.
