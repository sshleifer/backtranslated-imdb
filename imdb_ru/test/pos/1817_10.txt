I remember watching this film when I was 13 and I fell in love with it, and I was a big fan of the film and the characters I adored. My favorite character was Stacy (Heidi Holicker) because she made me laugh when she showed no interest in Fred (Cameron Dye), who really loved her, and I hoped that in the end they would get together and then her boring boy Ralfi Christopher Murray) because he ignored her and hung out with his friends. I love the cast and the story. I always liked the role when Fred tried to get together with Stacy, and I always remember when he chased her around the car. But it was so good. I will always remember this when I am a teenager. Now that I am 33 years old, I took my copy on DVD and am looking forward to watching it.
