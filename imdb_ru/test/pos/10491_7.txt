In the aftermath of the American Civil War, the president (Van Johnson) travels to Dallas and is murdered by corrupt officials and businessmen interested in appointing a vice president whom they can blackmail because of compromising documents. The gunman (Guiliano Gemma) is convinced that his black friend is mistakenly accused of murder in order to uncover the truth. Tonino Valerie shot this exciting, albeit flawed film, which is obviously an allegory of Kennedy’s murder. The film may mistakenly represent blacks as slaves working on plantations in Texas, but the film is nevertheless enjoyable and provides an interesting interpretation - that Kennedy’s death was the result of a coup that many Americans could not accept at that time. Oswald’s murder is repeated here when responsible people are accused of killing blacks on their way to Fort Worth Prison. This moment in the film is more melodramatic than Oswald's death with his various attendants shot down in front of his main death scene. Nevertheless, it is certainly one of the most interesting and useful spaghetti westerns. Worth a look!
