Great thriller of all time. Vijay Anand stands out as a director and editor. The performances of Dev Anand, Vijayantimaly, Tanuji and Ashoka Kumar are useful for the film, the script of which is worked out to the smallest detail. Cinematography adds to the mystery, glamor and other requirements of history as it develops. And to top it all, the music of Sachin Dev Burman is unforgettable. Yeh dil na hota bechara Kishora Kumar, Raat akeli hai Ashi Bhosle, Rula ke gaya sapna mera Lata, Aasman ke niche Lata and Rafi and Hothon pe aisi baat main Lati, once again confirm the unique reputation Burman Dada as a first-class composer with his own style.
