How do you know a good movie or not? This is the impact it has on you. The “walking dead” upset me very much. I watched it twice. I don't know if I will be strong enough to watch it again. No, I did not feel good at all after watching, but the film was as successful as it can be. <br /> <br /> Robbins did a great job of incorporating all aspects of this controversial topic. He avoided giving arguments that could easily be regarded as biased or subjective. I hope that many people will see the "Walking Dead". I believe that anyone who supports or opposes the death penalty with such enthusiasm should watch a movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know what else can be done to finally convince everyone that this relic from ancient times has no place in modern society anymore. <br /> <br /> The film itself gives no arguments for or against the death penalty. It describes the reality. Reality is the best argument against the death penalty. <br /> <br /> 10/10 for excellent performances, good filmmaking and the most important film made in recent years. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Tim Robbins! <br /> <br />
