This show is awesome! I love all the actors! He has great storylines and characters. This is the perfect drama. James Caan and Josh Duhamel have a great dialogue. They both can be very funny. I miss Vanessa Marsil in the general hospital, but she's great here. James Lesure is great! He can be fun. Molly Sims plays the fool very well. The writing is awesome! They go at a great pace. The show can really leave you alone, which is one of my favorite elements of the show. I can not wait for the start of the new season. This show is in the top ten of all my shows. I hope this show will last a very long time. If people know that well, so be it. I never want the show to end. Ever
