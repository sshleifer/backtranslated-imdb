This film is one of the funniest I have seen in recent years. The film, which tells about the death and burial, without being depressing or disobedient. Christopher Walken gives most of the comedy in this charming novel, and I could hardly breathe with laughter. <br /> <br /> I saw the film in preview, and when it ended, the audience not only applauded, but also cheered, I tell all my friends to follow its arrival in the USA I definitely plan to see him again in the theater and buy it on DVD as soon as it is available.
