This documentary describes the origins and lives of the Zephyr skateboard team using an original film filmed in the 1970s (mostly Craig Stechik), in conjunction with an interview with team members and other influential people today. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film documents how a part of Dogtown originated in Venice, California, starting at the turn of the century, when the city was created as Venice, a Italy-like European city. By the 1970s, one of the remaining local attractions was the Pacific Ocean Park, leaving a beach with many open piers and other dangers. Poor children living in the area had nothing better than surfing, and they did well despite (or perhaps because of) their surroundings. Due to the fact that the waves scattered in the afternoon, they took up skateboarding to fill their time, and the empty pools caused by drought in those years, as well as their surfing backgrounds, led them to create a style of vertical skateboarding that is widespread today . <br /> <br /> I found that the movie covered much more about surfing than I expected, which seemed like a bonus to me, since I really knew very little about surfing or skateboarding before watching the movie. Not surprisingly, the soundtrack was also good. I also liked that these children simply follow their passion and generally gain more experience. The parts that didn’t work so well for me were the drama they were trying to create, which seemed somewhat forced, and the team’s somewhat overwhelming sense of self-confidence (although this was probably just the street’s attitude from where they grew up). up). This does not mean that they did not have a significant impact, but only that it seems very likely that there were other factors. <br /> <br /> One thing to say: my wife suffers most from nausea when the films use what we call “SpastiCam” (camera movement). This film is often to blame, so if you suffer like this, be careful. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to everyone, but especially to those who have a skateboard and / or surfing in history. <br /> <br /> Snapshot 5/11/2002.
