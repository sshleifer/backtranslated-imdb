Of course, seeing a few boom microphones means nothing, right? Lord, Rudy Ray Moore and D'Urville Martin really connected it, right? I laughed a lot, as is often the case in films of this type, but I don’t know what I was supposed to laugh at, because I laughed at many other things. I'm not saying that the movie was bad, but I will say that a little more editing would do wonders. I'm a big fan of Blaxploitation, so I don't think it was terrible, but I know that the “Human Tornado” was several times better than this one. I think that those who can get through this film may need a Colt 45 or two after. I mean, it really helps you not to notice the boom of microphones when you watch it again.
