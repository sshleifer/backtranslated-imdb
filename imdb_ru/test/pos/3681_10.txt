I first saw this film at a strange film festival. 10 minutes after the end of the film, a gay couple approached me and asked if I needed help - I was still sitting and crying like a maniac. The film is crappy, weird, excessive, funny, but amazing. I think every character is believable. The character of Everett is mean for a woman who is only trying to help, he cruelly throws out his (terrible) friends, he really has a character, he can harm a fly, a "fly" that killed the love of his life, twice. Bates is a miracle, she is as beautiful as the role. A woman whose love and admiration are so strong that she even loves her idolâ€™s homosexual lover is for me the essence of true love. I even understand Max (husband), he is tired of his life, he has a midlife crisis. He is leaving, trying to lead an exciting life, only to understand: a) that he is really a boring part in a relationship and b) that he loves his wife. I like the fact that she comes back to it at the end, because I think it gives the film the right balance between dream and reality. After all, in the end he is her husband, and he may not be as exciting as Victor, but he is real, he is a man whom she loves in a very mundane way. I watched it about 50 times, and I really like this film, everything about it is unconditional. By the way, just read Rupert Everett's autobiography, and UL is the only film he talks about as one of the best films he has ever made. For me, this is the best film he ever made.
