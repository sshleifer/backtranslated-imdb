Radio was a very good movie, and to be honest, I never cry in the movies. But it was pretty close to tears. It really came to me when Radio's mom died, and he just did not leave his room. I was very sad because if you were mentally retarded, you would not be able to understand death. I really liked the movie, and this is a must see.
