The above line sums it up pretty well. The best advantages of comics are visual jokes and jokes (the latter are almost impossible to translate, so comics best speak the original language). <br /> <br /> Both are quite difficult to film in a film, so they will never be as good as comics. Movies are just different environments than comics. With this in mind, this film surprisingly well captures the fun of comics. <br /> <br /> The word "fun" is tolerable, and sometimes even funny (Debuz makes reference to Amelie!). I have to mention that I watched the French version. If you don’t watch the French version, or your lack of understanding of the French language limits you to subtitles, the word “jokes” is likely to suck. <br /> <br /> Everything is in order with farces; It's a very simple form of humor, and it's not very funny when you are over twelve, but it reflects the spirit of comics. Other visual jokes are the saving grace of the film for older audiences because they are often quite funny. <br /> <br /> The acting game is absolutely unmatched, but again, this is not at all annoying, as it reflects the spirit of comics. Only Depardieu and Clavier do not really replay, which may be the reason why some people think that they didn’t like their roles (I didn’t notice anything). On the other hand, Jamel Debouze and especially Claude Rich turn reappraisal into an art form. Really fun to watch. Again, I am afraid that it would not be so funny when voices are voiced. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is not bad, much better than the previous one. This is not a classic, and it does not overthrow Asterix’s Twelve Tasks as my favorite Asterix movie, but still worth seeing. The French version, that is. 7/10
