I watch a lot of vampire movies. I KNOW vampire movies. Hammer Films have always been my favorites. Christopher Lee will always be the best Dracula. <br /> <br /> Vampire Effect is a fun movie from start to finish. Rewriting is not very good, but I also like Godzilla films, so I’m used to badly dubbed movies. Anyway, I really liked this movie. SFX are great. Although the role of Jackie Chance in the film has nothing to do with the plot and seems to have been added to the sale of the film, it gives him pleasure. Fang's work is excellent. Acting is not great, but this may be due to poor duplication. Perhaps the real language will sound better with the film, if I could understand it. I’m sure that Gone with the Wind sounds worse in another language. <br /> <br /> I own this on DVD and will not part. It's on my bookshelf next to the Hammer Films DVDs.
