This is the most humane and humane film that I have seen in a long time. There is plenty of irony: Susan Sarandon as a nun, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon in a film that neither preaches nor condemns. This is the best film, and yet the story is made up of several real events. <br /> <br /> Which of these two is more surprising, Sarandon or Penn? It is easy to say who is more likeable, but it is hard to say who is more persuasive. they are just great. <br /> <br /> You might think that all the killers should be killed, or you can argue that life without parole is not life, but death is more merciful. Whatever your personal feelings, this film gives you the opportunity to stop and reconsider your views. <br /> <br /> In the end, you just want to sit and be silent. This is what the great drama does, it gives catharsis, it creates a moment in time, a common memory that affects our humanity.
