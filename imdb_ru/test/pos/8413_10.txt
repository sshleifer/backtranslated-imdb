Following immediately after the last episode of the previous series “Yes, Minister.” <br /> <br /> Jim Hacker is now in Downing Street, number 10, as Prime Minister of Great Britain, not in the Cabinet of Ministers and in the government. He now heads Her Majesty’s Government. <br /> <br /> All this after some intriguing maneuvers of Sir Humphrey Appleby after the previous prime minister resigned at the end of the administration of Minister Yes. <br /> <br /> Sir Humphrey Appleby is now head of the civil service. <br /> <br /> I thought this series was better than the first one, or even though it didn’t last as long as the first episode unfortunately.
