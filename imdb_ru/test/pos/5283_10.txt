My first acquaintance with Japanese animation director Hayao Miyazaki and his production company Studio Ghibli happened when the English version of Spirited Away was released 7 years ago. What an amazingly creative and unique film it was! So, on this note, I managed to get my friend working at the cinema to watch this new film about Miyazaki, especially because he loves all things Disney (the American distributor of this movie). Once again, all I can say is “Wow!” What amazing visual effects relate to how water is depicted as an ocean ... and how about turning a title character from a goldfish into ... and how some characters change ... and, well, if you want, watch this movie know what I'm talking about. Oh, and the voices used for this American-dubbed version: Tina Fey, Betty White, Liam Neeson, Cloris Lichman, and Lily Tomlin. A good choice for everyone. Does everything make sense? No, but it is part of the childish charm that pervades everywhere. There are many funny scenes related to Ponyo, the boy and many other people they encounter. Oh, I think I wrote too much, so I just highly recommend Ponyo Hayao Miyazaki.
