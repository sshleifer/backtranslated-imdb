The Adventure of the Chipmunk is one of the greatest animated films of the 1980s. Alvin and Chipmunks have always interested me, since it was they who really led me to rock and roll. None of the chipmunks have any bad features. Alvin is really a star and has all the cool looks. Theodore is cute, sensitive. Then there is Simon (my personal favorite), smart, which is often in vain at a party. I also really like Chipette. There is Brittany, who, like Alvin, always tries to be so popular. Then there is Eleanor, who, like Theodore, is sweet, sensitive, and loves food. Janette is the only Chipetta who is not very similar to her colleague; she is very naive and very clumsy. <br /> <br /> In the very first feature film, The Chipmunks, David Sevil goes on a business trip to Europe, and while he leaves, he leaves the boys with Miss Miller. Playing an arcade game, Alvin loses to Brittany, and then says that if he had money, he would really drive Brittany around the world. Unnoticed by the children, a man named Klaus Furshtien and his sister Claudia, who tried to come up with a clever way to deliver diamonds around the world in exchange for cash, overheard this conversation and said that they would allow them to race. worldwide for 100,000 dollars. Alvin and Brittany take it and go to the race. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of great songs in this adventure film. "Off to See the World" is made for the corresponding thematic song for the film. Then there is “Getting Luck”, one of my favorite songs in the film. “My Mom” is probably the happiest song in the film, but it always makes me cry. “Wooly Bully” is the only cover song used in the film (the rest were completely original). Then, of course, there are “Boys and Girls of Rock and Roll”, which, in my opinion, should be one of the greatest musical numbers in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie very often until my recorded tape died. I still watch the movie though. In fact, this is a funny movie for people who are going on vacation to a foreign country for the first time. This will give you an idea of ​​what you expect from traveling the world. Definitely one of my children's films, and I would recommend it to fans of the 80s, Alvin and the Chipmunks.
