Well, I like stupid movies. If you like silly sci-fi movies, movies on top of the best movies, or you're a fan of Mr. Bruce Campbell, I would watch this movie. This film is all I wanted. Being a fan of excessive cinema, it meets all the requirements. Every time when I thought to myself, “this film will be the stupidest, best film in the world, if an“ empty ”happens ...”, then, as I thought, an “empty” will occur. This is a wonderful stupid movie. If you're a Campbell fan, I would say, “Look at this,” bring your friends, laugh about it. It's fun. It's not a classic, or anything, but if it's ever on TV, watch it. For me, this would be a movie that I would have filed under "condescending films." Movies that may not be very good, but after a hard day I could come home and watch (this list also includes “Harold and Kumar go to the white castle”, “Army of darkness” and “Intolerable cruelty”) <br /> If you feel that you look like an astonishingly little bit bad movie, watch this. if not, go rent "Bubba Ho-Tep"
