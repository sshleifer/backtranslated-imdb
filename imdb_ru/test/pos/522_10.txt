I like to see Linda Blair playing in a real horror movie again. I was disappointed with it in almost everything, starting with the films “The Exorcist” (which I loved). What happened to all those nasty "B-movies" she made? <br /> <br /> David Hasselhoff, on the other hand, all I could do was laugh. He doesn't want to be a horror movie actor. David must stick with "Knight Rider" or "Baywatch." <br /> <br /> All around, this is a great movie. Even for the eighties, it was a great movie. He has horror, action and drama. This is a tense wait, and I liked the way Linda Blair turned out.
