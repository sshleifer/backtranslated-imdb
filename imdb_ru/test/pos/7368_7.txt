I recently bought this film for three dollars on a sale in the garage, and although I am glad that I did not have to pay the usual $ 19.99 for this DVD, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the film was. <br /> <br /> It was created as an anthology of horror, divided into 5 stories, including the story of the "connector", which tells about four teenagers whose car breaks a dark, solitary road in the middle of the night. Apparently, these kids like scary stories, because this is what they decide to do until the morning - they tell terrible stories around the fire. Each character in turn tells a story, after which their own story turns into a pleasant little twist. <br /> <br /> The first story, “Hook,” is a waste of time, a bit dull and dull. Fortunately, this is not one of the main stories and lasts maybe 5 minutes. It is intended simply to present the film, and it is easy to lose sight of the non-originality of this work. <br /> <br /> The second story, Honeymoon, well, okay. It's about - you guessed it - two people on their honeymoon! They travel by RV heading to Las Vegas. They decide to stop somewhere for the night, but the mysterious stranger quickly warns them to leave the location or risk being attacked by some dangerous, unknown creatures. This story has a pretty good setting, but just “good.” In fact, before the monsters appear, this is quite funny and mysterious, then it’s just a little unreliable. <br /> <br /> The third story “People can lick too” is my personal favorite. This concerns a young girl whose parents go out for the night, and the elder sister throws her to a party. So, she is going to be alone - this is a fact about which she tells her friend on the Internet. The trouble is that internet buddy? This is not exactly a thirteen year old girl. The conclusion of this story is a little less climatic than I would like to see, but still damn good. <br /> <br /> The final story "Medallion" is definitely filled with the atmosphere itself. Located in a creepy mansion on a dark rainy night, this is a story about a young man (played by Glenn Quinn!) Who travels on a motorcycle that stumbled upon this house just at the moment when he had problems with his bike. He meets a dumb girl who lives in the house and falls in love with her at first sight. Unfortunately, not everything is in order, and this may be due to the fact that the medallion is hanging on her beautiful neck ... <br /> <br /> After the stories are wrapped, we are presented with a turn with the participation of four teenagers in the car, the turn that, when looking back, was supposed to be obvious, but which he really did not expect, and this is a rather pleasant conclusion for the film. <br /> <br /> So all in general, a good movie. Rent it if you can, because, unfortunately, I don’t think it is important for re-viewing. But next time you'll be in the mood for a vaguely scary little movie in the same spirit as “Tales on the Dark Side” or something like that, take this film and some popcorn, turn off all the lights and treat yourself to this amazingly elegant little flick.
