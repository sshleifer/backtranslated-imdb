I really liked this film, which in many ways, as Hitchcock did on several occasions, was the first attempt at a conspiracy, which he recast later in his career. Perhaps the most surprising thing about this is how faceless the main characters are. After viewing, you can remember Murray Alper as a cheerful truck driver, Von Glaser’s turning as a blind “patriot”, an unforgettable strange strange show and, of course, Otto Kruger as a courteous and sophisticated villain, all of whom completely overshadow Bob Cummings as a rather wooden fugitive ( Compare this jump on the bridge with a similar trick by Harrison Ford in Andrew Davis’s The Fugitive) and Priscilla Lane, whose change of heart and subsequent love of Cummings are never quite plausible. <br /> <br /> The other main supporting player, of course, is Hitchcock himself, who plays the film with two unusual tricks. Many criticize old films for lack of realistic special effects. I feel that in the absence of technology, even an attempt to convey what the director wants to show is an amazing achievement. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this film carries an anti-fascist message made during World War II, but being Hitchcock, this is never the most important thing, and the emphasis is always on action. Worth checking out, especially for support roles.
