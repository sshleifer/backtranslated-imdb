Hilary was great, like Julie, and Pat was great again, like Mr. Miyagi, but there should have been more references to the other three films! I mean, come on! First, where is Daniel!? Miyagi mentions him very briefly and that's it. Daniel was his best friend and, at least, should have appeared in the film. He could help Miyagi train Julia-san! On the other hand, the music remained faithful to the film, although with a small amount of instruments (Fretless Bass) to accompany the well-played Pan-Flute! It’s not like a karate movie if you don’t hear this pan flute! Thank you, Zamfir! Overall, although a decent movie! We miss you, Noriyuki!
