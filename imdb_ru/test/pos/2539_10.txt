The violent death of Fernando Ramos da Silva, just eight years after the completion of this film, only intensifies the sharpness of the strong message of the director B. B. Benko. The film is divided into two parts - the first in the reformer, where a group of young people is subjected to violence and violence by law enforcement officers and guardians. The second background is a city in which they are instead limited to their own actions and morals, which includes robbery, pimping and killing the different characters that enter their lives. <br /> <br /> Different gender and sexual roles in the film allow for constant changes in the characters when they interact with other people. Particularly interesting is the character of Lalique, a transvestite who is the mother and lover of some children. Her reaction to the arrival of Suely, a prostitute, is both acute and tragic. <br /> <br /> This story has no happy ending, and I recommend watching it with caution, because there are some very uncomfortable scenes, especially in the first twenty minutes. But while watching it is important to remember that this is not just a made-up story. The actors are not professionals, but boys selected on the streets of SÃ£o Paulo. They really lived this life, which was so vividly portrayed on the screen, and in the case of da Silva, they died at the hands of the police, who were so cruelly portrayed. Documentary? A piece of fiction. It borders on both, but it certainly makes heart-rending material and a film that actually makes you gasp and think long after watching. <br /> <br /> 10/10
