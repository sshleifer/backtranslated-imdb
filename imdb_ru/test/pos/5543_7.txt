First, don't be fooled by my last name. My mom was a purebred Italian, so I really know Italian families, and I LOVE gangster films, even as funny as this one. <br /> <br /> For those who have knocked badly in this film (you know who you are), you must have the privileges in the cinema, because you do not know what is good. It's a damn funny and well thought out movie. As I understand it, the fact that almost no one in it is Italian is part of the joke. And what a redhead man could complain about having spent an hour and something like that with Michelle Pfiffer? Puh-rental! When I saw this movie, he captivated me with the introductory song of Rosemary Clooney, which was as Irish as possible, but her pronunciation of the Italian words in “Mambo Italiano” is perfect and sets the tone for what should follow perfectly. (Damn, I even bought the record the next day because of her.) Only the look of each bright thing in the apartment that I personally saw in the homes of my relatives, although not in the same place (which I found hysterical), sold it to me . <br /> <br /> This film is like Goodfellas on merry gas. I just wonder why there are no burger worlds and what happened to the food these guys were supposed to get? I think the crew ate it. "Crispy French fries. Shake creamy." My mouth waters almost as much as he thinks of the gorgeous Miss Pfiffer. (In any case, I never trusted clowns.) And the three best things in this film are that the amazingly funny mafia wife Mercedes Rühl turned away, Dean Stockwell, like her offended husband Tony "Tiger" and, finally, but not last of all, the great robbery of Oliver Platt, who should get more comic roles. And notice to yourself: find out where this black chick went. Oh! Why does she work so rarely? This picture is right next to great movies for mobs, as it should be.
