Based on a true story about Christopher Boise (Hutton) and Donton Lee (Penn), as well as their involvement in the sale of classified US government documents to the Soviets in the 1970s. Boyes works for the government, and his job is to protect these specific documents, which ultimately disappoint him in the affairs and practice of his country. He then recruits his friend, a drug dealer, Dalton Lee, who became a wanted man, a courier for these sensitive documents. Lee enters the Russian embassy in Mexico and comes into contact with Alex (Suchet), and they both start playing a spy game. <br /> <br /> Lee is interested solely in money as long as Boyce acts out of anger towards the system in which he participates. Alex believes that Lee is a man within the American government. Things start to become erratic when Lee's addiction and reckless behavior in dealing with the courier's position are compensated for by both Alex and Boyce. Lee becomes more paranoid, and the initial spy game becomes more deadly and important for all participants. <br /> <br /> This is a real spy thriller without stupid actions. Characteristic motives and analysis of real objects are sympathetic, but very well written, and the film cleverly intertwines real events with the main political themes about the predatory behavior of a person. Where a large nation uses its political power to control smaller nations. Well directed and intense piecemeal, especially where the main characters are immensely above the head in a spy game. Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn give amazingly exciting performances in a film that questions authority, and yet there is no simple answer to the political message or the complexity of this system. The plight of the main characters becomes the main message in Falcon and Snowman and makes it a clever political thriller with a sharp element about society, human relations and the American system. A great movie! <br /> <br /> **** 1/2 of *****!
