I saw the movie when I was in class a few years ago in high school. I thought it was a thought-provoking film that made you want to look into the power of riddles. I think that people who do not like this film will be those who do not like to solve problems, or those who are upset when they cannot solve riddles. This is a good movie based on a true story that happened in my hometown of Toronto, Ontario. so if you need a real record of what's going on in the alleys, watch this movie. And those who only watch movies in order to point out gaps in the plot and shortcomings of the characters understand that the same happens in real life. but that's all I want to say about this. Riddles are good, some are complex, some are not. But the film also makes you want more, more puzzles, more explanation, just more. Another thing I want to add is that the ideas in this film, the underground world of mysteries, exist, but there is a lot more. To find it, you cannot search for it. Never search for it, it would be impossible to find it. Leave your mark and he will find you.
