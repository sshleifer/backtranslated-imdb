It was a very sandy film about anti-Semitism. However, unlike the GENTLEMEN AGREEMENT (which also deals with anti-Semitism), the film is well aged and does not look tough. In other words, this is a topic that does not look like a sermon or a banality by today's standards. <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan plays one of the nastiest characters, beating a guy to death just because he is Jewish. Robert Mitchum plays an investigator trying to sort out this crime. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the film for its rude and unshakable look at hate. In many ways, this is an example of the film Noir - although the topic is not about ordinary gangsters or robberies.
