This is the best horror movie this year. “House of Wax” is one of the worst films I've ever seen. This version really puts a shameful version of the Vincent Price movie. I know only a few young actors in the film. Restless Paris Hilton; the pain is that you know what seems more seductive than ever. At least, she did not try to copy her disgrace. Well, if she likes to do horrors, she’s better than Bath of White's Wheel of Fortune. She wins the Bath HANDS DOWN! And the scene where the House of Wax was made was not a joke. The house was made of wax, and the victims could get out of there before they were waxed, like their friends. These two twins Bo and Vincent (twisted twins) were maniacs from the very beginning. Parents raised them well, except for Vincent. And I think they have become equally distorted. Why one in another pickup turned out to be creepy, but not as bad as the other two. This is another story in the book. I guess he should have followed his heart, not the other twins, who turned Ambrose into a tourist "trap" for unsuspecting victims. This film as "The Phantom of the Opera" meets the "Rocky Horror Horror Show". And this film is one of the worst in 2005! Rated 4 out of 5 stars.
