I have already given my comment on this film called BruceV3. Now under BruceV13 I want to add something! Now, after a long time, I have seen many so-called heroic bloody titles! But not many approach the action shown in the films of John Woo! That is why, after all these years, I think it is strange that China White does not receive the credit it deserves! No matter which version you saw! Action at the highest level! The landscapes of China Town in Amsterdam are very unique. It seems that this is a big area. But living in Amsterdam, I know that this is only a small part of the red light district, in which there are many Chinese shops and restaurants! But because of the way they shot the film, it actually looks like a big and important territory, where people know that you shouldn't mess with the triads (the Chinese mafia)! In addition, “China White” is an exciting gangster drama with a good acting game! For this I must pay tribute to Russell Wong! It is a pity that we have not seen him lately, because he has great potential! Must watch a movie!
