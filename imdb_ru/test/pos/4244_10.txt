“Bride of Chucky” is one of the best horror films that has appeared in the last ten years, and can become one of the best horror films of the 90s. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Chucky's girlfriend, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), can find his battered remains after sucking the fan at the end of the third part and reviving him in his trailer park. Her neighbor, Jessie (Nick Stabile) and her friend Jade (Katherine Heigl) are tortured by her uncle. (John Ritter) Tiffany upsets Chucky when he refuses to marry her, so she buys a doll for him to play with her. Chucky kills Tiffany, and then translates her soul into a doll, which she received. To be placed in human bodies again, they must go to New Jersey to get the amulet for this. Jesse sees this as an opportunity to escape from Ritter, and they embark on a journey, but not before Ritter kills Chucky and Tiffany. Along the way, several strange incidents force them to stay in bed and breakfast. When several more people are killed, they call their best friend (Gordon Woolvette) to correct the situation. They convince him that none of them is a murderer, as the police began to uncover the crime. He finds Ritter's body in the trunk behind the van. Thinking that he was created, he confronts them about it. Chucky and Tiffany become real to prove that they did it, which killed Woolvette. The group hijacks a motor home and arrives at the cemetery. Jesse and Jade make Chucky and Tiffany turn on each other, giving them enough to run away. Chucky takes away Jade and makes her take his amulet. Chucky and Tiffany renew their enmity, which gives Jesse and Jade plenty of time to kill them both when the police arrive and cleanse them of their crimes. <br /> <br /> Good news: I have to give the greatest amount of props to the FX department, like Chucky and Tiffany, how dolls look completely convincing. The scenes with them are the main points of the movie, including a lively conversation in which Tiffany advises Chuckie how serial killers work in the 90s. However, the number of one-liners in this film, which are actually ridiculous, is incredible. Chucky gets the most of them, but Tiffany also smashes a few gems. It's actually funnier than what Hollywood calls comedies these days. The mountain is plentiful and shockingly realistic. Several deaths in this film are in fact original and creative. Ritter’s transformation into a new Pinhead shape was an absolutely brilliant scene. The newlywed couple was also a good death scene. For teenage love, Stabile and Heigl are a great combination. They have excellent chemistry together, and they behave like a regular couple. I also have to admit that the first time I saw this film, I jumped during certain scenes, and this shows that the incredible director Yu did. Obviously, he had learned enough to do the same with Freddy vs. Jason. He knows how to organize settings and payouts, and here he shows some excellent skills that have Hong Kong style and style. He could be the next great horror director, if he continued to replenish his resume with such films. A good soundtrack, for example, "Freddy vs. Jason." <br /> <br /> Bad news: for fans of funny movies, this will be a great find. However, this movie has a high cheese factor that can prevent a serious horror movie fan from having a good time enjoying this movie. The film knows that this is a trashy movie, and enjoys it, forcing a serious fan to disconnect because of such things as one-liners. This is not so bad in the film, but you need to look in your mind that this is a funny film, and that the lightness of certain scenes adds to the film, but does not remove it. Remove yourself from this state of mind, and you may like this movie. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: fans of raw films and other films "Children's Game" will like a lot of this movie. For serious horror fans, take a look at this, but keep in mind that this is not a serious movie, and that there should be a fun one, and you might like it. <br /> <br /> Rated R: Graphic violence, graphic language, brief nudity on a doll, a grim scene of puppet sex, the use of certain drugs and numerous references to drugs.
