I am really surprised that this film only had a rating of 6.4 at the time when I was doing this review. Although this is not a very good film, I think it is one of the best films shot by Dietrich and, unfortunately, it is not so highly valued. I think the reason why I liked the film so much is that the usual stupid person Dietrich, like über-vamp, doesn’t, and her role required her to really act. I just hate to watch a movie after a movie in the first days of my career, when she seemed more like a caricature or cliche than a real woman. I don't necessarily blame Dietrich for the stupid vampire films she made in the 1930s — the audience loved them and they really made her famous. But here she showed she could really act. In the end, just looking at her in films such as MOROCCO, BLONDE VENUS and THE BLUE ANGEL, who would have thought that she played the role of a gypsy perfectly! I was quite willing to hate the film because of this casting decision, but it worked - it was pretty believable and very fun to watch! The film, in fact, is a means only for Ray Milland and Marlene Dietrich - other minor characters are very secondary to the film. Milland is a wanted spy in Germany before the Second World War, and in his attempts to escape he encounters a rather frisky lonely gypsy woman (Dietrich) who instantly perceives him as the fulfillment of prophecy - in other words, his new lover! Milland is quite sultry, but reluctantly agrees to travel in his van - even puts paint on the body and pierces his ears to make him look like a gypsy (hence the name of the film). Over time, he gradually begins to realize that under her very uncouth appearance pretty woman, and romance slowly blossoms. <br /> <br /> The movie is “charming”. A good affair with a good share of comedy and fun is just the kind of picture you would like Hollywood to still do. Also pay attention to the performance of Murvin Wai in the role of "Zoltan". He was very attractive in the short time that he starred in the film, and I just liked his deep and beautiful voice. <br /> <br /> Finally, a sad note worth considering. While the film is in Germany, nothing is said about the upcoming Gypsy Holocaust. During the war, throughout the whole of Germany, the Nazis killed a huge percentage of Roma, and thus the final pleasant ending of the film was a bit contrived.
