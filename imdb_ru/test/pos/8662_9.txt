The Bothersome Man is one of the best foreign films I've ever seen. All technical aspects, in my opinion, are impeccable (lighting, acting, directing, stimulation, etc.). HISTORY is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> It seems that after death our main character lives in a world in which there is no beauty, passion or something remotely pleasant for human perception. His work is cold and uninteresting; his relationship is numb and boring, and when things get too much, he tries to finish it in front of the train. But this is not the end - he can not leave this strange world through suicide! Returning to the man who seemed to feel the same lonely and lonely, our main character joins him during the excavation of the stone wall in the hope of uncovering the source of the strange and wonderful smell and music. Just as they break through - and I will not reveal IT much, everything ends, and the film ends as strange as it began. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that you will love this film or hate it. I feel that this is like a magical poem, open to many different interpretations, and all of them are just as relevant as the following. If you like new impressions of the film and you want to be removed from the Hollywood holiday, try this movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10 (and I don't appreciate it easily!), because, despite its darkness, this film left me with a feeling of something more ... something mysterious and beyond. Well done!
