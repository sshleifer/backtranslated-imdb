Buster Keaton was perhaps the most enjoyable when filming short 20-minute films, and they do not seem more ridiculous than this stone. The dead man comedian is involved in photographic confusion with the wanted criminal. This leads to his carefully considered evasion of several street policemen and fellow travelers who recognize his face on the basis of "Wanted." The Goat is a chocolate with glittering jokes, starting with the first scene in the bread line and ending with a wonderful lift chase at the end. Keaton's film never seems to be missing its silence, since sound is never what you need with it. His films explain themselves through the amazing (but incredibly dangerous) things he did for himself. It is not difficult to understand how influential he really was - this man is just as amazing today as in 1921.
