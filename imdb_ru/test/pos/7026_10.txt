I have to admit that before I watched this film, I thought that this is one of those deplorable love stories where everything works beautifully and beautifully. but I was mistaken when I sat down to see it. I found that it was actually a really good story about a family that goes to the dance park for a three-week vacation, and there the younger daughter, the baby, finds love, but has difficulties with her new love because of disagreement with her father. But in this way, another dance instructor helps and risks the whole situation ... A real spiritual film, like no other. <br /> <br /> 10/10
