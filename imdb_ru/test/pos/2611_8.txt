Assi McGee is an uncontrollable fierce detective based on countless examples from the police dramas of the late 20th century. The highlight is that Assi is literally walking buttocks. <br /> <br /> The cheap, low forehead of the facade of the show refutes his cunning and hidden satire. This does not mean that Assi is deprived of drunken jokes, just toilet humor is used economically enough to cause constant laughter, and not groans and gags. The sequence of the program headers demonstrates the smart, subtle humor used throughout. The sequence consists of panning photographs of the city on a jazz policeman of the 70s. One photo shows a police cruiser, and the “camera” enlarges the front license plate holder, which is free. The senseless increase saturates the production of the typical police drama of the 70s and 80s and, by the way, makes me laugh every time. <br /> <br /> All typical characters included: upset police chief who cannot control Assy; a faithful minority partner that hinders Assa’s recklessness; the usual cops who hate the means of Assi ... they are all taken into account, and they are all funny satires of the typical police drama. <br /> <br /> Voicing, mostly performed by Larry Murphy, is nothing but spectacular. Assy's voice - hoarse and gruff with a bit of a drunken insult - is so clever and unique that he is ranked among such great people as Stewie Griffin (Family Guy) and Homer Simpson (Simpsons). Although the voice is unintelligible, diction is somehow clear and easy to understand. This is a nice change from other Adult Swim voices, which often require subtitles for understanding. <br /> <br /> In addition to the fantastic production and sound, the script is also fun. The direct straightness of Assi feeds most of the humor, especially in his communication with citizens who are not part of the police force. <br /> <br /> If you have access to Adult Swim comedies, Assi McGee is definitely worth a look. Each episode lasts only 8-9 minutes, so you really have nothing to lose.
