The three shorts included in this collection, released in 1959, are a classic of Chaplin, timeless, there is nothing wrong with them and there is nothing to criticize. Chaplin's rating for these films and the frame added as connecting sections between the shorts are also well made. The problem with this compilation is minor but annoying. The shorts were stretched to fit 24 frames. the speed of modern films, while the shorts themselves were shot at 20 frames. The result is a dramatic move that does not look very attractive, and yet it was an excuse decision, given the limitations of optical printing technology at the time, it’s just possible that the current DVD version is not restored, the films look dirty as they were in 1959 and before so far printed. There are separate recovered versions of these classic works, even on DVD, and restoring the image will not be a problem, but, alas, this did not happen. <br /> <br /> A minor push took up a lot of space in my article, but again I’m saying a little niggle, it shouldn’t distract all of this from experience, although it didn’t distract one point from my rating. The shorts are still "10".
