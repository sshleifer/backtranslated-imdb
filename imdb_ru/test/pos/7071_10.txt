Sorry if I'm wrong, but "Cronica para un desayuno" may be one of the coolest films in Mexican cinema history for many reasons. We can get a lot of ingredients for the perfect Mexican family breakfast for the middle class: a cup of surrealistic Bunuel motifs with a small drop of ripstenian abandoned scenarios; a pound of phallus characters around the film and a complex psychological complexity, more than Todd Solond’s Happiness and Dogma films. It has a lot of dirt, black humor, repressed dreams (Theodoro’s dream of a fly), incestuous lack of control (the relationship between Marcos and Lusma), parallel stories without meaning, discrete violence, anachronisms and a small sign of hope (highlighted in Luzma, returning her husband home and "Un poco Mas", used for the keynote). Marcos (Bruno Bichir) is a charming character (I think in Bukos), a king without a crown, who waits for nothing but broken noses. Luzma (Maria Rojo), an attractive wife, laid out many faces, but the only thing she was worried about was that her sons had breakfast; in many ways, she is a loser and sensual, but you will fall in love with her. Dragging a soundtrack (too much forest) feeds a lack of technical merit, deliberately, of course: defocused shots, lighted close-ups (in introspective scenes), dizzying panoramas and sudden cuts in the publication. Crónica is something that is difficult to digest, it is stuck in the throat, and everything that helps it. It tastes bitter, like rotten orange juice, and sour, like expired milk, but you want to enjoy it. Therefore, I recommend to buy Melox before the show, because you are not hungry.
