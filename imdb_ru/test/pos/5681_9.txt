I put this film, not expecting much, except the festival of films Gore. Fortunately, they gave me a very well-made film that created tension and managed to keep it during the whole time of its performance. It was an impressive achievement. The game was flawless, creating characters that you cared about and who were related to; and while some may find the film slow, it made you think about what you would do in the same situation. In addition to this, there was a good job with the camera, and the directors put it all together perfectly. This is an excellent effort worth the time, if you prefer development and expectation, not blood.
