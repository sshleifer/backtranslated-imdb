First, I must say that this film is much less pretentious than the Da Vinci Code. Of course, you have the problem of religion against science, but it is not trying to make a big statement about it. it is basically an action movie that moves very well from one scene to another. Especially one scene (which includes fire), I found very well done. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the transition from book to movie. Although when I followed the development of the film, I complained about changing some characters and completely removing others, I must admit that I was wrong. it was refreshing that the film did not follow the book in the same way as it was in Da Vinci. if you are a book cleaner, some of them may upset you. However, BIG TWIST is still there, so don't worry about it. Finally, I'm glad they removed some stupid subplots and didn't even try to hint at the possibility of combining Langdon and Vittoria. <br /> <br /> The performances are really good, but nothing unusual. this is normal for such a movie. <br /> <br /> I would give 9/10, mainly because it gives what it promises, entertainment, pure entertainment
