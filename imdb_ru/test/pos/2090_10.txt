Strongly recommended to all those who appreciate watching movies. Great acting, completely surreal awkward humor, necessary prison, a precise description of the male state. The music is also accurate. I think the artist is "deep," but not sure. The short loop of the title song in the DVD menu is timely and sounds like Slint.
