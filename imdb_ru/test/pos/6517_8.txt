This film was dedicated to a young woman who prays to help her family and friends when they face difficulties in life. It made me think about other films, such as “The Song of Bernadette” and “Francis of Assisi”, and has a very strong influence of the Catholic faith in the film. Ann Blythe is very charming at first, a student at a Catholic school, and then a young girl who buys the statue of St. Anne (by the way, this is the name of the street where I live) and prays a lot for holy intercession whenever problems arise in her life. Frances Bavier (Aunt Bee from Andy Griffith's show) and Edmund Gwenn (from Miracle on 34th Street) play her relatives. One of my local priest said that my sister looked like Ann Blyth, and they both have the same name and patronymic. Good good family movie, which came from an era when life was a little easier.
