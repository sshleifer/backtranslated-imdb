I love Aaron Carter, but even I expected the pop star to be predictable, but I was so wrong! Aaron Carter was really fun at this and a great actor! Also the actress who played Jane was a brilliant actress! Anyone who hasn't watched him loved him! <br /> <br /> The music in it was also very good! <br /> <br /> My favorite lines from the movie: â€œYou can't send me mom from a public school! I am CELEBRIDEE !! "and" Take your time, it will come to you! "<br /> <br /> Even though the ending sounds silly, all the good chick releases do! This movie is great and Chick's good movie that I can watch again again!
