This is a forty-minute film that introduces us to the Butcher character, which will later be discussed in more detail in the film “Seoul Counter Tous.” In this film, he follows the early period of his life from 1965-1979, but focusing on the late seventies. The first images are the slaughter of a horse, then the birth of a child, a butcher's daughter, which we quickly see growing every year. The Butcher (played by Philip Nahon in both films) is a bitter man to the whole world. He hates a lot of things. His anger comes to mind when a man attacks his autistic daughter. Then the Butcher cripples the wrong person and ends up in prison. <br /> <br /> This film follows the life of a butcher until he is released from prison, and Seoul Counter-Tous takes over. At first I watched the movies wrong, first Seoul Counter Tu. Try to watch this little movie first, if you can.
