I did not have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn. I don’t know why I keep buying these slasher films when I know they are the same all the time. Maybe I'm a little masochist? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, nothing original. Yes, this is a small group of teenagers who go to the woods in the camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they are killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? This is just magic! This is one of the best experiences that I had when I watched the movie "Slasher." Places where it is removed, so beautiful. You see mountains, waterfalls, rocky mountains. This is just awesome. It will take a very long time (except for the initial scene) before the killer starts to kill, but I didn’t care! It was nice to watch enough not to care. I mean that you will not sit and wait for the killings to start, because everything that happens brings pleasure because of the beauty of the film itself. The ending is a bit strange, but I won't talk about it anymore. You will understand what I mean. One more thing that I liked: you care about the characters. This is not just a group of assholes who spend time aiming at each other. Of course, these are pure stereotypes of ordinary slashers, but there is something special about them. In any case, this is a great horror movie, and I hope you had a good time watching it, because I really did it!
