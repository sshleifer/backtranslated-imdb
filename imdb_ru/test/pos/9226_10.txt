That's what you should remember about this movie .... This is a children's movie !!!!! I do not know about you, but I am a child of the 80s. I was obsessed with Rainbow Brite. So naturally, I love this movie. But if you watch other Rainbow Brite movies, then this movie is definitely the best. But, as I said, this is a children's film. You have to judge this as a child film. For children, it does not matter, a fantastic or even a good game, animation or script. All they care about is what happens to the characters. If a good guy (or girl) wins, this is a great movie. If not, then this is bad. You all know what I mean. You were once children.
