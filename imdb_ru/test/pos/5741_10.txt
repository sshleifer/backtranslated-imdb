My partner and I sat down to watch this movie over a bottle of wine last Saturday, and although we had reservations from the very beginning, as soon as the story began, it was actually quite exciting. The scene in which one of the characters was brutally killed by knitting needles was particularly shocking and echoed the work of the Korean author of the new wave, Park Chan Wook. The weapon of choice was a special masterstroke, which allowed us to look into the psyche of "Grandmother", greatly turning the connotation of a loving, warm grandmother into a murderous witch. The dialogue was incredibly touching and lyrical, expressing the inner paranoia of the protagonist. Moreover, the chosen stage of Pavloski reinforces the nervous and maneuverable atmosphere of nightly events, in combination with Oscar-worthy performances create a masterpiece that makes you think. The final, which I will not spoil you here, reminded my partner and me of M. Night Shyamalan's institutional masterpiece The Sixth Sense, because it is a mind-altering turn that made me think weeks after watching. Definitely one to watch, repeatedly!
