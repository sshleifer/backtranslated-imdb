Gilly, a Telugu "Okkadu" remake, fortunately, is a refined version of the original. He packs the same punch, and Dharani, faithful to his cinematic brilliance, conveys it with style and grace. Noting the career of Vijay with the advent of the likes of Surya and Vikram in a fight, he got a much-needed boost with this film. This may well be the best movie that Vijay has ever been in, given the choices he has made since then. The industrious actor seems to have lost his composure with the talented recruits accepted by both the industry and the public. <br /> <br /> A closely boring scenario that works at a neck break rate revolves around Velu, a strong-willed youth trying to make a mark in the game Kabaddi (a popular game among boys in India). Events after a chance encounter with Muthupandi, his rescue of a girl in need and how he juggles with the aspirations of his friends and his own, forms a foothold and end movie. Vijay fits like a “T” in the role and delineates a muffled and believable image of a boy next door. <br /> <br /> Trisha has more than the stereotypical Tamil heroine of the mantle. The role is much more complicated than just a girl in need. With a limited number of conversations, Trisha uses his muted expressions and subtle vulnerability to add colors to the role. This is a classic case when a cover girl comes of age and becomes a professional actress. Trisha became my personal favorite after this film. <br /> <br /> The film ends with predictable lines, although we must pay tribute to the director for making the audience guess many things, including changing Trisha in his decision to leave the country. Prakash Raj deserves praise for providing the perfect counterbalance to the role of Vijay. His almost indomitable status as a villain and the obvious cracks in the hero's armor create an ideal trick for guessing viewers. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great movie that deserves at least one viewing. I give it clearly 8 out of 10.
