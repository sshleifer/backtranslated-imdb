She is cool. it was funny, original and made me laugh so hard that I almost wet my place. On that day, when I went to see him in a movie, I was not in the best mood (problems with a person), but after I left the movie, I had a smile on my face. The plot is a bit like no one notices that she looks too much like a girl, but hey, who am I to say that itâ€™s plausible, the jokes are great and some of the liners in this 2006 hit can go down in history. Amanda B. did an excellent job with the lead role, and Channing Tatum looks too good to be true, as opposed to the magnificent duke. So girls go for it, because it's a big laugh, and there is a cool guy in it, and guys, you go for it, because you can just find out something about girls! <br /> <br /> In general, a brilliant, fantastic and funny film that I will buy on DVD when it comes out.
