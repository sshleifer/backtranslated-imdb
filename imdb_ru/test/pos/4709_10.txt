Of course, this proves beyond any doubt that Patricia Arquette is who she was promoted: ACTRESS! This is undoubtedly her best moment in acting, and she certainly deserves credit for her work. Never in her other films, with the possible exception of a holy marriage, was she completely believable and genuine. <br /> <br /> Plot: a young woman finds herself in Southeast Asia and suddenly falls into the political chaos of the countryside. She is a witness of mass killings, totalitarianism and flees. <br /> <br /> This is one movie that you MUST see or have not seen all the best Hollywood movies. I rate it as 58 in the top 100 films of all time. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Bob
