The only thing that can be said about TIME RUN is the fact that this is a very smart movie. It is interesting to note that the authors of the film are French, which may explain the film’s “unusual” atmosphere, since it does not quite correspond to what is commonly called “Hong Kong cinema”. <br /> <br /> The film tells about a thief who plans to take revenge on some criminal types with the help of an equally intelligent policeman. But first, he must convince the cop to join his personal crusade, and therefore a series of games begins in which the thief maneuvers the cop into his plan. <br /> <br /> Pretty smart movie. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this film or reviews of other foreign films).
