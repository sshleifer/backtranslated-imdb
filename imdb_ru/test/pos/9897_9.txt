I was also lucky to see “Departure” with Peter Falk at the Phoenix Film Festival. This is an extremely sweet character-driven film that leaves the audience excited about Applebaum’s fate in life. More than funny, every character in the family brings invaluable comic relief, which not only stimulates laughter, but also causes some joyful tears. Peter Falk was born to play this role. He plays a 90-year-old “young” father of three children, who brings his adult children together, which may be one of the most important moments in his life. The two-day journey that the Appelbaum family makes on the amazing backdrop of New York (with carefully selected characters) not only leaves the audience wanting more, but also feeds their sense of family. “Departure” is a film that must be watched not only to everyone who cherishes the family, but also to those who do not like it !!! I thank the director who took the opportunity to bring this GIFT to his audience. Robin Sly, Scottsdale, Arizona
