David Cronenberg’s films are easily recognizable, or at least the elements of the film stand out as his trademarks. Fetishism, blurring between organic and inorganic, soft pulsating things that should not be soft and pulsating. “EXistenZ” is a classic Cronenberg. In short, we are talking about future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, visual effects are provided by your mind. The game connects directly to the “bioport” at the base of your spine, and during the game the player cannot distinguish reality from the game. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the game developer, navigating marketing novice Jude Law at all game paces. While in the game, they reveal strange events and possible crimes. But are they real or is it a game? Even the author of the game does not know. <br /> <br /> The film is a real pleasure, allowing the viewer to be busy, but in the dark until the last minutes. Another thing that I like about eXistenZ is that it does not use a strong dependence on special effects, and the story itself is driven by a movie. Recommended for Saturday evening when science fiction is needed.
