I have loved this film since I first saw it many years ago. I'm not sure how many times I saw it, maybe 10, maybe 20. The last time I watched it, I was struck by a detail that I had not noticed before. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the picture, the killed heroes return to the city by sleigh. There are several close-ups of the dead. Most of all I was struck by a shot of a young blonde. All that you see on the screen is his profile from head to hand. His hands are holding a flickering candle. The wind is blowing, and his thick blond hair is dancing in the wind, consonant with the flickering of the candle flame. The contrast between death and lost life is incredibly strong. Moving hair and a candle flame remind us of the life force that once inhabited his body. <br /> <br /> Every time I return to this film, I see something new.
