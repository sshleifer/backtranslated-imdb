As a child from the cinema, I will not soon forget one of the trilogies dedicated to karate children. You can record Ralph / Daniel as much as you want, but the main thing in films is that it is important to be respectful to all creatures, big and small, but to stand up for yourself when time demands it. Returning to the film, it is rather funny, because I saw “Boys Don't Cry” and was really impressed with Hillary Swank’s game, and that evening, scrolling through the sea of ​​channels, I came across the screening of this film. the film, and I did not understand at the time of my first viewing of this film that it was in it. The story tells about Julie, just like Daniel, not knowing where to fit, and whether she wants to fit into it, and led the teacher-teacher to help put it in order and guide. I really liked this addition to the series, as it gave a good female side of the story, and yes, even some outfits that Hillary was wearing kept me, let's say, stimulated. <br /> <br /> Overall 3.5 out of 5
