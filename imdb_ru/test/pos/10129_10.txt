Radio is the true story of a man who did what he felt was the right thing to do in his heart. The viewer will be forced to wonder what he or she would do. The trouble faced by coach Jones and Radio was tragic and predictable. People did not understand; nor did they want to understand. But, in the end, the force of circumstances made people understand and appreciate much more than before it happened. Radio is a mentally retarded young man who understands very little, except for the three most important things that are too often forgotten as they grow up: intuition, compassion and love. Coach Jones is a high school teacher who cannot ignore the plight of the underdog, who is simply trying to play a bad card hand in the best way possible. It was sad when Coach Jones and Radio met. The practical joke that scared life on the radio was enough to make you want to severely punish not only the boys involved, but every boy who knew what was going on and did nothing with it. However, on the positive side of the scale, this incident led to a friendship that would affect many lives in such a way that most of us believe that only happens in the movies. This film is a true fairy tale not to be missed. Ed Harris was his usual brilliance. Gooding was flawless. Radio is an inspiration.
