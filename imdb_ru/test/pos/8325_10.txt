This BBC series is excellent. I'm not a paleontologist, but this series gives the best historical insight into the dinosaurs I have ever seen. 3D animation and animatronics are very good and make you think that you have traveled to the past. The BBC deserves praise for such an excellent series, like Tim Haines, who must have spent a lot of time to show this series.
