I saw the Director's Cut version and there can be nothing but content. Great game (especially Cole Hauser, I was sad because of the small space for Claudia Black), subtle visual effects and photography in general, a believable plot (given the genre) without many logical holes, really unpredictable turns to the characters. These are the biggest assets of the film. In combination with style - some may consider this film as a B-class effort, but I would not agree with that. All this is really very original and stylish. <br /> <br /> And although I'm not a fan of Vin Diesel, he really liked this cool Riddick boy. I can't wait for the Chronicles of Riddick, it's really great that this film will have a sequel ... <br /> <br /> 9/10 if you ask me
