I would agree with the comments already posted on this site by the previous appraiser. <br /> <br /> I first came across this film back in the 80s when I was working in a psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately, many of the notches aimed at the psychiatric profession really hit the mark. I especially liked the ending, where the psychiatrist spoke through the door to the hospitalized Grodin. Believe me, that's pretty accurate. <br /> <br /> Of course, the doors in most mental hospitals are not locked, and nowadays haircuts are not used, and any hospital MUST have a license for a “soft room”. <br /> But a surprisingly underrated film, and, of course, quite funny. <br /> <br /> jeff
