"One True Thing" is a very quiet film, which was opened in the fall of 1998 for vivid reviews, but with a soft box office. It tells about the disfigured story of Ellen (Renee Zellweger), a workaholic who is forced to return home to take care of his terminally ill mother (Meryl Streep), so that her estranged father (William Hurt) can manage her academic department. These terms are only general. The power of “One True Thing” lies in the fact that the actors raise their characters over the territory of the Hollywood cliche. <br /> <br /> Strip - Kate, the ideal housewife, whose ability to illuminate the room with her charm is evident in her first scenes at a costume party in honor of Hurt's birthday. But Ellen was never close with her mother, and since she graduated from Harvard University, she has certain desires for her — Ellen almost thinks that her mother is a simplified airhead. On the other hand, she admires her father, who shares a particular passion: writing. Ellen writes for an aggressive New York firm, and her heart almost breaks when her last job is frustrated by Hert, who seems to be a very lonely figure. <br /> <br /> To understand how Kate is getting worse Helen's prospects are changing, and she is getting closer to her mother and more distant from her father. It hurts to continue to make excuses not to be there when the family needs him most, and Ellen suggests that he has an affair. In the meantime, she abandoned her desk to spend time working with the cult group of her mother, The Minnies, and also learning that her mother is not as weak as she had first thought. <br /> <br /> Without giving Too Far, “One True Thing” is a masterpiece in learning character. The strip again turns into a beautiful performance, this time working on a subtle level that begins slowly, but ends with a brilliant speech about marriage vows. Streep received his eleventh Academy Award nomination for this performance. It hurts as convincingly as a father who bears a secret, which is not revealed until the last minutes. But this Renee Zellweger is stealing this film. Forget “Chicago,” “Cold Mountain,” “Bridget Jones's Diary,” or whatever you saw her shoot this movie. She is wonderful in that. Working in the bitter resentment of her character on her parents ’understanding, Zellweger manages a realistic image of a young woman struggling to keep her lip while she screams inside.
