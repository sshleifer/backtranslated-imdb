*** SPOILERS *** Despite the fact that the film "They made me a criminal" is nowhere as good as the later classic of antihero John Garfield, such as "Body and Soul" in 1947, "The Power of Evil" in 1948 and his latest and very underrated film “He went all the way” in 1951, it was this film that determined his career from that moment until his untimely death on May 21, 1952 at the young age of 39 years. <br /> <br /> Garfield plays the role of lightweight champion Johnny Bradfield, and then a fugitive from the law of Jack Dorney, who is innocent of the murder for which he was charged, although he was officially declared dead. Johnny Doc Ward’s manager, Robert "Doc" Glekler, who killed Dr McGee John Ridgeley, a reporter during a drunken victory party, who was going to expose to the public that his fighter Johnny Bradfield was lying about the fact that he was a guy from one woman, and Do not drink sissy Doc Glekler smashed a bottle on the head of McGee, killing him, because Johnny was almost drunk, and several women had fun in his hotel room. <br /> <br /> Doc was later killed in a car accident with Johnny Goldie's girlfriend, Ann Sheridan, but Doc burned out, and with his looks, Johnny was mistaken for Johnny. He said he would remain dead and buried by his lawyer Malvin, Robert Strange, who took $ 9,750.00 out of $ 10,000.00 Johnny's money, which he received for this wonderful advice. Malvin told Johnny to take a new identity, call himself Jack Dorney from now on and get out of New York State; talk about mean shisterov. Johnny now Jack Dorney travels on rails from New York to Arizona, ending at the Raifferty Dame Farm Ranch, where most of the film takes place. <br /> <br /> If it were not for John Garfield starring Johnny Bradfield and Jack Dorney, the film would have been long lost and forgotten. Garfield, who at the time was only 26 years old, showed the best of everything in the film. Even carried by Dead End Kids, I think we can call them The Arizona Kids here, the acting was a step above what you expected of them, and they seemed to be real and sensitive people, and not a bunch of jesters like almost all of them films. All this is due to the fact that they were on the same stage or on the set with John Garfield. <br /> <br /> “They made me a criminal” - this is a good story in which the undercover champion behaves as he pleases, but not to draw attention to himself and be not only behind bars, but also on electric the stool. In the end, Jack showed that he was a man, not fighting in a big fight and no matter what, sharply winning at the last moment, but going through four cruel rounds to get money for his new family on the farm, including his girl Peggy, Gloria Dixon, to open with her gas station. <br /> <br /> Giving European champion Gaspar Rutchek, Frank Riggy, the struggle of his whole life and receiving $ 2000.00, or $ 500.00 per round, Jack showed everyone who looked at him as “Children of Arizona “That sometimes the blow was much bolder and bolder than a shot. The fact that Jack could easily strike Ratched, but not to not expose himself to the police, as did the free killer Johnny Bradfield. But instead, he went as far as he could, taking all that Routchek could throw at him to help his friends, showed more than all the fights he won in the boxing ring combined. <br /> <br /> I, for one, did not find the ending of the film far-fetched, but fitting into the story. Policeman Morty Felam, Claude Raines, who came to Arizona from New York to arrest Jack, had to come to terms with the fact that one day he sent an innocent person to an electric chair. We were told all this at the very beginning of the film. Why, knowing that Jack / Johnny was innocent of the murder he was accused of, and not sure if he would be found innocent in court, would he want to make the same terrible mistake again? I easily see how this happens in real life, why not in the movies.
