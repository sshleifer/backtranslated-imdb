"Pink flamingos" - a cult classic. The plot of this film revolves around the defying superiority of the Divine as the dirtiest man of the living. “Pink Flamingos” contains some memorable repulsive scenes, such as a sex scene with a chicken and a scene where the Divine eats fresh dog excrement. Yes, the film is shocking and funny at the same time, but the loudest laughter emanates from the lines of the actors. Especially pay attention to this line from the movie “Deity:“ Kill everyone now! Be reconciled with the first degree murder! »S ***! Dirt is my policy! Dirt is my life! “In general, I really liked this film. However, its slogan“ Bad Taste Exercise ”should be taken to heart, and even those used for everyone. Movies today can find this gem difficult for the stomach. recommended.
