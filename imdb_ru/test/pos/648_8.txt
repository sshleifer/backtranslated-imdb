I found this movie on Netflix and had to add it to my turn. I was not disappointed when I got it, because now he is as funny as when I saw him at the local cinema. <br /> <br /> It is perfect for the climax when you get an idea of ​​the different characters who begin to travel around America on “Honky Ton Freeway, America on Wheels”. It was a strange comedic role for William DeWine, because I remember him as Kennedy in the 1974 television film The October Rocket and I felt that no one could handle this dramatic character as well as he did. <br /> <br /> This reminds me a little of Dick Van Dyck in Cold Turkey, where Van Dyke played the role of local minister. DeWine’s role as mayor, minister and activist was typical for small towns, so his character looks funny and real. <Br /> <br /> Howard Hessman and Teri Garr, as a spoiled family in the RV, were also targeted by everyone. Anyone who has traveled around the country with small children (are we still there?) Will appreciate these scenes. <br /> <br /> The scenes of a small town fighting for survival reminded me a lot of the small city I grew up in, but they treated it with the charm and humor that you often saw only in small cities. Sadly, many small towns have disappeared because of the freeway system, and this gives a realistic, albeit humorous look at what they had to do in order to survive. (Has anyone used zoo animals?) <br /> <br /> In general, this is a light comedy without a special message, but with a humorous look at America in the early 80s. Worth a look if you need some good mood.
