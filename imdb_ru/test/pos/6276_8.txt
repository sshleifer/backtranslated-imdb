The jazz singer is one of a series of films made in the late 1940s and 1950s about Jewish experience in the United States. In addition to Crossfire (1947) and Gentleman's Agreement (1947), which dealt with anti-Semitism, they usually had musical and theatrical education. These films include Jolson's Story (1946), Jolson Sings Again (1949), Eddie Duchin's Story (1951), Eddie Cantor's Story (1953), Benny Goodman's Story (1956) and Margori Morningstar (1958) Leading actors in these "Jewish" films have always been played by non-Jews. For example, the non-Jew Larry Parks played Al Jolson, and Gene Kelly played Noel Pilot in Marjorie Morningstar. This casting was probably done to make the Jewish theme tangible to a non-Jewish audience. The jazz singer (1952) is no different. Danny Thomas was a devout Catholic, and Peggy Lee is certainly not Jewish, although she plays a non-Jewish practitioner in the film. The clue to her story is when she attends the Golding family meal in front of the entrance, she says: "I haven't been to a sage (Easter service) since I left home." <br /> <br /> A film about Cantor's son, who had just left the service, after seeing the action in Korea. His dilemma is whether to become a cantor, a family tradition, or become a singer in a musical theater. His choice of theater leads to inevitable conflict with his father. <br /> <br /> However, this film is much more than this. This film was made after the trial of Rosenberg during the hunt for McCarthy and the Hollywood blacklist. Therefore, in this film, the Jews are shown as good loyal citizens, and <br /> <br /> typical Americans. The synagogue choir will rather play baseball than engage. Cantor friends also talk about baseball, in fact one of them is a Major League judge. The synagogue itself dates back to 1790, and, as they say, George Washington visited it. Therefore, the Jews are represented as an integral part of American society. No one in this film has an Eastern European accent. Peggy Lee has appeared in very few feature films. In this film you will see how she sings "Lover" and "Just one of these things." Danny Thomas is very believable, he plays and sings the part very well. Comedy routines could be omitted. Yes, the film is sentimental and sentimental, but worth seeing. I really liked it.
