Returning to those “good old days” of 1971, we can remember when we were treated in the cinema for the whole season of Charles Chaplin. So the promoter called him when we saw him on someone’s old talk show. (We can't remember whose it was: Merv Griffin or Woody Woodbury, one or the other!) A guest told about Sir Charles’s career and how his films went out of circulation since the exclusion of the first of them in 1952 "Little Tramp ' from Los Estados Unidos on the grounds that he was an “unwanted alien” (No, Schulz, he is NOT from another planet!) <br /> <br /> Charlie was considered “subversive” because of his interest and open research of various political and economic systems. Everything, starting with the anarchist movement of the 20s (and earlier), the fascination with technocracy to social The snake, in its various forms, was a fair game for discussion on Chaplin’s Hollywood parties, which, of course, meant the inclusion of the Soviet style, which we usually call communism. <br /> <br /> CONSTITUTING Mr. Chaplin’s predicament was mixed by one small He never became an American citizen. <br /> <br /> ANYHOW Enough of that background! <br /> <br /> Suffice to say that he became persona Non Gratis in the United States of America. It's time to get old films out of mothballs and go back to the cinema. It would be a great gesture if we could easily forgive and quickly forget about Americans. <br /> <br /> This would be a wonderful gesture for a great filmmaker; In addition, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences planned to honor Chaplin with a special tribute to Oscar Show in 1972. It would certainly have been a deplorable, but joyful package of pathos, because of which America invited Charlie and invited him to come and get a special award for the Academy's lifetime achievements to the global television audience of millions. <br /> <br /> In addition, it would be natural to promote the Chaplin season in the theater! (Remember, Little Tramp was as astute as Buen-Man, just as he was a filmmaker!). and, finally, "Chaplin". We remember that we were very excited in anticipation of a multi-day film festival. <br /> <br /> In our beautiful city of Chicago, he was booked for the Carnegie Theater on Rush Street. The festivities begin in MODERN TIMES, and the rest will be shown one at a time, each stay for the required period to satisfy the public's desire to view each picture. As we remember, the latest in the schedule was the Chaplin Review. <br /> <br /> In RETROSPECT, we look back and want them to start running with the Review; because, of course, there were legions of moviegoers (very similar to us) who knew very little about his achievements in the cinema, with the exception of those "Keystone", "Essanye" and "Mutual silent shorts", which were shown as a normal function on many shows, therefore, many shows of children around the world country. Oh, well, once again, no one consulted with me! <br /> <br /> Concentrating on today's deserved guest film “The Return of Chaplin”, we discovered that in fact there were three separate paintings; meticulously interconnected using Chaplin's (Himself) narration, some animated themes and episodic music (once again written by Chaplin) and some cheerful conversation and serious narration (the same thing by Chaplin). He opens the hearings using some kind of home movie, similar to a film about the construction of Chaplin’s studio in Hollywood, as well as a film made during the rehearsal period in which the director Chaplin demonstrates what he wants to a group of actors. <br /> <br /> This segment was well made and well received by the audience. Both the construction humor and the rehearsal were intensified, making them seem to be accelerated. (Naturally, building rehearsal using camera speeding up the camera process. The old stunt gives the impression that the buildings were almost self-building. <br /> <br /> THIS amalgam of shorts included three short comedies from Chaplin from he worked at First National Pictures; 1917 to 1923. The choice was well thought out and gave us a wide range of themes and moods. <br /> <br /> The first thing was the SHUTTLE WEAPON (Charles Chaplin Productions) / First National Pictures, 1918). As the name suggests, this is a story about World War I, released in October 1918, and until the Armistice Day on November 11 was about a month, it was a comedy with comic jokes of the army and a romance between Private Chaplin and a Frenchwoman (Miss Edna Purvians). Frivolity is quick, physical and in the great old tradition to ridicule the enemy, the German army. <br /> <br /> SHOWING a superb example of an old saying about children and dogs that unite people, the next film LIVING DOGS (Chaplin Productions / First National, 1918) traces the parallel lives of Rolling Stone Chaplin and the recently adopted homeless, Scraps. The film is about families, two of them. One Homo Sapiens, one Canine, and both give us big surprises. <br /> <br /> As a final, we will have THE PILGRIM (Chaplin / First National, 1923), which was a good choice for the final. It was bright, light and tight. It was an excursion to the “Western Parody” district, comedies of this type have since been performed by every comedian and team. The “Pilgrim” in this story is not your standard Thanksgiving variety; rather, "dude" or "tender foot", who ventured to the West. The tramp is not only this guy; but his character is a Convict who escaped, who is mistakenly considered a new priest of a church in a western city! <br /> <br /> OUR rating (i.e. Schulz and I) - ****. (These are four derbies) <br /> <br /> Poodle Schnitz !!
