“It all depends on how you look at it - we are either halfway to heaven, or halfway to hell,” said the priest Rev. Harlan in Northorn. The film of the Polish brothers is an ambitious film that will force any intelligent viewer to sit down if he has the patience and basic knowledge of Christianity. The layers of entertainment offered by the film take the viewer beyond the limits of surrealistic and absurd images that are obvious to less obvious sociopolitical and theological commentaries, which should encourage an unconstrained American to think about current social values. Adopting a surrealistic film (coffins that come from the depths of artificial lakes to swim and interfere with life, homeowners who almost crucify their feet to the wooden floor of their homes, angels who need multiple reading glasses, etc.). ) and absurd images (half of animals, half of living toys, door bells, which are the most delicate of harp music, a blind angel who continues to write unreadable treatises, etc.) can make the viewer unfamiliar with the surrealistic and Absurdist traditions in literature and art wonder what the movie is entertaining as entertainment. Although European cinema has the best powers in this area, Hollywood did make such films in the past in Cat Ball, Lee Marvin and his horse leaned against the wall to take a nap several decades ago. “Northfork” in one of the scenes where citizens leave the city in cars seems to pay homage to a number of cars in “Citizen Kane”, which Kane and his wife take out from Xanadu for a picnic. <br /> <br /> The film is difficult for an uninitiated or impatient moviegoer - the most interesting epilogue (one of the best that I can remember) can be heard as a voice near the end of the credits. Directors seem to leave the best moments to those who can stay with the film to the end. If you have the patience, you can enjoy the layers of the film, if you swallow or swallow what the Polish dish bothers you, you will miss many of its flavors. <br /> <br /> What is the whole movie about? ? At the most obvious level, the city is freed up to make way for the construction of a dam and a hydroelectric power station. Even cemeteries are torn apart so that the dead remains of the dead can be moved to higher burial sites. Real estate agents are looking for real estate on the lake for 6 people who can evict the townspeople. Of 6 people, only one seems to have a conscience, and therefore he can order chicken broth soup, while others cannot serve them. <br /> <br /> On the next level you have Christianity and its interaction with the townspeople. Most of them are devout Christians, but many have a survival instinct at the expense of true Christian principles, of which the priest is an example. Many want to adopt children without taking on the responsibilities associated with such actions. <br /> <br /> At the next level you will discover a world of angels interacting with people close to angels and with each other. You understand that the world of an unknown angel, who keeps a comic book about Hercules and dreams of a mother, finds her in an androgynous angel called “The Flower of Hercules”. While the filmmaker makes it clear that Flower is a continuation of the young angel's delusional imagination, Flower’s subsequent actions disprove this possibility. You are indeed in the world of angels - not gods, but pure in spirit, and therefore not in the world of the living. These pictures show a softer camera focus. <br /> <br /> At another level, Irwin's toy plane becomes a real plane that carries him and his angels to heaven 1000 miles from Norfolk. <br /> <br /> The last layer is a social comment. “The country is divided into two types of people. Ford people and Chevrolet people. Is there any difference? They think they are different, but both are consumers. <br /> <br /> For religious leaders, the film reads: “Pray, and you will receive” (the words of Harlan’s father, quoted by the Angel Flyer Hercules). For the consumer, the film says: “What we do with our wings divides us” (each of the 6 evicters also has wings - one duck / goose feather hidden in their hats, but their actions are often different from the angels, like It was supposed to) various reactions to the scratch on the car). <br /> <br /> This film is certainly not the best American film, but it is definitely an outstanding pioneering work — excellent visual effects, amazing performances (especially Nick Nolte) and a loaded script offering several levels of entertainment for a mature audience.
