This film has won great popularity and as a whole receives much less credits, than it is necessary. It covers a topic that is always present in our daily life, but which is considered as a phenomenon so widespread that it does not deserve discussion. This phenomenon is observed in carers (whether doctors or, as in the “Broken Promise”, a senior social worker) who abuse their position to harm those who are tasked to protect. <br /> <br /> In Broken Promise, Patty Clawson and her family are left by their parents; but soon picked up by local law enforcement. Faced with a certain prospect of foster care, Patty begs a young social worker to keep her, her brothers and sisters together. This social worker appeals to a senior employee of another department, but his request is denied. <br /> <br /> Children are sent to individual homes, thereby following the prevailing views of the day and providing a “clean break”. But it is this event, the “broken promise” that gives the film its name, that causes dramatic tension that will continue throughout the film. Angered by the apparent betrayal of a young social worker, Patty Kloson escapes from the foster family to which she was sent. <br /> <br /> Faced with the daunting task of finding your family in an environment in which the ideal is seen complete separation from the past; she does the only thing she can to find out their whereabouts and bursts into the office of a senior social worker to steal the case. <br /> <br /> She was detained soon after she discovered that she had made a dangerous enemy. The senior social worker is enraged at the embarrassment that this little girl inflicts on him and his department, and decides to use her power and authority to destroy her; what he is legally capable of doing. <br /> <br /> --------------- <br /> <br /> This topic about the dangers of those caring for customers is relatively taboo. This, of course, was touched upon very little in the films, since few directors want to take a path that would imply that educators are hurting. <br /> <br /> I think this film plays a very important role in raising public awareness of this kind of thing. The case presented is not only plausible, but has probably happened many times before with many other children around the world. This film is crucial to changing public opinion in order to get rid of laws that protect harmful people, such as the senior social worker in Broken Promise. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Broken Promise. This is particularly suitable for interns of social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors and other caregivers. This is an avoidance lesson that should be taken to heart. <br /> <br /> ----------- <br /> <br /> From the point of view of the action in the "Broken Promise." "Melissa Michaels plays a great role in the role of Patti Closon. Especially in films like this, credibility is crucial. If the viewer is not identified with the character Patty, the whole point of the film will be threatened. Unfortunately, Melissa is still not filmed today. because her performance in Broken Promise shows that she had exceptional talent.
