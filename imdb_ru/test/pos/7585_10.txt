Horses on Mars are a wonderful journey of very small creatures. There is no need to work hard to keep your attention, and the characters are really memorable. Much of the merit should be given to Eric Anderson for choosing the visual style and writing an interesting story, but Anuj Majumdar also deserves praise for the narrative and the excellent musical score. These choices were obviously not an accident. If you can, look at it in a 35mm scope for the greatest effect. This is quite a beautiful movie!
