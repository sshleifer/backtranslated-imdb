This film was adapted from the famous Journey to the West sutra, where a monk with his three students is trying to find a long-lost book about the teachings of Buddha. <br /> <br /> Although this film was not in spite of the fact that the previous films shot according to the legend were just as solemn, they managed to bring a romantic and funny humorous scene. <br /> <br /> This real purpose of this film revolves around a monk who was primarily saved from being eaten by demonic flying creatures. One of his disciples, the God of the Apes, managed to pull him out of battle at the very last moment, but in turn was captured by demons and thrown into the deep throat of a dragon trapped in this particular dungeon. <Br /> <br /> A monk woke up in a small village, where he found Mei Yan (the so-called ugly snake daughter), who fell in love with him at first sight. Although she was ugly, she did not allow her appearance to be abandoned, except to get to him. However, the desire to save his three disciples was soon filled with obstacles, and each of them, as it turned out, deteriorated when Mei Yan followed the monk. Problems have crept deeper, and it is here that conflicts between relationships are exacerbated. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story will be left at your disposal, but suffice it to say that this film does not reflect the typical plot line of the film. the book is more for those who want to find a funny and easy picture of what traveling to the West really means and love obstacles. <br /> <br /> To the very end, one could describe all the resumes in just one word, and that is love. The monk went to show Heaven's Gate, Heavenly Palace and Buddha himself, how love can overcome even the most terrible fear of all and which is considered the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of higher powers. <br /> <br /> Perfectly created and fun activities await those who buy this ticket. There would be, of course, no regrets, at least for my part and those who were with me in the cinema that day, watched the same movie.
