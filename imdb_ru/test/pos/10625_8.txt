On the whole, I found this film to be good: an exceptional game with disturbing scenes (some substantial, some useless) and a weak second half. CONTAINS SPOILERS The film is divided into 2 parts. I thought Pianist’s first half was awesome. We meet with Erica Kohut (wonderful Isabel Huppert), piano teacher, and get to know her world. She is lonely, struggling to find her place against the ultra-protective and borderline tyrannical mother. We understand that she has lost or rarely experienced love as physical + emotional chemistry: she protects herself, being acute and offensive to people, relieves her sexual tension in sex shops, as a voyeur, or in sadistic self-deprecations ... This first half is very clinical and creates incredible tension in the film, almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> Then comes Walter, a young, handsome and sociable man (superbly played by Benoit Magimel). Although he begins to feel the coldness of Erica at the beginning, he seduces her and slowly destroys the strength of Erica. He loves her deeply, but she needs him to fulfill her sadistic desires. Then, when she is about to fall in love with him, he is disgusted with her world, and in the end we find that Eric cannot love or feel at all (especially since Walter is portrayed as a person who is impossible not to love). This is the second half of the film, very touching, as we see that Erica’s inability / inexperience lead her to self-destruction. This second half looked less mastered by Haneke, and sometimes there were unreliable (that is, too shocking) scenes that paradoxically reduced the drama. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a rude film, at least in the French version: you see porn sequences from the sex shop, daring to mutilate and sex scenes. It seemed to me that the scene of talking about fellatio between Magimel and Huppert was pretty good, and it is central to understanding Erica’s love for love. As for the actors, Huppert is amazing throughout the film, Magimel is getting better and better to perfection, and Girardot (mother) is gorgeous. <br /> <br />
