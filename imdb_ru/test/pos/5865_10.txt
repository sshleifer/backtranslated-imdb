I went through the highs. I went through the lows ... cried, laughed, tore up my ever-loving guts. But through all this I became whole. I became a better person, having survived this experience of self-deprecation. Not every day we can say that we have experienced the worst and come to the other side with something that very much resembles our whole and safe. Friends ... neighbors - unite and be like one now. Go out and find this film and tomis in its extravagance. Place it high on the mantelpiece and kiss the polystyrene box. Take it to bed. Take it with you when you go shopping, or you have a blind date with strange people. They will appreciate you for your majestic and unique schizophrenic film bias. And then they will throw their favorite drink in your face (but you will be the last to laugh). I ran for the governor with this little beauty in my belt (and you can too!). This pleasure is worth having again and again.
