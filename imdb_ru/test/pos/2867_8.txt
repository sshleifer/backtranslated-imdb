I really liked it. <br /> <br /> Camera viewing angles are awesome, not all as nervous as Blair Witches. And I thought they did a great job with sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Lots of fun. Many people screamed at the screen! <br /> <br /> Kane did a great job with his various psycho-emotions. He is much less one-dimensional than most horror heroes. <br /> <br /> Kane is much less scary and more believable than most movie psychos. It was not clear to me how he would react to different situations. There are not so many turns here, but it is clever and original in its own way. Good, creepy, cheap movies.
