Let me move away from the many comments that I read here and say that this film is one of the five best links, along with Her Majesty’s Secret Service, From Russia with love, with a murder license, and only for your eyes. ONLY once Roger Moore actually played the role of Bond, instead of messing around). Of course, Sean Connery puts it all together - as a co-author, co-producer and in his best performance since “From Russia with Love”. He is fit, energetic and, obviously, enjoys himself. His game is mature, confident and permeated with the right amount of humor. This contrasts with his mechanical performance in “The Thunderball”, his sleepwalking in “Only you live twice” and his harsh, sharp game of this cartoon, known as “Diamonds are forever”! <br /> <br /> This is a creative rework of The Thunderball, without sets and machines, overwhelming characters and plot. This cast is also much better. Klaus Maria Brandauer brings her unique style to the role of Largo, without relying on eye patch, SPECTER ring or boring uniform. Kim Basinger is sportive and sweet, Barbara Carrera is dynamic, and this time we have a wonderful Felix Leiter in Bernie Casey. The M and Q images are original, and adding a clumsy agent Small Fawcett is fun, without falling into a farce. <br /> <br /> Directed by Irwin Kershner makes good use of his location (Bahamas and French Riviera). without losing sight of their actors. Despite the fact that careful examination reveals some mediocre special effects and errors in continuity, Kershner keeps the film at a good pace, unlike Thunderbol (which even his director Terence Jung didn’t like). Obviously, fans will miss the gun-muzzle brand and 007 thematic music, but they are ultimately owned by Eon Productions. <br /> <br /> Michel LeGrand may not have composed the most memorable account, but he captures the atmosphere of the places without being overly intrusive. It is not surprising that his best moments are in the south of France, and his French love song (in a health resort) is especially attractive. And tell me, how much does music really remember for Moonraker? I personally would prefer to forget "The Man with the Golden Gun" and "A Look at the Murder"! <br /> <br /> People of “Eon” can scoff at this film if they want. (Yes, Octopussy made more money.) At least, a mature Connery 007 did not swing in the jungle, uttering a Tarzan cry. He did not frolic with the Bengal tiger and did not fight with the "Indian" snake charmers with the help of a tennis racket. Despite Eon’s desperate attempts to stop this production, Kevin McClory and the late Jack Schwartzman created a wonderful film that I think I would appreciate by Ian Fleming. <br /> <br /> If you, however, would prefer to see James Bond get hit in the shins of a dwarf, join another tedious fight with Jaws, jump into bed with Grace Jones, or lead a fire truck chase through San Francisco, this is NOT a movie for you!
