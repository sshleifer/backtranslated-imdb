As a child of the 90s, I really liked this show, and I can proudly say that I liked it and even more than the classic WB cartoons. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know why; the cartoons of the early 90s had something special; I do not know whether it was an atmosphere of uncertainty, a change of generations, whatever. But "Tiny Toons" retained the atmosphere of the 90s and released one of the most popular, funny and undervalued cartoons ever created. <br /> <br /> Memories are dark, but I can only say that I liked every episode and product associated with the show. Easily, no other cartoon made me laugh gently (before getting into the dark comedies targeting teenagers). <br /> <br /> All the characters were funny and had a feature of the absence of a true protagonist. Each character was fun and deserved to be called the lead.
