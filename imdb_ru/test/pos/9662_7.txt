I must say that I did not expect this film to be so good. Typically, Eastern cinema represents the communist past in 90% of films. Nevertheless, this film surpasses the Romanian cinema, deserving more advertising. <br /> <br /> The game is true and not exaggerated, the plot is simple, but complicated because it represents life in a Romanian suburb, the sound hit me, the direction was good and what else can I say ... <br /> <br /> This “catastrophe” of Eastern Europe drew me into a film that lives every moment. I even felt a desire coming from me, a desire for adventure when I saw it. <br /> <br /> Look! You will love it! <br /> <br /> 7/10
