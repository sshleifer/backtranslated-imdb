For many years, there are several films that just slip through and almost no one is watching. <br /> <br /> Conner is one of those films. <br /> <br /> This little gem played at some festivals, and his short two-week run in a small theater in West Hollywood earned about $. 5500. <br /> <br /> This is now on DVD. Hopefully many will see it now. <br /> <br /> This is a strange drama of an astute young politician who influences me very much. At the 15-year-old guy. This politician also has a handsome nephew (about 17 years old) who is friends with a 15-year-old boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The above paragraph is a bit vague about what is happening, SO the film, And this is what I appreciated, we DO NOT understand all the facts, much is left to our discretion. You will hear a dialogue that makes this logical. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber (“Wings”) is our politician, his role is a bit vague, this is another point that viewers have to think about. <br /> <br /> Alex D. Lens was 15 years old, he was about 17 years old when they were making this film, but he could easily pass for a younger one. He has been in film and television since early childhood, he is a very good actor and quite convincing. <br /> <br /> Escher Holloway is an older teenager, this role is his first lead role, and he's excellent too. <br /> <br /> Now I save the best for last, writer / director <br /> <br /> Luke Eberl is not yet 23 years old. For the first effort, thumbs up. I really hope that he, like our two guys, has a long career. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
