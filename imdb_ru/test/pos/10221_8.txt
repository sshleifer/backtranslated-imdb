I first saw Nightbreed on television a year ago, and I was pleasantly surprised by the results. <br /> <br /> Clive Barker is said to have revived horror with Hellraiser, but this film actually stopped his film career. somewhat. What an unfortunate thing to happen, because, like the people of Midian, this film seems to be misunderstood. <br /> <br /> Barker created in this story a crossing of the main genre scenes - it begins as a traditional horror film. but soon becomes the parable of human inhumanity. It is difficult to cause sympathy to the devil at the best of times, but when the characters are as visually demonic as in this film, it becomes almost impossible (hint at the child!). Almost a Clan-like human uprising (pitchfork and holy wrath!) In conclusion, the films become doubly distressing in the face of what it was before. This film, as a parable about the ethnic tensions and superiority of whites, can be quite memorable. <br /> <br /> I’m sorry for those who don’t see the film from this point of view and consider it a fantastic condescension of Barker who has gone too far. We have a real forgotten pearl here, and the sooner the studio and Mr. Barker become nice and devote some time to this - the better.
