This film is one of the most memorable films I've ever seen. I reluctantly went with a Turkish friend who recommended it. I am not a very enthusiastic supporter of musical documentaries, but when Ainur Dogan, a Kurdish woman who was forbidden to sing in Turkey for years, sings her play, the theater was delighted. I would have given all my strength to hear the CD recording of this obsessive, magnificent song. And she is just one of many artists interviewed and recorded telling about their experiences of performing in Istanbul. Even now, a month later, I remember the shots in which Ainur sings in an acoustic audience, and I try to remember the music that sounded in the movie. Well done Faith Akin, the director of this film, and his great idea to capture the many magnificent sounds of such a cosmopolitan city. This will certainly encourage me to visit Istanbul.
