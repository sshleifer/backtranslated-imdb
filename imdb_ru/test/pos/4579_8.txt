This film is funny and rather sad, I think it is true. If you love Office Space, you'll love this movie, because this is another hit by Mike Judge, but it doesn't look like Office Space. I told everyone to watch this movie. I just wish it were in more theaters so that it would get the recognition it deserved. I love this movie and would love to see more from Mike Judge. Luke Wilson also makes this film what it is. I'm so glad that I won't be alive in 2505, because if this film turns out to be true, there will be a lot of trouble for all of us. I just hope that more people will see this film, because I know that they will fall in love with it too.
