I could not disagree with those who say that this is a lousy movie. My friend and I went to watch it during the Stockholm Film Festival, and it was one of my favorite films during the festival. The dolls used in horror films are not new, but I have not seen that in many films it is as good as in this film. Atmosphere, atmosphere, actors, camera work ... everything is just fine. And they really work well with each other. Now, if you expect this movie to be another Grudge or Ring, then you probably won't like it. But if you want a good stylized panic, then that's fine. Despite the fact that it is quite predictable and sometimes funny, I still recommend it to anyone who loves horror movies. Go look. Now.
