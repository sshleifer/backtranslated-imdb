This is perhaps the television series with the greatest potential among all the TV shows. Production values ​​in its class. The characters are rounded and interesting. This is entertainment at its best. Some aliens are quite grotesque, but there is a hidden humor that makes it unattainable. I hope that this series will last for many years and will have a lot of additional income. Sci-fi had a bad press, some justified, but this is really the flagship science fiction series, and I thank Henson for that. Top marks.
