I just got a DVD for Hardware Wars in a new shiny package that looks irresistible. Stuck on my dvd player to find lots of extra fun stuff. The extra content on the DVD is even longer than the movie. For those of you who (shamefully!) Have never seen Hardware Wars, this is a fantastically stupid deception of Star Wars (of course, Episode IV). Home appliances (such as irons, toasters, vacuum cleaners and waffle irons) will replace Ty-Fighters, X-wing, R2D2 and the death star. Instead of Princess Leia, we have Princess Ann-Droid complete with a hairstyle from Cinnabon. You understood, I'm sure. Crazy stupidity and exciting trip for any Star Wars fan (like me!) <br /> <br /> Now the DVD is wow! The director's commentary, where he mostly starred in the film, ridiculing himself and the whole project. Interview with Fosselius about Creature Features (remember that?!) And the funny director and foreign version of the film (of course, all the jokes). Anyway, that's great. I loved Hardware Wars in the theater and am very glad that in my collection there is a DVD sandwiched between MST3K: the movie and Thumb Wars!
