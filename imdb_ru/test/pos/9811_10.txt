I'm not sure what to call this film a child drama or a fantastic film. When I first watched this, I could not see the final, and this is the only part of the film that seemed to lack depth, and for a while I was a little upset. Then I watched it a second time and realized how great the game was, and did not know why she received the scant attention she made at that time. <br /> <br /> The unforgettable performances of the young Madzello and Wood were supposed to make this film a classic one. <br /> <br /> Although screenwriter and director (Evans) probably intended to present him as fiction / drama, after Donner captured him, he apparently did it with a more dramatic look, especially the final who left much to be desired about what really happened to Bobby - was he killed? Did he run away and did he make all these fantastic journeys? Or was it just an imaginary story woven by Hanks to prove his point? children? <br /> <br /> But in general, this did not ensure the closure of the happy ending to which we were so accustomed in the children's film. Perhaps this is because it is not only that. <br /> <br /> To see a more classic ending, visit the official website of Ilya Wood, where you will find the first draft of the filmâ€™s completion script (presumably by the original) <br /> <br /> Also a note to the music of Hans Zimmer which is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, a mixture of childish and dark moods throughout the film. Great CD to get if you can. <br /> <br />
