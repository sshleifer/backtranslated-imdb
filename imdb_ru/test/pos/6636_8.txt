Ingmar Bergman's meditation in war concerns a couple living an idyllic existence on a small island off the coast (which country is not specified). Raging at a distance is a war that they only know about from the news. When they approach their day, war comes to them, and soon it becomes a struggle for survival, since both sides do not seem to care about them. A gloomy view of the human costs of the war and those who are not ready to participate in the battle, but nevertheless came under crossfire. This is a film that is ahead of its time, in about 40 years since the idea of ​​the wars in which most civilians perish. This is a dark, disturbing film that is told from the point of view of an ordinary person with a full sense of hopelessness and confusion, best expressed in the thought that ran through my head all the time: “What should I do now?”. As an intellectual exercise, a top-level film is a film that makes you think. As an emotional film, it is touching, but it never moves completely. I have never been emotionally excited, even when the horror of this situation made my brain slap. (I have to say that I admire Bergman intellectually for the ideas he brings to the table, however I have never been touched by his films. I am not a “fan.” I was always on the side of Fellini in the argument of the old film about who was better since he had more emotions to his films). In addition to reservations, it requires viewing, especially because we live in a world where war, for most of us, is just a thing on the TV screen.
