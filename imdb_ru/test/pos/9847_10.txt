This is the best acting film I've ever seen. All the artists are old actors of the Turkish theater, they are great in this film. Sometimes they say that "they do not act, they live by it", this can really be seen in this film. The director is also competent, you canâ€™t see a lot of moving cameras, but the arrangement of the cameras is also good. But after the game, the most outstanding part is the content of the film. This gives happiness, enthusiasm, a desire to live, the importance of true friends for people. We all began to live individually in our days, in this film you see that there is someone other than us. And most importantly, you see that the most honorable feeling in the world is love, love for your friends, love for your loved one. All people should see this movie ...
