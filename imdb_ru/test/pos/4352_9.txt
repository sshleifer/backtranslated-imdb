Warning: The Duke is a director, and, as a rule, he is too dramatic. Thus, obsessive ideas about closing the doors may or may not be a real part of the character’s life, but the director’s dramatic decoration — or so both agreed at the San Francisco premiere. But Duke's usual passion for character, dreams, and perseverance fits well with this story, first published in Soldier of Fortune, and now in a full-length autobiography book. (The “Soldier of Fortune” comment provoked loud cries from the SF politically correct audience, and the cinematographer and the protagonist had to convince viewers who had just watched the film that SOF’s interest was inappropriate - so the warning is not Rambo, but simply survival.)
