This is absolutely the best cartoon of the 80s, perhaps the best cartoon of all time. It had everything, action, adventures, thrills and much more ... <br /> <br /> I canâ€™t imagine how hard Ruby-Spears was to make this great cartoon, a lot of money was spent on this masterpiece of work, and it was worth it, for example, just to drown the scenes was difficult, because I would not call the 1980s a great technological year with computers, as it is now in the world we live in, so the translucent scenes were great! <br /> <br /> Cartoons will never be the same as they were before, so I hope that all of them will be released on DVD, especially The Centurions, since this is my favorite movie. I have a full set of 65 episodes on DVD-R, but this is not the same, because if they were released on DVD, people in the world could buy it and see a DVD in almost every store, which means a lot for the fans. My good friend Ted made this petition to get the show back on TV or better on DVD, that is, if we get a lot of requests to get them back on DVD. <br /> <br /> So please help us by signing a petition at http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html
