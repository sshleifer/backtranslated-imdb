Critics claim that this film is one of the worst films ever. Observers also claim the same thing. But there is a reverse side of this coin. They are wrong, very wrong. This is the smartest movie I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, you see a story that is unreal. A story that reflects the real world. This film is like a mirror. You see yourself as people see you. To truly understand the director's point of view, you must see it another time ... <br /> <br /> When you see this film ... Try to understand the story (and look at the background) ... Listen to music lyrics ... And the smell of industrial complexes ... <br /> <br /> This film is one of a kind. You will hate it (most people love it), or you will like it (and you will understand it completely). <br /> <br /> Ernest Hemingway once said: “The world is a great place to fight for.” I agree with the second part.
