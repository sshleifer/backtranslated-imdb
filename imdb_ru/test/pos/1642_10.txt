Ice the Limerick: <br /> <br /> A virus ripped out of ice <br /> <br /> I just didn’t know how to play well. <br /> <br /> If you are infected, kill <br /> <br /> Because you are sick. <br /> <br /> The medicine must be infected twice. <br /> <br /> Ice is a great episode; one of the greatest in the first season, which began to form the show, and if you ask me, you really can not ask for the best in the whole series. It starts with a terrific teaser, which, in my opinion, is truly one of the best teasers of the series. A group of scientists in Alaska drilled something from the ice core, which for some reason made them kill each other. Now Mulder and Scully go with three other scientists to investigate what happened. As Mulder says, this is either because they are brilliant or consumable. I suppose that means it’s better to be brilliant or else ... The group will soon find out that the cause of the disorder is a small parasite torn from the ice core. Little worm that enters the bloodstream and causes aggressive behavior. As the pilot is infected, the rest of the show turns into the creepy look of the paranoiac thriller “who did it” when others begin to suspect each other of being infected. The overly paranoid Dr. Hodge does not help this at all; he does not trust anyone, which we will know first because of what he asks first of all: check that everyone believes, "to make sure that we are what we call ourselves." Events lead to identifying who is infected and learning how to cure him. <br /> <br /> In this episode, I like a few things, and, of course, some characters that I want to hit on the face. this episode, as well as a couple of loopholes, but most of them can be attributed to increased caution and not think clearly. I like Bear since the first meeting with him. It is a pity that he must die. I also like the scene shown from the point of view of another scientist when Mulder and Scully argue in another room. This gives an interesting twist to our typical perception as a spectator, and I seem to be saying that maybe we should not assume that just because someone is a government means that he knows all sorts of secrets of the plot. As much as Hodges did not upset me in this episode, I think Mulder was just as guilty in some rash actions as any other. I really like Scully in this episode. First of all, she can handle as a bloody midfielder! Secondly, I really like the focus on her fear of what might happen to them, and because she tries not to let Mulder’s trust and friendship stop her from distorting her judgment. I like the scene when she enters the room to sleep, and at first looks like a photograph of a previous group that hugs everything, and birthday gifts from them to someone who previously slept in this room, and then how she suddenly got mad and pushes a chest of drawers in front of the door and in the final touch of subtlety, when she sits on the floor, pulling her knees up to her chest, we see the bottom of the poster on the wall that says "Busty Friends." This is such a great letter. You can say without saying that Scully is worried that she cannot even trust her best friend. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this heightened suspicion makes the group believe that Mulder became infected because he discovered that Murphy had a dead body, although they hadn’t examined him at all to find out for sure. This was my main problem with the behavior of the characters, as they could easily resolve all suspicions simply by donating blood. But, probably, I would also act recklessly in this situation. But then stupid Hodges decides that he must assume that Mulder is infected, although Mulder willingly gives up, and then he is readily examined and almost infects Mulder. Fortunately, he sees that this is really Dasilva, which is infected, and we finally reach a solution. At least as much as you can expect from X-File. The “government” does not waste time on falsifying evidence, as is always the case in these cases, and Mulder has yet another unpleasant “unsolved” case. In conclusion, I give “Ice” and quietly 10/10 and leave you with a haiku. <br /> <br /> “We are not who we are. It does not go beyond that. It ends right here and now. "
