This strange and hypnotic drama of Don Siegel / Clint Eastwood was left on the sidelines in 1971 and what a pity. An exciting learning experience with some great women for Squint to deal with. Geraldine Page was one of our main actresses, and she played well. Young Jo Ann Harris is flirty minx, and Elizabeth Hartman (who died too young) is unquestionably repressed. <br /> <br /> A 7 out of 10. Best performance = C. Eastwood. Released the same year as DIRTY HARRY, it made no difference but good reviews. Look for it, if you are not only in the films "Explosion". Very thin and frightening, this piece will stay with you.
