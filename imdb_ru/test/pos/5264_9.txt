This is one of my favorites. Betty White and Leslie Nilson sparkle in this romantic comedy. One of them is a business executive who overestimates life based on the expectation of her death for a year. The other is a playboy who is tired of gold mining young women and is seeking a relationship with a vital, mature woman. If you have silver in your hair and / or romance in your heart, cook popcorn in a microwave, roll up with honey and get ready for a treat.
