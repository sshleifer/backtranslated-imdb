Some people do not like Led Zeppelin, but, fortunately, the number of people who, compared to the number of people who do not, is RIGHT unbalanced. I am a proud converter of 2 or 3 Led Zeppelin fans, and the only reason I could do it was this DVD. <br /> <br /> First of all, how can someone listen to “Stairway to Heaven” or “Immigrant Song” without falling in love with Zeppelin, I can't afford, but playing the guitar, not like Paige .. It is like being a Christian and not loving Jesus. My friend was like "Led Zeppelin sucks!" and I was like, "Oh yes, look this!" After about 2 minutes of watching Paige’s viewing through “White Summer / Black Side of the Mountain,” he was glued to the screen and has never said anything bad about Zeppelin since. <br /> <br /> If you haven't followed the running metaphor I call this DVD the Led Zeppelin Bible. Keeps high among followers and is used as a converter for unwashed pagans. <br /> <br /> Of course, some things are missing, such as “Over the hills and away”, a good version of “Immigrant Songs”, and I really didn’t need two versions of “Whole Lotta Love”, but damn it I will take them. <br /> <br /> Because there is nothing but “The song remains the same”, to compare it, too, I gave 10, and even if there was something else to compare, I would still give 10.
