I saw this show when I was younger. This is a really good show to watch. It is very informative for children from 1 to 8 years. Barney is definitely a super de duper. B.J. pretty funny. Babie Bop is very cute. The children are also very cool. This show talks about numbers similar to Sesame Street, but about a different type of show and characters like Barney’s purple dinosaur, B.J.’s yellow dinosaur. With a baseball hat on the head and a cute green dinosaur with a pink bow. The first thing that started was a very old Barney and Friends show. But then the second was different to be new episodes. Also last in 2000 was the new Barney Park scene. They also have a Barney show at Universal Studios in Florida, where you see Barney, B.J. and Baby Bop, and then when the show is over, you can go play, buy and meet Barney. This is a very good show, watch this show when you learn about many things you like, about the film and about the live show at Universal Studios Florida.
