In the Book of Life, Martin Donovan plays Jesus, who appears at Kennedy Airport on December 31 to usher in a new millennium, battling Thomas Jay Ryan (Satan) and deciding the fate of the world. There is also David Symonds (accountant Kurt from Amateur) as a compulsive homeless player. <br /> <br /> As usual, Hartley creates a surrealistic world in which the beauty of ordinary, made strange and otherworldly people skillfully permeates the whole world. framed scenes and urban / industrial landscapes filled with blinding light and shadow. As usual, he introduces seemingly random details early, and then returns them later in a cheerful and unexpected context - humor is simple, but frivolous and irresistible. Hartley has an amazing ability to build, to small and enthusiastic moments, at the same time everyday and outrageous. As usual, he creates a tone, exhausted and tired of the world, but at the same time vulnerable, open and honest. After a few minutes, he moves from noisy humor to a metaphysical and poetic language - a scripture that is so dead and perfect that it is difficult to hold back tears, despite the absence of obvious emotions. Another amazing and very exciting movie. <br /> <br /> The book of life is removed (digital camera?) With a blurry effect: the feeling of heavenly hand in hand with the impending doom and hyper-awareness of the present fragile and fleeting in the last minutes. All Hartley films have a way to prioritize the present, but this unique effect aggravates it, as the images are erased on the screen in a way that at first scares, but becomes more beautiful when you agree to it. The last shot is spectacular. All this may seem precious, but the film is a comedy, and he makes fun of himself, even though he makes fun of the concept of Armageddon, the Day of Judgment and "urban life." Although it is actually quite deep, touching and life-affirming, it is mostly frivolous and playful. The game is flawless in terms of the type of muffled tone that Hartley developed in his films (a tone that some people do not receive and which causes them to judge such actions as empty - the same people who have a negative answer to Peter Greenaway). As always, there are sure to be people who will respond to this film with cynicism and contempt — people who are dismissed by Hartley’s dramatic changes and what they consider to be pretentious or mannered technicians — but anyone who is a Hartley fan will love this film (if they can get chance to see it, that is). It's hard to say how it will be on the video.
