This film, as it was conceived, was a success. This is a short tragic film. Despite the fact that I choose a film that really develops the characters and their relationships, this film is designed to simply give a taste, leaving you with the factor of "what will happen next." After watching it, I really wanted more character stories that they had to make people into them. I think that was exactly what the audience intended. The game is awesome. There are not so many lines in the film, so their body language, facial expressions and general presence should have been powerful enough to hold the scene. Both Franco and Miner have this element, and it shows. The fact that they (especially Franco) took the time to do this obviously says that they believed in this film and wanted to be part of it, and for that I appreciated the film as it was. In addition, I am happy to own it in order to share it with other people who would never know about its existence.
