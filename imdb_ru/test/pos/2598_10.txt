If you lose sight of the fact that the plot was filmed many times, this is a funny and joyfully pleasurable cartoon Looney Tunes. The animation is great, the backgrounds are so detailed and very impertinent. The letter is razor sharp, and the spectacle, especially Duffy, constantly tearing his head, brilliantly calculated. I really loved the controversy between Duffy and Bugs, and Bugs won every time. I also like that Duffy is really greedy and disgusting, though funny and funny. I prefer him when he is mad, but here he is very funny. Bugs is still his charming and rascal, and Elmer is funny, though rather stupid. In short, this is absolutely brilliant, and in fact my personal favorite is the Hunting trilogy for pure entertainment value. 10/10 Bethany Cox
