This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut film. It follows all the rules. Short scenes are, in essence, cheap filming, guerrilla filming, no filming (just abandoned buildings) and possibly an empty wing of the hospital. In addition, even a black and white film was a brilliant blow, probably chosen rather because of its low costs, and not because of the effect of the film, but it worked. <br /> <br /> Reno was great as Brutus. All acted great. The plot was simple and effective, and you have no loose pieces left. A tough, well-designed, cost-effective budget film. <br /> <br /> Released in 1983, it would have been done shortly before the art of creating high-budget militants was enhanced by the Hollywood movie-making engine. and filmmaking was more exclusive and therefore more complex and more in need of the right people in the right places than in today's world with Internet access, so Luc Besson would have to bargain a lot and keep promises to achieve this result, which makes the final product even more wonderful. <br /> <br /> But again, the French film industry has always maintained an excellent reputation (yes, I know that Luc Besson is Belgian, but a French film), and he was the source of many Hollywood remakes. <br /> <br /> If I have one criticism, itâ€™s the fact that the cover on DVD (and possibly the original advertising poster) has no resemblance to the film in general and looks rather strange, and not a representative of or the Themes film - at first glance it seems that this is a person in post-apocalyptic armor on a swing, but during the second inspection a person is found in armor with a spear on an office chair with legs on a table in a reclining confident posture. This never happens in a movie. <br /> <br /> This is a black and white film, zero dialogue, a physical game, tense scenes and brilliant actors make this movie something to add to your personal movie collection. A great movie.
