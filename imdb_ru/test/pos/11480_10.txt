I consider this film to be a complete masterpiece - in fact, I consider it the best work of Fernando Fragata and, undoubtedly, the best of all Portuguese films. I don’t think you can come across such a “zero budget” movie, as impressive and amazing as this one. <br /> <br /> The direction is done with perfection at an incredibly fast tempo, and the music also written by Fragata is mostly excellent. This story is both creepy and humorous, and it is certainly an in-depth study of the old saying, “Misfortune loves society”, in which they intertwine with a stunning mystery. A more than perfect recipe to glue viewers' eyes to the screen from the first to the last frame. <br /> <br /> He was called neo-hitchcock, and I agree. As in the case of the best Hitchcocks, I could not guess during the entire film, and most of my assumptions were far from what was ultimately cleverly revealed.
