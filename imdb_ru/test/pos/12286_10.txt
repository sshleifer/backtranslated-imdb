“This is not a movie” works, because this is so true in what he is trying to say. If you ignore the plot dynamics and focus on the message, you will see yourself a little in the main character, Michael. Whether it’s a man or a woman, we’ve all come to the conclusion that in our life we ​​want to look back and reconsider a situation or relationship. It really happened, as we remembered? Something went wrong? Michael's desire to find Grace is absolutely selfish. More than anything, he wants to feel better about how things turned out. But even in this case, he is a responsive character, because everyone is selfish in a relationship. We would not be in them otherwise. When the film ends, I'm not sure if Michael has learned something new about himself or not. Our best relationship score is through his friend Nadia. She is the soul of the film and reminds us that in each story there are always two sides. I found Michael pompous, arrogant and just ignorant. That is why I liked him. He is a real character. If you ever wanted to go back and analyze previous relationships, then this film is for you. In conclusion, this is a film for everyone.
