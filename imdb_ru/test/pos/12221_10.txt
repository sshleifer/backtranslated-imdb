I bought a full surface season. watched it for 3 days! I was so captured by the plot, theories and basically everything related to this show. The actor who plays Miles is great. Mile's sister, mother, and father behaved as if they were living in real life. You can connect at many levels, it's fascinating. <br /> <br /> I think animals are so wonderful that you can almost communicate with them, like a parent to a child. It would be something if a creature of this nature really existed. <br /> <br /> It is sad that Surface has no second season or at least four more shows. I have so many questions to answer, and I hope that they will create more, or maybe in the book. <br /> <br /> I love the show. For those who have not watched Surface, if you like fantasy, you need to watch it !!!!!!!!!!!!!
