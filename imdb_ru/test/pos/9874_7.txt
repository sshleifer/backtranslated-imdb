For some reason, I always like movies that people hate when I really don't think they are so bad — and this is one of those films. In the case of this film, I think it is criticized too much, I really am not so bad at all. Actually, I think this is one of the best sequels. "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" begins the night before Halloween, where Michael brutally kills Jamie Lloyd (who was captured by "The Man in Black" in Part 5) after she gave birth to his child. Then we get acquainted with the Strode family, which now coincidentally lives in the old house of Myers (which seems to change in every film). Kara and her son Danny are the main characters, along with Tommy Doyle, now an adult boy who survived the initial killings. They must fight together to save the baby Jamie from the evil cult that takes care of Michael, while Michael himself is forced to kill the old Celtic ritual, where he must sacrifice the whole family in Haddonfield. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the best sequels of the series, in my opinion, in any case, and I cannot understand all the hatred he has received. It had some kind of pleasant anticipation, an interesting plot (but I admit that sometimes it is confusing), some scary moments here and there, and a lot of bloody and knife blows to appease all of you hounds. Not all actions were not particularly good, but for me it was convincing enough. Marianne Hagan is the leading lady and she is very pleasant. Paul Rudd plays the adult Tommy Doyle, and is also very talented and plays his part beautifully. The rest of the auxiliary staff (except the brilliant Donald Placéns) is not so commendable, but, given all the circumstances, this is not so bad either. I'm still not sure that an explanation of why Michael is killing was absolutely necessary, but in the end everything turned out, and I was not upset about how they all tied up. The open output was also pretty creepy, but could be something big. <br /> <br /> I also saw the movie’s notorious “Producer Video”, its original piece, and I think it’s better in some ways. It also explains the curse of Thorn, which Michael moves, and some additional scenes that really helped support the film, plus, in my opinion, the final was much better. It was more natural than the conclusion that we gave in the studio version of the film. I would like Dimension to release this alternative version of the film, because I personally think that it is better. Chances are very small. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" is a very good sequel that will delight all fans of the series. This film is not the best of all horror films, but it is definitely worth renting if you want Michael to do his job. Just do not expect shine, and you will like it. 7/10.
