Bad Abbott and Lou Costello always had good followers among children, but in their careers, I think you could say that they made only one film that can be intended for children. Jack and the Beanstalk were the movie. <br /> <br /> This was part of the Warner Brothers independent transaction, consisting of two paintings. The second film is Abbott and Costello, Meet the Captain Kidd. It was only two films made by boys in color. <br /> <br /> Two of them, as usual, out of work, get a job as a nanny for a very early and unpleasant young David Stollery. Although it all starts with the fact that Costello wants to read the guy, Jack and the beanstalk as a bedtime story, the young man finishes reading it to Costello. Lou falls asleep, and in his dream he fantasizes that he is truly Jack the killer of giants. <br /> <br /> Buddy Baer, ​​who was threatened by boys in Africa, Chris is playing a giant, and he has a giant-sized housekeeper Dorothy Ford as his housekeeper. Dorothy was a big girl, 6'2 ", and you can imagine that she was a little hard to be abandoned, except when her height was used as a joke. One of the only players who ever looked down on her , was John Wayne in the film "Three Godparents" at the age of 6. "4". Henry Fonda and James Stewart in the film “On our merry way” also stood a little higher than her, but again her height was part of a gag. <br /> <br /> Shay Kogan and James Alexander were princess and prince of fantasy, and they sang beautifully, but could not cost anything. It was the last film by William Farnum, whose career began from the early silent days of screen and even before the beginning of the last century on stage. He played the father of Princess Shay, the king. <br /> <br /> Some not very memorable musical numbers came from Jack and the Beanstalk, with the exception of the title song. I remember well how in childhood I had 78 songs, when Bud and Lou sang a song and told a story. I was in early childhood, but I became their fan throughout my life and in my television shows. <br /> <br /> Jack and the Beanstalk are still a good picture for children of the smallest, although I would warn parents to warn their little hedgehogs not to imitate the young master Stollery.
