The title of the Chinese film “In Love” is “fa yeung nien wah”. This can be interpreted as "those heyday (which once were)." <br /> <br /> The entire film is a well-made piece. A complex love story told in a simple visual approach. Writer-director Wong Kar-Wai put the dance of hearts - this is she, this is he, this is love. I hear the theme of Galasso: dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum and strings - almost like a heartbeat. Work with a prelude, stanzas and epilogue. <br /> <br /> The director optimized the use of music (Michael Galasso score, Nat King Cole singing in Spanish and Chinese songs / melodies). Rhythm and lyrics suggest to viewers that she and he feel / think, and not verbal dialogues. I hear Nat King Cole give us clues: “Aquello ?? ojos verde "(this thing, throw, green eyes) plays when they meet, and" Quizzes, quizzes, quizzes "(maybe ??), when it is undecided. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia permeates the entire movie. Design details are abundant: bags and ties; The novelty of the Japanese rice cooker; green glass cups, saucers and ribbed plates (I remember dad treasured them at home); mahjong session; kitchen area; bedroom furniture; take-away noodle bowl that she shakes when she walks. Slim and slender Maggie Chung looks exquisitely in fashionable patterns and colors of traditional Chinese women's clothing - "Cheng himself." Every change of her dress means a different day, a different time in history. Wong Kar-wai is ingenious in this sense. <br /> <br /> Scenes may be in the same place, but they have a different mood, advanced to the next stanza. Up and down the stairs to the noodle stand. Standing at the wall around the corner to the apartments, like rain. Along the corridor, back and forth, to his corner for writing. <br /> <br /> General Information: She helps him in writing his martial arts novel. Maggie could help because she was in kung fu / martial arts films. "Eastern Three Heroes" 1992 is a fascinating action movie with Maggie Chung (Thief Catcher Chat), Michelle Yeo and Anita Mui as three superheroes fighting evil. <br /> <br /> If you appreciate Tony Lun’s performance, you shouldn’t miss Chungking Express 1994 (second segment - romantic rhythm with difference) and Happy Together 1997 (intense, emotionally colorful picture of friendship, faith and fate ), written and directed by Wong Kar-Wai <br /> <br /> Being able to understand the Cantonese and Shanghai dialects and visiting the official website, I realized that the epilogue was not fully translated. Here is my version of Chinese signatures: <br /> <br /> This was an unbearable clash. She kept her head down, giving him a chance to get close. He did not have the courage to be closer. She turned around, left. <br /> <br /> This time and place is a thing of the past. All that belonged no longer exists. _______ <br /> <br /> Those disappeared years, seemingly separated from each other by dust from glass, can see, but cannot comprehend. <br /> <br /> All this time he longed for everything that passed. this glass collected in the dust He will return to the times long gone. ________ <br /> <br /> Wong Kar-Wai’s “In the Mood for Love” recalls the simple poetry and wisdom of the Sufi philosopher Rumi - “inner and outer”, “mind and body” of life, love and life. <br /> <br /> [Forward.
