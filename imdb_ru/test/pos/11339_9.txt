WHAT AN AMAZING MOVIE !!!!!!!! I left the theater with a dazed feeling. The film that I just saw was one of the best films I've ever seen in my life. I glued my eyes to the screen. It is very symbolic, visually magnificent, beautifully shot and beautifully said. Basically, these are two people who move to an apartment and live next door to partners who are supposed to have an affair with each other's partners. Assuming this, our two heroes act out what they think their partners are doing. There is an obvious suppression of feelings for each other using vouryistic camera work, body language and symbolic ladders. This is a visual feast, and it's hard not to love. Part of the story gets a little confusing, but it's nothing. The ending is one of the most beautiful (and anti-Hollywood) endings I've ever seen in my life, and visually stunning. Films chasing the score add to the mood. I highly recommend this film to anyone with openness and respect. What a great movie.
