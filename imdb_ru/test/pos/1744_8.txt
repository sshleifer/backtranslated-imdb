This is a very modest, very cute film with an excellent score of Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Lessser with an outstanding number “We are a couple in the castle”, which completely resembles an era and returns us to the “Penthouse Serenade” just at the beginning of the premise (the Hoppiti parish) inspired Fred Saidi and the discovery of Ipa Harburg (Woody Coming) at Finian Rainbow six years later. I fully agree with the posters that noted that the name “Disney” was added to the fact that by now it would have reached its “classical” status, rather than falling into oblivion. This is surprisingly inventive, never more than when objects barely seen in the “real” world become much more important - both for and against - in the world of insects. In fact, it is a classic, albeit a minor one.
