I have never seen the original "House Of Wax", so I really did not know what to expect when I went to the preview of the new film. After some shaky start to represent our young characters, “House of Wax” switches gears and becomes an extremely effective horror horror movie. <br /> <br /> The plot doesn't really matter here - I think most people know about seeing this, these unfortunate children will meet the nasty killer and find some horrible things in the horrible house of wax figures. It's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch. Viewers who like their horror films with a lot of blood will be pleased here, but there are other horrible effects. The production design and scenery is excellent, and the actors play most of their insufficiently written roles. <br /> <br /> Of course, many people are probably wondering what Paris Hilton's performance is. To be honest, Hilton feels good, and she doesn’t portray “herself” as many predict. Her character is sexy and sweet, and I think her good work will change many people's opinions about her. Elisha Cuthbert is also good, moving up from her previous film, the terrible Girl next door. Her character goes through a lot, and Cuthbert turns out to be a furious heroine. Chad Michael Murray, like Hilton and Cuthbert, is a pleasure to watch, but unfortunately he is not very convincing as the “bad guy” of the group. <br /> <br /> I predict good things for the House of Wax. as the audience at the show, which I visited, shouted, shouted and clapped in many parts of the film. Congratulations to the cast and crew for a job well done. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Paris Hilton on the proof that many people are wrong. As she always says, “It's hot.”
