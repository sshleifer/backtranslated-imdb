There are only a few films that were made on such a large scale and led to such changes in the art of making films. <br /> <br /> "The Battleship Potemkin" is one of these films, and it should be on someone's list to find out more about the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Grigory Alexandrov and Sergey M. Eisenstein shot this stunning film, which tells about the horrors occurring on the Russian battleship. When the sailors finally retaliate against their bosses, the locals embrace them and support them. Everything gets terrible when a group of soldiers are sent to a small town to do business. This is followed by one of the most imitated scenes in the history of cinema. Anyone who has seen the Untouchables and the Battleship Potemkin knows for sure what I mean. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this film raised the bar for making a film just like Intolerance a few years ago. If you are not against silent films, do yourself a favor and watch “The Battleship Potemkin.” <br /> <br /> If you don’t like silent films ..... see “Battleship Potemkin” anyway. <br /> <br />
