I liked it better than House Party 2 & 3. The cast was fun and cool at the same time. Chris Stokes, who made the film, has a very humorous cameo as a car repairman; Look for his mom, who plays the main role, John John's grandmother. And you can hear her rap on the title song “Up to the Last Minute” at the end of the movie, like captions. She is very funny and really good actress. The young actors who play the main role (the top three), and who are actually part of the IMx musical group, did an excellent job. Before this film, I did not pay much attention to this group. Now I'm a fan. The musical number only on stage House Party is worth seeing in the film. I was pleasantly surprised. I like it.
