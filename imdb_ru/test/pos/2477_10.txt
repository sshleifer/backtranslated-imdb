Well, I like this film, although sometimes it turns into a stereotypical situation too much. At that time, I did not understand whether there was a “Park of Punishments” in the past, but I think that was not the case. <br /> <br /> You should look at this film differently. This shows how much violence you can find in our world. This reminds us that we live in a world that is led by violence, and that no one can avoid it. If someone refuses to “take responsibility”, then you will be expelled from our society ... Our whole history is made by wars, we must never forget about it. In fact, it is only when we finally accept the truth that maybe we will change and realize that our “intellectual skills” have improved. So we could use them to find other ways to solve our problems. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this film is a must, perhaps it will help us accept the truth ...
