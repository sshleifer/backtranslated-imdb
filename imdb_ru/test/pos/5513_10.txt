Honestly, this is one of the BEST horror movies I've ever seen. I was fascinated by this story, petrified by Captain Howdy, and sat on the edge of my seat throughout the trip. I do not quite understand all the negative reviews. <br /> <br /> Setup has already been discussed in detail; Captain Howdy is an online predator who meets teenagers, kidnaps them and introduces her favorite body modification and piercing activity. Dee Snyder is Captain Howdy and he is one of the worst psychopaths ever created; perhaps the most terrible, because it is so human, and you have a feeling (especially if you are modifying the body at all) that there really are such people in the world. <br /> <br /> But the main reason why I liked the movie and the reason why it is so terrible is that Captain Howdy becomes a hero. At the beginning of the film, the roles are clearly defined; the victims are innocent, the cop is a good guy, and Howdy is pure evil. To the second act, however, everything changed a little. You want Howdy to be evil, but it turns out that he is really just a victim of circumstances, and perhaps good and evil are not obvious. It is terrible to find yourself ill for the "bad" guy. <br /> <br /> Several people mentioned that “Strange Land” should be split into two separate films. Of course, there are definitely two separate “acts”, but this film works so well, because these two acts go right along. The first act is a typical psycho-thriller, but the second is the most disturbing because of the reaction of the audience to the situation. I do not think it would have worked the same way if the second act had been extended and turned into a continuation. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of horror movies, I highly recommend this movie. This is the first horror movie ever given to me by nightmares.
