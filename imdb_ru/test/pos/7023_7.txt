Jennifer Gray seems unlikely of the romantic roles, and this is probably the reason why this favorite movie is such an unmistakable hit. Everyone is doing very well the version of Montagus and Capulets with sweeteners, such as dancing and bait with shadenfred, in which family trails of Jewish society are added, but usually there should be an X factor. <br /> <br /> Swayze probably makes this movie safe with his coarse, post-volt movements and temperament, but he was conquered by this curly teenager from Penelope Pitstop, who brings the dream to an impressive market. The super (dated, perhaps “perpetuated”) soundtrack helps and, of course, the cunning trick, which consists in the fact that the film turns into a resort from everyday life, and does not fantasize at all. 7/10
