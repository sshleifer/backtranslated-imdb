I’m probably a little old for this movie, I’m 16 years old, and being a guy, the story is a little too girl, but I really thought it was a cool movie in general. All the girls in this film are such hot and really wonderful actresses, from Alana to Adriana, Dina, Kimberley, right up to the cute girl who plays Alana’s little sister, Rachel. I'm not a big fan of pop stars with love songs, but I thought that Aaron Carter did a great job on this, and it seems he was in this film, and made him seem real. My mom liked all the old bunches she grew up with, so that's cool too. I kept thinking that I liked a lot of people, and I think, will I see them again? Continuation would be cool. I rented it, but I might buy it as well, since I have a ton of DVDs, and I would like to come back to see something I missed. Although I could not buy it at Blockbuster, so I do not know where I could buy it right now, but I will look at it. Anyway, I'm a 16 year old boy, I already said that, I know, but I would have had a full date to see it. It's really good for all ages, really. I think that even my little half sister, who is 6 years old, could see this. This is what is so great in this, that this is what all ages can see. I'm sure it was made on purpose, but it really works. Girls can dream of being with Aaron Carter, and guys like me can dream of all the hot tiptoes in this movie. Here everyone will find something for themselves.
