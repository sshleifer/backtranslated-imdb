This film was bombed at the box office and in the voting here, but I liked it. One of the indicators of the value of the film is how much it can be remembered after 25 years. I will not bore you with a list, but there are dozens of deeply comic scenes, also a good story and excellent casting. Incompetent robbers - scream. See and judge if he gets on TCM.
