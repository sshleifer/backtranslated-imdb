This film explores in great detail the relationship between a mother who grew up in a Christian environment and found out that appearance is everything. She and her son, who just recently returned from Vietnam, face some very tense issues. Relationships have no close ties and are a great accurate reflection of what it is like to live with someone who is a liar and only looks at the surface of problems. Kathy Bates copes with the image of a woman of false faith, who either does not notice her cruelty, is forgetful, or simply does not want to be faced with. Jeremy is never afraid of anger, and this leads to a very disturbing conflict between him and his feelings about his fathers' love for him. This is a very honest look at some family dynamics after a traumatic event leads to despair.
