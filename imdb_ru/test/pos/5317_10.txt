This film was a masterpiece of human emotions and experience. I think many people are involved in Leland's apparent mental illness as a storyline, but I have been involved in the relationship of many characters and what they show about the power of human emotions. A big part of the filmâ€™s idea is that we will never know the good without the bad, which is a small cliche, but what makes this film so good and so original is that it very eloquently reflects the crushing and destructive power that you can see bad the bad is everywhere, like Leland, or you feel the total helplessness of unrequited love or relationships that simply won't work, no matter how much you want it. This film shows how helpless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than any movie I've seen, and it is as depressing as it is good.
