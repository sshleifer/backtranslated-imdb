Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park, finally came out of their exhausting schedule to talk to the cameras, sipping champagne in their hot tub. At first, watching this, I did not feel as much sarcasm as it was. I knew that they were joking when they complained about various actors in the series, and when Trey said that he was not going to give his mother any part of his money, but everywhere there is so much sarcasm that this documentary is more instrumental full of internal jokes. <br /> <br /> This “documentary” shows everything about South Park (in any case, right up to the second season). It shows what happens behind the scenes with animation and recording. He has interviews, many of which are fake, but some, among all fictions, give an idea of ​​the show. Clips from both Trey Parker's Spirit of Christmas shorts are shown, as well as many good clips from the show. If you were a South Park fan, then it should have quenched your thirst for show knowledge in the end of 1998, when it was done. Now, obviously, the show has changed, but it's still interesting. <br /> <br /> We have a funny documentary where Trey Parker (especially) and Matt Stone act as arrogant assholes, and this is exactly what they wanted to come off as. They may be so in real life, but here it was a joke, a 51-minute insightful joke. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** out ****. 51 minutes Not rated, contains language and sexual content.
