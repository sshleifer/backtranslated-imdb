Tomorrow is not the continuation of Gone with the Wind, but a story about lovers, as well as a surprisingly vigilant and exciting story. For an alleged hack of B-minus traits, such as The Devil Thumbs A Ride, Felix Feist proved that he can fill his work with unexpected, inventive details. Steve Cochran leaves prison after 18 years for killing his cruel father when he was only 13 years old, and now he is still uncertain, clumsy, pubescent, acting in a huge human body. Lonely, he visits the palace 10 cents for the dance and falls in love with the brass, seizing Ruth Roman. But the sudden shooting of her boyfriend-cop makes a poorly chosen couple go on their way, ending up, like Joads, in a California camp of migrant workers. <br /> <br /> Romance is a revelation; in her most famous role as the bride Farley Granger in Hitchcock's Strangers on the Train, she was ill and underused. Here she convincingly modulates the blond dancer-dancer, sacrificing his wife and future mother (and brunette to boot). Cochrane is almost as good, wavering between suspicion of a wounded child and the explosive reactions of a non-socialized man. And the ending, although unconvincing, is nonetheless welcome. Tomorrow Is Another Day, along with "They live at night" and "Gun Crazy", demonstrates the redeeming sweetness and warmth that are contrary to his noir-film lineage.
