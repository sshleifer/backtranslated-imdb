The excellent book by Leslie Karbagi about the "Fleischers" tells the whole story about Fleisher's big move of their entire animation team to Florida and their subsequent expulsion by Paramount. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bug Goes to Town did not destroy the credit of the animation pioneers at Paramount, although this is often said, and this was the favorite version of Paramount. According to Karbagi, a big studio, more than anything else, wanted to get its gloves in an animation studio and completely get rid of the famous quarrels of brothers. Mr. Bug gave them a reason to do just that. - The sad closure of a wonderful, unusual chapter in American animation. <br /> <br /> I would also like to point out that the film actually debuted on December 4, 1941, and not on December 7. Perhaps it was close anyway enough to get things done in terms of national sentiment, undermining the success of the film. But another part of the legend about this troubled little film is that he was killed because he was not lucky to be in theaters at the same time that Dumbo (released on October 23, 1941) was still in a very busy festive business. . I did not conduct a box office survey, but I would say that Dumboâ€™s simultaneous presence in cinemas probably influenced Mr. Bug. During this period, cinema was at its peak of popularity, and successful films could become strong in cinemas over the course of many months. - Something unimaginable on these usually short, fast days on DVD.
