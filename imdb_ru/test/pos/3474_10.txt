Damien O'Donnell has a good track record, and in this film he handles a very sensitive topic with sensitivity, but does not allow the film to become a schmuck. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic movie, its funny with sad beats, and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to see it now - FANTASTIC! <br /> <br /> The game is great and Dublin plays the main role. This film will change your view of people with disabilities, as well as give you a very interesting night at the cinema. I can't wait for it to go on DVD.
