I waited so long to watch this movie, and finally got to yesterday. In the end, I'm glad I finally did. Humor from the wall cheerful. The plot is so incredibly believable that there must be at least some truth in it. If something stood out in this film, this is definitely a coffee house scene. I was there for every guy. You are throwing away. You discover that your ex has deceived some guy who, as you are sure, is an asshole. Now every time you see something for the next few days, you just get terrible thoughts about it, located in all the wrong areas. She fucks everybody and everybody knows it. I could probably watch as this person licks his wallet all the day and walks his finger around him, look back at himself and laugh, that he was there too.
