Since the world has been flooded with so-called comedies over the past ten years or even longer (only a few deserve this name because they are so predictable), King of Queens is a very original, unique and amazingly funny alternation. This is about the daily life of the delivery man and his wife, who works as an assistant attorney in Manhattan in Queens, New York. Together with them lives father Kerry Arthur, an extrovert from the picture book, played by the fantastic Jerry Stiller and who, every time he appears, steals the show from everyone else. Other important people are their best friends Deacon and Kelly, a married couple, and their other friend Spence, who is almost 30 years old and who still lives with his mother. What makes this show so unique and funny is that each character seems so real, and Carrie’s cynical, sarcastic attitude is the exact opposite of Doug’s good-natured, slightly stupid optimism. And Arthur makes him completely unpredictable with his weird ideas and habits. He often gets in trouble, and Doug and Carrie must get him out of the mud. Even if, in my opinion, the quality of the show has decreased slightly in recent years, it still remains one of the best daily sitcoms. It takes a little time to penetrate the characters and relate them to them, but after this is done, you will hear uncontrollable laughter. Although I think that I will not be able to survive with Arthur once in a closed room without knocking the spirit out of him, I really adore him in this show. Watch and have fun, I put 9 out of 10.
