The best movie ever. <br /> <br /> How is it to discord? However, if we look at it from a purely cinematic point of view, it will become clear that Three Colors Red is a masterpiece. It is not enough just to say this - “Three colors of red” is a masterpiece of world cinema. If you admit that Citizen Kane is not human enough, if you admit that Star Wars is not really good, if you admit that Ozu and Mizoguti have to step back, then “Three Colors Red” is the masterpiece times. As a discussion of human morality, Three Colors Red works on a metaphysical level with a depth with which no one can compare. Blue went almost as deep into the human psyche, but he stopped as he was about to pull a rabbit out of a hat. White made us think about the equality of humanity - looking back, it is even better, but still not quite so. Red, however, is the real thing. What he expresses in this film is an expression of what it means to be human. In fact, what he expresses is how a person feels. This forces us to examine the very nature of our souls, our ethical qualities, to the smallest details. In red, you can find the value on one of several levels. At the first level, Red achieves a high level of credibility - we should have no problems calling Red an exceptionally interesting story. However, the coincidences inherent in the film and its vanity, force us to consider the film as a film. As if Keslowski says: "Ceci n'est pas la réalité." In essence, while pursuing a humanistic goal, Keslowski can also challenge reality. This is a trick that Keslowski tried to do since Le Double Vie de Véronique, but only after this, his last film, did he finally achieve this divine interweaving of fate, philosophy and circumstances. Actors and actresses, too, are at the mercy of a great power. Valentine (Irene Jacob) is a good name because she seems to represent almost pure love. Meanwhile, the idea of ​​first impressions is challenged by Judge Jean-Louis Trinitiante Kern, a strange man who eventually becomes an almost all-knowing observer of events - a character who symbolically has the ability to unite the characters. - the ability to make people happy, the power that he can achieve only through Valentine. <br /> <br /> We have the opportunity to see films not just as a series of pictures. In fact, films may have more meaning than literature. Of course, this will not happen, but at least we have the opportunity to watch this film, knowing that it gives us the opportunity to achieve what we cannot determine, but we all have. The synopsis of this film read: "The film is about a woman who knocks down a dog." Well it is. <br /> <br /> Isn’t it? <br /> <br /> - Simon Huxtable <br /> <br />
