Oh my gosh I really like this movie. It's so incredible ... I loved it like a baby, and I still love it like an adult. This is my favorite Disney movie about all the time! You have to watch it, watch it and love it. My friends and I watch it ton ..... It's so good. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart. My favorite part is the song and dance number with all the vagrants and Thomas O'Malley. Writers / producers / directors completely nailed it ... yes, nailed to the wall. <br /> <br /> xoxo ~ wolly ~ xoxo
