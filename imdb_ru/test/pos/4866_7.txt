As I said earlier in previous comments, some programs are designed for Easy Entertainment. Therefore, I am somewhat upset when commentators seem to expect a program that will reveal the meaning of life, you will not get this from Cleopatra 2525, and she does not intend to offer it. You get a girl who was frozen and returned to life after about 500 years, and her adaptation to this new life is realistic. She does not calm down for 10 minutes, as it does with other time-traveling adventures, nor is she the female equivalent of James Bond, who is ready to receive everyone. Cleopatra is overwhelmed by her new environment, and she is afraid of some of the weapons on display, as most of us will be. However, this is light entertainment, the stories have a beginning and an end in fast time, and these are surprisingly good moments of acting. The episode, when a double double takes place in Cleopatra, is especially touching, and Jennifer Sky, I think, gives one of the best ideas that someone has long died, and being a lover of movies and television, I know what I'm talking about. Finally, to prove my sincerity, I bought everything except four episodes, and I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The only reason I do not have the full set is that I bought other episodes before I realized that there was one complete set. Victoria Pratt and Gina Torres adequately complete the trio, and Cleopatra 2525 for light entertainment surely entertained me.
