Pam Greer's gun packaging takes the names and kicks ass like a heroine in the William Girdler entertainment action movie directed by William Girdler directed by William Girdler, Sheb Baby, along with D'Urville Martin and Austin Stoker. Sheba Baby is one of several hard-toe tiptoes that Greer appeared in the 1970s, including Coffy, Foxy Brown and Friday Foster. Short-lived Girdler overnight wrote with producer David Shelton this completely ordinary private eye bowler, which features a stubborn female shamus who refuses to rely on the man who will help her take care of the business. Unfortunately, “Sheba's Baby” is not as good as the breaking films made by Greer under the direction of director Jack Hill. Hill led the African-American native of North Carolina in the films Coffey, Foxy Brown, Big Bird Cage and Big Doll House. Anyone who analyzes the images of African-American women in the cinema should be familiar with these epics. The main problem with Sheba Baby is that our heroine gets too many convenient breaks. Naturally, minor villains are happy clowns who cannot hit the side of the barn with a howitzer. As the main antagonist, Dick Merifild qualifies as a selfish and cunning villain with such lines of choice as: "Everything worth having is worth stealing." In addition, composer Monk Huggins does provide a strong, atmospheric orchestral soundtrack, and the best song featuring Barbara Mason - “Good Man Is Gone”. "Sheba Baby" will play Greer in the role of Chicago sneakers stylist Sheba Shane. She leaves the Windy City to return to her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky to help her father. When she arrives in Louisville, Sheba finds out that her father, Andy (Rudy Challenger from Detroit 9000), is having problems with the local black gangster nicknamed Pilot (spoiling D'Urville Martin's cigars from Hummer) who demands Andy sell your loan company to Pilot or die. <br /> <br /> Initially, the Pilot sends a group of fools to Andy's office, but our hero’s father catches them on the spot. They turn Sheva's father into a punching bag. Interestingly, during the battle, Girdler rarely shows fists breaking flesh. Earlier, Andy’s right-hand man, Brick Williams (Austin Stoker from High Horror), sent Shebe a telegram asking him to return to Louisville, but she didn’t receive it immediately thanks to a lazy partner who did not know where to find her. Brik and Sheba unite, kindle a romantic flame and spend the night in a bag. Brick spends most of his time convincing Sheba to remain calm in the face of adversity. As a former police woman from Louisville, Kentucky, Sheba prefers to shoot first and ask questions second. After she comes home, Sheba borrows her father’s car and barely escapes a blow. When she walks out the door to get into her father's car, Andy gets another worrisome call from Pilot. Previously, Andy refused to discuss the prospects for selling his credit company Pilot, but Andy changed his mind and agreed to talk to the bully. A satisfied pilot warns Andy about dynamite, which was attached to his ignition using a time delay fuse. In other words, starting the car will not cause an explosion; the explosion takes place ten seconds later. Andy and Brick save Sheba before the car explodes. Sheba had previously agreed to let her father deal with her problems without her intervention. “Dad, I know you think I’m doing male work, but I’m not going to sit back because I'm a woman,” Sheva tells him. After his deathbed experience, Sheba vows to find out who sabotaged her father’s car. She screams old contact since she became a cop, and threatens the guy with her gun to extract information. Only after Sheba has sharpened the guy's face in a bucket of chlorine dust, he relents and tells her about the reward in the city railway museum. The brick accompanies Sheba, and the shooting is accompanied by an agitated Pilot running for the skin of his chin. <br /> <br /> Later, the Pilot sends a quintet armed to the teeth of thugs from another city to clean up the garbage Andy Office. These gunners ignore their orders to kill. Not only did they shoot at the loan company’s office in ribbons, but they also shoot Sheba’s father with a Sheba shotgun and retaliate at short notice. Holding a nickel-plated revolver, she kills three of the four Dirty Harry-style attackers. The last killer drops his weapon and asks for mercy. Sheba pulls the trigger when the murder investigation detective Phil Jackson (Charles Kissinger from Abby) and a policeman in uniform arrive at the scene of the incident. At the hospital, Andy Shane dies holding his daughter by the hand. Naturally, the Pilot is furious with this revelation, and his rage borders on apoplexy. After that, Sheba hunts down moneylender Walker (Christopher Joy from Cleopatra Jones) and takes out information about the Pilot from him while she holds him at gunpoint in a car wash. This is one of the best staged scenes with a lot of sinister shots of car wash equipment whirling and humming. Walker warns the pilot about Sheba. The pilot and his minions confront Sheba in the parking lot and switch places. Sheba runs on foot to a nearby carnival. While the policeman is driving one of the pilots into the corner, she is busy with the others. The pilot accidentally shoots one of his own, and Sheba kills him. She attaches the Pilot to a roller coaster track and threatens to keep him there until the roller coaster cuts off his head. The pilot manages to escape after telling Himself about himself and the phone number of the big man, Shark (Dick Merrifield from Hell Cats), whose reputation is so flawless that Detective Jackson describes him as “the guy with everyone” the correct answers. “Sheba Baby” is not first-class Pam Greer. Nevertheless, the idea that our heroine can cope with everything herself, without the help of guys, makes her interesting and interesting.
