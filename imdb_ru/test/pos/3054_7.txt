Since Bette Davis, in 1933, Ex-Lady has not seen a film that was much better than his star said it is! Most of the extraordinary rap "Atoll K", a.k.a. "Utopia", a.k.a "Robinson Crusoeland", a.k.a "Escapeade", obtained over the years, came from the terrible stories that Stan Laurel told about his production. Given that he had a stroke during the shooting, he looked as if death had warmed through most of it (of the first two shots taken together, you never guess that Laurel survived Hardy by eight years), and was diagnosed with diabetes (once he adjusted his diet, respectively, he regained his health), you can understand why Laurel did not think that this film was the most enjoyable experience in his life. Yes, this is a mistake: the cheapness of the production comes to the end, the dubbing is terrible, and Laurel and Hardy were too old to make an energetic farce from their best films. But it’s still really funny, and Leo Joannon’s story presents elements of political satire (sometimes libertarian, sometimes communist) that can be expected from more socially conscious comedians such as Chaplin or the Marx brothers, but never from Laurel and Hardy. The film deserves praise for being different (although his duty to the classic Ealing Studios film “Passport to Pimlico”, shot a year earlier, is pretty obvious) and for integrating the comedies “Laurel and Hardy” into a rather harsh context, different from everything they used before. This is not a very good movie, but it is certainly better than the eight dull ones for Fox and MGM, which they shot in the early 1940s. I suspect that only the technical rudeness of the film prevented him from earning a cult that followed among the anti-tomic youth born during the boom explosion, "The Duck Soup" of the Marx brothers, acquired in the late 1960s / early 1970s.
