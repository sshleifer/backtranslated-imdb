One evening, I wandered into a Blockbuster with a friend, deciding that we were too upset and too lazy to play sports. She decided that she wanted to watch “Klozer”, that it looked like I had to rent another movie so she went to bed. Looking around, I did not see many interesting things, but I saw The Doll Master in the section of new issues. Based on the cover (a woman with a puppet face crying with tears of blood), I thought it would be interesting enough to take it off. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, I watch it in an almost empty place. the house, with all the lights turned off, was pretty scary. I have to admit that I always had a small doll phobia when I was a kid (and watched a terrible film called "Refuge", one of the stories in which the mentally ill doll created, which killed people. and the first three quarters of this film really hit me. In particular, the first half hour was amazing. The terrible atmosphere of premonition really put everything in its place, and without movement the dolls seemed really threatening. But unfortunately, as soon as they began to move, everything became a little stupid, I was a little disappointed when moments that could be really scary made me laugh because they were shot. <br /> <br /> As for characters, this is a horror movie, you do not expect anything memorable. I found that I remembered the names and faces better than most Asian horror films, which I saw, which suggests that there must have been some hidden character development that I consciously did not notice. Typical stereotypes operate in this film, each of which has a kind of character quirk that distinguishes them from others, from the shy and quiet Yong-ha and her doll Damien, to the outgoing fuss Seon-yon. <br /> <br /> The plot itself was pretty cool, although the final, in which many of the free parts of the plot were bought, seemed a bit confused and actually did nothing for me, although there were some really sharp plot twists that I will not destroy here. The main plot is a bunch of children who are invited as dolls by a famous reclusive old-timer, they have to stay in a creepy house (decorated with scary dolls, big or small), and our heroine begins to happen. He-mi begins to explore areas of the house, and things start to happen to other residents. <br /> <br /> In general, I would definitely recommend the film, rather than watching with a lot of people, because some moments probably make you laugh if you are surrounded by friends, but somehow you also see yourself in the dark, the windows and the doors are ajar, just in case the dolls want to see with you. It really makes you guess most of the movie, letting you go to the theories of the wild conspiracy, then completely destroy them. If you really believe this and ignore its lightness in places, I can guarantee that you will check under your bed before going to bed and maybe even leave the lights on. <br /> <br /> Or maybe it's just me: P As for Closer, everything was fine, but I preferred it.
