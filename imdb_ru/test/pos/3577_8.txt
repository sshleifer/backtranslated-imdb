“Bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends,” says Marion Fairlie, who lives with her stepsister Laura in a vast country estate in the middle of the Victorian era. “And last night I ended up in Limmeridge's graveyard. Usually dead people remain dead, as usual, these are criminals who are locked up, not victims. But then what happened to us was nothing normal. ” And we set off to a first-class gothic story of madness, deceit and villainy based on the great novel by Wilkie Collins on Victorian secrets. It is a good idea to pay close attention because there are areas within the plots, but they all focus on a cunning and ruthless scheme that includes, what else, money, a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Marion Fairlee (Tara Fitzgerald) and her sister Laura Fairlee (Justin Waddell) are committed to each other. Marion is tough and protected; Laura is softer and more romantic. Marion has no money of her own; Laura will inherit wealth when she comes of age. Marion has no prospect of marriage, of which we are aware; Laura was promised some time ago to Sir Percival Glide (James Wilby), a too charming aristocrat. They are the wards of his uncle, a fussy, indulgent, extremely selfish hypochondriac (Ian Richardson). Everything seems rather trivial, but then a young artist, Walter Hartwright (Andrew Lincoln), draws them to drawing and artistic appreciation. And when he arrives at the local railway station at night, there is no wagon, so he goes on foot to the manor. In a dark forest, he meets a strange woman dressed in all white, wandering and talking about things he does not understand, who then disappear. Are we worried? Yes, and he and the sisters understand that the strange woman is very similar to Laura. Does love come later between Walter and Laura? Does the bud bloom? Is there a misunderstanding that sends Walter away and causes Laura to marry Sir Percival? An ulcer nibbles? And gradually, secrets are uncovered about the relationship between Laura, Marian and the woman in white ... will we learn to be deeply suspicious of the intentions of Sir Percival? Count Fosco (Simon Callow) ... and do we finally understand the dirty depth of depravity, as well as the power of honor and true love, which humanity can do? Do we go to Victorian lunatic asylums, see falls from high towers, dig up open graves in the middle of the night and observe retribution among the roaring flames of a locked church? <br /> <br /> Well, of course, and this is a great journey for us. <br /> <br /> This BBC / Masterpiece Theater program is distinguished for its excellent play and outstanding performance. To fit Collins’s 500-odd-page novel on a television show of less than 120 minutes, it was necessary to shorten or shorten a significant part of the deal, and some changes were more likely to achieve greater effect in limited time. Nevertheless, if to take alone, the play “Woman in White”, in my opinion, is very good as a capricious, romantic, gloomy television fairy tale. Tara Fitzgerald in the role of Marion plays the command role of a woman who decides to protect and then save her sister. James Wilby, like Sir Percival, controls the clever feat, slowly allowing us to see the spoiled mucus under the skin, which still has charm among the evil deeds. Ian Richardson, like an uncle of young women, almost steals the show. He gives such an overbearing and sharp performance that it hardly balances the story every time it appears. Perhaps the weakest of the main parts is Simon Callow in the role of Count Fosco. The count is just a monster, but at the same time extremely civilized and charming. Collins described it as a huge girth. Callow does it well, but I miss the evil monsters. <br /> <br /> At some point, Marian tells us: “My sister and I love Gothic novels so much that sometimes we act as if we are in them.” Little did she know she was waiting for her and Laura.
