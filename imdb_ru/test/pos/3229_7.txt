Fuckland is an interesting movie. I personally love the dogma movement. I wish it lasted longer. It seems already dead. Many critics have tried their best to close it. I do not know why. This is the most interesting movement in the cinematic world since the days of the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland, I saw the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne and Mifune. They were all great, in my opinion, Festen was a masterpiece. Fuckland is not up to those others. I was just fascinated by the film industry. It plays as if it were a real documentary, with a real person who was so obsessed with his camera that he refused to shoot it. In a few moments of the film it becomes clear that this is a work of complete fiction, but this illusion dragged on for an amazing amount of time. I would like the filmmakers to come up with something more interesting to show on the screen. This is mainly about this guy, Fabian, who is an Argentine visiting Falkland Islands. Argentines only in the last couple of months have been admitted to the islands, and Fabian plans to saturate women with Argentine children. He looks at her alone, and most of the film goes to her seduction. Two actors are very natural. Camilla Heaney only hints that she is an actress. Fabian Stratas seems absolutely real. The film’s policy confuses me somewhat, as I only have an idea of ​​the situation around the island and its recent history. I was 3 years old, I think, when the Falklands were invaded. The last bit of the movie does not work at all. I do not understand what the filmmakers expected. However, Fuckland is an interesting experiment on dogma. However, this violates some of the rules of dogma, in particular, the rule of the absence of extradiagetic music. This is a lot. 7/10.
