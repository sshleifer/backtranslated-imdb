This is a film about music that now sounds in Istanbul. Istanbul was the center of the two superpowers of the Old World, Byzantium and the Ottoman Empire. Today it is a metropolis with a population of almost 10 million people. Therefore, no one is surprised that there is a lot of music in Istanbul with a large variety of voices, styles and influences from around the world. Of course, this is Turkish music, and I have been fascinated by Turkish music since I bought my first record a long time ago. The film involves various singers, instrumentalists and groups. The comments made by the musicians perfectly illustrate the music being played and the social context in modern Turkey. From my point of view, the most interesting comments were from Orhan Gensbey. In addition, the films show cityscapes mainly from Istanbul, which are very pleasant to watch. <br /> <br /> “Crossing the Bridge” is indicated as a documentary and includes minority music, such as the Kurds and the Roma. Other important topics are omitted, such as Turkish jazz music or Armenian and Greek music. <br /> <br /> This film is highly recommended for lovers of music and culture in Turkey, the Balkans, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. It can also be useful to those interested in global effects of musical styles, such as rock and roll or hip hop.
