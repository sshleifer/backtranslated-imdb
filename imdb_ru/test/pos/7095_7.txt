What struck me most about One True Thing was how sincere she was when her daughter mentioned her mother’s cancer at the beginning of the movie. No matter how sad the topic was, it was a refreshing change of pace, and not a stunned revelation about the deadly illness of the character 2/3 in the film (“Love Story”, “Conditions of Tenderness”, etc.) <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and William Hurt give very strong performances that do not go beyond. The characters they play seem human; they are not perfect people. (It can be argued that this cannot be said of a character like “Martha Stewart” who is played by Streep, but throughout the entire film I found her character to be noble in an insatiable way. <br /> “One true thing” is an observant, nonsentimental family drama, in which the tears at the end were deserved.
