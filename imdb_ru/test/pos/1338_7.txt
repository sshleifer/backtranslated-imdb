This film is the most traumatic and painful horror film I have ever seen in my life. To know that this film is based on a true story, and to watch Jeffrey Dahmer (Karl Crew) brutally kill his victims, enough to cause a tear in my eye. I admit that it was a low-budget film with not the best dialogue, but he explained why Jeffrey Dahmer was a psychomaniac. Because he was so selfish / inwardly emotional, his emotions and egoism so deeply penetrated his brain that he became a murderer. To every person he lured back to his apartment, he was attracted and had feelings, and the reasons for which he killed them were caused not only by the thrill of their murder, but also by the fact that he could not cope with the fact that they left him. In the scene, when he killed his first victim, after hitting the guy with the object, I noticed that it was not because he wanted to kill him, but because he was devastated by the thought that the guy would leave him. It was after this that he became accustomed to suicidal behavior and committed murder by his hobby - for evil and emotional reasons. <br /> <br /> The scene when he was talking, crying on the phone with his mother and telling her How much he loved her, and the love he showed to his grandmother, and how he did not want to leave her home showed that there was love in his heart. One scene, which I found rather frightening and strange, was when the priest overheard Jeffrey in the pub, inviting the guy to his apartment, and then called Jeffrey in the phone booth in the pub, so the guy lost patience and changed his mind about going home with Jeffrey. When the guy left the pub, the priest hung up and laughed at Jeffrey. I also discovered that Carl Crew played a wonderful acting role in the role of Jeffrey Dahmer. His evil and cold-blooded facial expressions before he killed his victims were so real that I was trembling in my chair. His facial expression reminded me of how Vincent D'Onofrio (Private Pyle / Leonard) in the movie “Full Metal Jacket” looked shortly before he shot the general in the toilet barracks. <br /> <br /> If your emotional person, I would not advise you to watch this movie, but if not, then watch it.
