On June 14, 1905, during the Russian revolution of that year, the sailors on the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their oppressive officers. Disappointed with the second-class treatment they receive, and, in particular, with the larvae-infected meat they are forced to eat, the crew of the ship, led by the inspiring Bolshevik sailor Grigory Vakulinuk (Alexander Antonov), decides that the time has come for a revolution. And so begins the incendiary classic of Russian propaganda by Sergei M. Eisenstein "The Battleship Potemkin / The Battleship Potemkin". <br /> <br /> The film itself is full of vivid examples of stunning visual images: the glasses of the overthrown captain of the ship delicately hang from the side rope on which he was thrown; the body of the deceased rebel peacefully lies on the shore, on his chest is the inscription with the inscription "Killed from the bowl of soup"; a close-up of the clenching fists of hundreds of viewers who are finally fed up with the royal regime; the wayward baby carriage goes up the steps of Odessa when desperate viewers hold their breath (this scene was unforgettably “borrowed” by Brian De Palma for a particularly intense scene in his “The Untouchables”); barrels with numerous canons ominously aligned with respect to the far superior numerical battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> However, the film itself is best analyzed ?? not like a fragmentary selection of memorable scenes ?? but as a separate film, and, indeed, every scene is extremely memorable. Although the entire film is divided into five rather different chapters, it moves wonderfully forward; in no way do we lose interest, and we have absolutely no doubt which side we should treat with sympathy. <br /> <br /> The film is often called “propaganda,” and this is exactly what it is, but it does not have to have a negative connotation. "Battleship Potemkin" was created by Eisenstein with a specific goal, and he copes with this task perfectly in all respects. It is planned that the Soviet Central Committee will coincide with the celebration of the 20th century unsuccessful revolution of 1905. "Potemkin" was to become a popular film in his native country, symbolizing the revival of Russian art after the revolution. In a sense, it is regrettable that Eisenstein’s film was not able to play well at the Russian box office, which was reportedly beaten by Allan Dwan’s 1922 film “Robin Hood” in its first week and lasted only four short weeks. Fortunately, despite the fact that the “Battleship Potemkin” was banned in different countries in different cases, it turned out to be more delightful abroad. <br /> <br /> The film also proved to be a successful test for Eisenstein of his “montage” theory. Thanks to the fast editing and distant frames of many additions, viewers are not allowed to sympathize with any individual characters, but with the revolutionary population as a whole. However, Eisenstein briefly violates this order in the scene, where Vakulinchuk flees from the officer of the ship who tries to kill him, and, of course, during the famous sequence of Odessa steps, when our hearts are beating in horror about the life of the unfortunate child. in a fallen baby carriage. The accompanying soundtrack to the version, which I watched, mainly with the participation of Dmitry Shostakovich's orchestral works, served miraculously to enhance the emotional impact of such scenes. <br /> <br /> One of the greatest films of the era of silence "Sea Battle" Potemkin - the triumph of phenomenal filmmaking and a significant piece of cinematic history. The greatly exaggerated events of the film (among other things, there was never any cruel reprisal on the Odessa steps) are so fully rooted in the memory that we are often not sure of the true story behind the events depicted. This is a great achievement.
