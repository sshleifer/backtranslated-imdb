In fact, only jokes were added to the story, not mixed or deleted content! <br /> <br /> For example, the Egyptian slave Cellularis who had difficulties with the transfer, LOL! Or when Tidivinnus was played as quasi-Sith and was annoyed when the Roman Empire suffered a blow, the general ordered the Empire ...? Oh, watch the movie! <br /> <br /> I can easily believe that this picture was one of the most expensive in the history of French cinema, and, for my part, it was worth it, Depardieu was excellent in the role of the Romans and the hogs. thunder Obelix. Clavier, who plays the small, indomitable Gaul, was beautiful and far from his days in the role of clumsy squire Jean Reno in Just Visiting. <br /> <br /> The fight scene between Artifis and Edifis was fun and good, see “The Matrix” was not borrowed to spoil the perfect battle! <br /> <br /> The redboard and his team almost stole the painting, from the sinking of their own ship to the Otis engine. ”(Edifis' Assistant) the invention was used at the very end. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are Asterix and the Olympic Games with many of the same team back from Toutatis, I plan to watch this too!
