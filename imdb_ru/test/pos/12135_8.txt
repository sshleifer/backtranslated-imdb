So you think you saw all the mafia movies you ever made! Here is one about which no one has heard. This is a low-budget, fast-moving film shot in the swamps of Jersey. For us, fans of mobs, there was a bit of everything - sex, violence, swearing and wise guys acting like "gafones". While violence dominated the film, I laughed at some familiar scenes that I have since seen on the Sopranos and Goodfellas. Look for the 1977 version of Badabing Girls at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> All our favorite gangster stereotypes were shown here. And, as for realism, "fugettaboutit"! Joe Sands was great, portraying the classic character of a sage, as we have seen him many times over the years. It was probably his first shot, and it was a gem. Pesci fans should run to the video store to check out this click. You must carefully search for it, as it is called under various names. My copy called it "Family Enforcement." Here he is known as the "death collector". But whatever it is called, it should be called - Winner.
