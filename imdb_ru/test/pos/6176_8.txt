This is a brilliant, luxurious Czech film from the team of father and son Sverak, which tells about two Czech pilots who flee to England to help the Air Force in the battle for Britain, but also fall out because of a woman (beautiful Tara Fitzgerald). Features excellent and incredibly realistic aerial combat scenes ?? probably the best and much better than Pearl Harbor or even the Battle of Britain film, and a whole host of interesting common topics such as love, war, romance, friendship, loss and slavery. In addition, the trials and hardships of moving abroad and learning a foreign language (although it is easier here with a large, tall Anna Massey). <br /> <br /> The film has some great little motifs, such as the world-famous RAF bull-eye device, shown everywhere and beautifully reflected at some point in a black vinyl record circling around (music is another theme of the film, of course). Plus, all the traditional icons of English life: dimples for beer (as opposed to the post-war straight glasses used at Pearl Harbor), tea in the beautiful Chinese tea service in the English country garden (though it was filmed in the Czech Republic?), Dog-mascot , vintage HP sauce bottle, even a dart board! <br /> <br /> Of course, the airfield and its surroundings are ridiculously different from any of the south of England, although the virtuouso's air flow compensates for this by showing Eastbourne and the Seven Sisters, always synonymous with southern England and the Battle of Britain. But best of all is the sensational music from Ondrei Soukup, as good as Hans Zimmer, but according to the tradition of the late, excellent Ron Goodwin, who won the original film “Battle of Britain” among other classic English war films. Is there even a good little cameo role for apparently ?? famous Czech musician and actor (and Kevin Kline, double) Aldrich Kaiser, who plays the title song Dark Blue Sky. Fine! <br /> <br /> He has some dirty, but funny little Freudian devices, for example, always showing a swollen condom floating near the ceiling when Karel (nice but shiny Christophe Hadek) gets stuck on the airfield while his Love Opponent and another pilot František (Ondrej Vetchi) with Susan. <br /> <br /> Another great english actor in this movie! Charles Dance is, of course, good as a wing commander Bentley. <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended and worth a look / hire ?? get a DVD with special features (for example, how they created dog fights and stuff). Probably the only film ever combining subtitles with characters speaking English, German, French and Czech at the same time.
