Jacob Goodnight, a dangerous psychopathic killer, is hiding in an abandoned and rotting Blackwell Hotel, one on one with his nightmares, until eight juvenile offenders appear in public works along with a policeman who wounded Jacob four years ago. When one of them was kidnapped by the killer and her fate is uncertain, the rest of the petty criminals do not have to fight for their lives ... "Watch No Evil" were directed to porn film director Gregory the Dark and WWE star superstar Kane as a ruthless psychopath.The support cast is terrible and there are no surprises here, but there is enough cruelty and bloodshed for lovers of slasher to enjoy. In general, I liked this movie, and you should, too, if you like pointless slashers. Of course, this is a cliche, but who cares. 7 of 10
