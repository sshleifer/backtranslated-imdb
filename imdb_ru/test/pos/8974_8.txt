Nice to see comedy for adults. Masterfully structured by Aaron Sorkin thanks to Mike Nichols' own skills. Mr. Nicholas's skill is to present the characters in all their shocking truth, from the sad and exciting Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf" to the sad and exciting Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Jude Law and Nathalie Portman in "Closer "". In Charlie Wilson's War, the shocking truth goes beyond the characters, while the sad and captivating Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams are doing something else, it's personal only until a certain point. Hanks has to bury her brilliance in single malts, and Julia Roberts has parties and introduces characters with frank bluntness. Amy Adams testifies and exists as a character, a witness, an irresistible challenge that Miss Adams manages to overcome is wonderful. However, this is the monopoly of Philip Seymour Hoffman with t, monopolized my attention. His character may not be the first, but this is the first way that Hoffman introduced him to us. Someone who is experiencing the neglect with which he is treated with the absolute conviction that he is smarter than everyone else. Hoffman is great. The tempo of the tale helps a lot to not get into a myriad of useless questions. Harsh, short, smart, sad comedy, and when was the last time I could say that?
