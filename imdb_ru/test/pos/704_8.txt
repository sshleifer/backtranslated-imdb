“Desperate” (1943) is a real classic not because of its history (which is quite ordinary), but because of the technical elements of production. It was a landmark western, the largest in the entire history of its release, and even more unique because it was a Colombian production - a lightweight studio with an unsurpassed reputation. Only "Jesse James" Fox (also starring Randolph Scott) a few years earlier gave such a luxurious approach to the genre. Although the Seekers and Noon overshadowed him a few years later, the Desperate were an innovative effort and a historic treasure. <br /> <br /> In 1863, the economy in Red Valley, Utah, was based on the collection and sale of wild horses of the Union Army. The script is a bit confused here with links to the railroad (which was Utah’s future a few years later) and Custer’s last battle (Caster was busy fighting Stuart in Pennsylvania at the time), but these are not important plot elements. <br /> <br /> There is an honest sheriff Steve Upton (Scott) in Red Valley, but a banker and several citizens are corrupt; rob your bank every time the government pays for the herd of horses. The city is visited by Cheyenne Rogers (Glenn Ford), the famous criminal, a longtime friend of Steve. He wants to go straight, especially after falling in love with the rather stable stable owner Alison MacLeod (Evelyn Case). Partner Cheyenne "Nitro" Rankin (Guinn "Big Boy" Williams) is mostly for comic relief, like Uncle Willie MacLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and the city judge (Raymond Wolburn, who models his character on Frank Morgan's crystal ball "The Wizard of Oz" cheater). <br /> <br /> Without risking a huge budget, Colombia filled this stuff with lots of action movies and all the elements of western cinema, except for Indians and boxcars. This is the best crush of wild horses ever filmed, an exciting bar fight, explosive climax, romance and tricolor technicolor. All these things are not necessarily combined with each other, but who would care about it in 1943. Unity is a problem, as it tries to be both serious fighter and comedy. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was probably the best at the time of filming. The scenes in the room are solid, but this is a naturalistic picture in the open air, which is really impressive; and lyrical static shots and a moving camera shooting action sequences. <br /> <br /> Scott and Claire Trevor were on top of the bill, but the studio clearly wanted to promote Ford, which will soon become their biggest star. And director Charles Widor used this film to demonstrate his new wife Kiz (whose image of Scarlett's sister in Gone With the Wind was more associated with the audience than any small part in the history of films). <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the Ford Keyes is the most unique and important feature of the Desperate. Instead of going on the “love triangle” cliché with Scott and / or Trevor (which seems to happen for the first time), the entire romantic focus is on two young actors. It was probably the best role Kiz ever got, and she makes the most of it. Plays for a dirty, but extremely sexy young woman who looks great in both leather pants and dresses, and who goes and fights like Keira Knightley's character in Pirates of the Caribbean. It was revolutionary at the time and coincided with the formation of the 1942 WAAC for military service of the Second World War. <br /> <br /> “Desperate” is one film that has been well taken care of, and the print looks completely new. Unfortunately, there are no special features on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
