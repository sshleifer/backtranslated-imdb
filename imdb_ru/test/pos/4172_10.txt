Symbolism is abundant, great melodies, this film has crushed the expectations of the target audience "soon there will be no more." These monkeys and naturally selected members of the group witnessed a subtle, but still goodbye kiss to each other. Today's message rings true, the cell you are escaping from, and the bridge you want to jump from is a disappointment for future generations, there will always be new children in the block, replacing those who break free from the chains. Sometimes the film can be frustrating, because the themes that are being attacked by the films are so distinctly different from the American way of life that a thinking and reasoning person cannot but look at his reflection in the scenes of Khed and question not only his personal motives for the continuation of the madness of everyday American life, but the motives of those who want this to continue in the name of madness. The final scene, similar to Don Quixote's knightly impudence in search of a tiger in a battle cage, shows how crazy and impossible most dreams are.
