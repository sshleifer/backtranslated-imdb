I saw this film at a festival in the lowlands (August 23, 24, 25) after a friend of mine said it was a very cool movie about the history of skating. I did not know what to expect from this film. Was it recorded by a pair of skaters who thought they could do a couple of cool stunts, or was it a skating documentary. <br /> <br /> I entered, having waited for about an hour, without any waiting. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a good job about starting skateboarding. It started with a marshmallow team, which was an excellent group of surfers. This happens in a not very good living area. At some point, the waves are no longer so good for surfing. Therefore, they are trying something else. skateboarding was a fact. <br /> <br /> If you were part of a marshmallow team at the time, you were one of the coolest guys / girls. Because many people saw an escape from the place where they lived, with a team of marshmallows. So now they tried all the new skateboard tricks. <br /> <br /> Soon skateboarding became popular again. There were several competitions and one national competition. The marshmallow team participated in several competitions, as well as nationally. But what they did on skateboards was incredible. But the jury did not know how to judge them. Therefore, they put the whole world of skateboarding on the head. <br /> <br /> In any case, I can tell you the rest of the movie / documentary, but you have to see it with my own eyes. Because then you can feel the atmosphere of this film. This film has become very stylish for me, so I rewarded it 8. <br /> <br /> Greetings from gijs and the rest of Holland. See you later.
