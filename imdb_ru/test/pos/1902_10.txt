Dolemite may not have been the first black explosion of exploitation to appear, but this is certainly one of the best. This is the main film in the “Black Exploitation” genre, as it caused a dramatic shift between films that were before it, unlike films that appeared after it. It was not necessarily a shrill or touching film about black culture, and it was a struggle to overcome problems like racism or something more important, but it was a story about how one wicked dude fought “white” with his hot Kung army. Fu mothers. It was a guilty pleasure, great pleasure and best to watch it with friends. (10 out of 10)
