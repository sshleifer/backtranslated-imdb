This is not from my favorite Hitchcock movies, although I have to admit that it is still pretty good. Among the things I really liked was the presence of Jimmy Stewart (he always improves even the most mediocre stuff) and an incredibly scary assassin (which looks like a skeleton with a thin layer of skin stretched over it). Although it cost the studio a lot of money, I didn’t care much about Doris Day in the film — she seemed to cry a lot and shouted out “Que Sera” as a protector. Yes, I know that she had to sing in this way, but it made me hate this song forever. Excuse me. <br /> <br /> Another complaint, albeit a minor one, concerned the film that it was a bit “too polished” and “Hollywood-style”. The original version (also made by Hitchcock) seemed much darker and disgusting - and it added to the scary atmosphere.
