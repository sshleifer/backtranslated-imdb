Begotten is one of the most unique films I've ever seen. For me, this is more a study of sound, light and darkness and movement than the real story. What you see in the video in a museum of modern art than in the cinema of a local theater. I will not try to interpret the images of mother nature, the animals in the cloaks, the perverted and tormented body of her "child." Some things just can not be interpreted.
