It was the first Mickey Mouse cartoon and the first cartoon with sound. It was based on a silent film called "Steamboat Bill Jr." Buster Keaton starring. Returning to this early short story about Mickey, Mickey did not speak and did not have gloves. He could just whistle and play music. The song he played was Turkey in the Straw, in which several cattle were used as musical instruments. He plays cow's teeth like a xylophone and plays on the nipples of a nursing sow, like on an accordion keyboard. Captain Pete, however, is very angry and forces Mickey to peel potatoes in the galley. Pita's parrot flies to the window and orders him to peel the potatoes. Mickey throws a semi-peeled potato into a parrot and laughs, closing the cartoon. I managed to record this cartoon on tape, and I really like it. I think Disney shorts are much better than feature films.
