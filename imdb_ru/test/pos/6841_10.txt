Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Carla Gugino and Gil Bellows are admired in this sexy caper. This film is smart, the edge of your entertainment for adults, and what a relief these days are great conceptually predictable cartoons. Great music and camera work complement the fun of this puzzle in New Orleans. Highly recommended. Ten stars!
