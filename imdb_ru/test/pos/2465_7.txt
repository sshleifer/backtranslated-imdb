Emilio Estevez actually shot a good movie - who would have thought? I watched two previous films shot by Esteves, “Wisdom” (with then-girlfriend Demi Moore) and “Men at work” (with brother Charlie Sheen). These are lousy films - bad acting, directorial, stupid and offensive. Estevez is a good actor, but a lousy director. I turned it on out of pure curiosity - he has a great cast, and I had nothing more to do. Damn him if he doesn't drag me out. <br /> <br /> This refers to the fact that Estevez, who is returning home from Vietnam, has suffered forever from what happened there. His parents (Katie Bates, Martin Sheen) and sister (Kimberly Williams) try to contact him, but cannot. Something in Vietnam has deeply affected him ... and it is about to explode ... <br /> <br /> A little too long, but still very good. Many materials are familiar, but the actors are so good that they seem new. Estevez is good, Shin is awesome (and Estevez's real father), Williams is touching, and Bates is just unusual - trying to rally the family. All this leads to a powerful finale, which REALLY surprised me. <br /> <br /> Worth catching. <br /> <br />
