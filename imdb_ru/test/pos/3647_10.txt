In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester moves from collecting garbage cans to becoming a haven on a cruise ship, which, as it turned out, carries a certain canary and grandmother, its owner. Uh-oh! Once again, Tweety and Grandma provide many obstacles to a cat trying to catch a bird. Sylvester also got seasickness several times. And the second time, when a cat with a red nose goes to a place on the ship, where there is something that cures his illness, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can blow up fire! Iâ€™ll stop here and say that this is another great cartoon shot by Frieze Freeling in the lead role in a popular duet with birds and birds. Tweety's S.O.S is highly recommended.
