This film was fun from start to finish. Everyone in the cinema laughed out loud throughout the entire movie !! The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, a girl from Will and Grace) and Tanya Manicursh (Debi Mazar). They had better lines, better relationships, etc. Jada Pinkett playing a lesbian was really funny, she really played it well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the film was that the other two main characters were not so funny, although the film was centered around them ........ In general, this is a great film that you can watch and see your girls (yes guys, this is a movie about girls through and through!). Enjoy!!!
