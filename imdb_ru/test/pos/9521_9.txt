Starting from the scene “My name is Joe” in Alcoholics Anonymous, tBM career turns into an insane spiral of infidelity, double standards and secret affairs. but what do you expect from a family of lawyers? <br /> <br /> A really funny film in which some of the most outrageous characters from the Time of the Birdcage, plot and plot are interwoven with surrealistic scenes of the decadent Parisian life at a wedding reception in the men's room, where the grandmother of the bride and her irresponsible friend smoking drugs and joking with blue jokes? No, me too!), Leading to the final scene of almost Arcadian symbolism. <br /> <br /> Great.
