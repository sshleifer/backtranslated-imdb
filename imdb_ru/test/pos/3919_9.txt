I usually give horror movies around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. The House of Wax was by far the best horror movie I've ever seen ... Even better than Amityville's Horror. <br /> <br /> Paris Hilton was good at this and I have to say that she has a good future. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I'll just say how she dies ... <br /> <br /> She has a giant pillar right between her eyes, and they are close-ups and everything. Burn, huh? Brian Van Holt was very good as a killer, Beau and Vincent (Vincent had long hair). He usually plays a mean-spirited cop or soldier, but he succeeded in that. <br /> <br /> Eliza Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray also played the role of Carly and Nick Jones perfectly. Nick was in the spotlight in the first half of the film, then Eliza stole it, suffering a lot of pain in the second half, such as cutting off a finger, tearing lips after they had stuck together, and a direct blow. in the face of Bo. <br /> <br /> In general, I give this film 8/10. Horror movies MUST see this.
