So this is not a winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to watch a movie that was just stupid? "Villain", and this one can head the list. My husband says that “Jekyll and Hyde are together again” is one of those films that, if “you were there and done it,” will think that this is a parody of the 80s cocaine culture is a riot. I think the whole movie is just fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes ... There are constant jokes that need to be monitored to evaluate. To say that the film does not follow the book would be true, but then many really good films will allow themselves and the word published. I recommend this movie to all the old "stoners" among us. We can be smarter now, but we still know and laugh at the many people we knew (ourselves?) In earlier times.
