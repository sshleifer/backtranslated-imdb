This is a deep and touching work on the creation of art, which is a unique person and cannot be created by nature, at the cost of genius and the search for transcendence, and that which ultimately makes up the family, that is, all of us. I was very touched by the family discussion that Nathaniel spent with his sisters about their father’s shortcomings, as he was in a beautiful house that seemed to radiate heat that Lou had created. And although Esther seems so cold in her discussion about Lou’s inability to make money, you can appreciate how she in many aspects of his life opposed his motivations. Nathaniel did a great job, showing how all the people in Lou's life fit in and completed it and become as much of his work as his own genius. Yes, or maybe, especially, our failures make us who we are. And of course there are buildings. I knew only Lou Kahn by name and did not associate his name with his works, they are evidence of grace. Maybe someday there will be a building into which we will all fit, and it will certainly resemble the building of Lou Kahn, perhaps not a built temple in Jerusalem. Perhaps there is salvation
