This is an excellent film with an underestimation, and Rip Torn, known as he, is an actor with a serious underestimation. I read Howard Frank Mosher’s novel many years ago. How well Craven captures the book and the beauty of the northeast kingdom of Vermont! I was fortunate enough to grow in BT in the 40s – 50s, and I still lived there when the “Irasburg Incident” occurred. I have not seen The Wanderer in the Kingdom, the collaboration between Craven and Mosher based on this incident (and another Mosher novel), but this film inspired me to do so.
