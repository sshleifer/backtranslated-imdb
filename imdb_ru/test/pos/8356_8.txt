Where should I start? Walt Disney’s happiest film “The Lady and the Tramp” is one of, if not possible, my favorite in the theatrical canon of Disney animation. Continuing, however, ... to say the least, is pleasant. I enjoyed the whole movie. It was (fire shield!) Amazing! The Broadway style of songs and movies partly worked, and I sang songs until the end of the night. I can, if you ask me, still sing all the songs. <br /> <br /> But where the film was (really) good for me, it was bad in many other places. At times the animation was pretty scary. Every time someone shot a face at close range, I don’t know ... it just seemed scary to me. Besides, where the hell is a lady? She becomes like two lines of dialogue, and only a dog hugs Scampa at the end. She has 0% interaction with the plot and her only son! <br /> <br /> But overall I liked it. Compared to the original, it can withstand? Not. The songs are not so good (although they are still striking), the plot was much less confusing, the Lady had almost nothing to do with it, and he was not as cute as the first. But, if you enter with an open mind, you will have fun, and perhaps “gasp!” Like it?
