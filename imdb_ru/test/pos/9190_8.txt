Fado is a sad, almost bluesy style of Portuguese gypsy music, which is repeatedly featured in the film. As one of the main characters (Igor) explained, this also means fate. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it is fate that unites the two main characters Paco and Alex and causes problems. <br /> <br /> Overall I really enjoyed it. It starts as a “drama / road” film about “ups and downs” and turns into an exciting thriller / road film. <br /> <br /> There were two things that I found unrealistic that prevented me from giving him a higher rating (I gave him 8). First of all, the main thing is why Alex gave up things. She so desperately needed money to sell her passport for a small amount, and then distributed her things to thousands of people to a stranger? Her explanation was inconclusive. Also, how did they get through the gate, where were the police?
