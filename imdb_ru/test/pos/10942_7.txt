The fun combination of vampires and martial arts is a bit random, and the actions of those who voiced voices are almost universally bad, but the premise is attractive, the battle scenes are quick and catchy, and the film is often quite funny. There are a couple of places where I had no idea what had just happened, it was almost as if five minutes had just been cut off, and you suddenly found yourself on the next scene, not knowing how you got there. The film does not explain well, and some things do not make much sense, but the film moves quickly, so its flaws are barely noticeable. Not a very good movie, but definitely fun.
