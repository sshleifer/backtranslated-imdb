First of all, I would like to say that I am just a fan of commenting on films, and that English is not my native language, but I felt a strong feeling that makes me write about such a film; perhaps as a way to thank and thank K. Jay Cox, the cast and crew for such a brilliant performance. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I saw The Last Days for the first time. <br /> <br /> At first I thought it might be like the movie “The Priest,” which I really liked for showing a gay priest from the closet. But the “Priest,” perhaps because of his limited Catholic ideological views, did not satisfy the needs of my viewer, revealing a deep, sad end. <br /> <br /> “Last days”, on the other hand, broke this concept (and some others, such as the principles of Mormons); presenting a tender and cheerful story, bringing it to a happy and emotional end, and at the same time evoking a feeling of God's blessing and hope. Really great movie! <br /> <br /> Somehow the “Last Days” made me feel like LA like a city of angels. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone who loves strikingly beautiful gay love stories!
