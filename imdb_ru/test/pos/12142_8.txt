I only saw half a dozen films with Lino Ventura starring, but this one seems very similar to the others. He plays a laconic criminal - one who has few words, and he is conquered, but sometimes exploded. Given his quiet personality in films like ARMY OF SHADOWS and SECOND BREATH, I noticed that his minimalist style of play is extremely effective. In other words, because he is so quiet and well-mannered, when he does bad things, you tend to notice. And, like in other films, he also has a very strong, albeit perverted moral code. <br /> <br /> Abel Davos (Ventura) and his partner Lilan both live in Italy and are professional criminals. Both grew up in France and were eventually forced to flee because of their criminal activities. Now in Italy, as the film begins, they continue to live as bandits, and the heat is coming to them. Strangely enough, instead of fleeing to a third country, they decide to return to France - although Davos was convicted and convicted in absentia - and if he is caught, it could mean life in prison or the death penalty. Much of the first third of the film concerns their hidden return. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Davos, the return does not go perfectly and now it seems that every policeman in France is looking for him. In addition, the reaction of his old countrymen to a crime is not at all the same as he expected. In fact, their cool response to his return leads to a series of terrible events happening at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> On the way, Davos meets and takes on my stranger, Eric Stark (Jean Paul Belmondo). Despite the fact that there seems to be no friends in Davos, Stark and his girlfriend do their best to make his return a success. What throws another wrench at this is that two very young sons of Davos - what does Davos have to do with them - keep them with him in his stash? <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very good crime film, like the French film Noir. Unlike American Noir, many French versions that I have seen have a more realistic and gloomy look at them. Fatalism reigns supreme, that's for sure! The game is excellent (especially from Ventura and Belmondo), the direction is very confident and the script is very pleasant, although I am sure that many will not like the final. It seems that it seems like a belated thought. I understood why they did it, but I also see how this can leave many unsatisfied. As for me, it made me a little flat. The rest is an exceptional movie.
