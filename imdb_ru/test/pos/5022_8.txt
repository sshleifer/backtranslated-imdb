I traveled a lot, both on business and as a tourist. For both types, I assure you, the best advice is also the oldest: always drink country wine. In this film, the archangel Michael comes to earth on business, quickly wraps him up and decides to walk a little. Boy! "Does he drink the wine of the land"? <br /> <br /> Can a person be drunk forever because of alcohol, love and fights? <br /> <br /> He rises in the morning in the morning, and he lies nights. <br /> <br /> This is something that cannot be done in heaven, so he enjoys them while he is here! Of course, it turns out that he had several other tasks, and, if he is not as frank with them as about the first, he is just as successful. The final scene is a bit silly, but it's also great. Jean Stapleton begins to dance with John Travolta.
