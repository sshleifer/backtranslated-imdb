I watched this when it was first shown, and then missed it when it disappeared from British screens. This showed another side of Old Australia that we should see more. A good comparison of old hands and young Turks. Then the realism of a stiff back was fantastic. It was sadly missed. This show was a cold look at the old look at Australia. It is difficult to live and work hard. The young idealist is faced with an old practical head. A real politician fights with young upcoming New Labor To add a modern political language. <br /> <br /> This was the first of its kind show that I didnâ€™t try to do in Australia. It was a great show of a realistic <br /> <br /> documentary realistic show. At the time, there were a few good films doing similar work. It would be great to see more of these TVs from Australia, because they have been lacking for the last twenty years. all that fed us is a soap mass of different quality.
