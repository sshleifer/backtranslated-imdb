I think Never Been Kissed was an absolutely awesome movie. The casting was really good, and they acted very well. I really like Drew Barrymore, and of course it was excellent for me. At first I was scared because he said that it does not go on video. Boy, I am happy that this is because it is an incredible film. See if you already haven't!
