Recovery is an incredibly touching part of the work that eliminates the devastating effects of traumatic brain injury not only for the individual, but for the whole family. Without resorting to a sermon or Hollywood juicy endings, drama Tony Marchant realistically represents a family in crisis. <br /> <br /> David Tennant and Sarah Parish appreciate their incredible performances. Before watching the drama, I assumed that some of their previous relationships on the screen in Blackpool would pass through the blood, but this does not happen. No actor is recognizable from any previous work, and I have not seen one of them as an actor playing a role for all 90 minutes. In addition, Harry Tredaway's performance as a son just on the threshold of his own life at the university was fantastic - throughout the play he demonstrates the torn nature of a teenager thrown into the undesirable role of a man at home, <br /> <br /> Sometimes almost every hero Drama does not sympathize. As a spectator, I wanted to give each of them a good taste in order to wake up to reality, to stop being depressed and begin to adapt to the rotten, but very significant changes in their lives. But under the same circumstances, I see that I behave like any of them - switching between trying to show a hard upper lip in despair in order to get away from anything, including behavior that is completely different from me. This is the strongest side of the show - though without sugar coating - to make all of us think about what we can do under the same circumstances. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult but obligatory for viewing the show. I hope that somehow it can be shown in the USA.
