This is not a movie that really deserves critical attention. He won't win an Oscar - it's really not a very good movie. Damn it, this is not even a film - just a chain of short disgusting parody parodies, joined together in an attempt to have fun. And as much as every critical bone in my body calls for this film to fail, damn it, damn it, I'm going to give it a much better result. People who like this film are not the people who really care what critics say, so I'm not going to give some snobbish criticism of the quality of surrealistic existentialism of Jackass, who permeates and comments on how our society .... oh, forget . <br /> <br /> What to say? There is no plot development, no character development — there is no real beginning — there is a semi-sorrowful end that is not as funny as the parody that precedes it, and everything between them smells like an inappropriate humor in the bathroom, over which younger children laugh. This is actually pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Leave behind the door all your ideas about a good movie. Jackass: Number two is just crap. It really is all there is. Nonetheless, I give the filmmakers this: they come up with rather ingenious things. You will probably cringe a few times, want to raise vomiting a couple of times, sway and move awkwardly when people on the screen do deadly and vomiting-causing tricks. Vomiting, shit, urine, semen ... almost all body fluids can be seen at the donkey: number two. There is nudity, sexual humor, and so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> This is entertaining. If you're the kind of person who finds this stuff enjoyable, then you will probably really like Jackass: Number Two. I laughed a few times. As I said, this is pretty creative stuff. I never wanted to vomit - although I have a rather strong belly. Just accept the premise of the film: a bunch of idiotic guys doing weird crap for fun. Once you overcome it, accept it and go with it, you will enjoy it. The only flaw in the film - a clear excess of all the strange and disgusting things. There are some very original, very disturbing parodies, but they drag on in many places, as they make those that are less interesting. Towards the end, things accumulate, but in the middle of the film, resistance degrades the overall quality of the film. In a half-hour TV show, this is not a problem, but with the film's celluloid, it is inevitable that boredom will begin at some point. After a while, rude shit just becomes desensitizing. <br /> <br /> In general, number two is a fascinating, creative and, above all, disgusting comedy that will leave you feeling pain, nausea and gaiety. See if you need to, but hey, if you know that you don’t like these things, don’t worry. You will simply be disappointed.
