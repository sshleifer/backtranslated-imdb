I remember watching this movie when I was quite young, and it worried me a lot. I find the storyline very distressing and I still remember the various methods of bullying used. One, in particular, was when other schoolchildren spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoon. They also tied him up and shaved his personal parts. This is all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. I have a feeling that even if he were good at games, he would be intimidated, because it is difficult to decide what makes someone popular. For me, he is the type of person who will always be chosen because children work this way. Popular kids are popular because they are kind of cool. Popularity is difficult to determine. Thus, even at the end, when he is successful in his career, it does not matter, and he still feels tormented. I found the end rather sad, since there was no resolution.
