This is the last full-length film that Michelangelo Antonioni shot with the help of Wim Wenders, and adapted from the collection of stories "That Bowling on the Tiber". Beyond the Clouds contains 4 short stories with familiar themes to which we are accustomed from his early works, and summarizes these themes in vignettes, which are woven together through Wenders' directorial scenes with the participation of director John Malkovich. However, most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth to which we were used to the Antonioni film, while Malkovich’s story about the alleged depth thundered from obscure diction, which sounded a bit pretentious and inappropriate. <br /> However, all four stories seem to relate to casual encounters and extremely fast romances that play out more like lust at a glance, perhaps due to lack of time (as they are stories anyway) to allow a more layered approach to carefully define and create characters, as we know from the typical Antonioni film. And the obsessive approach here is for the characters to undress to demonstrate the absence of a deeper connection sacrificed for the direct satisfaction of the flesh. Perhaps this is precisely the point of observing more modern relations? <br /> <br /> The first story, “A Love Story That Never Has Been,” tells of Silvano's novel (Kim Rossi Stuart). and Carmen (Ines Sastre), who meet when one asks the other way to the hotel, and then meet in a cafe. It’s as if Fate plays games on them when they meet, but are separated and meet much later, but, like the games people play, it’s almost like L'Avventura or La Notte with a lack of communication and expectations from people. <br /> <br /> In the next short film, the main character, John Malkovich, plays the main role, demonstrating very dissolute looks at the girl working in the store, played by Sophie Marso. She is deeply agitated and feels uncomfortable, but somehow she had the courage to get close to him, and, as it seemed to me, should have scared him, tells him that she killed her father, inflicting 12 knife wounds on him. But in an instant, these two go to the gym in the bedroom. <br /> <br /> The next short, “Do not look for me,” is the longest of all: Peter Weller plays a cheating husband who has to choose between his mistress (Chiara Caselli) or his wife, played by Fanny Ardant. Perhaps the most stellar of all, with Jean Reno, also entered into the bidding for the coda, which, as it were, expands the small universe in which this short one exists. But, unfortunately, Renault’s involvement also shifted to some suppression of laughter, as it moves into an incredible area with laser-fast, romantic confusions. There was a key element adapted from L'Eclisse, with a couple kissing through a glass panel, while the introductory story about the history of souls was rather interesting. If there is a negative topic in this short film, it will be human duality. <br /> <br /> Between this short and the next episode there was a small scene that reunited our couple from La Notte, Marcello. Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau, where the former painted a landscape resembling a landscape in the Red Desert. Finally, we have the last shot of This Body of Dirt, with Vincent Perez, when he was a young man stalking a girl (Irene Jacob), whom he had just met, and fell in love with her, only to realize that it is love that is too late. This is a rather talkative work, like the first story, with characters who talk while walking through the streets of the city in which they are located, which is reminiscent of Richard Linklater's Till the Sunrise. <br /> <br /> Although on the whole, the film may have been a success as separate parts, but they could never be compared with common efforts, considering that the “excuse” for combining them was to study the director of possible stories and search for inspiration for his next the movie.
