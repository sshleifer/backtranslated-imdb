Last year, I fell in love with Sweeney Todd Tim Burton’s version, so I wanted to check out other versions of this musical, and I found this one in the library. Although I think that Burton is the best, probably because I like the movie much better than the theater, but it’s still an excellent story setting. I have not seen any of the other versions, but I am trying to get them. <br /> <br /> After Johnny Depp became Todd, it's hard for me to imagine anyone else in this role besides George. Hearn does a fantastic job. Angela Lansbury is great, as always, and all singing is fantastic. I found myself singing along. You will not want to miss this play, but try to watch it before you see the version of the film so that you do not have a biased look at me.
