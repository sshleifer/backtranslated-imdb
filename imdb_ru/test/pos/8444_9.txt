Reporter Kimberley Wells represents the secondary side of the news; Layered shapes that do not have much merit in the news. During the filming of the material on alternative energy at a nuclear power plant an accident occurs. A friend and cameraman, Kimberly Richard Adams, unlawfully shooting the people controlling the incident in the control room. Jack Godell, head of the control room, prevents a reactor crash. After investigating the incident shows that everything is in order, Jack cannot help, but he feels that something is wrong. Finding that the welded seals on the generator pump are cracked, Jack and Kimberly and Richard try to tell the public about it and close the unsafe installation. <br /> <br /> Almost done thirty years ago, China’s syndrome is an exciting drama that is still so topical. Nuclear power has always been the subject of heated debate, be it the safest source of alternative energy, radioactive waste, and nuclear power plants, waiting to be the next Chernobyl. “China Syndrome” is not only nuclear power, but also freedom of speech, the rights of the press and big business. Regarding Jack's data about falsifying information, his knowledge hinders massive investments in the construction of another nuclear power plant, from which many people seek to make a profit. Kimberly, desperately wanting to quickly hear the news, believes that the struggle for truth is more important than enhancing her career; Constantly pushed by Richard, he never wanted to be silenced, demanding that people find out about the accident. <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas and Jack Lemmon are simply flawless. Fonda shows Kimberly as a frail woman on her appearance, yet emotionally firm and determined to show this concealment. Douglas demonstrates the strong role of Richard fighting for honesty and truth. Lemmon shines in everything, like Jack. His performance is a very tense drama. <br /> <br /> “Syndrome of China” attracts viewers, and today it is still relevant, as it was for the first time.
