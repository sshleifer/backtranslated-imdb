Read this: <br /> <br /> BOYZ 'N The Hood - scene by scene, a complete breakdown of this film. <br /> <br /> Two friends in the hood, one focused on intellectual pursuits, and the other an athlete. A friend who is an athlete contacts the wrong people and gets killed. (Washington was the athlete from Welcome, Cotter.) <br /> <br /> I hate that people don't know that. It amazes me every time I go to the video store, and Boyz 'n the Hood is in the “Drama” section, and Coolie in the “Comedy”. This is a shameful shame. This film is funnier and more dramatic than the robbery of John Singleton. At the very least, Singleton could say that his film was a tribute to Cooley High, but no, he never said a word. Boys 2 Men, however, called their hit album after this film.
