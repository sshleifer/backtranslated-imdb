The story is incredible, it starts with a new child in a city named Roy, when he goes to school on a bus, he notices a child running without shoes, and on the same day he breaks a big ruffian nose that is trying to fight him. , Roy soon discovers that this child has escaped, and he and his stepsister are trying to spoil the construction scope, which can kill all the beautiful owls living there. Roy decides to help them in this battle, can they win this battle before the clever but clumsy cop Dave Delinko (Luke Wilson) stumbles upon them. Nice movie, fun and adventurous. I admire Luke Wilson for his role. I don't think his brother Owen would even take this role.
