It's worth seeing, although sometimes it's silly, it's great to see young Shaun Astin, and the result is a rather captivating and humorous action movie. I watched it many times when I was young, and now I still enjoy it when I insert old VHS into the car (I have a copy). So sit down with this film, let the reality wait for a bit, and you can laugh a little and enjoy a good hour and a half.
