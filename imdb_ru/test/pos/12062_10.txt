It was one of the few shows that my wife and I agreed to watch. I was upset to learn that it was canceled, especially because I did not realize that the ratings were so bad. As far as I knew, it was very good with many viewers. Almost all of my friends and most of the people with whom I spoke watched the show. Now we're stuck watching shit shows or DVDs. How bad was the show? Does anyone know the actual results of viewing the show? I know that on Thursdays it was harder for me to catch. Thanks G * D for DVRs! <br /> <br /> In any case, it was a real surprise: there will be no more “War of the House”. If any other networks see this, PLEASE GET SHOW !!!! YOU ARE WELCOME!
