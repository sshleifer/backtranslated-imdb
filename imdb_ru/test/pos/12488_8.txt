A good, humorous combination of music hall (mostly in the first third) and procedural secrecy of the police, when the stories of various suspects begin to crumble. The final disclosure of the murder may be a surprise if you do not look. Sandy look at Paris at the time. You can ignore the final scene (the Hollywood finale). Louis Zhuv is best suited as a police inspector who seems only to pass, but is actually in the middle of the action.
