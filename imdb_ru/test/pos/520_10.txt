Linda Blair has been around for forty years, and although she will never escape the role of Regan McNeil in The Exorcist, only a few of her subsequent horror films used her legendary status for such a great effect as The Witcher. She plays Jane Brooks, a pregnant, single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to buy. They are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents (Katherine Hickland and Rick Farnsworth), and upon arrival on the island they meet a photographer (David Hasselhoff) and his girlfriend, a writer (Leslie Cumming), who illegally squat in a hotel, investigating the legend. local witch (Hildegard Knef). It seems that the old witch hunt led to her suicide, and she was with the child at the time. Not knowing the danger, Jane recently dreamed of the dramatic death of a witch, and younger brother Jane Tommy (Michael Manchester) more directly visited her creepy, dressed in black spirit, which he calls "the lady in black." Group time at an island hotel starts off quietly enough; however, an unknown Lady in Black had already sent the captain of their hired boat (George Stevens). Soon, isolation and cold begin to affect everyone, and it was during this period of sullenness and tension that the Lady in Black begins her kingdom of horror. She plans to avenge her own fate, taking possession of Jane and sacrificing her companions and her unborn child. Each of her other victims fulfills an aspect of her vindictive curse — the greed, lust, and blood of a virgin. When the sun sets and the sea goes wild, it follows one after another in horrible, terrifying ways. The location of the island is actually scary, and the hotel is very creepy and haunting. It's such a colorful film that it reminds me of the work of Dario Argento. The lighting is excellent, and the scenery of the scenery is absolutely creepy. The soundtrack is very effective and unique. The effects of horror are extreme, terrible and unforgettable. The cinematography is great, and that’s what brings us back to Linde Blair. The creative team behind this film shoots it, as if a horror star should be shot: a lot of dramatic push-ups, protracted close-ups that subtly detail Jane's increasing ownership, and moments resembling other great horror films. There are hidden tributes to "Rosemary's Child," "Jacob's Ladder," "Shining," "Black Sunday," and, of course, "The Exorcist." She does an excellent job with her work and absolutely steals the show with her capricious and discreet performance. This is not to say that the rest of the cast is disappointing; Katherine Hickland is sexy and very good, and veteran singer Annie Ross is remembered as the bitchy mother Jane Rose. Hasselhoff is doing everything possible, but in fact he is not a movie star, and his television persona interferes with his performance. Blair and young Michael Manchester have great chemistry together. Otherwise, the film is so cruel and creepy (in a good sense of the word) that it needs their warmth (Blair also played the mother in the Monsters Creators of 2003, and her mother scenes in this film give them the same tender feeling). Finally, Hildegard Knef (in one of his last roles) plays the great witch, and she has the most amazing voice and accent. Along with Blair, she was also well played. But this is a blair movie. Jane Brooks also seems to have some extrasensory abilities, and this aspect of the film goes back to Exorcist II: The Heretic. I think Witchery is there with The Exorcist, Exorcist II, Hell Night and Summer of Fear as Blair’s best genre work to date.
