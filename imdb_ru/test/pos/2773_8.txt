My kids loved this movie. we watched it at every opportunity. It was a fun funny movie. we watched it as a family, and each of us enjoyed it. it was a movie that you could watch without any uncomfortable places that you should have explained to the younger ones. my boys liked this movie and they would like to see it again. even after all these years, they remember it. Amy Joe Johnson was a very sweet girl. all my boys were in love with her. they loved her like a pink ranger, so we watched this film from the very beginning. (as you can tell, I wander around a bit to fill in the LOL lines). But seriously, this is a fun movie and worth seeing. Disney, please give us a DVD or a replay!
