It is interesting to see what people think about this film, as it is, in fact, quite unique (although there are some trademarks of Clive Barker's writing on it). Although it may seem a bit cynical, the film is complex enough to reflect those that need standard Hollywood plot hooks, and multi-layered, so if you expect to be conquered, you will see an ordinary monster with lots of monsters and scattered plot. <br /> <br /> Those who need a linear, specific and unraveled storyline will hate this film because the story lies, as in a novel, partially between the lines, or in this case, partially behind the scenes, in comments and imagination . <br /> <br /> Another possible hangup is the final, which I can say without spoiling it, that this is not exactly good and not all bad. This, in fact, is not very clearly defined, and I know that some people are furious because they didn’t know what happened, but for me and many others, I’m sure just adds another dimension to the story - the measurement of speculation, and, moreover, the fact that great destruction has a tendency to cause ripples, which stretches quite far. <br /> <br /> There is definitely a moral here, but rather a different good than the standard Hollywood display like “your face at the end of the film”. To summarize, the morality up is simple, although it is not quite as simple to display; Prejudices and inclinations of people to hate are different. <br /> <br /> I like this film, although, as many reviewers have noted, the expressions of the actors (with the exception of David Cronenberg, who makes a wonderful appearance) are rather sticky. I am not sure that they are completely guilty of their shaky appearance and lack of depth, although, seeing that these are common problems in transforming literature into a script. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great movie, provided that you do not expect it to be a standard horror movie.
