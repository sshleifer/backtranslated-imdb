Hey, it's great that you donâ€™t have to wait for the next Star-Trek exit to see the hik track! This is a trashy movie with a bunch of tracks without a budget, but a good way to spend an hour. They got the most special effects right, the dialog box is a classic track, and it just looks like a fake track.
