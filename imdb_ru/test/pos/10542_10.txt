This movie is the best horror movie I've ever seen. the action is terrible, and the plot leaves much to be desired, but the doll gave me nightmares for several weeks. seriously, if you have small children, don't let them see it. Of course, I am a bit biased because of the irrational fear of puppets and dwarfs. also a double cameo of the body of the guy who makes the mini me a true threefold. and some unwarranted nudity, the need for any low budget horror movie. all other horror movies will be forever appreciated in my book.
