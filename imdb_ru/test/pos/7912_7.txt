A fantastically directed and smoothly photographed psychological mysterious thriller with an exceptional lead game of the dark Donald Sutherland and powerful supporting roles for Donald Pleasant and David Hemming. The material decides to keep it all bleak and moves from the investigation period to the prehistory of the victim. The rare and rather sullen nature of the investigation drew me, but when memories of the victim's side showed that her last days were not so convincing, they became somewhat heavy and similar to stocks. Although the script is very detailed and somewhat complex in order to captivate us, the final and surprising revelation should have been sharper, and its careless performance did not help. The musical score of Howard Blake has an emotional bite in his cues that simply drag on, and the skillful management of director Claude Chabrol (well mostly) has a strong stylistic and rigid character that allows you to extract the most from capricious places and flexible composition. The young faces Lisa Langlois and Aude Landry also do an incredibly good job.
