OK, you need to calm down! This film is not so bad. I saw it for the first time last night and fell in love with it! I have to admit that I have never been a LeeLee Sobieski fan, but she grew up with me in this film. I think Josh Hartnett looks good, but come on .. Chris Klein is the most gorgeous man I've ever seen !!! He made this movie better for me. Come on, girls ... when he doesn't have a shirt and he goes for water, I know that your mouth has dropped. Yes, I know that at first he is a jerk, but in the end he understands what he did and learns to be a great guy. If he had not come at the end .. then I would be angry. I think that a couple of lines did not need to be said, but overall it was a great movie! I would definitely recommend it!
