Closet Land tells a powerful story and has many different subtle elements. You can read a lot of material about the plot of the film, but you don’t need it. All you need to know is that the film is about interrogation. Along the way, we learn a lot about the interrogator and the person being interrogated. We also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place. Especially when you have absolutely no control over it. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film is a warning (although the film has several different aspects) about what happens to people’s freedom when they “look the other way” and ignore the injustice that happens to others . <br /> <br /> If you have about an hour and a half, and you know where to rent it, I strongly recommend that you do it.
