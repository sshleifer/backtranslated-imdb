Beware, My Lovely is an experimental studio film from the early 1950s, directed by Harry Horner, better known for his stage design projects. Robert Ryan plays the master, whom Ida Lupino hired to do housework. The problem is that he is a psychopathic killer and does not know it. Miss Lupino is a sensitive soul and tries to conquer Ryan, but to no avail. He is not one of those people whose compassion could help or cure. Thus, we have an interesting situation with two people who mostly mean well, but one of them cannot succeed, because there is something wrong with him. He suffers from periodic blackouts, during which he commits acts of violence, which he later forgets. <br /> <br /> In fact, Ryan influences Lupino both on the hunter and his prey, and in another sense on the sadist. Viewers learn early that Ryan is a crazy killer, but it will take Lupino much more time. So we have to live with this knowledge, watching as poor Miss Lupino tries to do everything possible to “conquer” Ryan, to make him work, do work, continue his life. But the matter is not in the character of Ryan, since he is not capable of anything, except for the most elementary forms of normality, and as soon as disclosure takes place, his paranoia asserts itself. <br /> <br /> As a mental illness study, the film is not very impressive. The fact that he has a superlative degree shows the influence of the main mental diseases, with a dangerous psychopathology in combination, and its influence on a normal person. In this regard, the film is realistic and compassionate, although it is consistently logical, since we know that Lupino cannot “fix” Ryan, but we want her to do that. As a result, if someone wants to, he can be extremely emotionally involved in this film, if you can postpone, so to speak, its melodramatic structure. <br /> <br /> Horner gradually shows us the layout of House Lupino, the forbidden gothic monster that never feels like a house. We get to know the stairs, the kitchen and the pantry; and we will find out which window Miss Lupino can use for escape, and which ones cannot.
