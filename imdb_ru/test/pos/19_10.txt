This is one of my three favorite films. The only thing I can say is that director Peter Yates was shooting too much, showing the actors separately, not together as a scene, but the performances were so good that I forgave him. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney and Tom Courtney are absolutely amazing; brilliant. The script is great, it gives a very good idea of ​​life in the theater during the Second World War (and, therefore, as it was in the 30s). A lot of gorgeous, subtle strokes, a lot of wide, replayed strokes, and everything is perfectly done. Scene backstage just strikes me, and then comes the heartbreaking climax.
