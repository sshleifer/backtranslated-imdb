I was very excited to see a documentary about one of my favorite Italian directors. D'Amato indulged in everything in horror, postapocalyptic to hardcore porn. A couple of times he touched genius in films such as Buio Omega and Emmanuelle & The Last Cannibals. This documentary is a long and informative guide to D'Amato films. He is polled everywhere with English subtitles rolling down the bottom of the screen. Excerpts from his films are narrated by the narrator (with English subtitles). The documentary was particularly interesting when he analyzed the often censored "Emmanuel in America". Here D'Amato explains in detail the fake scents of “snuff” and recalls some funny stories. In fact, the good old Joe is very warm and cheerful, always smiling and smoking a cigarette. One of the disappointing aspects of this documentary is that it spends little time on D'Amato horror films, such as Anthropophage and Buyo Omega. He spends too much time on erotic movies and hardly touches post-apocalyptic films. But I can't complain. It is great to see D'Amato get the respect he deserves. Highly recommended for D'amato fans. May he rest in peace.
