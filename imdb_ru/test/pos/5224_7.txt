If we consider three films with a similar plot, namely this one, which was filmed in 1930, “Covered Wagon”, filmed in 1923, and “The Master of Carriages”, filmed in 1950, the distance between “Big Trail” and Covered wagon ”- only 7 years, whereas the distance between the“ Big Footprint ”and the“ Wizard Master ”is 20 years. This is surprising because it shows how many films have developed during these 7 years, and how the changes have been slow over the next 20 years. “The large trail is technically close to the Master of the Wagons, but is very different from the Covered Wagon.” The story of the pioneers who go from Missouri to the west to Oregon. Tyrone Power Senior - the man leading the caravan, he is a rude and despicable guy. John Wayne is a good guy, and the film underlines his appearance, not giving him a chance to become Wayne, to which we are accustomed. Margarita Churchill is such a proud lady that you wonder why Wayne just does not forget her. Raul Walsh was a master of caravans and cattle moving in the west, he shot "Tall People" in 1955, which has much in common with "Big Trail".
