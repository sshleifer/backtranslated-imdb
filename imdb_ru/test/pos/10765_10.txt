I was lucky to see this at the Tribeca Film Festival this year. I was stunned by how well made and how interesting this wonderful little film was. Directed by Griffin Dunn did a great job of assembling this film, in which there are several characters and several plot lines that blend so smoothly and smoothly. The main story includes a family, and this is a very provocative and entertaining story that involved the viewer in every scene. The film as a whole has credibility and integrity, but there is still a commercial advantage - an “indie” film for the masses, if you will. All the performances are great, but Diane Lane shines the brightest of all. Diane Lane is simply sensational in this great film and should be nominated for an Oscar. I know the early days, but Lane takes off his socks here.
