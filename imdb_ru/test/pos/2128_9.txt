This film was very nice and very suitable for a little girl. My nieces watched it non-stop, since they got it, and as a result I saw it almost 4 times all over. I can't get enough of it. The CGI images are pleasant to watch, the humor is good, and the images on the ballet are excellent. Although there are several holes in the storyline, not a single little girl will notice them, and as an adult, the film is so charming that you donâ€™t even notice. Just keep in mind that this is a film about Barbie, and although, in my experience, at times, it meets the high standards set for it by other films about the Barbie princesses. I would recommend this to anyone who has a little girl who always wanted to be a princess. This is also a good lesson. All people are special and different in their own way, and everyone can change something.
