I was extremely impressed with this film. This is one of the best sports films I've ever seen. The visual effects in this film are outstanding. I like the sequence in which the camera tracks the ball as it flies through the air or into the cup. The film moves well, offering both excitement and drama. The cinematography was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Acting is great. I was surprised by the young Shiite LaBouf. He succeeds in this role. Stephen Dillan is also good as the pensive Harry Vardon. Peter Firth, Justin Ashfort and Elias Koteas offer decent support. The film is fascinating and interesting, and for the first time in my life I wanted to watch a golf tournament.
