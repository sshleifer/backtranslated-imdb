He plays straight but with calm power, making him one of the best cops in cinema history. The stars of Roy Shader in the French Connection of the poor man who has a bit of the same sandy attraction. FC is the best movie, but I prefer to watch it, because 1) I think Scheider is great and this is his best movie, and 2) he has the best car chase EVER, when Bullet looks like cable production thanks to Bill Hickman, who actually plays the driver). It doesn't hurt that Tony Lobyanko stops (again) to play the villain. Please enjoy.
