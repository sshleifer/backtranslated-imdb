The TV mini-series "North and South" is the 80s, as "Rich man, poor man" (the world's first television mini-series) - until the 70s. <br /> <br /> This is an incredible adaptation of the first classic novel in the trilogy by author John Jakes. The story itself covers two decades, preceding the years of the election of President Abraham Lincoln and the inevitable proclamation of civil war - North and South. Intertwining stories develop around the Hazard families (“North” in the title) and Mines and their two central figures, George and Orrie, who form a friendship, while they begin training at West Point in 1842. <br /> "North and South" is a wonderful historical chart, and as I get older (and wiser!), I am very interested to learn about the contrasting attitude to such controversial aspects as "Slavery" and “Abolitionists,” and how this relationship arose. <br /> <br /> The series also highlights some of the wonderful characteristics when we learn about friends and foes in the lives of George and Orrie, as well as women who stole their hearts in their youth. This aspect of the story also reveals the romantic story that unfolds against the backdrop of a stormy American civil war. <br /> <br /> North and South, along with Rich, Poor Man, are overshadowed by the 1977s. "Roots" as the greatest mini-series of all time. However, it is approaching the second / third, and also has the same time frame and themes as the Roots. But don't let it go, even if it's just to see the great scenery, costumes and brilliant cast of all the stars, including Gene Kelly, Johnny Cash, Elizabeth Taylor, James Stewart, Olivia De Havilland, Lesley-Ann Down and others. <br /> <br /> The series is well thought out and closely related to real historical events, and it is a pity that Emmy and Golden Globe did not deign to much more actors and actresses for their images. Patrick Swayze and James Reed, the two at the time unknown main actors, are starring Orry Main and George Hazard respectively. However, this is an exciting performance by Kirstie Ellie in the role of George’s sister “Abolitionist” Virginia, who steals the show many times. In addition, Terry Garber, David Carradine and Philip Kaznoff as Elkana Bent are delightful villains from a piece that you just love to hate. <br /> <br /> North and South Books 1 and 2 are now available on two DVDs,
