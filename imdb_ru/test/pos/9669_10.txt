Ignore the comment before mine. This is a comic genius, the most underrated series. 3 reasons why. Reason 1, the memories are so funny, who cares if they have absolutely nothing to do with the story, they make me laugh so much that it hurts, and isn't this the idea of ​​a good comedy program? People who think it is not funny simply do not have a sense of humor. Who cares if they are random, this is TV. show, you can do with it everything you like, and people say that it is unreal, and this is not a cartoon, but an animation. Reason 2. Jokes are just funny, Seth MacFarlane and other writers are soooo funny, everything, from mentioning Star Wars to mocking celebrities, I love them all. And reason 3, the storylines are brilliant and funny, they invented all the jokes with their crazy temper and stupid behavior, even more funny. <br /> <br /> I caught it late at night on BBC2 I never returned, I have all 7 seasons, plus something like a movie (Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story), I have a few t-shirts, posters, and my collection is still growing. I have never had a single TV show collection, but it was so funny that I just needed to get everything. <br /> <br /> Just watch season 3 and trust me that you will be hooked for life, the funniest show ever created, and I hope that it will never end!
