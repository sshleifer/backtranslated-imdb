This film is not what it seems. Clint Eastwood here is not Dirty Harry and not "cowboy." The appeal of the film stems from its careful manipulation of the atmosphere and theme. This is a Gothic story, filmed in the civil war, and therefore all the “action” of the film or its absence takes place in a house inhabited by southern beauties of all ages and forms. <br /> <br /> The horror comes from viewing the whole story through the eyes of Clint Eastwood's character. Seeing how he got into the house and was captured by women is actually very “tempting.” And who exactly "lured" here for sure? Are women deceived by Eastwood's incredible looks? Are we, the audience, seduced by both his sexual charm and the potential deviant sexuality it unleashes? Or “deceived” refers to what the director is doing here — does he carry us away for a short time just to (possibly) let us go? Don Siegel does all of the above in one of the most memorable and exciting films I've had the pleasure of watching.
