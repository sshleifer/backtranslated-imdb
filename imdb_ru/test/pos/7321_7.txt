Directed by the younger brother of the great director Leo McCary, this is a pretty good short from the Three Oscar-nominated puppets. Here the puppets are doctors named Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine and Dr. Howard. They are not the smartest doctors, but they benefit from doubts if they cope with duties and humanity. <br /> <br /> I liked this short one. This is not one of their best, but some moments are fun, though. One joke, which is repeated more than once, works every time. The part where they have to manage the hospital boss is awesome. Saying something else can ruin some of the jokes, so you should see for yourself. Just one more penalty for three puppets.
