Anyone who appreciates a great acting and a pleasant dialogue will love this movie. Taken from Ronald "Taking Parties" by Harwood, this is a fun <br /> <br /> and ultimately grueling analysis of the relationship between the two <br /> <br /> very "acting" types. Albert Finney is elevated as a despotic Shakespearean actor who barely notices a raging world war around himself, so he intends to destroy the fate of his theater. <br /> <br /> The company and its own psychological and emotional breakdown. <br /> <br /> Tom Courtney has no equal, like Norman, a “chest of drawers” ​​for the title, <br /> <br /> to be something other than selfless. <br /> <br /> Really need to see.
