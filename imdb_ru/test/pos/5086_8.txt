When I was a kid, I remembered this show, but I thought that now, as an adult, the show may be a bit dated. Well, yes, but for me it makes the show more retro (and the music is very cool). <br /> <br /> This show is mostly well written. I think this is a parody of the fact that this show was canceled after one season, especially when this show was more popular than the Incredible Hulk. <br /> <br /> I think the fans should ignore the bad special effects and enjoy the stories. <br /> <br /> This next sentence contains spoilers: My favorite episode in childhood was when two spidermen fought each other, I wonder if a similar idea was invented in the movie “Spider-Man 3.” I liked the ideas on this TV show, some will hate him. I believe that Stan Lee was not a fan.
