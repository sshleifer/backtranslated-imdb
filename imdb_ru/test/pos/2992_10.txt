I like this movie! O MY LORD! This movie shook so much! I found it among old films and did not know what it was, and after reading the back of the cover to see what summer had to say about it (By the way, I mentioned the fact that Elton John recorded the soundtrack to the film). more than what was actually mentioned.), I thought it sounded interesting, and it was even more interesting to watch it, because it was an older movie. <br /> <br /> “What kind of argument?” I thought to myself when I inserted the cassette into the player, I was curious what I was getting. And my expectations were certainly justified. I like it! I think this is a really girlish movie, but it was so sweet and adorable! It was a wonderful affair, although at times the director reminded me of camera work in The Graduate, and I thought that while watching this movie, the director must have been in acid with some of the close plans they had made. /> <br /> OK, so these two children could not imagine that they run away and live on their own ... but this could happen ... in fantasy ... <br /> <br /> But , the ending just sincerely prevented me! I was so angry about how they ended it ... it kind of makes you hang, and I suppose they can consider what actually happens to them in the sequel ... but at the same time, I almost I hesitate to see it, because the prequels are almost never as good as the first. <br /> <br /> I fully recommend this film to anyone sixteen and older! This is a terrific movie ... Great!
