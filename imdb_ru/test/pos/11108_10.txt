I really fell in love with the characters. They were very down to earth, but each of them had a hidden dark side. It seems a mystery. David Gracemark himself was a mystery. Secret fears and just shared secrets that he had. He had a whole side about which the other characters knew nothing, and this made the audience think or accept. In this man there was always some part that he was hiding, but he also shared himself a little. He was a strong male hero, and I admire this type of character. Billy Moses himself is an incredible actor who can play almost any role! He has tremendous talent and a good man. His fans love, respect and support him forever. <br /> <br /> After this show, he participated in many other projects and significantly improved his acting skills. Kudos to him and all the other actors from this show in order to do such an excellent job! I wish them all the best. I would like the series to continue! It is a pity that no!
