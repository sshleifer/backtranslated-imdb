This cartoon describes Wile E. Coyote's second meeting with Roadrunner and is definitely better than their first meeting in Fast and Fluffy (1949). <br /> <br /> Judging by aesthetic value, this cartoon is not included in the top five or six of 1952. Despite this, this is a very funny short. Coyote (Carnivorous Vulgaris) stalks Roadrunner (Accelerati Incredibilus) along the road and is completely tired. The ingenious scientific "Latin" characters' names are very original, and imitated earlier in other non-related cartoons. Coyote falls and wonderfully expresses boredom - I do not know. Such an expression in the spirit of Jones makes this cartoon give more than its share of laughter in seven minutes. Then he has an idea, and another funny expression is worn. All the jokes with slaps are hilarious and mask the fact that it really is harmful for a poor, helpless coyote to really hurt such a person. Everyone knows, but who cares? <br /> <br /> An old rocket is also present. Coyote is tied to a rocket, which should give him enough strength to catch up with Roudranner and grab him. Instead, the rocket takes off into the air and at a distance turns into fireworks: eat at Joe. This classic gag comes from this cartoon; although it is obvious, it still makes people laugh. <br /> <br /> The highlight is the pursuit of the mine. Two are wearing lights in their helmets, and we see a tunnel through which both pass, and only the lights are visible. Here comedy peaks. Mandatory sequence, perhaps even the best in the early days of Roadrunner. The last touch is provided by writing Michael Maltese when Coyote's light goes out and he unknowingly lights a match in a room full of explosives, the surface is shown where a bunch of cacti jumps and says â€œYES! after the explosion. These little things make you laugh in just seven minutes, and as soon as the fun begins, it all ends. Rocket skates are another good idea, as well as a free drink of water and an anvil on a stretched rope (the sequence that appears in Space Jam [1996]). To give the results of those who left, it would be useless. The free drink turns out to be a problem for Wyla E. at the end of the second-last sequence, namely rocket skates. <br /> <br /> This classic cartoon is full of beautiful animation, except for the characters. Although they are very well animated, these two characters are very primitive; which can be an understatement. Although at first it may seem strange, the humor of subsequent episodes makes you forget. <br /> <br /> If you like vintage Jones, watch this. If you love Roadrunner, get it on video. Great entertainment (rating: 8/10).
