Like many other reviewers, my memories of this show are always warm. In fact, they are so fond of these cherished memories that I recently acquired a DVD box set to return to that happy and carefree period of childhood when I sat completely mesmerized, watching the ongoing search for Monkey, Pigsey, Sandy. Tripitaka, and later Yu Lung - horse / dragon / man (you really need to watch this to understand), when, as I recall, this favorite show was originally broadcast on BBC 2 on Friday evening. <br /> <br /> Well, I am glad to say that even after all these years and now, when he looks at it with adults, that is, with more cynical (!) Eyes, the show has not lost a single inimitable charm. <br /> <br /> Just great entertainment from magical characters and their comic interactions with each other to perhaps not very special effects (which actually serve to enhance the fun) and, of course, not forgetting the extremely memorable sequence introductory titles from the first season, over time by no means, neither the form nor the form diminished the charm of the Monkey. <br /> <br /> How could the Monkey itself say: â€œOh! Are you there! Go out and get yourself some nostalgic fun.
