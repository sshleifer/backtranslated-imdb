(Note: I saw that I SOLD DEAD at the Glasgow International Film Festival on January 20, 2009.) “Sell the Dead” is a black horror comedy shot in the late Middle Ages and stars Dominic Monagan (“Lost, Lord of the Rings”) Ron Perlman (Hellboy), Larry Fessenden (Session 9) and Angus Scrimm (Fantasm). <br /> <br /> The film begins with the grave robber Willie Grimes (Fessenden), still perturbed and ruthless, dragged to the guillotine and executed. His student and crime accomplice, Arthur Blake (Monahan), is locked in a tower while waiting for his turn when Duffy's (Perlman) father, a whisper-drinking priest, with an unhealthy interest in the occult, visits him with the clear intention of recording Blake's latest confession. However, it soon becomes apparent that Duffy's main interest lies in the more ... otherworldly side of Blake's exploits. Much of the plot from here is recounted in memoirs when Monaghan tells Duffy stories about his dismal career. <br /> <br /> Initially, Grimes and Blake began as simple thieves of wise bodies working for the abominable Dr. Quint (Scrimm), a soulless, corrupt anatomist who uses blackmail as a lever on our two antiheroes and gets a rather unhealthy taste in his work. The pair first met the undead when, one evening, Quint sent them on a mission to the dreary moon pier to find a corpse that was mysteriously buried at a crossroads, apparently according to some ancient custom. But there is something else in this corpse. This one was wrapped in garlic cloves ... and buried with a stake in the heart ... <br /> <br /> After a terrible meeting, they are not only developing a plan to get rid of the doctor’s intrigue. machinations, but they also reveal a secretive subculture of occultists who will pay good money for corpses, and even better money for living samples of the undead. This leads our fearless duet to the hidden underworld of the "ghouls hunt" trade, where they meet face to face not only with vampires, monsters and zombies (and another paranormal creature for whom I will not spoil the surprise), but also competing hunters for ghouls in the form of the inbred and murderous Murphy clan. <br /> <br /> I went to the “Sell the Dead”, waiting for a restrained, slightly distracting, low-budget chiller. I was not prepared for an incredible imagination, frivolous humor, quality action, excellent dialogue, dense atmosphere and a clear individuality, which makes “Sell the Dead” a strong early contender for my horror film of the year. <br /> <br /> With the exception of a few rough moments, the production figures are really fantastic for such a low-budget film - it looks like it was done for about $ 20 million, and I was surprised when the director told the audience that it was done much cheaper than half of it (although he did not want to give exact figures, since the film was still sold to distributors). "Appearance" and the tone of the film - this is a visual comic somewhere between Tim Burton and Hammer Horror, with small inserts in the style of Creepshow-esquire. The plot is surprisingly surreal, but the idea of ​​a hidden underworld that runs parallel to everyday life, but which people cannot or do not want to believe in, is an idea that really makes sense in the context of the film. /> <br /> The game, as one would expect from this composition, is top notch. The characters are remarkably well-crafted, especially Grimes and Blake, and all the actors set out their sharp scripts with the right amount of frank language in their cheek to make the dialogue fun and realistic. Angus Scrimm also plays a small, but memorable, role in the role of a mildly threatening violin-playing anatomist, Dr. Quinn. <br /> <br /> Conclusion - I really liked it. I have long been so fascinated by the film. I struggle to find something bad to say about it. Remember my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still discover and fall in love in 20, 30, 40 years.
