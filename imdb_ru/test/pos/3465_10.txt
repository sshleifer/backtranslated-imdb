This is an incredible and powerful drama that amazes you. I found that the film was great and coped with the disability of the two main characters, it was presented in excellent performance by both Michael and Rory. Regardless of whether the story is based on a real story, I feel that the story was trying to convey to the audience a message that the general public should respect and feel the needs of people with disabilities and that they should be given the same chance as any other. person. In general, this film penetrates into my soul, and I also feel touched by the actors and the director, who send creativity there. In general, the picture is that some actors perceive the play outside their character and show only that part of the character that is believable to the audience, but I feel that these two theses have certainly been beautifully used as their gifted talent for portraying . Of course, one not to be missed!
