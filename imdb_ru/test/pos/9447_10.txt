She - The Man, was the funniest film I've ever seen. I laughed so hard that I cried. It was also very romantic. Channing Tatum is absolutely gorgeous and can really act. Of course, it doesn't hurt that he has quite a few scenes without a shirt. Channing and Amanda possess amazing chemistry and were absolutely wonderful together. I love this film. When you watch, do not forget to watch the last deleted scene. Cutting this scene was a huge mistake, because this is one of the best scenes in the film. I highly recommend this movie. Amanda was never funnier. And Channing will become a huge star. This is only the first of many for this bright new star.
