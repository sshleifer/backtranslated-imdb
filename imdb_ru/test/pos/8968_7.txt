Consistency is perhaps the biggest problem of this film. The film begins as a fast, stylish and just funny political satire, but in the second half of the film becomes more serious, almost like Oliver Stone. This, of course, is also a very serious topic, but I would say that the film would be much better, and also more effective, if it were completely executed in the same style as the first half of the film in which it was shot. <br /> For a biography and a film related to the theme of this film, the film is also rather short with its simple 102 minutes of work. Because of this, it seems that the film does not tell the whole story. Of course, the film hints at the continuation of events after the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, but the film does not delve into it, and there is little that explains what looks like a cheap way to simply glorify Charlie Wilson without showing the other side of the coin. In addition, the actual events in the film itself become quite simplistic, although the story is still sometimes told (unnecessarily) difficult. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film would have been much better if he had not tried to be so serious from time to time and generally lighter with his style and atmosphere. The film should, for example, be more like Wag the Dog, which was achieved in order to find the right combination of satire and sensitive political issues. <br /> <br /> Because of this inconsistent style and way of telling stories, acting is also mixed. When Tom Hanks plays his character more playfully and more comically, he is just great. But this only complicates the perception of his character serious in the more serious and sensitive / shocking moments of the film. Philip Seymour Hoffman is always excellent, as in any film in which he plays. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role in this film. Most of the other actors seem to just go around in this film, just to be in the film. This mainly concerns Julia Roberts, whose character seemed too mysterious to me that he seemed to have a sufficiently clear goal for the film. She made an excessive impression on me, and therefore in this film it is really very easy to forget. <br /> <br /> It’s not that the movie is a bad viewing, it’s actually pretty good and pleasant, but if the movie dared to be a little sharper, the movie would be better, and above all also more effective what he was trying to accomplish. <br /> <br /> 7/10
