I remember watching this movie as a child, and I was very excited about it, I could not take my eyes off the TV. This movie has everything for horror lovers! There were no funny moments in this film, expecting a couple of puppet liners (who was my favorite character in the film), Kevin Tenney shot this gem and did a wonderful job with a small budget. stopping them, having survived the night when they were unstoppable killing machines! The effects made by Steve Johnson are excellent, I would recommend this film to anyone who loves low-budget horror films, because, as the old saying goes, they no longer make them that way. The sequels were pretty good too, but not as good as the original. It should be in any horror collection, buy it, if you can find it, you will not be disappointed.
