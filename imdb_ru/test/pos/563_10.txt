A very good movie. Very good documentary. <br /> <br /> It is very nice to see that these parasitic detectives are humiliated and discovered as fanatical, narcissistic, heartless pigs that their one-eyed parents, society and entourage have raised. <br /> <br /> I topple the lid of Pat McGinness. Can we attract this decent person to the commission or the investigation of 911? We need his honesty, endurance, intelligence, clarity and fighting spirit in the falsified game, which is world politics and big business. <br /> <br /> All animals go out at night - whores, skunks, dudes, queens, fairies, dope, drug addicts, sick, corrupt. Someday the real rain will come and wash away all this scum from the streets. Pat McGuinness should be the first drops of this real rain. The people who control this land are animals. They need to drown. <br /> <br /> I'm just in shock. Walking at night is a terrible thing. Inhuman howl and giggle of detectives in Murder on Sunday Morning. In Pat McGinnessâ€™s glittering spotlight, they look terribly caught, terribly guilty and ready for just and horrible drowning. <br /> <br /> This is extremely pleasant in a world in which players play a fake game to see justice and see how every narcissist is drowning, like miserable human rats. <br /> <br /> How do you feel, disgusting, evil fingers of the law? What is it like for your falsified prosecution, your falsified confession, your falsified detective work to find out what it really was? What is it like <br /> <br /> I hope it turns like a knife, miserable, one-eyed.
