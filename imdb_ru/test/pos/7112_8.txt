“House of Dracula”, coming out at the end of the horror movie series “Universal Monsters” and before the advent of the Golden Age of science fiction films, is more science fiction than horror, and includes some of the more stupid {read: pleasant} elements typify sci-fi movies of the coming epoch. Lon Chaney, Jr. plays The Wolf Man, and John Carradin, Dracula and Glenn Strange, the monster of Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> A mad scientist intends to "cure" both monsters from their "diseases" with the help of modern {read: insane} science. When the scientist's beautiful nurse turns out to be a hunchbacked at the beginning of the film, the viewer is warned that this film will not be the typical universal fare; This film foreshadows that sloppy operation, which we used to take for granted in the 1950s science fiction. <br /> <br /> If you don’t mind, go slower on old movies, and black and white doesn’t throw you off, this movie is recommended for viewing. Afaik, this one is not currently available on DVD, but AMC publishes it from time to time, so stay tuned, or you can always wish it on your TiVo!
