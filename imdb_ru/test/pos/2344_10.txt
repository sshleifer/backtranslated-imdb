I was lucky to see this film at the festival last year, and I expected it to be released. The fact that he was filmed on a digital video camera, of course, prevented his success, but, as I understand it, the director never intended to make the film “LOOK AS A FILM”, it was more about the plot of the characters and their relationship. Isn't that what films should be about !? But it did have a quality in the structure of its visual appearance, which suggests that May Thomas is something that we should pay attention to. Independent directors and producers with talent who don’t have enough money and drive can learn a lot by watching this film, from a technical point of view it has everything you need, the use of light, music, etc., Much surpassing any other digital a feature film I've ever seen, and so it deserves a lot of praise. The performances of the actors are believable to some extent, if not slightly underestimated, I felt that there was much more, more depth, in particular from male leader John Paul Clark. But one thing that really bothers me, as the director himself, is that the black and white film has to hide many sins than if it were in color? We have a lot to learn in the progress of digital technology? Or is this the future of great, affordable filmmaking?
