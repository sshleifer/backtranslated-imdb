For a kids movie, that's great. As an adult and mom, I enjoyed watching a movie with my daughter. There is a lot going on in this movie. The following * can * be considered * a spoiler * ... Barbie learns courage and learns not to judge others so quickly in this film. She also learns not to lose hope and to cope with her anger. I liked the feeling of teamwork that you see, watching Barbie, her sister and friends solve a puzzle. There is nothing offensive or inappropriate for young viewers. In fact, I felt that the moral ideas of the film were excellent and well done. <br /> <br /> The animation was pretty good. I really enjoy skating scenes and think they were very well made. There is a lot of action in this movie, so I suspect that most children will like it ... and not just those that really carry Barbie. My daughter chose him because of Pegasus. She loves horses. But she really liked the movie. My daughter is autistic and was able to watch the whole movie and enjoy it. She really liked the action scenes and any details involving horses. <br /> <br /> I thought that many people object to Barbie (and Ken) because they are so beautiful. Nevertheless, I think that children, like adults, love to look at beautiful people and things. It `s naturally. As adults, we also enjoy watching beautiful movie stars. It's amazing that Barbie's character and her “boyfriend” are very individual. Although it is pleasant to look at pretty people, they age if there is no substance behind a beautiful face. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would say that this is a great movie for children, and parents will enjoy it too. :)
