“Four Friends” is one of those films that you go to without any expectations, just to be at a dead end. You kind of slip it, but then you hear Ray Charles's “Georgia On My Mind” song, and images and vague feelings start to flicker on the edge of your mind, and then you remember this crazy movie that made you laugh and cry almost at the same time. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so memorable? Firstly, at least for people who have experienced all of this, because it reflects so well the essence of time - his broken hopes, his successes, his sincerity and, above all, the emotional ride on a roller coaster that leads to acute nostalgia . And then, the acting is just awesome. Danilov, all the longing and passion, Georgia, is as difficult to understand as the will of the trickle ... but, nonetheless, charming, and Louis, a roommate with charm to spare, who attacks life with pleasure and takes every moment with a wry smile, because he knows all too well that this may be his last. <br /> <br /> How much time has passed since you watched the movie that made you really care about the people in this story? Even if they were far from perfect? The film introduces you to people whose choice does not necessarily deserve praise, but the film never moralizes, it simply allows us to evaluate the human condition in all its diversity ... even the minor characters have a distinct personality and history, which is why this film seems so real, even if some actions and reactions may seem excessive ... because such is life when you think about it. And why this film attracts you with complexity that is determined by character. Really amazing and enjoyable experience.
