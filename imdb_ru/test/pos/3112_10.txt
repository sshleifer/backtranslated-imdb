Today I finally got my DVD, watched it and am pleased to announce that this is the original theatrical version of the film. As you may have read in previous reviews of The Rich and Famous, that edited for TV version of the film, which somehow got on VHS in the late 90s, but now WB fixed the error and released it on DVD along with the restroom scene on the plane, Matt Lattanzi’s naked ass and a scene in a hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) C ** t! It's all there and looks better than ever! Clear, clear digital broadcasts, widescreens and special features that include the original theater trailer and the 1981 vintage art collection “On the Place with the Rich and Famous” with interviews of actors and directors. If you love this movie as much as I do, you will not be disappointed by the acquisition of this DVD. Glad to finally have it on DVD ?? Worth the wait! Thank you Warner Bros!
