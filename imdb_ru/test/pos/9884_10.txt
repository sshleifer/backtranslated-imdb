Take someone you love or want to love and watch this movie. <br /> <br /> He touches you in all the right places. <br /> <br /> All other reviewers said it all. <br /> Perhaps the cynic will not be impressed. <br /> <br /> They only seem to like what leaves you depressed for a few days. <br /> <br /> This movie is ga-run to stay with you for life. <br /> <br /> I am so glad that the director is not trained by USC. <br /> <br /> This confirms my premise that there are too many mediocrity and conformity in the movies these days. <br /> <br /> This is due to the mentality of USC and inbreeding. <br /> <br /> Cheers for Jeff Hare and Richard Marcus, the cast and crew. Well done!
