Anyone interested in Texas must have this DVD. This is just a good movie about real Texas with great scenes. To do this correctly, it took a bunch of Texans. Hollywood would never get it. Tabb puts so many subtle things into the film that he may not even have thought about, but the series does it. <br /> <br /> Guest cameos are not considered to be cameos at all. Each star fits perfectly and does not distract from the film. Many of the guest rooms mix so perfectly that when the captions are turned over, you will return to the cinema to find a character. Straight's roll is dead, he could not have been made better in real life. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film is completely different from the first, it looks a bit “false”, but this is normal. Somehow the storyline works. These "hockey" things are similar to what happens after school, but they look believable and natural. <br /> <br /> I have never heard of anyone using the Sonny Pruitt line before, except for the locals I grew up with. For me it was the icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Definitely a collectible thing, right there, with “Clean Country”, “Sugarland Express”, Junior Bonner, “Texasville”, “Last Picture Show”, “Giant” and, of course, Hud. <br /> <br /> Gig'em Aggies '86
