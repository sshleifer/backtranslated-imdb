Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another great scene in the Werner Herzog film, which has no equal. Recently reissuing it on DVD, almost ten years after its first release in the United States in 1997, it has not lost its strength, and you can see its influence on documentaries as varied as the recent Grizzly film The Man Grizzly and the award Errol's "Academy" Fog. Wars Like the first, he describes in his too short 74 minutes the life of an interesting American. Like the last, he looks at the side of the war that few see. Yes, we see violence and heroism, but since “The Fog of War” brought us to the head of one of the great arsonists of the last century, this film allows us to look at the life of grunts, captured by enemies, tortured, and ultimately triumphant. Except that form and form are by no means as simple and optimistic as my short description. Little Dieter does not need the title story of Dieter Dengler and the German immigrant who survived the Nazi robberies (for example, we find that his grandfather was in his hometown Wildburg in the Black Forest, the only person who voted for Hitler and suffered severely for this position) Germany after Second World War I and his own imprisonment in the hands of the Vietcong when his Air Force plane was shot down over Laos on February 1, 1966. While the name of the film and the idea of ​​Dengler's passion for becoming a pilot, are caused by the impression of the fighter planes of the allies who fired at him when they destroyed his city from childhood, lead to believe that Dengler is the central theme of the film, this is not true . The subject is Dengler's survival, or, more precisely, his human will, all human will. The details of Dengler's romantic life are too Hollywood and may not interest the Duke. It’s not a fact that he won the Purple Heart, the Medal of Honor, the degree of Doctor of Philosophy and the Naval Cross. What made Dengler to survive so much and remain such a relatively optimistic person (although there are glimpses of darker sides) is what is in the center of this film, and the whole of Herzog's canon. Dieter Dengler’s Far Barbaric Dream of His Past is the fully matured Herzog Country, and the use of Oyah Lahi E's Madagascan singing in many scenes of the jungle, among other excellent strokes in the score, shows that Herzog may, along with Martin Scorsese, be the best manipulator images and music to the movies. How long can it merge!
