First of all, I just have to say that I am a big fan of LOST. Everyone who makes the show, I love them. In fact, it has everything. <br /> <br /> I am glad that they are made by great people, for example, Jack Bender is the greatest director, well, maybe after J.J. Abrams. And, of course, the full merit of Damon Lindelof and Carlton Chius. They are geniuses. <br /> <br /> In any case, the season 2 finale is one of the best episodes of the LOST series !!! “Live Together”, “Die Alone” focuses on Desmond David Hume's story on how to get to the island, and Henry Ian Cusick plays this character so well! The creators of the series would be very stupid if they allowed the old to "perish" on us. <br /> <br /> So, in LOST, the survivors of the plane crash were there 65 days ... 65 days, man. Although Rousseau has been there for sixteen years, others have been there because God knows how long. Referring to Jeffrey Lieber, Lindelof and Abrams. In any case, I hope that we will get the answers we need in the third season. Can not wait! My voice is nine.
