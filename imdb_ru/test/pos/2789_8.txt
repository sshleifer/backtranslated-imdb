L'Auberge Espagnole is full of energy, and it is honest, realistic and refreshing. Not a comedy or drama, but rather a life film about this particular group of very interesting, but still normal young people who live in the same apartment in Barcelona for one year. Beautifully photographed with a good soundtrack. If you are older, this film should bring back a stream of good memories. If you are young, learn from this example.
