Blimey! I just have to say this show is super cool! I fell in love with the show from the very beginning! The idea of ​​the show is very original and very soothing! It is also a pleasure to watch the performance of two great leading ladies Loren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they are just wonderful! I am a particularly big fan of Lauren Graham! she’s not just a pretty face, she’s also the actress’s monster! I'm not saying that Alexis is also not a wonderful actress ... I just like Lauren more! in any case, it is really nice to see them on the screen, “sparing” with words! in the words of the immortal Jim Carrey "B-E-A-UTIFUL!"
