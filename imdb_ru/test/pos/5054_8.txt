I was delighted when I saw that my husband rented the Labyrinth of Passion. I love Almodovar films. We both loved the movie. We both could not stop laughing. We especially liked the scene in which the transvestite takes a photo-novel, and although he is allegedly threatened with a killer with an electric drill, they say that he answers the phone and says: “I cannot talk to you now, I” I am attacked by a sadistic Serial killer. If I survive, I will call you back ". (This would make the answering machine have a big message to think about it.) We also liked the woman who told her new beloved:" I went to the orgy after the concert, but could not stop thinking about you. "( I’m waiting to use this line on Twitter. ”The Labyrinth of Passion" is a terrific farce with lots of jokes, cheerful dialogues and pleasant eyes for everyone. The film stood well: the costumes and hairstyles of the 1980s add wacky emotions. I would give 10 of 10, but I give 8. For two reasons. The first is the scene in which use laxatives, including a snapshot of a woman who is dabbling herself: completely unnecessary, and momentarily lowering the tone of the film to a Hollywood comedy. However, I would recommend the film to anyone who wants a difficult, sharp and fun time.
