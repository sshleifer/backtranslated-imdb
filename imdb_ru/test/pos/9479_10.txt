If you like Cagney, you will love this movie. He claims the integrity of America at any cost, personal or social. Cagney plays the head of weights and measures in New York. Cagney is rebelling against dishonest politicians, the criminal underground, a famous philanthropist and simple grocers that add a few ounces to the price of chicken. The chicken scene is funny where Cagney finds a weight placed in the bird's cavity by an unsuspecting butcher. A chicken is thrown around the store in a fun scene about who controls the "clues". If you like old phones, there are interesting scenes with dials, telephones and even strange phone cords. Compared to the large number of films made today, this is pure entertainment and includes a riddle with comedy and the message that honesty should be above all else the guiding principle of humanity. Made in simpler times, it reflects a world that we cannot find today. Fashionable (especially hat) outerwear and cars play a significant visual role in the definition of this small film.
