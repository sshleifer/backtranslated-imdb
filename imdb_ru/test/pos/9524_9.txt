I admit that maybe I missed the tiny moments when I didn't pay enough attention, but I got enough history to agree that it was a great family movie from director Lionel Jeffery, who played Grandpa Potts in Chitty Chitty Bang . Basically, it starts with a happy middle-class family living in Victorian London. One night, two strangers come to the Father (Ian Cuthbertson), and he leaves with them and does not return. They move to the country to the country, and then the children; Bobby (Jenny Agutter, which I first saw in “Children's Game 2”), Phyllis (Sally Tomsett) and Peter (Gary Warren) invigorate, carried away by the neighboring railway. Every day they conscientiously wave passengers in passing trains, and with courage and vigilance they also avoid accidents and become heroes. Their kindness makes them friends, including important people who can help find the secret of their missing father. Also starring Dina Sheridan as Mother / Mrs. Waterbury, Bernard Cribbins as Albert Perk, William Mervin as Old Gentleman, Peter Bromilov as Dr. Forrest, Ann Lancaster as Ruth, and Gordon Whiting as Russian. It was number 29 in “The 100 Greatest Family Films,” and it was number 24 in “The 50 Greatest British Films.” Fine!
