This 1959 film, shot in a soap opera, talks about the life and love of three young women of the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as the Three Coins in the Fountain a few years ago. It takes place in New York, while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first starring role, Susie Parker and Diane Baker. Lange succeeds and holds her up against some strong business veterans, namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who loses her beauty with difficulty. It is hard to believe that anyone can reject this beauty for any reason, but Louis Jourdan, her throbbing heart, does just that. In some ways, you return to Paul Neumann, rejecting the gorgeous Elizabt Taylor in the movie “The Cat on the Hot Tin Roof”, isn't it? Diane Baker, the third unhappy girl, meets and meets with Robert Evans before he becomes a producer, and his husband Ali McGraw is known. Hope's boyfriend from home, played by newcomer Brett Halsey, promises to marry her. She also meets Stephen Boyd, a work colleague who has interests in our Hope. All three ladies have a drama ahead. Crawford almost steals the movie. Her presence and her usual strong gnarled essence are fun to watch. Veteran actor Brian Ahern plays one of the bosses with a yen for pinching our lead lady behind her back. He is delightfully charming. Also in the cast is Martha Heyer, wasted in an ungrateful role that has never been explored. It is unfortunate that I like this actress, who seems to never get that single role to distinguish her abilities. She is in love with a married man in the office, played by Donald Harron, with whom I had the pleasure of working in a pair of Shakespeare plays in New York. He is an outstanding actor who is also wasted in this film. <br /> <br /> In general, this is fun, in Technicolor and in the cinema, directed by Jean Negulesko.
