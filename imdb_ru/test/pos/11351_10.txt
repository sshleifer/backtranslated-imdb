I will not bore you with plot and plot lines, since they have already been presented on this page many times, so ?? The time has passed since I saw such a film. Beautiful, elegant and discreet, with a narrative pace to match. A film with sensitivity and understated qualities that is rare at this time of cliche. Perfectly muffled photo, rich with rich luxurious colors, and due to the lack of the best words, each frame is filled with the air of tension. Settings and locations are used repeatedly, but the film manages to breathe new life into them every time they are shown, there is always a key pillar, a light fixture or a decoration to tell viewers a little where we are in the characters of Mir. <br /> <br /> Acting reminds me of “Theft of a Bike,” not about style, but about forgetting that you are watching two actors doing their craft. There is a meaning behind each gesture, and significance is attached to almost every movement in order to explain the characters' inner world, attitudes, feelings and situation of two lovers. The dialogue is rare, but, like the entire film, filled with meaning. Speaking of meaning, the soundtrack is contagious. Used here, it becomes a storytelling device. And although the film is of Chinese origin, even the song of Nat King Cole in Spanish gives the film a subtle meaning. The orchestrated soundtrack repeats, but repetition is what makes it comfortable. It is used in conjunction with the plot, and not just as a means to put music into action or to encourage the audience to feel a certain style at a certain point in the plot. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this film to anyone, I am afraid that most people will be tormented by the calm flow of history, but I would recommend it to someone who is looking for an alternative to the romantic castle that fills multiplexes on our side of the world. I have to say that I was completely captured by this film and continued to watch it night after night. The story takes time to present itself and has multiple views, since very few films in this genre are open to such a broad interpretation. Very beautiful movie.
