When I first saw this film, I was simultaneously surprised and a little shocked by the apparent vibration of the story. This is a very artistic drama with incredible special effects, an exciting acting game, not to mention excellent work in the makeup department. Jennifer Lopez got out of past roles that fit into her career with this film, portraying a very sensitive child psychologist who works with a team of engineers to regain consciousness of comatose patients to treat them. Vincent D'Onofrio played surprisingly well. His depiction of a sadistic serial killer was perfect for T. The sheer emotion conveyed by his play is striking. Vince Vaughn is not my favorite, but he performed exceptionally well. Symbolism and artistry were intriguing and exciting, sometimes surprising, and sometimes shocking. In general, I say that this is a wonderful film, with excellent acting and beautiful artwork.
