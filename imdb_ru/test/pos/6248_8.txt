Lost oasis of Slausen. A place to eat, have fun. KILLING AND KILLING! After the guy disappears on the way to the gas station, a group of her friends goes in search of him. They run into a wax museum where they think their friend might end up. Unfortunately for friends, however, the owner of a roadside attraction has the ability to control his wax mannequins and use them for evil. One by one, Slausen and his legion of wax mannequins shoot down and kill tourists. Can friends escape or fall into the same fate as their lost friend? Following in the footsteps (and twisting them) of magnificent classic wax films (“House of Wax Figures”, “The Mystery of the Museum of Wax Figures”), “The Tourist Trap” takes the slasher genre to a whole new level of strange and exciting plot and style. As for character development, action, dialogue, flow, etc., it seems that this is just a click. But it goes far beyond the fact that the director takes control of the plot and transfers it to a supernatural thriller. The acting skills range from acceptable (from the basic composition) to very good (from the backwood showman Mr. Slausen (performed by the legendary western Chuck Connors)). The letter moves well, and the dialogue is well structured, but there are some flaws in logic as the film goes deeper into the story. In addition, some scenes are a bit stupid, such as the moaning dummy attack on Becky. This is nothing, however, that would diminish the effect of the film. As expected from a film about wax mannequins, it is full of endless eerie mannequins. It is strange that a (mostly) inanimate object can simply sit still and somehow disturb. Perhaps this is a human resemblance, or an empty look, or the fact that you know that this may lead to an attack. Whatever it is, the dolls are very creepy, and this effect is very well used throughout the entire film. As for slashers, this is one of the best and one of the most creepy movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Mandatory elements of the Slasher: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: The film is full of steep deaths. The blood is not excessive, but it is well made and makes it realistic. <br /> <br /> Sex / nudity: there is an extended scene with a naughty skinny, with very attractive lead women (although “very attractive” ”barely begins to describe the delightful future angel (Tanya Roberts), but this is all teasing, because the girls are mostly underwater, but they remain poorly dressed throughout the film. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): Creepy is only the beginning of Slausen and his dummies. One of the best killers in the slasher subgenre. <br /> <br /> - Frightens / Suspended: starting from the first scene, the film shows great The combination of the eerie mannequins, the terrified blows from attacks and the strong level of tension in a difficult situation., all this is very well done to create a really scary movie. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: In fact, the mystery was not the main goal of the film.,, all that matters is <br /> <br /> - Awkward dance scene: all these lovely girls, not one dance. Shame. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 8/10. See this creepy slasher! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
