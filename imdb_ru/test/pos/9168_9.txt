As I said in the title of this review, it hurts me to talk about it, but the "hitch" reaches the maximum that Hollywood romantic comedies can hope for. I criticized both the genre and its namesake for as long as I can remember, but on an almost tragic note, “hitch” forced me to spend somewhere in the neighborhood of two hours of my life with a ridiculous smile spread on my face. <br /> <br /> Sometimes this film can be misogynical and presumptuous, but, nevertheless, has a certain humor, whose subtlety can only be called British. This is a great attempt by Hollywood to make (or remake, depending on the circumstances ...) a film that appeals to all our wishes for a romantic comedy that can make us think and laugh at the same time. I reluctantly and most evasively give this film 9 out of 10 ... Something that you hardly see me do for the Romantic Comedy in the near future, or at least that is how I hope.
