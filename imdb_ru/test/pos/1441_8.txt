A truly excellent view of the world and the realities of drug addiction. The film will be shown too close to the home of those who were involved in the drug culture and know what a heroin addict is (or be near). A good film that will never be truly outdated. Excellent performances of all the participants and a minimalist set - Preminger's way to show how bleak the world of Dzhanki can become. Worth seeing - some kind of upbringing. The Golden Hand is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of pain in which the addict lives.
