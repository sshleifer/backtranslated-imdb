Hello; Belmondo! Look, there is Anna Karina! The great American improvised New Wave (or Independent that you want to call it that) is not as good as Godard or Truffaut, and not perfect, but hey is such realism, style, warmth and humor I like this New York accent; "you know nothing!"; "forget it". As in the French New Wave, we are talking about young people. party, fall in love or just walk. Lelia Goldoni is so cute; she's gorgeous; wonderful. Ben Carruthers is also good, reminds me of Belmondo. A film that you will not forget. <br /> <br /> Evenly 26.5 out of 31 ;-)
