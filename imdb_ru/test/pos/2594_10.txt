“Rabbit seasoning” is one of three cartoons in which “Bugs Bunny”, “Duffy Duck”, “Elmer Fadd” are represented in the war of words, as well as in wit about the season of rabbits or ducks. Love Bugs and Duffy stir up a "pronoun" with Duffy, always a victim of Elmer's shotgun, as a result of which his beak is always dismembered. Then there is the cross bunny clothing, which always drives Elmer in his striking way of love. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese have always been my favorites in the category “screenwriter-director” because of these funny hunting cartoons in the trilogy, which I laughed at since childhood. And at least two of them end with an exclamation of Duffy Bugs: "You are mean!" It could not be better than that!
