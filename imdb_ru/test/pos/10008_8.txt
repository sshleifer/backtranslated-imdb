"Exit" can mean both a withdrawal from a predetermined person, and a refusal from drugs. As a country boy coming to Beijing, class and success must have attracted the attention of this young artist as a call to separate from their roots and significantly surpass the current success of their peasant parents. Problems arise, however, when a new person is too new, when he requires too much care from family, history, nature and personal identity. The subsequent splits, the confusion between the imaginary and the real, as well as the discord between the ordinary and the heroic, is what, on the one hand, is an instinctive test, and on the other, a complete escape from oneself. Hongsheng slips into the latter, and his long and lonely path to himself can be grim. <br /> <br /> But what is unusually convincing feature, honesty and sensuality of the director Zhang Yang and his actors bring to this journey. There are no clichés, no stereotypes, no strict gender roles, no necessary sex, romance or scenes of violence, there is no necessary street language and, at the same time, there is no intended money to swim the actions and whims of the character. <br /> <br /> Hongshen Jia is already over twenty. He is a talented actor, impressionable, conceited, idealistic and, possibly, emotionally hungry. The perfect recipe for its factors. Soon he is a “cool” actor, whom the youth worshiped. "He was hot in the early nineties." "He always had to be the most fashionable." He needs extremes, he is engaged in heavy metal, takes earrings and a scarf. His actions mean art, friends - and roles, but not those that offer any personal problems or contributions. And his self-criticism, blunted by the immediacy of success, opens the doors to irrational self-doubt, self-hatred - “I didn’t know how to behave”, “I felt like a liar” - and readily available medicines to counter them. He says: "I had to get up to do what the director wanted." Thus, his superficial identity as an actor becomes through drugs an escape from identity. <br /> <br /> Hongshen's refusal from drugs and his false life are very gradual, intermittent - and stubbornly his own. Solitude, space, meditative thinking, rejection of speech, replacement of therapy. Abstract out. And most of its changes take place in the open air - not in idealized places, but mainly in green areas under highways, bridges and high-rise buildings in Beijing. Physicality is almost romantic, but it is not. The bike goes to Ritan Park, long spontaneous walks, sun and rain, grassy picnics, sky patterns and kites that absorb its reflections are very specific. He drifts to come, all the while picking up clues to a more realistic and realistic identity. “I began to unfold,” he says of this period in retrospect. And the contact seems to begin with his long body, which projects a kind of dancer's position (awkward, graceful, humorous, speaking) in current circumstances. If there is no mind or spirit, his legs can make him walk all night. <br /> <br /> The main thing in his return is the rejection of established roles. To accentuate his end of acting and his determination to a new identity, he smashes his videos and television, and hits his head to the bloody against his "John Lennon Forever" poster. He let down his cult anti-establishment artist - but he is the only viable guide he knows. He even imagines himself to be the son of John (Yoko Ono) and takes his "Mother Mary" as an intercessor in the "hour of darkness" and "time of sorrow." (painful, trembling pain in the park - hallucinatory and skitoidnye tests) "Music is much more real than acting," - he says. And he speaks about the influence of Lennon as “showing me a new way”. In a psychiatric institute, life-saving apples (resistance, food) reflect the presence of Lennon, as well as the need for Honshen to re-hang the poster of his character in his renovated room. <br /> <br /> If Lennon’s influence is energetic, then Honshen’s father’s influence is grounded. Although father and son are both actors and consumers (drugs and drinks), it is precisely Fegsen’s difference from his son that underlies his changes. The father is more self-confident: he admits that he is Chinese, a peasant from a number of peasants, the director of a rural theater. And he controls his habit and his emotions. It is this recognizable personality that makes Hongshen treat him like a sound board, sometimes with anger and rage, sometimes with humor (blue jeans, Beatles) and passivity. In his most insane and cruel exchange with his father, in which he accuses him of being a liar and a fake, he exposes more of himself than his father: "all the actions I have done before were nonsense ... life is nonsense ". “And to Hunshen’s decisive statement“ you are NOT my father ”, he gently replies:“ Why can't a peasant be your father? ”<br /> <br /> Under the guidance of these two teachers and with much more help from his mother, sisters, friends and prisoners in a rehabilitation institution, he makes some tangible connection with the present (not whole) I. As the long-term narcotic effects recede, his old personality disappears. Debt replaces pride, trust, mistrust. a cloud. I soften all its edges "You are just a man," he repeats endlessly, after he was released because he refused the medicine. After returning home, the fat of the peasant soap is now good with him. And it was once "rare and true friendships "begin again, as is evident in the back to the sharp fence scene with his fellow musician. Hongsheng speaks about this film:" This is a good chance to think about my life. "And I might add, become a new actor associated with art and life. Like Lennon, he achieved success without losing his identity.
