Challenge all D-sciples! Grab your friends, go to the theater and watch this movie. From the opening sequence to the credits, you will laugh with bated breath. <br /> <br /> This film is a wild trip through the history of D, and not just a list of what they did, but a chronicle of their coming to power. I'm a big fan of Rage Kage (Kyle Gass) and Jables (Jack Black), so naturally I liked the movie. <br /> <br /> It helps to find out about the show they had and their first CD, but it’s also fun if you don’t. This is a film for D-sciples and newbies - from funny and vulgar lyrics, rocking rhythms, a huge amount of smoking to a variety of episodes and up to insanity, which is the storyline. <br /> <br /> Many of their songs, such as Two Kings, Tribute and Kielbasa, are mentioned in many audio tracks, such as Cock Push-ups. The comers say: “It's fun!” I highly recommend this film to any body that has ever swayed. This film is definitely in big competition for being the next "This is a Spinal Tap". One of the best ever.
