Rupa (Kamalini Mukherjee) loses his parents and other family members in a terrible car accident. She begins to live independently as an independent woman, without receiving any help from her relatives. She has a friend named Rahul (Anuj), and he is going to marry him, but he is retreating because of the behavior of his future mother-in-law and because of the uncertainty shown by her boyfriend. Anand (Raja) joins her neighborhood. And he begins to make Rupu feel comfortable and safe. The rest of the story about why Anand - the medical doctor from AP's richest corporate house - decided to live as Rupa's neighbor, and what follows next. <br /> <br /> This film has a freshness that we rarely see in Indian films for it. Although the story is slow, you feel familiar with it. Glory to director Shekhar Kammula for such an amazing direction! A brilliant musical and background score composed by KM Radhakrishnan adds to the quality. Kamalini Mukherjee as Rupa gave a wonderful performance. I think she was the best choice for this role because of her unglamorous appearance and amazing story. Anand as Raja also succeeded. I watched this movie three times now and enjoyed it every time. This class is in addition to the daily dose of militants that we receive here. Highly recommended !!
