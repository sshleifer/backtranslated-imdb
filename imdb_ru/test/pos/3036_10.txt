I'm going to make it short and sweet. No wonder you didnâ€™t use this movie. This is a story about the strength, beauty and opportunities inherent in meaningful education. Based on your pathetically written comments, I see that your own education was utterly neglected ... or, even worse, completely lost. Your comments are truly ignorant. I would advise you to do something with this condition ... but in your case, I feel that it is probably too late. I hope that you yourself are not going to engage in teaching activities (especially in the study of cinema), because you can only cause damage. Oh ... last tip. In the future, if you intend to write more articles, you must truly subtract your work. It will make people take you more seriously.
