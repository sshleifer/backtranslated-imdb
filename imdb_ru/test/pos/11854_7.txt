This indie film is worth seeing because of the enormous talent of its creators, Wallace Volodarsky and Marsha Forbes. Mr Volodarsky led a young actor, and he should be commended for this effort. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is a cautionary tale of the danger of wanting something that a person cannot have. This is the story of Alice and Ed. Having lived for some time together, Alice suddenly begins to worry, because she thinks that she lacks experience in the field of sex. The relationship of Alice and Ed, although not an example of perfect happiness, is a convenient way to share your life with each other. That is, until the moment when Alice and Claire, her sister, accidentally came across a sexual encounter with another couple who have no idea what they are watching. <br /> <br /> This incident makes Alice reconsider her sex life with Ed; she finds that she lacks substance. When she offers to “see other people,” Ed is shocked, to put it mildly, but not wanting to contradict Alice, he decides to agree. What will happen next is that Alice and Ed will enter a world unknown to them. People with whom they meet, after all, are not worth the problems. They sadly understand that in the end they are made for each other. <br /> <br /> The film is worth seeing to see the amazing Julianna Nicholson, who we liked in another indie film “Tully”. Miss Nicholson reminds us of young Shirley MacLaine; she projects such a radiant quality onto her that it is difficult to tear her eyes away from her when she is on stage. This young actress proves that she is an experienced singer, who is getting better with each new appearance. Basically she wears a movie. Her Alice is a study of contrasts. Alice is a decent woman who believes that she is unable to please Ed because of her inexperience. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr, great for Miss Nicholson. Both work wonders together. His ed is completely trustworthy. We knew people like him. In the depths of his soul, he is a good man who suddenly finds himself in a situation to which he did not call, but he goes only to find that he is too decent and not meant for a useless life with voluntary women. who have no problem with falling hay, just for fun. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is wonderful. Lauren Graham does an amazing job as Claire, Alice's sister. Andy Ritcher is also wonderful, as a down-to-earth Carl, a boring friend who finally finds satisfaction when she meets Penelope, a single mother. Like Penelope, Helen Slater makes a successful, albeit short, appearance in the film. <br /> <br /> The director is incredibly gifted, who will undoubtedly go somewhere, because he shows that he is well suited for work,
