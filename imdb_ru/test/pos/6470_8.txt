The first Martin Ritt film offers an exceptional existential response (three years later) to Elia Kazan’s more conservative book On the Embankment. While Naberezhnaya gained enormous benefits from the electrification of Marlon Brando, who inadvertently disguised the insulting topic of Kazan in an attempt to justify naming (as Kazan did with impatience before the Committee for Non-American Activities at Home), Edge of the City boasts young John Cassavetis and upstart Sydney Poitiers, who dared to solve problems that Waterfront could not understand, namely, workers' rights and race relations. <br /> <br /> “The Edge of the City” boldly dives into this (then) unknown territory, and although the rather attractive black hero (Poitiers) may seem a little Hollywood simplification, the courageous struggle with thinly veiled fanaticism and violence has hardly grown old. I wonder how shocked the audience of the 1957 film was in such a bold demonstration of white-black relations (if some fanatics did not leave the theater earlier, they should have been stunned, if not offended). <br /> <br /> The last movie of the film will still amaze viewers, because it refuses to dive into the expected clichés, including those that spoiled the Embankment. Only the most exhausted spectators will not understand what the radical and entertaining film “The Edge of the City” turned out to be. <br /> <br /> What worries this lost classic most of all: how unfortunately it is not available in any format, for reasons that remain rather cloudy. This film should be required to watch the history of high school or college throughout the country, but it can only be found on obscure night television channels, if ever.
