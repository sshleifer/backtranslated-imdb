All I can say is, I really miss this show !! My wife and I just got married when this show started !! Why did CBS take it off the air ??? I think it was the best show for the whole family to enjoy !! It made me laugh !! It also made me cry. But when CBS took it off the air, my wife and I thought that CBS made a big mistake. Do you know what would be so great? Have a reunion presentation !! That would be so cool !!!! Does anyone know if this is on the DVD yet ?? Last season of the Promised Land CBS showed all last season? I think CBS took it off the air in the middle of the season. My wife and I will never forget that. The opening with this dark song was fantastic !!! This show is only once in a lifetime! May we never forget the Promised Land!
