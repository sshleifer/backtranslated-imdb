“At Sea” is a funny movie that starred a wonderful duet of Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau. This film is not as funny as their comedy "Angry Old Men" (as it is very similar), but there is a lot of laughter everywhere. Lemmon and Mattau play a couple of relatives who go on a cruise together. Once they get on the boat, Lemmon does not know that Mattau signed them as masters of the dance, so they do not need to pay for the cruise. This infuriates Lemmon, who is not in the mood to dance. Worse, Mattau doesn't even know how to dance. However, they agree with this, and in the process they meet some of their fellow travelers and crew members. Here are the crew members: there's a cruise director, Jill Godwin, played by veteran Star Trek: The Next Generation veteran Brent Spiner, who acts as an evil dictator. There are two other dancers who are played by Barney Miller star Hal Linden and veteran movie star Donald O'Connor. There is the owner of the ship Mrs. Carruthers, played by the "Golden Girl" Ryu McClanahan. As for the passengers: there is Vivian, the widow played by Gloria De Haven, who falls in love with Lemmon. There is Liz, played by one of my favorite actresses, Diane Cannon, who falls in love with Mattaw. This is Mavis, Liz's mother, played by veteran actress Elaine Stritch. And they meet others too. All these actors are pleased to see Lemmon and Mattau play with them. It's great to see Cannon here, to see beautifully, as always; Stritch - scream; Spiner is a funny comic villain who plays deathly straight at him; De Haven is beautiful; Linden, O'Connor and McClanahan have a good moment or two; and finally, the two main stars, Lemmon and Mattau, in order, as usual. Good little comedy gem. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
