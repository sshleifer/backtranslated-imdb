This film fully deserves to be one of the best Hindi comedies ever made. Rajkumar Santoshi is mostly known for his tough hard social dramas, but this is probably the easiest film he has made. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film unfolds around two small city jesters Amara (Aamira Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan). They want to get rich quick and therefore move to a big city. They carry the same plan separately - to achieve the rich heir of Ravina (Ravina Tandon), who is the daughter of the rich businessman Ramgopal Bajaya (Paresh Raval). Thus, the one who marries Ravina gets all her wealth into his own hands. but when they get to know each other’s plans, there is an intense struggle of one person for marrying Ravina. As the battle goes on, funny jokes and situations occur. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Ramgopal’s identical twin brother, Bajaj Shyamgopal Bajaj, wants to destroy his brother and niece and usurp his family fortune. Add to this an assortment of funny characters, including the handmaid of Ravina Karishma (Karisma Kapoor), the error-prone butler named Robert (Vidzu Chote), a manager named Bhalla (Sehzad Khan) who mimics the villain of past years Ajita and the funny gangster Gogo (Shakti) Kapoor), which is more like a pirate and you are waiting for a funny comedy. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time looking for LOGIC in a movie. Leave the company to your brain and just ENJOY. The actors are so synchronized with the script that there is no room for errors. Dialogues (Rajkumar Santoshi, Dilip Shukla) are witty. Music (Tushar Bhatia) and lyrics (Majrooh Sultanpuri) are remembered. The picture and choreography (Saroj Khan) "Yeh Raat Aur Yeh Doori", "Ae Lo Ji Sanam" and "Dil Karta Hai Tere Paas Aaoon" are suitable and will always remain in my memory. <br /> <br /> Two superstars starred in the film, Amir Khan and Salman Khan (they eventually became superstars). Aamir Khan is flawless in his first full-length comedy role. I applaud his sense of comic time. Salman pales in comparison to Amir, but is still pretty. Among the minor characters, Paresh Rawal stands out for his dual role as Raggopal and Shyamgopala. <br /> <br /> The film unexpectedly failed at the box office. I do not understand why. However, I recommend it to everyone.
