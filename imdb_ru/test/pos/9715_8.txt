The role of the economy in the industrialized North American market has always had to be theorized in the birthplace of engines. People and industrialists such as Mercedes-Benz and the Bavarian Motor Works (BMW) have certainly realized the possibility of a North American market with the purchase of fuel and the number of cars purchased per household. This type of economic phenomenon spawned the concept of Speed ​​Racer. <br /> <br /> After the new constitution of Japan, the industrialization of the isolated island state of Japan must again look for opportunities through economic partnership with its global neighbors. It also helped open up economic opportunities in the European and North American market, if not in the global market. <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is a young, avid driver who, not knowing anything better, drives his demanding father Pops Racer, who challenged Himself, his whole life made the car better, better winning the race. In fact, it was Pops Racer that brought his first son Rex Racer to the brink of destruction thanks to his strategy of best using the technology he developed. Being a mature rider, Rex is finally aware of his intrinsic values ​​and becomes independent, but still feels obliged to his younger brother Speed. <br /> <br /> Rex Reiser's exact relationship with people like the inspector is never clear. but put in a dramatization. Rex is ultimately accused of being an agent of the country or organization because of his ability to be in places where there are no other explanations for how he learned that Speed ​​has problems. Or the fact that in situations involving certain types of illegal activities were hidden knowledge is used against an evil conspiracy. This adds to the Speed ​​Racer the level of romance cloak and dagger. <br /> <br /> Combining the innocence of Velocities with Trixie, Sprital and Chim Chim gives a level of comic human nature. This concept is a good form of rhetoric for balancing themes and plots as they play from episode to episode. Thus, instead of a dry detective story, the racer on international racing cars, the romance of the cloak and dagger and the comedy about human nature are combined into one story - “Speed ​​racer”.
