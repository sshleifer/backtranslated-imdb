I know almost nothing about astronomy, but nonetheless; At first I was a little skeptical about the plot of this film. It follows three children who were all born during a solar eclipse and therefore have no emotions and thus (naturally) become ruthless serial killers. The plot sounds ridiculous at first, but once you understand that a solar eclipse is blocking Saturn, and, as you know, Saturn is a planet of emotions, it all falls into place; makes sense, and then you realize that you are not just watching another silly 80s slasher with a pea brain plot. Thank God for that! Seriously though, the Bloody Birthday is based on a ridiculous premise, but this more than makes up for it with its originality. Having many children going around slaughtering people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in a movie, but when I have a choice between this and another boring Friday 13th clone, I know that I would choose. <br /> /> In addition, getting the film out of the hole into which some people will think that this is a stupid plot into which they have shoved it is the fact that it is extremely interesting. Many slashers become too stereotyped too quickly, and the audience eventually looks just to see blood. This film, however, continues itself with some wonderful creepy performances from children (who return to creepy child classics, such as Village of the Damned), a constant stream of sickly humor and a small but impressive for the type of film, a dose of tension and tension. One thing that I really liked about this movie is the huge amount of weapons. There is nothing worse than a slasher in which the killer uses the same weapon over and over again (coughing on Halloween), but this is not the case here, since the Bloody Birthday finds a place for everything: from jump ropes to bows and arrows. There was no room for a chainsaw, which is a pity, but I believe that not every movie has a chainsaw.
