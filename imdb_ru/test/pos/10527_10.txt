Excellent adaptation of the novel Christie. Amazing attention to authentic details of that time (many films of the mid-1970s - early 80s, in which they tried to shoot the 1920s - the beginning of the 30s, in my opinion, look too mid-70s - early 80s , therefore, the worst was expected here, and I was glad to make a mistake) The costumes and decorations are very well made. I really liked this production ?? thanks in large part to the image of charming Francesca Annis, the carefree bright young lady "Frankie" and the charming Bobby James Warwick. The couple continued to portray Christie's Tommy & Tuppence, which is funny, as some modern book critics compared Frankie and Bobby to her earlier characters Tommy & Tuppence. Auxiliary characters were equally well done ?? the excessive Mrs. Rivington (played by Miss Marple, the future Joan H.) and Badger played well in the role after the First World War "Bertie Wooster".
