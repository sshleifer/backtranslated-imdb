Episode No. 13 of the fantastic (sorry for the incredibly funny terminology) television series "Supernatural" moves Sam and Dean Winchester to Missouri, where they were summoned by the old Dean flame to investigate the series of mysterious murders taking place in their small town, It turns out that a large pickup truck with an invisible the driver knocks down African Americans on a deserted stretch of road ... As Dean tries to rekindle his last romance, more and more people in cities find themselves on the road. The reason seems to be related to the past racial incident in the 60s, as a result of which the frustrated spirit of the villagers remained in a ghostly suspense, trying to kill black motorists. “Route 666” is another good article (which I noticed is not uncommon), which contains several noteworthy aspects related to a couple of main characters, such as Dean, who were taught and Sam’s regret that he left college ... A killer truck doesn't seem like the scariest thing in the world, although for a one-hour show, he does his job well. Not just a fantastic episode, but a solid concept with lots of references to horror movies.
