Yes, you can think of Babette’s Feast as a kind of slap to Puritan Christianity, but it’s much more. The superficial story of how a gifted Parisian chef leaves Paris after one of his revolutions from the middle class and is cast ashore in Jutland in the north of Denmark is just a lubricant that allows you to develop a deeper story. <br /> <br /> Babette is an artist, one of a small army of people who for centuries have been driven out of the column and sent to the post by stupid politicians, vain, greedy and arrogant, who kill beauty for profit, something that politics always does, pace The National Foundation for Art, which simply institutionalizes creativity for propaganda purposes. <br /> <br /> Babette is on her last legs when she arrives in a tiny village where two virgin sisters live, watching their waning crowd of devotees to the late pastor father. They live on salted cod and gruel black bread. <br /> <br /> Babette shows these simple devout people that God is in pleasure and sensuality, as well as behavioral and mental purity. It also shows them how this mental purity can lead to the control of insanity, which we all know today in neo-authoritarian governments that will restrict our personal freedoms, because they are somehow a crime against the state or we would say humanity. <br /> <br /> Babette is preparing a French dinner to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the deceased reverend. Daughters and their flock think that this devil came among them and vowed not to notice food or drink. <br /> <br /> It is at this moment that when I cook the food paid for by the Babette winnings in the French lottery, I start to burst. Compared with daily vulgarity and deceit, which permeates our mind from morning to night through the media and security forces, maneuvering to gain an advantage over all of us here in the dark, <br /> <br /> Babette’s simple art of refining the challenge of all the pretentiousness shown in our modern society, and it is painful to see how it is so gracefully played in this great film. <br /> <br /> This is the same as Fanny and Alexander (Bergman), my favorite movie in the entire history, but I can watch it only once, because like a rare bottle of wine with Blini and fresh oysters, this is something that can not be overzealous. <br /> <br /> An excellent film that should be in the library of every movie lover.
