If Family Guy insults you or you just don't get humor, unfortunately, this show makes fun of you and the masses of too religious, boring and politically correct people in America. So set your moral aside and enjoy this show. F.G. - cheerful revelation of the reality of modern society. Whoever said that this show is for a young immature audience is very mistaken. With all the references to old films and politics 10-80 years ago, I could not imagine that some young immature child would find this funny. Family Guy is definitely for a mature, open-minded audience who are not afraid to criticize American society. Hats off to Seth and the whole team that was able to organize this show.
