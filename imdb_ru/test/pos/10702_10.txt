Canadian cinematographer Ron Switzer delivers the nonstop, nonstop, thrilling horror of insane horror with the gorgeous science fiction film of 1991, Science Mad. Disgusting monster revenge its mother, police and tenants of an apartment building. Brilliant practical design of makeup and special effects create a truly terrifying monster, especially when he is hiding in atmospheric shadows and the smoke of gloomy rooms. Characters evolve beautifully with outstanding and surprisingly touching performances from the cast. Producer Donna Switzer, newcomer Ron Switzer, also wrote a screenplay of the film, which used faces, weaving an exciting rollercoaster ride with twists, turns and horror that makes you guess the last frame. Crazy science will surely leave you alone after a long, shocking conclusion. Highly recommended!
