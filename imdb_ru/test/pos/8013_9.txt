After watching this movie, I experienced a new sensation. I watched a movie in which the lead actor staged a play that almost competed with the Chevy Chase legend in Fletch. This is not to say that actions are comparable, but both provide almost flawless delivery of their lines. This actor is Mark Singer! The singer is Jack Ford, the droid shooter from the title, who makes a living collecting an award for an android. There are several mutants, droid-fun-pleasure (!), A Scandinavian smuggler and perhaps a hesitant attempt to make a class statement or maybe even globalization or ......... well, it doesn't matter. In this film, the dry manner is important, in which Singer sets out his lines, which leads to a split humor! What is important in this film is that director Fred Olen Ray seems to understand that serious science fiction rarely works, and when your budget is poor, itâ€™s better not to take yourself seriously. Olen Ray said that everyone who participated in this film was a lot of fun, and this is being transferred to the film. I dare to criticize the film, which allows itself to portray the futuristic Earth as forever dark and unlit, and then ends with pipes and valves. ' stock. Self parody is a very redeeming quality. Summing up, we can say that Fred Olen Ray is the ambassador of independent filmmaking, and Mark Singer is the perfect leader in the B-film. If only Olen Ray could make an equation in Tim Thomerson, then we would have a film in our hands.
