If you like horror or action, watch this movie as soon as possible. If the initial scene doesnâ€™t cause an adrenaline rush, someone should check your pulse. Excellent action, excellent casting and the best single-line. This is the only film I saw in the cinema where the crowd applauded every shot, hit and hit. Not perfection, but who cares when films can be so fun. This is a clean stream of dark comics. 9/10
