Well, “pretty good” doesn't scream at me, but I was surprised at how much I liked “Bonfire Stories”. Although not a classic, the participating directors have an idea of ​​what uncertainty is. Fright does not just jump on you, but instead the directors are steadily building climatic moments. The film is based on popular urban legends and ghost stories. The screenwriters have updated the stories quite well and twisted them so that the familiar endings still make themselves known. The best of the shorts are “Honeymoon” and “People can lick too”, I liked both, because in each story they have a good expectation. The medallion was a good ghost story, and the wrapper around the Bonfire is also pretty good, except that at the end they make too many turns. The only disappointing segment is the “Hook”, which is good because it is still rather short. Overall, I give it 7 out of 10. He has an expectation, which is lacking in most horror films today, and a good acting game. It may not make much difference there with Halloween and the Exorcist, but this is a good little movie, well worth the cost of hire.
