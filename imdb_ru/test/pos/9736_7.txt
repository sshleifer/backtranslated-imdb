I was a kid when I saw this show, a little later than Buck Rogers, both characters performed by the same Buster Crabbe, and I have to admit that these films were always part of the best entertainment I've ever had. The fight against Emperor Ming was one thing, but I was more interested in learning about the final fate of the Flash love triangle with Dale and Aura. Barin came and convinced Aura to forget Flash, a very innocent termination of her obsession with the beauty of Flash. The series has no offensive and really cruel scenes and can be watched by all viewers. Another thing is that I learned to swim in water, like a Crabbe, fighting with sharks. The soundtrack was also good, although it was previously used in another film by Boris Karloff, Frankenstein. It would be nice to have a DVD of this series, provided it comes with Spanish subtitles (not yet available).
