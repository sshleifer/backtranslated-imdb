This is one of my favorite TV shows. Excellent cast, excellent script and third-party plot. <br /> <br /> Watching the routine of the Kyle family gives great moments of humor and great comedians. Let's see: - Damon Wayans: no comment. He is one of the best today. Sa has the perfect time, and she always understands what the joke is. <br /> <br /> Tisha Campbell: Her paranoid and sentimental Jay is wonderful. <br /> <br /> - George O. Gore II: perfect for paper. It is impossible to imagine anyone else as a charming (and stupid) younger. <br /> <br /> - Jennifer Nicole Freeman: self-centered Claire found the perfect actress. Beautiful and talented. <br /> <br /> - Parker MacKinia Posey: it's impossible not to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> - Noah Gray-Cabie: this boy has a future, I am sure of that. <br /> <br /> I am very sad when it ends, but this show will remain in my memory forever. Michael, Jay, Claire, Junior, Kadi ... we love you!
