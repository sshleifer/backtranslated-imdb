Frank Oz's film Inside and Out, although he is kind and funny for gays, talks about a hidden gay teacher who a former student showed on national television, but was disinfected and deodorized to attract larger and more profitable viewers, under the patronage Cage for birds". Although viewers probably patted themselves on the back for being tolerant and liberal enough to watch a film, the film revolves around Howard Brackett Kevin Kline, who is stereotypical gay. The film claims that the tendency to dance to disco music, enjoy Barbra Streisand’s films and dress well indicates sexual orientation. Like The Strange Eye, the film actually beats the slap in the face of direct men and stereotypes them as untidy, brave, devoid of taste and culture. So “In and Out” is just a comedy, but even comedies send messages that can hurt. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in the center of the film's humor lies a somewhat pretentious character. Howard is middle-aged, deeply closed or selfless, and obviously never had a sex life. A three-year engagement with a teacher at the school where he works is described as a series of sunsets, long conversations, and a viewing of The Funny Lady. Fortunately, Joan Cusack plays Emily Montgomery, as was Howard’s supposed, and she steals the whole show. Most of the funniest moments of the film belong to her, although Klein’s attempts to resist dancing during the ribbon of instructions about macho behavior are fun. He is a gifted physical performer, but the film gives him only a few minutes to shine. Matt Dillon also stands out as a student who became an actor, and the clip from his Oscar-nominated soldier-gay film is hysterical. Nevertheless, despite the funny theme of the film, there is no romance “a boy meets a boy”, but only one kiss from man to man, and this buzz is about as erotic as the one that was between Michael and Fredo Corleone in “ Godfather II. " <br /> <br /> Despite good intentions, “In and Out” does not cope with injustice and prejudice, which he illustrates. Howard is fired from his teaching job, despite his outstanding work and powers, but a slight outrage is expressed. Most of the characters are more upset because of the cancellation of the wedding, than because of Howard’s self-realization, which seems to happen overnight, and his sudden and unfair dismissal. Not surprisingly, Howard's parents, portrayed with love by Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley, and his students stand up to support him. However, the sweet finale is as embarrassing as the public, as was obvious with Howard Brackett in the film. The film would be more refreshing if it revolved around a gay man who dressed like a slobber, was an avid football fan, drove a wagon, listened to country music and lived on fast food. Despite some good performances and funny situations, “In and Out” supports stereotypes, and, whether they are positive or negative, stereotypes should be sent to the dump of social history.
