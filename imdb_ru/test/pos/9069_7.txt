Peter Lorre gives one of his most evil notions as the owner of a named place. A new government agent appeared in the plot, setting a trail for character Peter Lorre. When a G-man contacts his murdered one of the agents Lorre, G-Man goes to jail for murder, although everyone knows that there is another story. Lorre entrusted him with assistance and took him to the island, where he mined diamonds. Lorre wants to know what our hero knows, but he does not speak, and a battle of wills is made. <br /> <br /> This is a good solid little thriller, which is not very good sense of the plot, but even in this case the film interests you. I put on the film last night to use it as something I could drift to, instead I found the story quite exciting and I woke up for an additional 70 minutes. Lorre is the reason why a person falls into this. His behavior is rather unnerving. He does very little, but according to his orders and the way everyone reacts to him (look at how they smoke his cigarettes), it is clear that he is a bad dude. <br /> <br /> Worth a look, is it worth it to bump into him.
