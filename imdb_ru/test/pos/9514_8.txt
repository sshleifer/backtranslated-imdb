I actually caught a Japanese magazine ad in a Japanese magazine last year and wondered what the heck it was until I saw the movie trailer. Then I remembered seeing an English translation of Sakyo Komatsuâ€™s novel a few years ago. I got it, and it was pretty good, and also frighteningly realistic. This is enough to make the reader afraid to hear any news about earthquakes in Japan. <br /> <br /> Now I read the book and watched this version of the 2006 film (the first film was released in 1973). And you know what? I thought the film was pretty good, even if there were significant changes from the novel to the film (but this is understandable). The story is simple - a serious tectonic shift will lead to the fall of Japan during the year. Massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunami rock the country as frantic efforts are being made to evacuate as many people as possible. One scientist has a plan that can stop the flooding of the country and save what is left of the land, but can it be implemented on time? I saw JAPAN SINKS on Otakon 2007, and although I had a couple of problems with it - it worked too long, and a couple of moments of the character was too juicy - I, nevertheless, was shocked. The concept of an entire nation plunging into the sea became terrifyingly real, and the results were some of the best I've ever seen competing with everything Hollywood has done. The film also has no favorites with the main characters, and some do not get into the final credits. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was surprised by some of the negative comments made about this film. The difference of opinion, I guess. Personally, I liked it. And I read the original book.
