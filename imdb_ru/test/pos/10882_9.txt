This game is not the best game for N64. Of course, this is good, but only when there are 4 players. Without 4 players, the only thing to do is to take mines from a distance and see how many people you can kill. But half of this game is the levels at which you have to save Natalia, so you will have to limit the use of remote mines at these levels, and this becomes quite boring. The graphics don't exactly reach the level of Super Mario 64 or even Mario Kart 64. And if you're talking about great multiplayer in a first-person shooter, you have to use Perfect Dark. At the very least, you can play multiplayer on your own.
