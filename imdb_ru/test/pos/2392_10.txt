I have been writing hard-boiled crime literature for several years now. When a writer develops a story, he always means the character / actor to bring the story to life. Last weekend I found a new one in Paul Vario playing Uncle Benny in Eddie Monroe. It was a pleasant film, underlined by the presence of Vario both on the screen and beyond (you can also hear his narration). I also especially liked the actress who plays Bennie's niece and ex-wife Eddie, although in this exciting movie everyone did a great job with the game with the bad guys and double crossing. Great work around ... and Mr. Vario shone brighter than anyone. He must be my Tony Gangi someday ...
