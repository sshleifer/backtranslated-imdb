Some words cannot describe the beauty and power of this film. <br /> <br /> Think about Toy Story. Now think Toy Story, circa 1934. Now imagine that the animation looks as alive, as smooth. Think of the film not as adults or children enjoy, but imagine it as a film noir. <br /> <br /> Imagine trying to do something similar in 1934. Somehow "Talisman" copes. In the story, where toys come to life, and one of them is trying to deliver an orange to his sick owner, Starewicz shows a completely unexpected level of animation. It is so smooth that you will wonder for a long time whether what you see is really a stop motion animation. <br /> <br /> Comparing Toy Story and Talisman is a useless example with a storyline: while Toy Story is a children's story that adults can enjoy, Talisman is a dark, frightening story. on adults. So, NO, your children will not like it. One bit <br /> <br /> However, get it if you can. You might be able to find it along "Vampyr" in DVD and LaserDisc. And get ready to be stunned by what Starewicz could do back in 1934 with a pair of puppets.
