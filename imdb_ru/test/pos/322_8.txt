Last night I saw a PICTURE ON A CHECK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles). Oddly enough, it lasted 137 minutes - a little longer than the time specified in IMDb. <br /> <br /> At first I lost interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me. The context of what was happening was missing, and I am glad that I was stuck with it. First, a young couple marries, and soon after the wedding, a war begins in their native Sri Lanka, and the lovers are separated. Months later, the wife is very pregnant and is aboard a ship for refugees bound for India. In the refugee center, you see a woman who is about to give birth, after which the names of the film are finally revealed. <br /> <br /> The whole point of the film is completely changed - to a girl who meets for 9 years in Madras, India. You see her in her house, and she talks to the camera about her life and family. None of this seems so interesting or important, and you wonder what is missing - what about the woman who was about to give birth? My wife and I discussed this, and we finally guessed that this little girl was actually the child of the lady in the first part of the film. One way or another, she was adopted and talked about her life with her mom and dad # 2 - although she did NOT understand that these people were not her biological parents. <br /> <br /> Shortly afterwards, the parents told themselves to be complete idiots (one of the complaints I had about the film), as they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about their origins. And to say it this way, that the girl emotionally screwed up and confused. Despite the stupid decision and telling her in the worst possible way, her parents made up for it by agreeing to help her find her biological mother. Observing the influence of all of this on the girl and her parents (especially on the foster mother) was impressive, and this aroused my interest. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sri Lanka was involved in a very, very long and cruel treatment. civil war with Tamil militants for three decades. The familyâ€™s decision to seek a mother in Sri Lanka was really noble, but sometimes even a bit silly - because they risked and were almost again and again killed, just blindly jumping into the middle of a war! All this was exciting and exciting, but also made me think about the adoptive parents' sanity - first you tell her that she is NOT your biological child, and now you are taking her in the middle of the WAR ZONE !!! Of course, the child really wanted to meet her biological mother, but it was stupid when viewed from behind. If it were me, I would be tempted to pay the unemployed actress to play the role and deceive the child - thus avoiding being in the middle of the war! <br /> <br /> Despite my complaints, the film was a pleasure to watch and was very useful. Far from perfect, it certainly hits an emotional run home. In addition, although I expected this because I saw several Indian films, many Westerners will be a little surprised by the bright songs that seem to come from anywhere - this is the IS standard in most films from India - including those shot in Bollywood (Bombay ) and Tamilwood / Collywood (Madras).
