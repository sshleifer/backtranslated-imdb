It was a favorite film of my late wife. I am sorry that she didn’t live to see the video, as I’m sure she would have erased it. What can we say? A magnificent romantic story and the push of two great people, Raizuli and Teddy Rex. Sean Connery and Brian Keith are great in these roles. But while Connery is his usual sex sex, this is the late Brian Keith, who gives us a solid performance in the role of mercurial Teddy Roosevelt. The backup is provided by Candy Bergen, gorgeous in her beginning, as a kidnapped American widow. Excellent support also comes from the great John Houston in the role of the besieged Teddy SecState, John Hay; Jeffrey Lewis from Clint Eastwood is great as the indecisive US ambassador Gummer; The late Vladek Shabal with his demonically evil look is magnificent, like Beshow, and much more is given by Steve Canali and Roy Jensen, whose faces we saw in several backgrounds. In general, this film is filled with wonderful romance, remembering a long past epoch. Senseless story? It's my pleasure. The question of how big nations oust smaller ones for the sake of their hegemonic interests is as relevant today as it was then. Overly romantic? Not really, of course, not in the spirit of Maudlin. Interesting to watch? You put. I own the video and will watch it again and again. I suggest you do the same.
