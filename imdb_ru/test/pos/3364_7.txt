The 1970s are often regarded as the golden age of British television comedy, a period in which numerous classic sitcoms were observed, as well as sketches such as Monty Python's Flying Circus. This period, however, was clearly not the golden age of British comedy, and what worked well in television was rarely successfully transmitted to the big screen. The most triumphant exceptions to this rule were provided by the Pythons, but their best films (“Monty Python and the Holy Grail” and “Life of Brian”) were very different in concept from their television shows. <br /> <br /> The main problem with adapting comedy films for movie theaters is that concepts designed for use in 30-minute BBC slots (25 minutes on ITV where there should be an advertising space) do not always work like that It’s good to expand them to a feature film of three or four. times how long. Few people remember the versions of the film, say, "Up Pompeii!" or Stepto and Son, with the same affection as the television versions. In the case of many classic TV comedy shows (“Some mothers do Ave 'Em”, “Yes, Minister”, “Fawlty Towers”, “The Goodies”) no attempts were made to make them at all, for which we can be grateful. Characters like Frank Spencer Michael Crawford or Basil Falti of John Cleese can be hilarious in half-hourly doses, but I doubt that they will remain as funny for two hours. One of the comedy programs (although the dramatization of the comic novel, not a comedy in the usual sense of the word) that could work in the movie was “Fall and Rebellion of Reginald Perrin”, but all hopes for the film were broken tragically early death of his star Leonard Rossiter . <br /> <br /> Papa's Army was one of the few television sitcoms of that period that was turned into a worthy film. (The only friend I can think of was Porridge). Perhaps this was due to the fact that he had an unusually large number of well-developed characters, and most of his humor stemmed from the interaction between them. The initial comedy series was held from 1968 to 1977 and told about the misfortunes of a home guard platoon in the small seaside town of Walmington-on-Sea. (The internal guard, originally known as the “Local Defense Volunteers,” was auxiliary police during World War II, consisting mainly of people too old to serve in regular troops). The film version is a three-act drama. Act I concerns the formation of a platoon and the recruitment of its members. In the second act, they cause chaos during army exercises. In the third act, they manage to capture a group of Nazi pilots whose plane was shot down. <br /> <br /> The three key players in this drama are platoon commander, captain George Miningverring (Arthur Lowe), and his two subordinate sergeant Arthur Wilson (John Le Mesourie) and corporal Jacks Jones (Clive Dunn). Mainvering, who in civilian life is the local bank manager, is a fussy man looking at the world through thick glasses. It is he who takes the initiative to form a detachment of internal protection and assigns himself to his commander. He is pompous, responsible, with an exaggerated sense of self-worth and his leadership abilities, a man who does not tolerate stupid things with joy. (And in George Meinwaring's worldview, the term fool covers most of the rest of the human race). He, however, has his good qualities. He is motivated by a truly patriotic idealism and is capable of great physical courage, as evidenced by his meeting with the Germans. <br /> <br /> Wilson is Deputy Minering at the bank. These two people are very different in character, which is emphasized by the difference in appearance: Wilson is tall and thin, while Mainvering is short and strong. He seems smarter and more educated than his boss. (His emphasis suggests that he may be a former public school student). Nevertheless, he ended up playing the second fiddle in both civil and military life, probably because he has a kind of passive personality that leads to pessimism and defeatism and the inability to take anything at all seriously. Jones is an old soldier who now runs a local butcher shop. (His promotion to the corporal is mainly due to his ability to bribe Mainwaring with black market sausages). His enthusiasm for his new role is accompanied only by his incompetence and ability to cause chaos. Although his key phrase: “Do not panic!” He is prone to panic whenever possible. <br /> <br /> Some other platoon members are represented. Private Fraser, a stern Scottish undertaker, is even more pessimistic than Wilson. (Slogan: “We are doomed, man, doomed!”). Private Godfrey is a kind old man whose main concern is the location of the nearest toilet. Private Walker is a sharp Cockney-spiv, and Private Pyke (another bank employee) is a spoiled mommy boy. (Pike's mother is Wilson's lover, although Wilson tries to hide this connection from disapproving Mainwaring). The two significant outsiders are the soft-mannered Vicar and the ARP warden, the hated enemy of Mainwaring and his equal in flatulence and authority. <br /> <br /> Sometimes obscene doubles happen (“Keep your hands away from my rank and file” - Mainwaring allegedly means those soldiers who have this rank), more than in a television show that was surprisingly free from the understatement. (Its creators, David Croft and Jimmy Perry, later began to create comedy shows, such as “Do you serve?” And “Hi-De-Hai”, which were known for their impressive humor. The film, however, retains much of the mix of gentle wit, nostalgia and harsh characteristics that made the series so successful. 7/10
