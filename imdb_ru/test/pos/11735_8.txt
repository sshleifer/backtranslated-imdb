One of the few comedic Twilight zones that is really good. We have Floyd Barber from the Andy Griffith Show, Promotion in the store Dude old Geezer from many old westerns and cute old Frisbee. It also has that cool spacecraft interior, which I suppose was used in the Classic Forbidden Planet Sci Fi. Or another day, when the Earth was Sill. Plus, the new guys in the city drive an exotic Renault sports car (I think) back to the time when European cars were known as "Foreign Jobs" in the USA. The very idea of ​​harmonics as a weapon is a scream. And the fact that Frisbee's friends love him, despite the fact that he is a real BS artist, is a touching moment.
