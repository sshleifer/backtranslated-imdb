I saw it at the 2004 Stony Brook Film Festival in New York, and it was very warmly received. In this film before World War II, a pair of German rocket scientists working on the Scottish island of Scarp, when war looms on the horizon. Characters found on the island are invaluable in their creation and image. Shauna MacDonald especially remembered <br /> <br /> After gaining speed on “Scottish” accents, the viewer feels at home with these people, who enjoy watching the Germans try to connect their island with the mainland via rocket mail delivery. Oddly enough, this film was based on a true story. <br /> <br /> In general, an unforgettable film that will stay with you for a while thanks to its castes, history or scenery.
