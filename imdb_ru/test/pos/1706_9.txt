To paraphrase Toru Birch: “I like this film. This is the exact opposite of everything I hate in the film. ” <br /> <br /> This obscure film was too restrained and smart to get a theatrical release, any chance of success would require an expensive advertising campaign. And the history of the majority, where nothing much happens - where instead the focus is on character development, has a limited target audience. Anyone heard of a mature movie for teens? <br /> <br /> But if you have the opportunity to watch it or you can part with a few dollars for a DVD, you could have done a lot worse. “The wife of my teacher” is not something revolutionary, but it’s worth a lot and it stands up well for multiple views. <br /> <br /> Jason London (as high school student Todd Boomer) is a star and fits this character as well as his role in Man on the Moon and Stunned and Lost. He is assisted by exceptional work from his support staff. In the lead role, Tia Carrere is a revelation (she can act) as Todd's tutor in calculus and love interest. Christopher MacDonald as a teacher in a good self-parodied performance. Zach Orth and Alexondra Lee are Todd's best friends, and Jeffrey Tabor is his father. <br /> <br /> As someone previously commented, this is a “mature” teen film, because romance is universally unsuccessful - at least according to the traditional standards of a happy ending. Even Todd's parents are indifferent to each other, as his father chokes on the title character, and his mother (Leslie Lyles) literally speaks on the phone during the entire time she spends on the screen (a device that provides more and more relief from the comedy appearance). The novel "London-Carrere" has an unexpected charm and is much more believable than any other storyline for older women that you are likely to find. <br /> <br /> But the real strength of the film is the evolving relationship of three friends. There is no overburdened melodrama, only three immature people who alternate between checking and trusting each other, obeying all the dynamics that three young people can bring to such things. They really manage to make "believable" relationships with three people, perhaps the first in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
