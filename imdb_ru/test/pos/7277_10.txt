This mystical / psychological thriller, I think, is one of the best I've ever seen. All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin in the role of Jamie Harris, who first turns from a nervous starlet into strange events in which she participates, to a class star. In this film you will learn a lot about the real inner emotions of people, as well as about the movie business itself. The film in the movies at the beginning and in the game that the “acting coach” plays with her is fascinating. In addition, Mark Snow's music is perhaps the best rating I've ever heard. You will not forget this movie!
