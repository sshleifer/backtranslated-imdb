I have been studying Brazilian cinema since 2004, when I came across Cidade de Deus / City of God. Let me tell you something, this film is probably as good or BETTER than “City of God”. <br /> <br /> Acting, cinematography and music supervision make this film a unique experience. I have not been to Brazil yet, but this film represents the harsh reality facing the people of São Paulo. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if you like a good movie. This movie is disturbing, and after watching you may feel a little depressed. <br /> <br /> Something that you want to see, but not something to sleep.
