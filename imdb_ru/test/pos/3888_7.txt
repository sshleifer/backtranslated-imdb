My original title for this review was to be, "The End of Disappointments, The Film Triumphs." But I really thought about it on the way home. Most of these films are not a fairy tale, they take turns in turns, and although their end is disappointing at first, it slowly sinks and hits the core in a satisfactory tone. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a man named James Aaron (“Curbing His Enthusiasm” by Jeff Garlin, who also wrote and directed) a struggling actor who lives in Chicago with his mother and deals with both obesity and with the inability to find someone you can love. <br /> <br /> Yes, it sounds trite, but he is experimenting with elements that make him somewhat unpredictable, and actually makes you want it to last longer. The end came suddenly and made me say: “That's all!!” But as soon as it starts to tell, it really makes you smile. <br /> <br /> There are many tones of seriousness in it, but do not be afraid, because this is also very funny. Some scenes cause loud laughter, and those who have seen Jeff Garlin’s insert will recognize the couple (first of all, when he makes a speech on his career day in the classroom of his kindergarten’s niece and bombs). It starts with some serious note that you do not expect, but what follows is very funny, fascinating and quite sharp. This is a movie that you keep watching and always enjoy. And, as I have already said, at the beginning the ending may seem absurd, but if you think about it, this is a real joy.
