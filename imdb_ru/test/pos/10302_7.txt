This film is based on a play and is the second adaptation of this work. Paul Sorvino plays basketball team teams of players who, despite everything, took the championship home 20 years ago. They all met for reunion. Terry Kinney plays James, a high school student, and quickly becomes nervous with all his whining and pitying me. Vincent D'Onofrio, like Phil, plays a disgusting businessman with the right amount of money. Tony Shalhoub - George, the current mayor of the city, and, it seems, is on the verge of some kind of breakdown. Gary Sinise plays Tom, a writer who became an alcoholic, and, in my opinion, does an excellent job with this role. Although they are all believed to celebrate their championship, conflict, jealousy and fighting abound. When men agree with what was and is, they are forced to look at their lives in an unappealing way. Unusually, when a group of men talk and cry about what could be, it was interesting for me to observe how they relate to each other. This is not the best movie I've seen, but it is definitely good enough to watch.
