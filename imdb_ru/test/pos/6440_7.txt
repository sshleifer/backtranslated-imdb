In 1850 in Yorkshire, a crook falsely accused a boy of a chimney sweep and he escapes. He falls into the treacherous local river and is transferred to the underwater kingdom, where he makes many friends and saves the mythical Water Children from an evil shark. <br /> <br /> According to the book by Charles Kingsley, this is a great children's film, half live action and half animation, which are both dark and evocative images of Victorian times and an incredibly pleasant underwater adventure. These are really two films in one that somehow complement each other and unite into a much richer whole. Beautiful animations by Tony Cuthbert, Jack Stokes and Miroslav Kyiyovich, as well as photographs of Ted Skaif and music by Phil Coulter and Bill Martin. Pender has a great diamond quality, like (literal) fish out of water - I like the moment when he is at the top of the mansion, he sees all the pipes and shouts "Blimey !!" in a loud voice. Mason and Cribbins are the dirtiest and nastiest hooligans you can hope to see in costume drama (if you want to see real Victorian values, don't watch “Feeling and Sensitivity”, see this), and also Whitelow, Pertwee (who makes countless voices) and Percival everything is fine. This is how a good kids movie should be - good old cheerful singing, but also a little thoughtful, sad and frightening. Awesome Cockallorum !!
