I remember this old movie. This is an excellent, frightening, atmospheric horror picture of a man who moves to a Scottish castle, only to find strange events taking place in the corridors at night. And in the most famous Hollywood labyrinth of a hedge even stranger events take place. Yes, this is the maze that you saw in every full-length movie that has always had a Topiary puzzle, right up to The Shining. But the highlight of this story is the last thing you could guess. I certainly did not expect this. This is an excellent example of how good and convincing a film can be, even if the premise is completely insane, bordering on a laughable one. I would recommend this to everyone.
