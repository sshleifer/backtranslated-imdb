I neglected this film when I went to the cinema, but then curiosity came to me, and I decided to check it out. I like it!!! The film begins with Judy and Jay heading to a Halloween party at the abandoned funeral home of Hull House. Then we meet a few more characters, Angela and Suzanne (the hosts), Franny, Max, Roger, Sal and Helen. Then, of course, they start to have fun, and when they are really in the mood, they decide to arrange a session that awakens the demon. The demon has Angela, and she begins her terrible slaughter. Will they survive the night of the demons? <br /> <br /> The whole movie was great. The blood was fine, but the nudity provided by Linnae Quigley (Trash from ROTLD) again screwed it up. I have never been a fan of her and never will be.
