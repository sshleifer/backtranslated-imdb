Despite the fact that some unrealistic things happen at the end (for example, a policeman shoots a pistol at a crowded carousel where any number of innocent people can be killed), it was still an intense, pleasant thriller, one of Alfred Hitchcock’s best films. Robert Walker is excellent as a frightening psycho, he is really convincing, offering an exciting game that is sometimes too creepy. His colleague here, Farley Granger, is fine, but not suitable for Walker, both in action and in the characters they play. This is a typical Hitchcock film with some strange perspectives, immoral themes, an innocent person in trouble, etc. Unlike many of his other films, I thought it was a fast moving story with very boring spots. Being a former tennis player, I liked his shots with excellent old network matches, which were held a few good rallies. Hitchcock's real daughter, Patricia, plays an interesting and unique secondary role here. She didn’t just get a job because of her father; she can act. Also worth noting: the DVD has both British and American versions, and there are some differences in this story. This is a classic film that is still mentioned in modern films, even in such comedies as “Throw Mom from the Train”.
