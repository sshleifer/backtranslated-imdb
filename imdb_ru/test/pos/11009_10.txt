Interestingly, the metaphysics of Plato and Aristotle, formal logic and abstract ontology form the sciences that are not interested in most people. But about a thousand years after Aristotle, the computer began to usurp human thinking, and people who refused to reflect issues other than biological, physical, and chemical suddenly felt paralyzed because they could not cope with the consequences that these computers would bring ". R.W. Fassbinder's “Welt Am Draht”, together with “Solaris” by Tarkovsky and “Alphavil” Godard, is probably the first film in which the philosophical questions of modern computer science became the basis of the story told in the film. Confusing questions about identities and realities are cleverly embedded into various intertwined criminal stories that the audience is really trying to follow because they are interested in solving cases. Fassbinder was a master who sold to the public highly abstract content, putting theoretical knowledge into practical, mouth-watering forms. The main problem for understanding is that identity defines reality, but, on the other hand, reality also requires identity in order to be perceived. The idea of ​​a person with multiple identities is known to us exclusively from the point of view of psychiatry. However, logically, the only reason we have only one identity is that our logic has only two meanings (correct and false). Now take a logic with another value, that is, with three: then, as you can easily see, you already have three identities. What happens now when, say, Dr. Stiller is killed? Then it is quite possible that only one of the three personalities will be canceled, and the other two will remain and be able to save a person from death. Another question is if a person with multiple identities really feels these identities at once. The idea, however, to display such sets of identities up and down or up and down, as shown on the stage with an elevator in a hotel, is misleading, since identities and, therefore, reality are not structured hierarchically, but rather in a hierarchical way. Strictly speaking, “artificial identity” also does not exist, since each identity is defined by two objects that share all their functions with each other. Therefore, the idea to assume that each person has only one single identity is nothing else but a consequence of the ancient two-digit logic (the second identity implies that the person simultaneously exists and does not exist). But now look around and see that the same object (which by definition is self-identical) is perceived by each subject in its own way. Therefore, if each subject sees the object differently, why should it not be possible for an individual to open the boundaries of his two-digit personality corset so that different people can exchange their different individuals? Five years later, Fassbinder raised this topic in his masterpiece “Despair. Journey to the light.
