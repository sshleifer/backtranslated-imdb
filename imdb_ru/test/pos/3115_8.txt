In 1950, two completely different and interesting westerns appeared: Henry King's Shooter and John Ford's Master Wagons. Gunfighter was historically noteworthy because it clearly influenced Zimmerman's High Noon (1951) and later revisionist westerns. <br /> <br /> However, I personally believe that the Wagon Master is superior to its contemporaries. Ford's minor masterpiece is not much about telling stories; it should be understood more as a poem describing the concepts of the old west. Despite the optimism and warmth in the soul, we deserve naivety, because there are absolutely no pretentious underlines in it. The border landscape is well used because it perfectly supports the poetic narration. Add naturalistic camera work, and we will move among Mormon travelers to witness western cinema narration.
