The producer, Matt Mochari, stumbled upon the theme of the film, Anderson Sa (leader of the AfroReggae music movement), during a visit to the Hewlett Foundation in Rio de Janeiro. Mohari was so moved by the story of Sa that he called his friend, New York director Jim Zimbalist, who quit his job and joined Mochari in Brazil to work on a documentary film about Sa, favelas of Rio and the culture of violence. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film tells about the culture of violence in Rio favelas (slums where the poor live) through videotaping of police raids and attacks on residents. The video is clear and shocking. <br /> <br /> The charismatic Anderson Sa, who has overcome a possible career in the drug trade, has begun to start the AfroReggae movement, which combines elements of Afro-Brazilian culture. Reggae, ska and other elements in the rapidly developing, heavy, percussion style of music that has since spread to other parts of the world. You can't help getting carried away with music, especially when you see that local children are involved in the Sa school that he founded, so as not to let the children in the drug gang. The rest of the film follows the rapid rise of Sa, and its positivity changes the lives of many children in search of a life unrelated to drug addiction. SPOILER: Just at the moment when the filmmakers thought they had completed the shooting, there is an incredible life change in which you need to believe the resolution. The film then continues, and you are in your chair to the end. <br /> <br /> This film is the answer to “The City of God”, and this is a worthy answer. The gloomy situation depicted in this film is contrasted with a real example of how the inhabitants of the favela can overcome the difficult situation they are in and use their resources to achieve constructive goals. You can't help but love and cheer for Anderson Sa to succeed. <br /> <br /> This film is amazingly filmed, dynamic and quite entertaining. Judging by the overwhelming audience response to the SilverDocs movie show last night, the film should be spread internally in the US, and a stunning soundtrack should be released. Follow this excellent documentary - it is superb!
