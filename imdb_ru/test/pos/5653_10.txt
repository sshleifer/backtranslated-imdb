"Nobi" or "Lights on the Plain" is a film that is so good on many levels that nothing good can be said about it. I only regret that I did not manage to see this film of 1959 earlier. <br /> <br /> Being something of a purist, I tend to look at films because of their artistic merit based on dialogue, acting, photography, and even effort to stay true to the period in terms of costume. Ultimately, I want to know if a truthful film that reveals a human condition is enough to make me think, not oppressing me, because the director wants me to think. <br /> <br /> “Fires on the Plain” is an excellent film because it creates a portrait filled with realistic human reactions to the fading lights of a great historical catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Ichitakaw's film is a condemnation of war at all levels — like any good war movie. War is terrifying, bloody, destructive. It is also detrimental to the psyche. However, what is fundamental in the "Fires on the Plain" is his uncompromising glance at the Japanese soldiers. This shows that they are slowly crumbling under the weight of the superior American firepower and the inability of their country to wage a war of their own production. The fatalistic code that encourages death before surrender lies at the heart of this insanity. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see such an honest and cruel stare at the bitter fruits of Japan’s military setbacks, just 14 years after its end. about what the Japanese call the "Great Pacific War." Ichikawa talks about what the Germans called "military life", the plight of a simple soldier. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa’s film is interesting because even today it’s hard for Japan to come to terms with its wartime fanaticism, its submission to the defeated nations, racism in its war against the Chinese, and war crimes that included the cannibalism of soldiers and officers committed not only against friend, but also against allied prisoners of war. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa produces an absolute impression of the casualties of soldiers due to the merging of bad political decisions and cultural pressure. <br /> <br /> This serious examination is skillfully made, depicting doomed soldiers as people who at various times demonstrate fear, brilliantly laconic humor, a dialogue enriched by its rarity, and a plot whose complexity is refuted by gloomy, wild nature. <br /> <br /> The portrait of Ichikawa is a torn and painful tapestry of defeated people. Tuberculous Tamura, whom Eiji Funakoshi plays as a woeful and tender soul, is a good soldier who cannot give up his humanity, although he is just as scared and lost as his comrades. Before he goes to the hospital, where he will be declared too healthy, Tamura receives a hand grenade from his boss, who, recognizing the hopelessness of their situation, advises Tamura to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Why Tamura was hopelessly ill The supplied and non-military unit was not ordered to surrender at the beginning of the film shown. Ichikawa makes it clear that the war is over, and everyone is just waiting for death. When Tamura leaves his squad for his hopeless search for physical and spiritual salvation, he sees his comrades senselessly digging a bomb shelter. They look like corpses, breaking away from their mass graves. <br /> <br /> Later, we see overloaded medical staff at the hospital throwing dying patients at the all-consuming American shelling. Patient patients who crawl out of their huts in a vain attempt to survive, look like miserable snake creatures dragging themselves from omnipotent power. You know that they will not survive. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa makes it clear that the only thing worse than the defeated army is the one that has lost its honor, abandoning its humanity and its comrades. While Tamura staggers through the jungles of Leyte, we are faced with a nobleness, a dying person and an exploiter. Cannibalism lifts its ugly head when soldiers start eating each other, rather than surrendering to the American “corned beef”. <br /> <br /> When men talk about surrender, the propaganda of how Americans kill prisoners is opposed by a secular soldier, which shows that the approaching Americans feed and care for prisoners of war because they, unlike the Japanese, respect brave soldiers who are forced to surrender. <br /> <br /> It was the Japanese who intend to die, fighting for the emperor, long after the resistance, lost all meaning. Those who are ready to fight to the death will be killed. This is the calculus of war. <br /> <br /> After firing at a murderous and cannibalistic comrade, to whom he had previously offered his own body as food, reckless surrender of the fatalistic Tamura also seems to be a deliberate form of suicide. His death is a lonely image. Did Ichikawa try to tell us about the internal conflict of an ordinary soldier who wants to live, but who is still trapped in his country's suicidal cultural codes? <br /> <br /> If someone watches this movie carefully, he or she can see that absolutism and fanaticism are the enemy. Americans are portrayed as technologically advanced people who want to use this technology in the form of inexorable military power — a lesson that transformed Japanese post-war society. Ichikawa's film is not so shallow that it blames America. Ichikawa blames the sedimentary layers of Japan's destructive policies that led to the war, and then continue it when all was lost. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa does not mention nuclear weapons dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. He should not. The slow destruction of the imperial Japanese army in the Philippines reveals the seeds of Japan's self-immolation.
