Richard Kondi is a miracle of Canada that needs to be shared with the world. Whether it’s grueling early work, such as Getting Started and Oscar-nominated Snit through Pupil and digital La Salla, Condi is a cherished local hero. But not a single special work places such an imprint on his career as the “Big Nurse”. And did I mention that it was nominated for an Oscar? Darn tootin '. <br /> <br /> “Big Nyuka”, although clearly the bearer of the messages of the 1980s (a short rotation around the Cold War that requires nuclear annihilation, but do not worry - this is fun as hell) carries more meaning and most of the work of Condi in understated form. While the planet is in a hurry to hide from Armageddon, the couple quarrels because of annoying habits of each other (really, like Condi, he cuts furniture, and she literally shakes with her eyes). And do not forget to watch it again and again, because there is always something to look at. Condi loads this guy with countless visual jokes and catchy phrases. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend finding this incredible animation. In Canada, this is usually noticed in the video of the National Film Council, which includes other star shorts (including Winnipegger Cordell Barker, "The Cat Has Returned"). Americans just have to dig a little deeper, but keep on it ?? the reward is worth the hard work.
