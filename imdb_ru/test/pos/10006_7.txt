I felt that this film had many good qualities. Cinematography, of course, was different, revealing the stage aspect of the scenery and plot. Original characters as actors, of course, were an achievement, and I felt that most of them play quite convincingly, of course, they play themselves, but they are definitely unique. Cultural aspects can leave many disappointed, as familiarity with Chinese and Oriental culture will answer many questions about parent-child relationships and the stigma associated with any drug use. I found the story of Jia Hongsheng interesting. The bottom line is that this story is in Beijing, and some of its scents about fashion and music in the early 90s, although it was made in 2001, so sometimes it's really stupid (the Beatles crap, etc.) however, not a dozen or twenty, but if it's on TV, take a look.
