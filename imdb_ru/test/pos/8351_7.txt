* secondary spoilers * <br /> <br /> You know what comes to the point that the television animation of Walt Disney can equally well be called the animation of the sequel to Walt Disney. These sequels range from excellent (“Beauty and the Beast: Enchanted Christmas” and fantastic “Lion King II: Simba's Pride”) to terrible (“Return of Jafar”). (This is, of course, my personal opinion.) Now Disney brings us their latest sequel. "The Adventure of Scamp", and, despite its shortcomings, it is still interesting. <br /> <br /> Animation quality is not up to par with Disney animation; However, the animators do a good job of reviving the characters. Ladies and Trump do not have the age of the day since 1955. Trusts are still talking about their sense of smell and about “All Reliable”, and Jock is still upsetting him about this. There is a good fight between Trump and the huge dog in the dog pound, and again we enjoy the dinner with spaghetti with two romantic reasons (although it is highly doubtful that this will become a classic scene, like its predecessor). /> <br /> I really don't care about most of the songs (although Roger Barth and Susan Egan - the singing voices of Scamp and Angel - sing their parts very well). Both Melissa Manchester and Norman Gimbel have done a much better job in the past. Danny Trobe's score is fine, but nothing memorable. And some of the gangs in the dump seem like excess baggage; that is, they really do nothing. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, voice work is pretty good. Although I do not like Jeff Bennett as a dog lover, he is very good as a Tramp. Chazz Palminteri does an excellent job of working as Buster, the brigade’s dump leader, and Alyssa Milano — what could be her best performance as an Angel. Then there is Scamp (who is the spitting image of his father). He is voiced by SCOTT WOLF'S PERFECTION. Wolf perfectly shows Scamp's wild features and his soft side. <br /> <br /> In general, although Scamp Adventure is flawed, it still makes watching quite entertaining. However, I hope that Walt Disney’s TV animation will turn its attention to more original material for its future releases. <br /> <br />
