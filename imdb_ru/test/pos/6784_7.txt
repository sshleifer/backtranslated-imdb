Never mind if 'National Velvet (1944)' is a bit beaten and sometimes unconvincing, Clarence Brown's horse fable is a charming and very pleasant story with good morality. After achieving modest success thanks to her appearance in Lassie Come Home (1943), young Elizabeth Taylor, 12, received her first lead role as Velvet Brown, an avid schoolgirl with horse obsession. Although the film was shot in California, the story - based on the novel by Enid Banyold - takes place in a small town in the English countryside, and Technicolor photos are fully used to present bright and beautiful landscapes of blue sky and green bushes. Mickey Rooney gets the highest rating as Mi Taylor, the erroneous ex-jockey with insidious intentions, whose relationship with young Velvet evokes his sense of dignity and opens up a new, optimistic chapter in his life. Although he fights noticeably in the same sequence, when he has to confess to the traumatic experience that led to his fear of horses, Rooney is pleasant as a surly but passionate young man who has to prove his worth. <br /> <br /> It may well be that Elizabeth Taylor had these charming purple eyes, because her acting skills at this young age were rather limited. Her more emotional sequences, in which she displays courage and honesty in the face of adversity, seem rather empty to her, and the touchingly naive idea that just “faith” will achieve everything is something that has been repeated to nausea since then. an unforgettable inspirational sports movie ever made. However, Taylor has bright eyes and enthusiasm, and she works well with Mickey Rooney, who was no stranger to being a child star. Anne Revere plays a very important role as the mother of Velvet, once a famous athlete, who not only sailed the English Channel, but also trained with love by none other than Mi Taylor's own father. I liked that Mi was not told about this until the last seconds of the film, when Mrs. Brown correctly decided that the young man first had to develop his own sense of decency, and not exploit the memory of his late father for financial gain, as he undoubtedly would have done in the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film reaches its climax on the Great National Sweepstakes, where Velvet at the last moment decided to ride her own horse, Pi, in a world-famous contest. Under the guise of a Latvian man, she continues, as expected, to win the race, but later she is disqualified - either because she is a girl or because she fell from a horse before she was allowed to dismount (what a stupid rule!). This extended racing sequence is extremely well done, it effectively relieves the nervous tension of those nerve seconds before the race and the confusion in the event, which puts us in the same position as the Rooney character, standing behind the high viewers and looking forward to someone provide accurate update. It doesn't matter that we know that this is a trick that performs most of the challenging ride - in several scenes we can clearly see a creepy-looking man in a wig - but the positive message remains the same. I bet that National Velvet has raised the imagination of millions of young girls over the past sixty years, and its ability to inspire has diminished over time.
