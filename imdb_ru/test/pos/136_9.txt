I did not expect much because of the sharp reviews, and as a result I enjoyed the film very much. Softer colors and less amazing composition of frames than some of his previous films, in my opinion, made it possible to focus on the story. Although religious conflict in a vampire film was common, I felt that many other things were not. For example: <br /> <br /> how his powers are often revealed when dealing with her. <br /> <br /> very strong and well-functioning love scenes. <br /> <br /> The symbolism of the person they killed to get closer to each other actually separates them even more. <br /> <br /> Their strong differences in what it means to be a “vampire” are created by their past life experiences. <br /> <br /> The absence of many other vampires appearing or being created in the film. <br /> <br /> I heard and read a few things about "tricks used in other films." Of course. However, I feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is happening on the stage, and I feel that he does it well. I don't need a director to use new tricks. I prefer to use the tricks used in a good and proper way, which I think is the case in this film. <br /> <br /> I recommend this.
