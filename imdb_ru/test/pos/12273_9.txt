Zen and the Art of Landscape, written and directed by David Kartch, is a short film about a young man named David (his friends call him Zen) and what happens on one strange day of his life. Zen works as a family for a middle-class family. The mistress of the house is trying to force Zen to help her deceive her husband. Unfortunately, her son enters them instead of her husband. From this point on, the film begins to go through many revelations between the characters, as well as the possible participation of a person from home. “Zen and the art of gardening” is witty, intelligent, and generally very well written. The actors comedy time is also very strong. This is a fun, easy movie that I highly recommend.
