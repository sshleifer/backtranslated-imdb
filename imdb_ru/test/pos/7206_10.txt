This is definitely a movie to watch. The magnificent director Alain Shabbat (also acting as Caesar) managed to capture the very essence of “The Adventures of Asterix” (French comics on which it is based) and create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy that is also a tribute to the world of animated films. This film is so funny, so full of jokes (visual and oral) that you may need two or three views before you notice them all, between your laughter. The only drawback is that not a French audience (or, at least, not a French speaking audience) may not get all the “private jokes”. There are so many dialogs that are impossible to translate, so many situations directly related to the comics or the French way of life that the fun can be reduced. Nevertheless, it is still worth seeing a beautiful picture, amazing tricks, music, a completely insane atmosphere and a great game. All the actors are great, but the film wouldn't be the same without Jamel Debuse, Gerard Darmon and Edward Baer. And please, NEVER compare this magnificent film with the terrible previous one, based on the same comics: “Astérix et Obélix Contre César” and director Claude Zidi.
