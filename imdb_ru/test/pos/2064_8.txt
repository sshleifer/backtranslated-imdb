A school teacher in a small town (Gina Davis) slowly begins to realize that she suffered from amnesia and was indeed a secret government killer! Soon, it is followed by men and a small private detective (Samuel L. Jackson). <br /> <br /> This was full of action, with some great special effects and really funny storylines (especially from Jackson). ). Although the action can sometimes get a little silly, who cares? In the end, aren't the films meant for a good time? <br /> <br /> Craig Bierko is a funny villain. The film itself was a great time. Just do not expect that you have to think too much about it, because then if you take it too seriously, then the film will not really be fun, but stupid. <br /> <br /> This film does not deserve to be called a stupid or any other bad name.
