This is a film that really makes you think about your life, our culture, family structures and situational actions. I will not give the story in this post, I think others have already preceded me. I hope that, despite reading the opinions on this site, you risk and watch this film for yourself. I went to see this film with my husband and friend, and, I must say, after the film ended, there was complete silence in the theater. A few minutes later I looked around, and everyone in the theater was staring at the screen, thinking. It will make you delve into your psychological abyss, to think about a few things: <br /> <br /> How much does society influence my life and the life of my generation? <br /> <br /> How long does anyone have to pay for the mistakes they made? <br /> <br /> If there is a second chance, is it ever realized? <br /> <br /> Is it better to live in a box or not to live? at all? <br /> <br /> My questions are not intended to show my approval or disapproval of Lelandâ€™s actions. I do not want my opinion of them in any way dictated what you remove from this film, so I do not give it. See for yourself. I'm still deep in my thoughts, trying to answer my many questions from the film. I really liked it and hope you do too. This film does not attempt to answer questions, justify any actions, or advocate any punishment. This film is trying to make us all appreciate our lives and take off the pink glasses through which most of us look at the world. <br /> <br /> Great movie. 9 out of 10 stars
