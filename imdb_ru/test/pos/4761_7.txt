**** SPOILERS **** Buried under a mountain of medical bills and his funeral business is not able to dig it out from under the undertaker Vito Lucia, Tony Lo Bianco, came up with a plan to make lots of money with the help of his two crooked friends of the Moon and Bo, Richard Lynch and Bill Hickman. <br /> <br /> Vito gets close to his childhood friend Buddy Manucci, Roy Shader, as an informant for the crowd to gain Buddy’s trust and ask him to tell Vito what is happening on the streets of New York regarding the mafia’s activities. Buddy is a policeman working in the Sub-Rosa division of the New York Police, Seven Ups, who does everything in his own way to clear the streets of New York from criminals. <br /> <br /> Vito receives information from Buddy and makes Buddy understand that he really gives him advice about the crowd and what is happening to her, and uses this information to warn his bullies, the Moon and Bo, to undermine them. gangsters from their weekly take as well as kidnap the most popular mafia sharks and keep them for ransom. <br /> <br /> Everything is going well for Vito & Co., until the mob decides to take revenge and mistakenly captures the blows and abductions of a member of the Seven Ansel, Ken Kercheval, who worked under cover, thinking that he was one of those who abducted and robbed them. Later, Ansel was accidentally killed by Luna when he blew up the trunk of the car in which Ansel was locked, thinking that he had a full suitcase or money, a ransom. <br /> <br /> A fast paced and breathtaking film with that sandy and dirty picture of New York that was so effective in the film French Connection, which also starred Roy Shader and Tony Lo Bianco, who also shot the movie. Incredible car chase, which began in the center of Brooklyn and ended in the wilds of New Jersey at a distance of 15-20 miles, and Buddy was almost beheaded for his heroic efforts. <br /> <br /> Roy Shader, who is not a big man, is as tough and effective as any major action movie I can come up with, like Clint Eastwood in the same movie. Scheider reminds me a lot, he even looks a bit like him, former welterweight and middleweight champion Gene Fullmer, who defeated the great Sugar Ray Robinson in the middleweight championship in 1957 and behaves the same way as he does in the movie: tough, durable and destructive. <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco is very good, like Vito, the undertaker, a low-heeled shoe that plays with Buddy and the crowd to such an extent that it leads to the death of Buddy's partner, Ansel. Despite the fact that he is rubbish, you can't help but feel sorry for Vito, because he only needs the money that he receives from the torn gangsters in order to pay Rose’s sick wife’s hospital bills and medical bills. Even the fact that Ansel was killed because of his actions, Vito never wanted anyone to get hurt, but as they say, when you play with fire, you will eventually burn yourself. In the end, Vito has a lot of explanations about not very responsive and caring gangsters. <br /> <br /> In the film “Seven Ups”, the late Bill Hickman performs dangerous stunts with car chases and also appears in the film. Hickman was also a stuntman in both great films in which he drove a car along the streets and highways of New York and San Francisco "French Connection" and "Bullitt".
