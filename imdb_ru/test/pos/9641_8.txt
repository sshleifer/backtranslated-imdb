Robert Montgomery and Robert Young are issued as a duet of young submarine officers stationed in Italy during the First World War. The dialogue is very fascinating, and Jimmy Durante is cheerful, like the cook of the Ptomain ship. The character of Walter Houston inspires as the captain of a submarine, a star example of an officer and a gentleman. One of the most interesting aspects of this film was the level of technology displayed on the battle scenes. I was surprised at how similar World War I technology is to technology demonstrated 25 years later in World War II. The basic human nature was depicted as very similar to the modern era, and far from conservatism, as I thought, existed in the so-called "innocent" past. Overall, I felt that the actors, characters, battle scenes, and the story view depicted in this film were first class.
