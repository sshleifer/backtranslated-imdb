As John Grierson noted: “The documentary genre can be defined as follows: a creative interpretation of reality.” <br /> <br /> This incredible 180-minute documentary is the first time a dinosaur computer project respects the viewer's intelligence. <br /> <br /> When I saw the Jurassic Park, which I expected with great excitement, I was extremely disappointed. Of course, dinosaurs were great, but there was no need to tell stories. I thought, "What if they make a documentary about dinosaurs, without crying children or bad puns, just dinosaurs made as realistic as possible so we can be surprised that it was once a reality." <br /> <br /> My dream came true. The BBC released an exciting documentary that explores various dinosaur eras. <br /> <br /> This part is for all people who seem to disagree with the fact that they had to guess in many aspects of behavior, skin patterns, etc .: Of course they should. No one was there. I think it’s fantastic that they can imagine something as realistic as this. All assumptions are based on the knowledge of many paleontologists, and this allows the viewer to have a fairly good idea of ​​what it was like. If you want to stick to what we know for sure, then just visit the dinosaur bones museum. That's why I included a Grierson quote at the beginning of this comment. <br /> <br /> In any case, I take off my hat to the creators.
