I have seen more than 2,000 Studio-Era sound films, including many films about Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Shirley Jones and Dean Durbin, as well as a decent amount of live and recorded musical comedies and operas in the studio. And I assure you, no one is tasked with singing in front of the camera and microphone, or maybe somewhere else, NEVER touched Durbin's solo here ... the monophonic soundtrack and crap microphones of the 1930s and all that. The Canadian guy sings this bit from Il Bacio as if she lived and wrote it herself, and then accidentally appeared at a retrospective in Italy at the end of her career, and not as a child who learned about it from her music teacher. <Br /> <br /> If you skip this “Extra” on a DVD - or go to the solo “Garland” - you just lose yourself because this cheap teaser for MGM just captured one of the greatest performances of 20c.
