IN LINE OF FIRE, in my opinion, is an excellent, intense and action-packed action / drama / thriller! I thought Agent Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and Agent Raines (Rene Russo) looked good in the clothes they wore at the presidential dinner. As for Leary (John Malkovich), he was a sick man who loved to play with Frank on the phone. However, he looked good in a tuxedo that he wore at the end of the film. One thing that surprised me was the growing attraction between Agent Horrigan and Agent Raines. Before concluding, I would like to say that the entire cast and the crew did an outstanding job, I liked the decor, and I couldn't get enough of it. Now, in conclusion, to all of you, Clint Eastwood fans, who have not seen this great, intense and witty action / drama / thriller, I highly recommend it.
