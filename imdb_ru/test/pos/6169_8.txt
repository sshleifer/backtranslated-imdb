Being advertised as the most expensive film ever made in the Czech Republic, it automatically makes you think that it will be too famous and cliche (because of the fear of the budget). However, with a budget of 8 million and a half of the film in English, it was not a very big budget, a high-risk film. <br /> <br /> That we have a grand epic story based on the friendship of two people, the younger Karel and the elder Frantisek. As pilots of the Czech Air Force, when the Germans invade before the start of World War II, they flee the country to England to join the Air Force. <br /> <br /> Their friendship becomes tense because of the love of the same woman. However, there are friendships that go beyond simple friendship. Their friendship is an elegant metaphor for the relationship of the Czech people and their country. Remember that they were not winners, the defeated Germans only invaded the Russians. <br /> <br /> Funny, exciting, intriguing, beautiful, sad and illuminating this film is one of my favorite war movies. Most of all I like the way they mock the British surprisingly affectionately and give an amazing insight into how the British military fought in World War II. <br /> <br /> Forget about recent American efforts (Peel Harbor Salvation Private Ryan), this is the best film of World War II in a long time.
