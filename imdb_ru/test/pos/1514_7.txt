“The Cat in the Brain” by Lucio Fulci is an inventive and somewhat selfish story about a director who is decent in insanity. This is about Fulci himself, who is in the film. Fulci became known to horror fans everywhere as the “godfather of blood”, and for good reason, as he provided us with some of the most disgusting and most horrible films that ever decorated a silver screen; from violence over the eyeball in films such as Zombie 2, to the man who was hacked to death with chains in Beyond the Boundary, up to a full-scale blood festival known as The Ripper of New York; if you want blood (and let's face it who doesn't want it), Fulci is your man. However, all this treat of such hounds, like you and me, affected the mental state of Fulci, and he quickly plunged into insanity caused by what he was shooting. Fulci's problems do not end in his mental state either, since his psychiatrist, whom he examined for his problem, claimed responsibility for the murder as a hobby, using the Fulci films as drafts for the murders! <br /> <br /> I have to say that the acting in this film is absolutely terrible. In particular, there is one scene in which a prostitute is involved, and you can only laugh at her because she is acting and stupid. Fulci plays a major role in the film (obviously). He is not an actor, and it shows, but his performance is actually the best in the film. You can even say with certainty that in general, acting is bad for an Italian horror film. Of course, no one falls into Italian horror, expecting good acting skills, so this is somewhat forgivable, but I think that Fulci could hire the best. Bad dubbing doesn't help either. However, something that really helps is the fact that a terrible game is balanced by a lot of blood, and this is extremely at least! People are cut off the head, a woman is killed in the shower (and unlike Psycho, here we REALLY see it), people are chopped, fed with pigs, and there are many, many better cinematic weapons of the cinema - a chainsaw that pleased me without end. Most of the time, the amount of blood is huge, which gives the film a “fake” feeling, but “The Cat in the Brain” obviously is in any case a tongue in the buccal film. <br /> <br /> It would have been difficult to make a film about myself, and it would not have seemed like a big head, and Fulci really seemed like a big head to me in this film. His name is often mentioned, and he is on the screen almost all the time; it doesn’t look like “New Nightmare” in the ego bets, but it’s obvious that he had a good time doing it, and I, for example, had fun watching him, so that we can forgive him a little selfishness. The end of the film brings him - I saw him go a mile away, but then I didn’t seriously think that the film would go that way, but I was wrong; Unfortunately. The ending left me alone, and the film is better to watch if you turn it off shortly before the last two minutes. Nevertheless, despite the fact that it ends and plays terribly, Cat in the Brain is a lot of fun and will delight Fulci enthusiasts endlessly and is therefore recommended.
