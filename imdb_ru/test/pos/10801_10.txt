Cinema at its best is entertainment. If you need to question every aspect with which you can find a place for disagreement, and most of the recorded history is based on modern opinions - often biased - then you should leave the cinema because their prejudices will always spoil their pleasure. When I saw a plane flying overhead in a film dated 33 BC, I was surprised. Background decorations in "Casablanca" are absurdly false. So, I will moan and say that the film is not convinced? Fiona, relax and enjoy the great game. Weida's decision to quit the main characters as French and Polish was inspired. one immediately realized which side represented each of the main characters. No need to dwell on the authenticity of wigs. This is a powerful cinema. If there is a political message that is still relevant today - have a dinner party - Château d'Yquem with foie gras; Pouligny Montrachet with a dish; some Polish vodka sorbets and perhaps Chateau Lafite-Rothschild of 1961 with beef — and discuss the political aspects of Danton until you fall out of fatigue. Would Danton probably agree?
