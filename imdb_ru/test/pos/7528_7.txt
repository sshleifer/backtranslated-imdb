Once a red cat lane is fed up with people kicking him and attacking dogs and muses, that life would be better if he were a skunk. Then he paints himself black with a white stripe on his back and adds some Limburg cheese to make him stink. At first, life could not be better for him, the dog runs away, and the butcher leaves his shop, allowing the cat to leave with a pile of meat. Just as he thinks that everything is perfect, a real skunk notices him, not just a skunk, but Pep√© Le Pew, who is too much in love. Pepe takes the poor cat for a female skunk and pursues it, thinking that his protests are just shyness. Our poor cat thinks he escaped when he throws the skunk skin out of a tall building, so Pepe thinks he is dead, at first it seems that it works, but when he slips away, Pepe sees him and instantly forgets the dead skunk. In the end, the cat understands that it is better to kick and attack him than to lust for an abnormal skunk ... there is also a good ending for a skunk when his wife finds out what he has in mind. <br /> <br /> It was a rather funny introduction to Pepe Le Pugh, who at that time was simply overly in love, but now looked like a perverted sex pursuer, although in the end he was punished for his behavior.
