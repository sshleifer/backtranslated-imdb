Honestly, I went to watch this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. People may disagree, but he plays equally well in bad and good films. I have not seen a single film with Penelope Cruz, so I wanted to know if she was a good actress. So, this is what I think: <br /> <br /> The film is good (however, I did not read the novel). Some moments were really exciting and ... unexpected. In general, you will find the plot quite simple. Thus, the only thing that could save the film, which (an experienced viewer will know about it from the very beginning) ends tragically or happily, is the performance of both Cage and Cruz. And it was great, great, great !!! In the last part of the film I even liked the rather wide accent of the actress (Spanish, but for those who do not speak Greek, this is normal, and she even looks like a Greek woman). In general, the film is very pleasant and has a lot of irony (classical music fans will surely have fun at some moments :) <br /> <br /> I give it 9/10. You should see this!
