Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is a teacher who is going to get married. Then one of his former students receives an Oscar for the film in which he plays a gay soldier, and thanks Howard for his welcome speech, in which he portrays himself as gay! This film follows after reporters descend to Howard village, and he tries to convince everyone that he is straight. <br /> <br /> I like this movie! Kevin Kline is wonderful, he has some really funny moments, and it always leaves me beautiful with a huge smile on my face. Therefore, this is one movie that I like to watch as often as possible. If you have not seen this, you miss!
