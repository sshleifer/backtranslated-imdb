This is a remake of the 80's anime classics, and this one is even better. Celia, Nene, Lynn and Priss returned as Knights of the Sabers in their hard suits fighting with robotic boomers. The animation is clear, the characters are well developed, and the action is swinging. Priss is a singer in her usual job, so there are also some great songs on the show. There is quite a lot of violence, but most of them are against robots, and there are fan services, but nothing special. There are also many add-ons on the DVD, including comments that really improve your understanding and enjoyment of the show. A must for any anime fan. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: Burst Angel, Armitage III
