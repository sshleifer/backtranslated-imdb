The film was surprisingly remarkable, especially considering the last sequel. The third was dark and semi-interesting, but not as fun or pleasant as this one. It is filled with comedic lines about Martha Stewart, the anatomy of a doll, masturbation, and it was actually effectively done during horrible and disturbing images. The film was not scary or tense, and I am sure that this was not the intention of the director. It was fun because of the stupidity of Jennifer Tilly and her sexual performance. Puppet dolls were so well treated, the movement of the mouth, lips, tears in the eyes, a knife in the chest and costumes. The dolls were simply amazing, and this made terrible deaths more attractive, considering that they were made by wonderful dolls. New Chucky looked great, and Tiffany was very sweet. A few scenes from Chucky, hugging Tiffany's man, even made my father smile. Jesse and Jade were surprisingly very attractive, and the special effects were great. The ending was so unexpected, and the fact that they could have made another good one is very unlikely. It may not be as disturbing as movies like Halloween H2O or Urban Legend, but it is definitely more fun !!!!
