Over the past few months, I have seen a lot of feedback on “Italian work”, many of which were negative. The essence of almost all of these pessimistic criticisms is that, despite all its modern bravado and high-budget technologies, the film does not make much sense where it matters. Listen, people, this is just a funny movie. This is the type of image where you have to sit back, relax and just enjoy the steady movement of the film. As in Ocean's Eleven (2001), you can focus on the characters and the plot at the same time without thinking (lucky for some of us). Of course, “Ocean” is the best movie, but who cares? There may be some holes in the plot (there are huge approximately 3/4 of the way), the action may not be as supportive as trailers did, and some dialogues may seem meaningless and stupid, but again, who cares? Cool characters, Mini Coopers, big explosions, Charlize Theron. What else do you want? I think it's time to give up the fake Roger Ebert meets the act of Gina Shalit and enjoy this time! Oh, and one more thing, no matter what you do, do not compare it with the original, because, repeating what F. Gray said a million times to the press, THIS WILL NOT REMOVE !! My advice is if you are interested in making your way through a good-natured, funny film, do not even think about Italian Work. But if you do not have a serious inferiority complex and / or you want Ed Norton to be exhausted by a handful of Ukrainians, continue. The bottom line is that my cinema colleagues say: "Light up and enjoy, damn it."
