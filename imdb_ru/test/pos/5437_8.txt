Actually, I admit that I’m a political addict, so it resonated with me, but Ms. Green’s unstable nature (yes, I know what they did to her), but the ending was such an excuse and didn’t fit the film by oneself. <br /> <br /> Why can't Barry L and his team make us think about what he's going to do? Let's discuss this. <br /> <br /> Instead, they end up with the nonsense "oh, I'm not worthy", and this simply shows that when the chips do not work, it is better to leave the table and not double. Stop the end of Disney and put a bow on him. Life is not easy, they needed courage to give the protagonist some kind of backbone. <br /> <br /> We had to listen to the rhetoric of the entire film ... and then it became whimpering and stupid, Miss Green’s reckless behavior (when the shit came out of her system) simply created the ridiculous end of the film that was icing on the cake.
