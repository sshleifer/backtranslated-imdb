I always liked this film, and I'm glad that it finally appeared on DVD, so that more viewers could see what I told them all these years. A story about a high school girl named Gary (Lawrence Monozon) who works at a pizzeria as a courier and hangs out with her friends David (Joe Rubbo) and Rick (Steve Entin). Gary notices Karen (Diane Franklin), who is a new girl at school, and one morning he is driving her, and by this time he is completely in love. That night at a party, he sees Rick and Karen, and now he is jealous of his best friend, but does not tell anyone about his real feelings. <br /> <br /> ***** WARNING ABOUT SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Rick asks Gary if he can borrow an empty house from his grandmother, but Gary makes up an excuse for Rick not to could take Karen alone. But one night, Rick boasts to Gary that he nailed her on the football field, and Gary is furious. A few days later in the school library, Gary sees Rick and Karen arguing, and he asks Karen what is wrong. She tells him that she is pregnant and that Rick left her. Gary helps her by taking her to her grandmother's home and paying for her abortion. Finally, Gary tells Karen how he treats her, and she seems to be sensitive to his feelings, but later on her birthday he again meets Karen and Rick together. Gary leaves without a girl! This film ends with a much more realistic version of life. No matter how good you are, you don't necessarily get a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> This film was shot by Boaz Davidson, who will become a fairly competent action movie director, and he did two things right with this movie. First, he made sure that there was a lot of nude nudity, so that it was sold to young men who usually go to these films. Secondly, he finished the film with a young Gary without Karen, and I think that men in the audience might feel that they are being deceived, no matter how hard you try to win the heart of a girl. Yes, this film is stupid and exploitative, but funny and sexy. Actress Louise Moritz almost steals the film in the role of sexual Carmela. Moritz has always been a popular "B" actress, and you may remember her in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". Like Fast Times at Ridgemont High, this is a very good soundtrack, and the songs being played reflect what's going on in the story. But at the heart of this film are two very good performances of Monozone and Franklin. Franklin demands nudity, but she still expresses grief to a young girl who is thrown at a crucial moment. She was always a good actress, and her natural charm is very noticeable in this film. But this is still the story of Monozone, and you can't help but feel this guy. When the film ends, its performance remains with you. This is a good acting job that does not just make sex comedy for teenagers. Even with stupid scenarios when teenagers try to have sex, this film still manages to achieve what they want. An underestimated comedy hits the apple.
