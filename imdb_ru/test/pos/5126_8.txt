In the "Hooter" a new baby arrives in Florida from Montana. At first, he faces the usual problems of merging and dealing with a local bully. Soon, however, he realizes a more serious problem: the chain of restaurants of the franchise is trying to build a site in a city where many burrowing owls live. This film looks like a family film, but it is much more radical than it seems, since it sympathetically shows how Roy and a couple of friends do not shy away from breaking the law (including vandalism of private property and short-term abduction of the restaurant chain manager) in the name of environmental save owls no less). Now you can agree or not with these actions, but at least the film has the courage not to shy away from their beliefs. A good, solid film, in general.
