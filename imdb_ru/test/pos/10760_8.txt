From the first scenes of FIRM'S PEOPLE (a game of tribal customs, photographed by the anthropologist father of the young narrator Finn Earl, showing why this South American Ishkanani tribe is so cruel), the direction of the film is vague: we are watching a grim comedy about comparing life on the streets of New York with uncivilized peoples, or is it a film with more serious intentions? But as history progresses, the fine line between entertainment and philosophical influence becomes more and more obvious. Griffin Dunn’s referral to the adaptation of his novel by Dirk Wittenborn can sometimes be a little careless, since it deviates from the rational development of the plot, but ultimately it turns out to be a sufficiently strong final impact to fix the holes he created. <br /> <br /> Our narrator Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) lives with his coke-dependent masseuse / sexually obsessed mother Liz (Diane Lane) in New York, waiting for the summer when he joins his anthropologist father on a trip to South America (father, whom he knows only through letters and videos) when a drug crisis drastically changes their lives: one of the rich clients Liz Ogden Osborne (Donald Sutherland) saves a poor family and moves them to his 10-acre estate, wealth and power. In exchange for the fact that she is a private masseuse, Osborne, Liz and Finn can live in a mansion with “dirty rich” Osborns - the daughter of Mrs. Langley (Elizabeth Perkins) and grandchildren Bryce (Chris Evans) and Maya (Kristen Stewart). Osborne and his doctor lead Liz on a drying path, and Finn communicates with Osborne and his grandchildren, and, despite the difference between the poor and the rich, the life situation works — for a while. Incidents happen to change feelings, and Finn is attacked and raped by an assailant in a mask, which is a turning point for the film and Finn's look at the Osborns family. Osborne talks about his past to Finn, and together they manage to learn the truth about the disturbing incident with Finn, as well as about the brutal disease of the rich class. <br /> <br /> Many clips of tribal activities are used in the film, to draw some disturbing parallels for some of the more complex scenes. It works well for this viewer, but when the director decides to place the tribal people in full regalia in the context of the Osborns manor, the concept seems far-fetched, as if the audience should be forced to “get it”. The various plots between Paz de la Huerta’s maidservant and Finn and artist Mitney’s retarded obesity Whitney’s (Branden Williams) put forward a certainty of authenticity, emphasizing the line between the rich and the “lower class”, but the performances of Sutherland, Lane and Yelchin are strong enough to make us forgive film misses. Not a very good film, but with a lot of worthy ideas splashing on the screen of a project that often feels lost in the fight for direction. Grady harp
