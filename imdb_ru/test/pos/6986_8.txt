It opens with your cliché by an overly long ship flying through space. All that I could think at this stage is “Space Balls” and hope that there will be a sticker on the back with the words “We will not break anyone” Then the film shows cryogenic freezers with a Vin Diesel narration. I always thought that his voice sounds cool since I saw Fast and Furious. Since I learned that he is a criminal, I thought that the film would become a cliche. It was. It was very cliche, and fate seemed to be against them at every turn. Turn off every 22 years. Luckily for them, they land that day. Aliens can only be in darkness, hey, this is a solar eclipse. No matter how much I thought it was too simple and just a cliche, the film pulled and struck Major @ss. I even went out and bought a copy of Pitch Black after seeing it. I really can't wait for the Chronicles of Riddick.
