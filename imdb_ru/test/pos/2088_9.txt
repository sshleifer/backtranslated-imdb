I watched “9 Souls” at the 12th Athens International Film Festival (September 2006), which was also attended by the film director Toshiaki Toyoda and answered many questions from the audience. This road film tells about 9 fugitives, they are all very different characters. They decided to stay together, traveling with their red van around Japan. Every time the van stops, we see how the 9 fugitives are trying to escape from their past in order to build a new life or fulfill a dream. However, no matter how hard they try, it seems impossible, and their cruel past haunts them and leads to their final destruction. <br /> <br /> Although it is a very pessimistic film, it is not a dark film. On the contrary, it is full of beautiful pictures, surreal elements and elegant humor. Heroes of Toyoda cannot escape his "prison", and they are threatened with a divine (?) Punishment for their "crimes." These are small pieces of a beautiful picture, dominated by the Tokyo Tower, depicted as a huge inverted knife!
