Watching this fun retro but very interesting story about a girl’s career, I was amazed at the first appearance of Joan Crawford. At first I could only think: “My God, this is the same person as Michael Jackson on his notorious booking photo!” <br /> <br /> After about 34 minutes of the movie, Dianne Baker and Hope Lange leave the taxi in Greenwich -Village. As they walk down the street, you can see part of the sign behind them for the Stonewall bar - scenes of epochal “riots” that are considered to be the trigger for the modern gay rights movement. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Baker and a taxi, I had to laugh when she got into them and said to the taxi driver: "56th and Sutton Place, please - and be careful with the bumps." Can you imagine the driver's reaction on today's Manhattan ?! She says this, of course, because she is pregnant and does not want to harm the fetus. But this does not prevent her from jumping from a moving car when she finds out that Bob Evans wants her to have an abortion! Well, she had to find a way to lose a child (1959 and everything else). <br /> <br /> Sue Carson is as lovely as Mary Agnes. Why was this her only film? IMDb does not have biographical information about it.
