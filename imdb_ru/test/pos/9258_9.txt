The film was excellent, except for some scenes from Esposito. I liked how he put together every detective in the series and wrapped up some storylines that were never resolved during the series (thanks to NBC ...) It was great to see Pembleton and Bayliss together in their most human and very simple people. Brauger and Secor did an excellent job, but, as usual, they would be missed. It was painful to see that it was the end of the murder. Memories, recordings and replays on CourtTV are not the same as watching every Friday. But the film coped with its task and did it very well, presenting an excellent depiction of life after Al retired, and the family relationships that existed between the unit. I really liked it.
