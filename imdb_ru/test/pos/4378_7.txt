I can’t say that I liked it so much, like Big Lebowski or Arizona Sunrise, and I felt a little disdainful, but Oh Brother, this is a nice movie worthy of good laughter and taste of Coens’s fighters Perverted sense of creativity. The DVD edition contains a function, and I was interested to know that the Coens are quite simple in their directorial technique. This surprised me! Of course, this film is not the best example (and I only say this in comparison), and it was not worthy of any Oscars (many believe that it was robbed), but perhaps it depends on the appeal. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I liked the previous work of the Coens, I was never a fan of old westerns, the “Dukes of Hazzard” or what they show on TNN every day. Perhaps that is why I did not feel so enthusiastic about watching this film, because it revolves around the southern people. For all those from the south who read this, I don’t want to offend ANY of your people! I'm sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about cities, for example, The Tale of the Bronx. When you live in a city all your life, it’s hard to get used to movies of this kind. But apart from all regrets, I found the characters funny and bizarre. I think that John Turturro perfectly nailed the accent, and seeing how he talks in real life, I find it amazing. Tim Blake Nelson was good too. Of course, George Clooney, who, I believe, is not the best in the simulation of accents, judging by his decision to quit the idea of ​​working with the dialogue coach and working out the emphasis in New England for the Perfect Storm, naturally it seems a bit wrong and constantly struggles with an accent. His performance was good though. You may also see Coen’s regular clients, such as Holly Hunter (in a short but pleasant role) and John Goodman (also on the screen for a short time, but stealing every minute). <br /> <br /> Although I don’t do it normally while digging country music, I liked the title song "Man of Constant Sorrow." The DVD also contains a music video for this song. <br /> <br /> In general, the film seemed fascinating and original, but it lacks the quality that the Coens showed us in the past. This is a small effort, but a good one. I still suggest you check it out. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 (out of 10)
