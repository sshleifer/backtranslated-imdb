This is absolutely the best movie I've ever watched. When I was 12, I was late and came across a movie. It was on the US channel, Gilbert Godfrey "All Night Away." I will never forget. At that time, my friends and I were really struggling with various problems, including sexual ones. You know, 12 years is very rude and strange. It seems you are stuck between a little girl and a young lady. This film really helped me answer a lot of questions. Now I have a daughter, who is 12 years old. I have been looking for this film for a couple of years If it ever comes out on DVD, I will be the first to buy. I recommend any parent to watch this with your child when he reaches this very difficult and difficult age.
