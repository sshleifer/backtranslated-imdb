I just had to add my comment to raise the average for this. Paul Giamatti lets it all hang out and it's a scream. He probably would have said it was easy, but he did a great job and had to win something. We had a DVD for several years, and my children (the boy is now 4 1/2 and girl 9) will watch it again and again, and the humor is old enough, so I don't mind hearing it in the background (and I run to the TV for really funny roles). A simple moral message, a lot of decent actions and farce, “bad” adults who behave foolishly to distance themselves, minimal bad language and minimal minor jokes make it difficult for a family standard.
