Time does unusual things. This is the final judge. Time has given Married To The Mob an extra dose of freshness. There are no dead moments or cheap shots. Now it is more joy than ever. Michelle Pfeiffer creates a mafia widow who is just as far from the caricature as everything she ever did. This original creation, concerning the stereotype or hinting at it only to lead us, but her Angela is completely unique. Legendary Dean Stockwell presents us with a mafia boss who is as ominously real as he is cheerful. And Matthew Modin? Why did I then think that he had no chemistry with Pfeiffer? I was wrong. They are beautiful together. This time they reminded me of Barbara Stenvik, Fred McMurray "Remember the Night". I am writing this comment now to encourage you to visit or visit this gem of Jonathan Demme.
