Shame on you if you give this movie a low rating. How can you not like the movie with Doug McClure, Peter Cushing, stupid rubber monsters, fights (and for guys, the woman who was the villain’s minion in Spy Who Loved Me, and in one of the seventies Sinbad films, not wearing much many of which my mom said “They weren’t chosen by the color of their eyes”), lava, silly wigs, and a frantic Victorian drill press, very similar to the one used in the old Thunderbirds series? Whoever watched this movie and spanked it watched it for the wrong reasons. This may be shit, but it is definitely good rubbish. They make them not like before, sigh ......
