This is a really fun movie that I have seen many times. Drew Barrymore is great as Josie Geller, as is David Arquette as her brother. You are embarrassed at the thought that she will return to high school, because the film is a reminder of what this high school was like! Her outfits are strange and strange, and this brings back memories of those who dressed a little differently! Gorgeous Michael Vartan was amazing as a teacher (sorry when I was in high school! This is a movie you can watch again and again, with a fabulous sound track! One for everyone who was in school in the 90s to watch!
