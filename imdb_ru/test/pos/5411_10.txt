Imaginary characters are by far the best film of the year. It was a complete and total joy to watch. I was chained. A whole audience at Sunset Five was chained when the film ended, no one moved, was silent, nothing. I think this film is a great example of the power that drama has. Especially in that it shows an example of the quality of the drama / work of this young generation. <br /> <br /> There were moments in your movie, many at least seven, when I was amazed at such a tremendous beauty, emotional beauty that I could not even breathe for a while. And for a catharsis lover like me, this is the best censorship experience I could ask for. This is the result of powerful, masterful story-telling and directing. As heavy things as Burtolucci and these guys. <br /> <br /> Each element of the film is tight to each other. There were no errors at all. The cast was awesome. I was a big fan of Emil and Ryan for a long time, and I thought they were never better. I was / I / will be constantly overwhelmed by this film. And I promise that I will bring every person I know to see it. This should be seen. It is worth winning awards.
