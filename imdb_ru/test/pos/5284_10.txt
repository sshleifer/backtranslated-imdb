Ponyo, written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, is a small fairy tale that speaks of respect for the ocean, respect for people, young and old, and respect for cultural differences. This is a new story about a small golden fish that wants to be a girl, not a retelling of Disney's The Little Mermaid. Miyazaki made an animated film, a bizarre, magical film for the young and soulful. The film begins with a slow wavy blue-green palette of sea anemones, jellyfish, and many small fancy goldfish with childish faces. There is no need for narration, the movement of the creatures and the music of Joe Hisaichi speak of a beginning. Released last summer in Japan, Ponyo received an award from the Japanese Academy for best animated film and best result (Jezebel.com). A bizarre little goldfish, Brunhild, leaves his ocean at home on a jellyfish. Reaching the surface, it falls into a fishing net full of other fish, debris and sludge. She is thrown into a jar that rolls to the shore, where the five-year-old Sosuke finds her (the voice of Frankie Jonas). He cut his hand, opening the jar to release a small goldfish. Brunhild tries his blood, which heals Sosuke's cuts and sets in motion its transformation into a human, at the same time discomposing nature. Sosuke puts a small goldfish in a green bucket and calls it Pono (Noah Cyrus), which means soft and gelatinous. Sosuke's mother, Lisa (Tina Fey), allows him to take Ponyo to the school, which is next door to the nursing home where she works. Lisa’s crazy ride on a scenic winding road, past a dry dock, through a bustling fishing town and along a tree-lined road to a nursing home is representative of Miyazaki’s remarkable sequence of actions and perfectly illustrates the restless morning of her parents. Miyazaki created another strong, independent, female character in Lisa. Making her a loving, intelligent, modern mother for both Sosuke and Pono. Lisa's telephone conversation with her husband, who is not returning home, Kiochi (Matt Damon), because the captain, on whom he must make the next flight, is a typical reaction of his wife. Later that evening, Sosuke intercepts, using a warning light to talk to his father when the ship passes by the cliff on which their house stands. Lisa refuses to acknowledge Kiochi's apology, jumps up and signals: “Hang up, hang up, hang up”, this is a funny scene. But when Sosuke takes a warning light and says to his father: “Good luck, I love you,” Lisa embraces him and says that he has a good heart, this is a very sharp scene. <br /> <br /> My favorite older women are Miyazaki, a grandmother type, in wheelchairs in a nursing home, Yochi (Betty White), Noriko (Cloris Lichman) and Toki (Lili Tomlin). Their exchange over the small golden fish Sosuke is beautiful and reminds of the quarrel between the Witch of the Wastes (Lauren Bacall) and Sophie (Gene Simmons) when they climb the long flight of stairs in the Mobile Castle of Howl. The sea god Ponio's magical father, Fujimoto (Liam Neeson), who looks like a magic Hole, arrives to take Pono to her ocean home. Fujimoto uses one of its elixirs to try to bring nature back into balance, but the little magic pony escapes again, disrupting more of the elixir in the process and causing a tsunami. Running on the backs of giant dolphins to get to Sosuke, this red-haired little girl reminds viewers of the stubborn, adventurous Mei in My Neighbor Totoro. Ponyo is as adventurous and curious as May. When Fujimoto realizes what Ponyo did, he calls on Grand Mamare (Cate Blanchett), the goddess of the ocean, to help with the situation. This wise, soothing Goddess arrives in blue flowing clothing that never ends. She has a personal conversation with Lisa, which discusses the future of young children, which helps viewers to understand that Sosuke and Ponyo are connected not with lovers, but with her brother and sister. The quiet, simple end of life is typical of Miyazaki films, leaving viewers full of hope.
