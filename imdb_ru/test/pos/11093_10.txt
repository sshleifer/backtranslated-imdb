Falcon and Snowman offers some of the best characters from their two leads. Hatton in a brilliantly understated role calmly portrays the confusion and anxiety of a man who, apparently, turns a traitor for no other reason than to rebel against his father. Penn, being one of the conspirators, mostly just for a trip and money for drugs, explosively turns into one of the most powerful speeches in his multi-talented career.
