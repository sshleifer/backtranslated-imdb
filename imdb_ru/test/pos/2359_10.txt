It looks like b class, and you will probably think that there is no reason to make this film! But do it! I did not expect anything from this movie, just something to pass the time, but I hooked from the very beginning! Two interesting facts - the bank robbery went wrong, a million dollars disappeared, and two girls on their way to start a new life - How will these two stories collide? Just when you think you know which direction the film is heading, it turns 180, and you are struck by the great plot twist! He has a great, but unexpected finale, and you have to wish for more - always a good sign - rent it or even buy it, you will not be disappointed!
