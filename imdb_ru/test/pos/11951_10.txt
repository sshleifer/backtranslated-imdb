It seems I notice that many people have never seen this film, and those who usually reject it as rubbish ... in fact, this is very bad. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this film, I was admittedly almost one of those people ... thank God, I am patient, otherwise I would never have found such a classic. <br /> <br /> No matter how stupid this film is, it should also be for everyone who is either a fan of 80s films, or simply with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I know that many people will tell you that this film is derived from Better Off. Dead ... so what if this is so? Both were great movies! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that Savage Steve Holland is a genius! 10/10
