The film is happy to look not only for the exciting plot, but also for the magnificent performances of the actors Deneva and Belmondo. Although he is considered a “flop” in the first issue, he has become critically successful, and it’s understandable why. The acting style Deneuve brilliantly approached the film. she constantly gets the impression that she is hiding something or hiding something, and her character in this film is as follows. I will not spoil it by saying that, although it is made public quite early. Belmondo is cute as a rather naive, but tobacco lover. I would recommend this movie to all Truffaut or Deneuve fans. This is a brilliant Hitchcock thriller with exciting twists, interesting relationships and characters that develop in the process of film development. The film lasts about 2 hours, so you feel that you are not sold shortly. Deneuve steals the show in this film, and it becomes clear that during the creation of the film Truffaut was very keen on her. A definite must see for any cinema or moviefan. 10/10
