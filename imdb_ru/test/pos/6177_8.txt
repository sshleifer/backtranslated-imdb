I am a Czech and soldiers (not only pilots) who fled from Czechoslovakia after the Nazi invasion in 1939 and fought against them abroad, are for me real heroes and the most courageous people in our history. This film from the director of the award "Kohl" (1996) - a tribute to these people. This is the first widescreen film about Czechoslovak soldiers from the Second World War since the days of Heavenly Life (1968). I think that “The Dark Blue World” is a good film - a good acting game, good special effects, pleasant music, etc. The film is half in English, and some of the actors are British. But the biggest thing in this film is pure existence. This is a great chance to show people around the world (and many in the Czech Republic ...) that the Czechoslovak role in World War II was not only an occupied country, but also an active participant in the Allied campaign. <br /> <br /> The main characters are older and wiser than Frantisek and young Karel. They fled together from Czechoslovakia, they fly in the same squadron and fell in love with the same woman ... Maybe this is a cliche, but fortunately, this storyline is not so aggressive and well balanced with other scenes (including big air battles), I do not want to compare the "Dark Blue World" with the "Pearl Harbor", someone PH like more, some DBW. But if you like a happy ending, DBW is not for you. So I think this is a very good film for everyone who likes such stories, and a very good film that wants to know something about this chapter of the Czechoslovak history. <br /> <br /> By the way, the main theme is “The Dark Blue World” "from the Czech Republic of the 30s and 40s, composer Jaroslav Jezek. He wrote this theme when he lost his eyes ...
