Errol Flynn had a real gift for comedy, which, unfortunately, was rarely used. With the right material, this film demonstrates that he could live happily at home in the style of Cary Grant, gentle comedies. Of his various forays in the genre, this is by far the best. Patti Brady plays beautifully in the children's role, and Eleanor Parker looks just awesome throughout the film. An additional bonus is the great Hattie McDaniel, which, unfortunately, is not used enough in this film - however, the desired presence. Flynn performs his comedic duties with the same light style he used for his roles. The fact that he does it as if it is light does not mean that it is. Super small family comedy, perfect for the Christmas period or any other time when you want to cheer up.
