I saw this movie in the preview, and it's amazing. Cinematography is extremely creative, acting is good, and the story is incredible. If this film is not successful, it will not, because it does not deserve. Before this film, I did not understand how charming Shiite Lebuf could be. He does an amazing, self-sufficient job as a lead. There is something incredibly sweet in it, and it makes the film even better. Other actors also do a good job with their work, and there are moments of really high tension in the film, as might have been expected from a golf movie. Sports films cost a dime, but this one stands out. <br /> <br /> This is one that I would recommend to everyone.
