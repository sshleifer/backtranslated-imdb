I like the movie, this is the best pirate movie that I have watched so far (forget about the silly things of Errol Flynn and the Pirates of the Caribbean). This film is wonderful melancholic. I compare it with "Johnny Guitar" on the seashore (but 3 years ago), two women are fighting for a man, where crazy love can lead one. <br /> <br /> The character of the woman (anti-) heroine, Ann Providence, is excellent, behaves without compromise, like a child, lost alone in search of her own female identity in the world of a real man. She is a rather strange film hero, not a funny pirate, because most of her companions in this genre do not joke all the time, fight for poor and kind people and kill only stupid Spanish or British soldiers or - better, sly governors, but she kills all poor prisoners of war. after she captured the ship (look closely at the beginning of the film), she is primitive (she can't even read), she is desperate, and after receiving an alcoholic, she loses all her friends because of stubbornness and wears most of the film tatters. In this film, the pirate "hero" is a bit (!) A bit like him (or in this case, "she", but there was a female pirate "Ann", Ann Boney), perhaps in a cruel reality. <br /> <br /> The film is rather short and the story is told in a fascinating way. Of course, the film of the 1950s does not have exciting special effects for viewers of the present (the ships float very clearly in the bathroom), but this real drama about love (which kills), trust, betrayal, revenge, hatred and sacrifice is driven by one psycho. It may be assumed that Anna will even be Judas Iscariot and Jesus of Nazareth in one person, betrayed by her friend (French La Rochelle) as Jesus; after a friend disappointed him, he was sentenced to death (like Judas); how to get remorse about this (like Judas, who commits suicide according to the Gospel of Matthew); and, in the end, she sacrificed herself to save her beloved enemy (like Jesus). But even if you are not interested in these philosophical questions of guilt and redemption, the film brings a lot of (cheap) actions, such as sword fights and burning (plastic) boats for a very short hour and a half.
