Körkarlen (1921), a classic film with a cult status among silent films, filmed by director Viktor Sztrom, who also plays the main role of men, based on the story of Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf. The film tells the story of David Hill, the cruel drinker, who beats up his wife, neglects his children, seduces his brother for a drink and is blind from the love of the nurse Edith (Astrid Holm). By the end of the year, David sits with his buddies in a city park and tells the story of the Phantom Chariot (Körkarlen): One who dies on New Year's Eve, like the last one before dawn, should serve one year. While controlling Death and freeing dying souls from their bodies. But David gets into a fight with his buddies, suffers from hemorrhage and drowns on the ground. In the meantime, the Phantom Coach is approaching. The driver is none other than David Georges' late friend, who seduced him with alcohol and died a year ago. Because David refuses to get into the carriage, Georges forces him. Together they travel to the stations where the people who suffered from David live. They visit nurse Edith, whose love for David he could not recognize, and whom he infected with tuberculosis, so that she is now dying. But her unconditional love for David will save his soul. Being filled with her spirit, they get to David’s wife and children. David can prevent his wife from killing herself and her children, because she does not see a way out of the suffering that David has thrown. They also visit brother David, who committed the murder after David seduced him to drink. David asks Georges to return to his body, because he finally sees that his path was wrong. Since it was Georges who once seduced him to drink, David's wish came true, he gets a second chance, and Georges will have to drive the Ghost carriage for another year to pay for his own sins. This film probably belongs to the strongest and most impressive films ever made. Unfortunately, it is still not available on an international DVD.
