This film embodies the soul of the modern "elite" food culture, although the film is 17 years old. Permanent principle in the film: food is more than just food. It is also a powerful symbol and medium for the culture itself. The main characters literally get drunk with the best wine and food, inspired by idealistic thoughts and culture, letting go of puritanism and passion-denying manners. Karen Blixens shortstory uses the difference between Northern Europe and Southern Europe to indicate their fundamentally different approaches to food. As strict and rather boring Scandinavians are filled with “Eros” from the south, the party begins. So what are you waiting for? Go see ..... again!
