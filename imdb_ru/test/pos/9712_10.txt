Continuation is exactly what you expect. And it is good that everyone who would like to see this should leave it happy. <br /> <br /> This is not a film that will receive an Academy Award. But it requires what made the TV series Jackass TV and the original film successful, and this raises it a notch. It is funnier, more brutal and disgusting than the original. And I liked every minute. <br /> <br /> In the original there were several notorious stunts, and there are at least one trick that will be remembered for this film. You will frown, distort, look away and laugh very, very much. <br /> <br /> In any case, you may not need to read this review or any others to know if you will like this movie, if only you have never heard of Jackass.
