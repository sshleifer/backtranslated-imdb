Genius. My genius I remember the exact second in 1994. I sat in a pub in Shropshire, England. I remember the exact place. "Bill Hicks dies of cancer," read the headline in the NME. I felt someone hit me in the stomach. Buy this DVD. If you do not find something in this, one way or another, I will be surprised. <br /> <br /> RIP Bill, I would really like you to be here
