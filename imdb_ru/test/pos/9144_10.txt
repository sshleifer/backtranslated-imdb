Being a huge fan of horror, I abandoned the vampire subgenre due to the fact that in many vampire films the vampire became female and not threatening, soft and mostly weak. It was this attitude that led me to watching Midnight Souls, and I am glad to say that the vampires in this film, at least, are hungry to kill older women and sacrifice babies! Armand Assante, one of my favorite actors of all time, was born to play a charming vampire with wild intensity. <br /> <br /> Another thing that interested me is that the Borgo Hotel is located in the center. That's cool because (and I went back to my school copy to watch it) in Dracula, on the Borgo Pass, Jonathan Harker must pass to get to Dracula's castle. <br /> <br /> Finally, my hats are off to the one who made the decision to make the creature a real effect, not a damn CGI! This is one of the great features of many low-budget films: they cannot afford the computer effects that many Hollywood monsters suffer from. <br /> <br /> Bottom line ... this is definitely better than in the Underworld, especially if you are a pure vampire. Greetings, JA
