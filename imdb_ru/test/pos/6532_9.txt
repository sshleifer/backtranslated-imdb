I know that most people will think about this film without even seeing it ... "A typical film from a famous singer ... It will be a pink film, a teen film, it will be stupid ..." and everything is like this ... And yes, this is ... I mean, this is a pink film ... But, you know what? ... I LOVED IT. Seriously ... This is a very romantic film ... I think that every girl in this world dreamed of something like the plot of "Popstar" ... Met his favorite singer, knew him as a person ... and even had an affair with him ... right? ^^ I really enjoyed watching this ... Besides, it's really funny ... <br /> <br /> I think the actors did an excellent job ... There are a lot of loving characters ... And, Aaron Carter (JD ) is no exception ... To be honest, in the first five minutes of his speech, I thought: "It will be terrible" ... But then he surprised me very nicely ... <br /> <br /> Also, I have to say that the musical performances in the film are great! I especially liked the role when JD (Aaron) sings without music, (only with a guitar) a very beautiful song ... This guy is really talented ... Time will tell ... <br /> <br /> My advice to you? ... watch it! Do not make prejudices ;-)
