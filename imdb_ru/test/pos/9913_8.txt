Kirk and his team visit a mining colony of the federation on a distant planet rich in mineral resources. The devil in darkness is Orta, a very unusual form of life based on silicon that passes through solid rock. Orta kills miners and is believed to be destroyed. But how? <br /> <br /> It’s hard to continue this review without writing a spoiler, so instead, I just concentrate on the technical aspects of the episode and touch on its topics. The special effects are fine, but many scenes with Orta look a little ridiculous. The game is pretty average for TOS. Some of the miners are a bit awkward. Nimoy has the most difficult role in "The Devil in the Dark", and he copes well with this task. <br /> <br /> Why is this still my favorite? <br /> <br /> “The Devil in the Dark” is a truly anthropological and ecological moral game disguised as an adventure. More than many episodes of this remarkable series, he stresses the importance of maintaining openness and at least some degree of sympathy for others. In addition, it includes one of the most interesting, if not likely, plot twists in the original series. <br /> <br /> Enjoy your viewing!
