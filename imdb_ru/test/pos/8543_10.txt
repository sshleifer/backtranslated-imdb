I first saw this film in Papua New Guinea in 1967 and have remembered it since then, although I have never seen it since. <br /> <br /> How easily the lives of good people can be destroyed by the pure evil that existed then and still remains a memory that will haunt me forever. <br /> <br /> The film is funny and immensely sad at the same time, and the role played by Anthony Quinn is great. <br /> <br /> This film should be in all colleges about the inhumanity of a person in relation to a person.
