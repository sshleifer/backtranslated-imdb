Loved this movie !! Great game of Carla Gugino. An interesting story about the abduction, which is terribly wrong (isnâ€™t it all?). Some of the amazing twists and turns in the film and plot were easy to follow, without being so confused as to be completely incomprehensible. It was a completely unexpected delight. More Quentin than most movies try to be.
