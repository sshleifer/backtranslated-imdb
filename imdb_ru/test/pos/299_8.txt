This is the film that many people applaud as a classic - Apocalypse Now, now reprinted, reprinted, Redux 22 years after its original release. <br /> <br /> The film is based on "The Heart of Conrad." Darkness, the main plot (if there is one) is Captain Willard's voyage in a naval boat through the Vietnamese conflict on the way to the destruction of a colonel of a fraud. (Col. Kurtz) We see the characters and the situations he meets, and he tells the story of the colonel along the way. <br /> <br /> My first feelings for the film are that sometimes it is not particularly exciting, especially at the beginning, but at least a good dose of comedy is introduced in the form of surfing fanatic Colonel Kilgore. However, as the film progresses, considerable tension arises when Willard reads various reports about Colonel Kurtz until the end is over, when everything is gathered together and the atmosphere of the film reaches an incredible level and keeps it there until the end. <br /> <br /> All the usual aspects that everyone is looking for in a decent movie meet good standards. Cinematography, in particular, stands out as exceptional, and I believe that the speeches of Martin Schin, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Frederick Forrest deserve special mention. The score that I found initially sounded irrelevant, but as the film progressed ... I'm not quite sure if it really got better, or if it came up better, or it just grew on me, but by the end a movie that I really liked it. <br /> <br /> This is the second time I have seen the Redux version (I saw the original about four times). Now I will say that I first saw him. I was disappointed. I was expecting a “classic” movie with lots of wars. The fact that Willard got the task at the beginning of the film and didn’t fulfill it to the end made me feel bored because all the interaction of the characters on the way to the film seemed unnecessary. This is due to the fact that the plot is not fully defined (since the focus is more on the character and journey than on the plot), in most cases a second viewing is required to fully appreciate the movie (as in all films that are more character than plot), because the second time you know where the plot is going. I had a similar experience with “This is a wonderful life,” which is now one of my favorite films. <br /> <br /> In the four big films about Vietnam, Apocalypse Now wins the rest in the atmosphere, but there is not enough action and platoon involvement, the emotional intensity of the Deer Hunter, and it cannot be compared to the all-metal jacket (probably my favorite four). Apocalypse Now is a great job, especially at the end when it becomes overwhelming, and is recommended for anyone who loves a good movie based on characters and is not against occasional violence.
