I watched “The Perfect Storm” and thought of another Wolfgang Peterson film, which is much better - this one. Although the Line of Fire is definitely not based on real events, this is how a movie should be made. He has an amazing story with a great cast. Malkovich won the honored Oscar for his performance as a creepy killer with resentment at the government, which he served too well. Eastwood is good as a tortured secret service, and Rousseau is light in the eyes. If you have not seen this, be sure to rent or buy, like me. Definitely one of the best criminal thrillers of the past decade. 9/10
