I bought this film just to see Bam, because I really loved him, but after watching it, I don’t really like it. I mean, his acting was good and everything I think, but whenever it showed completely unnecessary scenes, I just said to myself: “Ok, we know that you are a professional skateboarder, now we can return to Ryan Dunn? ”Dunn, Rake and Brandon really shot the film from my point of view. <br /> <br /> I noticed that Jenn Rivell (obviously) and Missy Rotstein were at Haggard, but who did Bam meet at the time? In any case, I really liked Haggard, and I think he really doesn’t look like any other movie I've ever seen. This is a kind of category.
