Since the last couple of days, I am really fascinated by the TV series "Scorpio" and continue to beat myself on the head, because I waited until now ?? what's too long ?? before buying the whole box set. “Beast Stable” is the third brilliant work in the series, and, undoubtedly, the main trump card of this series, as the authors have always come up with something completely new and unusual for each party. Never before or after this has there been a series of exploitation that offered so much variety when it comes to storylines, settings, themes and shooting styles. The original is more or less qualified as the so-called film “Women in Prison” (but not typical), but you cannot classify Parts 2 and 3 as such, since they hardly have frames inside the walls of the prison. And the overall tone and atmosphere is constantly changing with each new episode. The first film was sharp and rough, while the second was psychedelic, and the third part was almost melodramatic. Do not let this last description discourage you, as the “Beast Stable” still contains more than enough exploitative themes and exciting plots, despite the dramatic atmosphere. For example, the initial sequence is absolutely fantastic. Sasorite, still on the run from the law, literally splits her way to freedom in the subway, when there is no other option than to cut off the hand of a stubborn policeman who handcuffs her. Her run through the city with a cropped hand hanging on it, while the credits appear on the screen accompanied by a familiar thematic song - just pure and real gold exploitation! The story continues convincingly with our heroine, desperately trying to lead an anonymous life in a big city, but the poor thing simply cannot avoid her past or even new types of agony. Sasori made friends with a prostitute, although not exchanging dialogue, and began working in a sewing workshop. Her own mentally retarded brother (!) Permeates the prostitute, and Sasori has problems with the local network of pimps and criminals. She deftly prevents the gangster from using her body, meets the former enemy from prison and violently takes revenge on one of the prostitutes when she is subjected to a barbaric abortion. Meanwhile, the one-armed police officer continues obsessively wandering the streets in search of retaliation against Sasori. Our talented director Shun Ito threateningly crosses all these storylines with powerful utility and never loses control over the visual aspects or the original style of filming. "Beast Stable" includes some of the most impressive compositions and original angles that you can only imagine, editing is impeccable, and the external locations are effectively depressing. Those who know the character of Sasori a little know that the film lacks memorable dialogues, but this is always widely compensated by Meiko Kaji’s amazing charisma and menacing grimaces on the screen. There is very little meanness there, except for the aforementioned incestuous subplot, but short flashes of extreme violence are terrible, and the curved ending is almost too brilliant for words. In fact, I think the third part may be the best (or at least my favorite) of the entire series. My only small and completely inappropriate criticism concerns the ridiculous sounds that one of the birds makes when Sasori is locked in a cage. This bird sounds like a dummy with stomach cramps.
