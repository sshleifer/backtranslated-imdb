Lol <br /> <br /> The very fact that I begin my review with the word "lol" speaks for itself. I watched this movie all the time in my childhood; and even then I felt the foolishness of it all. Low budget, terrible acting and slop scenario were ever obvious then. I watched it again yesterday and just could not stop laughing. It's so bad, it's really good, lol. As another reviewer said, this does not take itself seriously. It’s impossible to look at this movie and say that the creators did just that. The soundtrack is so funny, I laugh every time I hear it. The “climax” is just a riot of laughter. This is a military zone in New York, full of explosions and complete chaos ... so ridiculous that I can't help but laugh at the sight of it. <br /> <br /> Other funny moments: <br /> <br /> - The scene with Quercy and the cop running side by side like two cowboys against the whole Wild West was so funny that it was funny. <br /> <br /> - It killed me, how the bad guys could shoot at Quercy, and he could even fall on one knee, making a very careful (and slow) sight, and not get into the LMAO. Of course, with him it was one shot one shot with his elephant gun lol. <br /> <br /> - Another fun scene was the end when he finally killed the gang leader .... with a rocket launcher lol ... destroying the entire side of the apartment building with this. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Quercy almost lost loved ones ... when his new girlfriend is quickly rescued after only a few dates. The acting is so bad that you can't blame anyone who can only think that Quercy is angry at the destruction of the car, lol ... he runs downstairs, looks at the slaughterhouse and just leaves. <br /> <br /> Again, so bad, this is good. <br /> <br /> *** of **** stars.
