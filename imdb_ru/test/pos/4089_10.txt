Why take a completely good original drama based on a completely good novel and transform it into a quasi-musical? And play it with actors who lack singing or dancing talent? In some ways, “Show Dancers” or the last two films “Star Wars”, “Lost Horizon” is full of unintentional laughter. Who can forget that Sir John Gilgud smiles awkwardly in his outfit Dali Lham, watching interpretive dance at the Republican party (“Family”)? <br /> <br /> Or Sally Kellerman sings with love to George Kennedy, making a better impression of Cher as she jumps from one stone to another (“every little thing you make”)? And my favorite is Bobby Van, who embodies the power of the American education system (“Question answer me”)? I can't wait for the DVD to be released, as I hope it will contain comments from Liv Ullmann, which will finally explain what she was thinking when she agreed to make this film!
