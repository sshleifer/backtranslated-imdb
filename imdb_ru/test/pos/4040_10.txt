This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It's so magical, and it's fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! Characters are always so attractive, so real, you just love them! The love story of Gerda and Kai will really amaze you and add this little sparkle of magic to your life. <br /> <br /> I don’t understand how it will be interesting to someone if the movie fits the book, I mean the movie was awesome! I didn't even read a book, and you know what? I don't care. Actually, if the film and the book are so different, then you can just call them two separate stories and be pleased with it. <br /> <br /> I thought the game was damn brilliant! Bridget Fonda plays the Snow Queen, so angry and so cold - you just have to hate her. Chelsea Hobbs plays Gerda, a girl in love with herself who is determined to find her love no matter what is needed, and goes on a wonderful adventure. And I just adore all the sisters of the Snow Queen (Spring Witch, Summer Princess and Autumn Rogue), they are so funny and different in many ways. <br /> <br /> I haven’t seen this movie for a long time, so forgive me if I make a small mistake ... but there is no doubt that I will always love this movie.
