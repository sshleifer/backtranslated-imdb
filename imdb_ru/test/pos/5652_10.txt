The main achievement of this film is that, although it is racially unipolar, it still manages to compile a table of military images that leave a lengthy identification with those who can watch it, and with those who were present at that time. While good films may have the ability to universalize their plot, which is often difficult to do; Great films have the ability to universalize their unipolar plots, which is what this film does. <br /> <br /> Instead of cutting out the context of unity, the film portrays the Japanese in the sore finale of the Philippine war front in February 1945, making signs of pacifism or war, but rather indicating feelings, death, destruction, victory and illness of war bloody hands of the vanquished. Differs and surpasses such films as Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Metal Jacket, which needed a satirical methodology for trivializing and depersonalizing American troupes and using all races in one fight, which is good, but not as great as in the movie that uses one race and a kind that would look fascist if it were created in America to convey the horror of the war and show what it really is. <br /> <br /> The only way the main character goes through this movie to the end is nausea, which is inedible from there; therefore, thanks to this character, his illness, his saving face, we see the end of World War II in the Philippines in February 1945 and how the Americans, the Japanese and the Filipinos united in the bloody hostilities where you live to die. <br /> <br /> The film was clearly influenced by the neorealistic mode of cinematographic image, which is original and useful to the viewer, whether or not, because the neorealistic methods he uses convey all the horrors of the war in painting. form, be it a showcase for pacifism or "militaristic responsibility." Like Germania Anno Zero, Roberto Rossellini, history springs from the environment and its associated conditions. <br /> <br /> Opening of the film, with a bilateral discussion between two Japanese soldiers, a preface and a repetition of the Event. Through this discovery, we feel that the struggle is a person against a person and a person with a person; this shows that they relied on each other to confront the enemy in past battles, but now, in this discovery, or “core” of the Japanese experience in the Philippines, new information is transmitted to the main character Tamur, giving a premonition of a cannibal leaning on each other if they want to survive. <br /> <br /> The jungles are sandy, wet and thick, and the sky is often cloudy and pours. We walk with laggards through the puddles and swamps, as sick as the earth around them. Unnamed corpses are scattered everywhere. From time to time it is impossible to say whether they are bodies, stones or grain. Apparently, there is no difference, everyone is dead and sick. Everything dies. All they need to eat is the rare monkeys and corpses of fallen comrades and / or nameless enemies. <br /> <br /> Often Tamura meets a fallen other on the verge of death. Although crushed by the spirit and crushing him, some offer his body for his food, but he refuses; he still, like Hiroshi Kawaguchi, in the role of Nishi in "Giants and Toys," will not go to the death of dignity and Japanese morality; because this is all that he really has to endure for his survival, the dignity of himself. Therefore, when Nagamatsu cuts a soldier for consumption, he shoots him because of it. Tamura may be used to murder, but he cannot decipher the illness of murder and robbery. He is not a good or a bad person. He wants to survive, but he will not go one step further than simple direct killing in a war. His identity belonged to the dead on the battlefield, he is not happy to wander here and wipe the weak for the sake of his survival. <br /> <br /> The disease that he carries, he sees everywhere, in everyone; and, unfortunately, he lacks an ethical justification to think about thinking exclusively of others, because he cannot give his body for them because of his contagious disease, or think only of himself, because he sees the disease in all although it still kills them even if they are not harmful. It can be seen as he attacked two Philippians in a hut. He sees no one. No one can see anyone. The only thing that sees aversion from illness and aversion to health is the heart of the survival instincts. <br /> <br /> Often there is a hand pointing to the left side of the screen, to what should be hope, because there, in so far in the thule lies their freedom. However, it is blocked by American soldiers, which causes Japanese stragglers to slowly die in this inconsolable dirt. There is even a church tower, reflecting the light from the invisible sun. But upon closer inspection, the crows flutter wildly about it; Religion is also a bane. <br /> <br /> Nobi, the Japanese name of the film, gives more evidence to the themes or feelings of the film: slavery to fate, the burden of existence under the guidance of leaders and life is controlled by others. His correct English translation causes serious debates among historians, since non-Koreans translate him as “slave” and “slavery”, while many Koreans claim that Nobi was not a slave system, but a system of servant class that did not meet the slavery criteria. The way is usually to avoid agonizing poverty. This improves the theme of war and the symbolism of hostilities. <br /> <br /> Isn’t it important at this time to ask yourself, what is the goal of what will become our won history? Should we be comfortable if we let him turn around without conscious effort for change? The question is not who we fight, but in ancient history, but why we fight? Fires on the plain occur with Eiji Funakoshi, Osamu Takizawa and Mickey Curtis; based on the novel Shohei Ooka. In Japanese with subtitles.
