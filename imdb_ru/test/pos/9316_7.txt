It is assumed that he was made back to back with the "Erotic Nights of the Living Dead" with the same composition and setting, but surely it does not have Laura Gemser. Much is mocked by everyone, I rather like this film. Of course, the storyline and the dialogue are cod, but it’s so beautifully shot in such a wonderful setting, and I really like hardcore. I find it both naturalistic and exotic, and this does not mean that there is a black girl and a few soft penises! I find numerous and diverse sex scenes very believable, even if two of them are set on a tree trunk at the edge of the ocean with waves constantly splashing around. The creature does not deign to appear half an hour before the end and is, I must say, a disappointment. However, in the remaining time he manages to kill everyone but two in the expedition, and in case the girls engage with them first (or later, at least in one case!), And this film is not as slow as Somebody think. In addition, there are some wonderful moments of sexual exploitation, not least the lady scientist and her desire for two “natives”, and a glorious finale, when the two survivors hurry on their boat, look at the island from which they fled, and find there still time for the last act of copulation.
