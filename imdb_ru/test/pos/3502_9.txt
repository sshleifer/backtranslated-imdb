Ali G earned his fame on a small screen - although the big screen also did not lose him fame. Ali G Indahouse is a cheerful cheerful laugh in a second, as on a small screen. He did not lose his character or stupidity at all, and behind all this - none of the films are also brainless down. During the film, Ali’s human side, Ali Ji’s idea of ​​running for PM, is brilliant, fresh and funny, and the inherent stupidity of the gangster man Staines fits well with the harsh, harsh world that politics is. The film is also full of great new characters - and instead of just interviewing for an interview, we get a suitable comedy film that is never repetitive or boring. So why didn't I give him ten stars? Well, the final was funny, but also failed and failed - none of this made sense. And in part, the film has become offensive, trying to be funny - but this is Ali G for you - if it is not offensive, it is not in itself, and it is completely and completely destroyed. In my opinion, Ali Gu's debut on the big screen was successful and should have been in the average rating of 6-7 on IMDb. But it could be worse, and people will certainly have different opinions, especially with regard to a film like this. <br /> <br /> In general, Ali G Indahouse is a fun British comedy at its best - both funniest and smartest. Great job! 9/10
