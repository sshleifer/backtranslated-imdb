I recently saw this in 2007 at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. The title of the film and in fact most of the film’s plan are taken from Robert Graves’s poem Beauty in Need. Jan Grebeik leads the script of Peter Yrhovsky from the story of Grebeik and Yrhovsky. The story begins in 2002, when one of those devastating 100-year-old floods struck Prague, destroying the house of Marcellas (Ana Zeislerov) and Yard (Roman Luknar) and their two children Cuba (Adam Mysik) and Lyusina (Michaela Mrvikov). Because of the moldy conditions in which they now live, Cuba's asthma is life threatening. Marcela works, and Jarda runs a store from the garage where they live. Shady profession Yards leads him into conflict with the law, and one of his victims of theft is fond of Marsela. Evzen Benes (Josef Abhram) is a wealthy businessman who divides his time between Italy and the Czech Republic and offers to take care of Marseille and her two children. Yana Breykhova is the mother of Marcella, who lives with her civil husband named Uncle Richie, whom Jiri Schmitzer played, probably in a better role in the film. This magnificent cast is completed by Emilia Vasareva, Yard's mentally fragile mother, who gives any money she receives to a local religious charlatan. There is a lot going on here for a small film, and this is a good story with a great script and lots of comics. Ales Brezina provides music with additional music from Czech singer Raduza and Irish singer Glen Hansard. There is something to please in this film, and I would give 8.0 out of 10 and would recommend it.
