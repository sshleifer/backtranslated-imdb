It was wonderful. As a librarian and participant in the New York Library Association Viability Fund event on Thursday evening, October 18, I had the honor to see a preview of the new film “The Running Snake”. The release of the film was postponed due to concerns about the well-being of the children involved. I am grateful that the NYLA event was allowed as planned. <br /> <br /> As for the film, I feel that it is masterfully made. I think that he had the same influence on me as Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange", although it is much less visual - much less. There is no comparison between the horrific, shocking violence and rape shown in “A Clockwork Orange” and the small amount of violence actually shown in “Running Serpent”; only the subject and the consequences for the human psyche are comparable. (I wrote more information about the abuse and rape of children and how they treated him on my MySpace blog.) I had the general impression that this film was fantastic; one of the best movies I've seen. Image of Afghan boys flying their kites, captured part of the beauty and elegance of art, unknown to most of the world. The topic is very serious, and the film transfers the emotions of the audience to this topic without a lot of sharp "Hollywood touches" that other films have destroyed. Although the inverted carriage with grenades was for me an obvious symbolism. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to point out the superiority of the soundtrack. The boy’s story of Rumi’s poetry as the two main characters fleeing the country during the Russian invasion - in appalling circumstances - truly demonstrated the power of these verses. I urge everyone who looks to neglect the subtitles as much as possible in this scene and just listen to the beauty of the language. I do not even know in what language Amir quotes, whether his usual Persian dialect coincides with the original Persian dialect Rumi. Also, please pay attention to the sound heard every time the line of the kite is cut. I found it a deep, distinctive sound, although the librarians who were with me did not notice it at all. I can't help but wonder if the kites really make such a sound when they are “cut”, or if it gives a feeling of vibration / sound experienced by the pilot of the kites during the competition.
