Created on the basis of the manga (comic) of the famous artist Masamune Shirou, this animation function disappointed me a bit. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but the animation is just OK, although it could / should have been stunning. The film is adequate IMO, but it seems somehow flat and boring, if you know what I mean. A lost opportunity when you consider that Shirou's other work, Ghost In The Shell, is considered a classic in many ways. He set new standards for Japanese animation and spawned, among other things, a brilliant series called “GiTS: Autonomous Complex”. <br /> <br /> I think it's worth renting if you are not a Shirow fan and want it all. Check out the original manga, which is highly recommended.
