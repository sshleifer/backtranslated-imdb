I can proudly say that I am a UW-Milwaukee student where parts of the film were shot. Yes, I recognize Mitchell Hall, where I took a cinema lesson, perhaps the same course as fellow student Smith. <br /> <br /> It was there that I learned about “American Cinema”. Our professor told us about this shortly before his release. Of course, I was intrigued, but for some reason I delayed watching it for several months (it must have been pretty good if he still played, at least in Milwaukee). <br /> <br /> I finally took the time to see this, I thought it was an interesting documentary. This is not a masterpiece - it lasts too long, but I find Mark’s passion and dedication inspiring. I hope that this film signals the beginning of the big and best things of it. Maybe his upcoming "North-West" will promote it to luck. Who knows? <br /> <br /> Rating: *** (out of ****) <br /> <br /> 108 min. / Released Sony Pictures Classics
