This is a great movie, but Momento (Nolan's other big budget movie) is much better. I would recommend people to go to Momento, and then, if they like it, watch this movie. The film was shot in black and white, which at first irritated me a little, but as soon as you realize that black and white is the best way to see a movie. It is extremely exciting and fairly simple to understand, although the method of its manufacture is extremely clever. The elements of the storyline, I think, are a bit silly, but the film is definitely worth a second look. To conclude, the film has a clever plot, clever twists and turns, a very good action and remembering the film's budget, I must say, this is pretty amazing.
