I liked this movie almost as much as the original version! What kind of teenager is not experiencing what Scamp is going through: wants to gain independence, increasingly moving away from his family? The songs were nice and the character designs were great. Ladies and Rogue look almost the same as in the original film. They did a good job on the voices of these two, also considering the fact that the original actors of the voice are probably dead. However, I think they should have given more lines to Lady, Annette, Colette and Daniel. Well, yes, at least they had the common sense to save the same landscape from the original film.
