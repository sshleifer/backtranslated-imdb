The Malefactor in the Dust (1949) Director: Clarence Brown <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> A Great Fairy Tale “Southern Gothic”, adapted from Faulkner’s novel about a black man accused of killing a white man who asks a young white boy with whom he became friends to help him prove his innocence. Lucas Bosch (Juano Hernandez) - this is some kind of anomaly in this small town. He is a black man who owns the land on which he lives, and he thinks little about a sick social structure that basically supports the world here and in many similar small towns. Therefore, when Lucas discovers that he is holding a pistol over Winson Goury’s dead body, which no less shot in the back, young Chick Mullison (Claude Jarman) (whom Lucas once saved after Chick fell through the ice while hunting on his land) fear That the city finally had a chance to “make Lukas *****”. Arrested and with a very real chance of being lynched before the end of the night, Lucas turns to Chick for help, as the only person he knows is “not clogged up with notions.” Chick asks his uncle John, a lawyer, to defend Lucas, and although this person is initially worried about his own ideas, he agrees, and they rush against the gathering crowd to save Lucas's life. <br /> <br /> The film has an unusual frankness for its time and is mostly free from moralizing. A lawyer tends to speak an incredibly self-conscious dialogue that sounds mostly like something from a printed page, but it has a minimal effect on tone. This is due to the rich characteristics of all the others. Juano Hernandez, who mostly starred in the films of Oscar Michaud, is as magnificent as the proud Lucas. Porter Hall in the role of the murdered father, perhaps in the best role I have ever seen him, and Elizabeth Patterson in the role of a brave old woman who sympathizes with the cause of Lucas, outstanding in the role of support. The setting is perfectly implemented. This is actually filmed in Oxford, Mississippi, Faulkner's hometown. Brown also effectively uses the crowd, it is always an anonymous crowd against one person (for example, Lucas, when he is arrested, or John, when he goes to his office), which is very threatening. Or the grotesque of the whole city gathered in prison to witness the lynching, as if it were a parade. It is noteworthy that the scene in which Chick and his friend Alec gather at the cemetery is absolutely breathtaking. Robert Surtis (bad and handsome, thirty seconds behind Tokyo, Ben-Hur) took a picture. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of 4
