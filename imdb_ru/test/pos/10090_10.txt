as a rule, a film can have such factors as “awakening”, “well-being”, “sense of purpose”, “conspiracy”, etc. Something can always be extracted from films, only the question of how convincing the reason is, for me to own them in my collection. The Tale of Two Sisters, as they call her when she was released in my country, has an overwhelming feeling and ultimately (mostly) a self-explanatory storyline. I like horror movies that revolve around the house. The names that come to mind are "Other", "Ghosts", "Ghosts of Hell House". This film will be another great example that I will remember. The film had an extremely rich color in how the house was decorated, in clothes that the characters wore in open daylight scenes, unlike most horror films, which usually use unsaturated tones and gloomy surroundings (I think , Dark Water, another show that I like), which gives this film a sense of aesthetics and joy, when there was no more exciting moments. characters are extremely believable. this may be partly due to the familiar surroundings of this film. Perhaps domestic problems are easier for me and for me as actors to identify myself, and the actors have become Omeh of their characters with exceptional sophistication. the director plays with timelines to give the audience a story piece by piece, allowing them to come to their own interpretation conditions, rather than presenting everything in a linear fashion. This is a positive aspect of this film, in my opinion, and, perhaps, it is my interpretation of this film that allows me to find it enjoyable. I would definitely watch this on a DVD.
