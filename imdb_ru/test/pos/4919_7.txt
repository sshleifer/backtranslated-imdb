Honestly, fellow IMDb reviewers, I really enjoyed this show. Cause? Well, he did not try to be more than he is; I mean the comedy series with regular expectations, with a well-known and repetitive storyline, funny and talented actors and intelligent jokes that focus on the post-college audience. <br /> <br /> This is what Grown Ups does: try to be mature, but in a fun way. <br /> <br /> Jalil White, as always, is fun and delivers some witty and funny sex-oriented jokes. Humor is very much the 90s without taking into account the trends of the new millennium, and this, in my opinion, the main reason why the show was not successful. He was stuck in the 90s. <br /> <br /> Yes, and Mrs. Ribisi was very funny and fun. <br /> <br /> My favorite show should be that Karma bites the ass! Not a cult classic, but I'm sure that this is part of the usual nostalgia of the early 2000s.
