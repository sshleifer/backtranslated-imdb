How exactly do gay Asians cope with a culture that even refuses to even accept the concept of homosexuality? For millions of gay Hindus and Muslims, there seems to be little hope of ever leading a life that would be accepted and approved by their otherwise very close-knit families. This is the highlight that is being explored in Chicken Tikka Masala - supposedly named after a spicy western dish with tender pieces of young chicken flesh! Jimmy is a typical young Asian, raised in Britain by traditional parents with general narrow-minded and selfish views on marriage and grandchildren. Like millions of other people, he is having an arranged marriage, which seems inevitable, although he seems to be completely gay and deeply connected with a very attractive young man with whom he lives. He knows what to say is true, but he fears the consequences of this, especially because his father seems incurably ill. And so he finds himself drawn into a network of deception, which is becoming wider and wider as the plot develops. <br /> <br /> The film is very sensitive and does not condemn or patronize any group represented at all. The action as a whole is excellent, although in some places it may seem a bit strange, since the director seeks to seek humor, and not allow it to bloom naturally. There are no prizes for a photo or a script, but the film is made entirely due to the wonderful feeling expressed at the very end - a feeling that all fathers of the whole world would learn well from.
