This time, the continuation of "Karate Kid" without Ralph Makkio! Hilary Swank perfectly played the role of the orphan Julia Pierce. Pat Morita, the one who plays Mr. Miyagi, worked with Julie not at all like Daniel. Both Daniel and Julie preferred karate. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the most sullen man Miyagi had ever challenged. And there was no tournament in which to participate. And in this film there will also be a little bit of humor. I liked the part when, when Julie came back from school, Miyagi went to check on her and saw how she changed clothes. It was very funny! And the classic scene "Wax on, Wax off" was different. It was funny when Miyagi said to Julie, "Oh, the missing place." Set in Boston was far from California. The militant group in this group was similar to Cobra Kai in Boston. And Colonel Dugan Michael Ironside was not John Chris. His group almost left him when Julie kicked some serious ass. They all paid the price when they blew up this classic Oldsmoble. What a cowardly act. At the very least, they will find redemption from the poison of Dugan. This karate kid sets some morals, unlike the last three, which talked about “Honor” and “Respect”. Hilary Swank is incredibly hot in any film and everything else she does. Movie 9, Hilary Swank 10!
