If you want to see something that can be classified as a “stage” version of GYPSY, this film is for you. <br /> <br /> If you like (ed) recording in GYPSY GERMAN recording, then you really like to watch MIDLER as a gypsy mother, ROSE. In my opinion, Midler has the volume, vibrato, and gifts that Merman once had. <br /> <br /> Not often these days, when I listen to updated versions of musicals, I feel a tingling sensation that my neck tingles my hair, but Bette Midler certainly shows his talents in this film - see how you like these apples ..... <br /> <br /> I know you may not like it, but for me, Miss Midler is the defining "Gypsies."
