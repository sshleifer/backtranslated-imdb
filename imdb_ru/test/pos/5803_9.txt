This show was so tedious to watch, and there are only two numbers: “The drowned world” (“Replacement of love”) and “Paradise” (not for me), where you can sit down and just consider it all. The discovery of this show will go down in history as the most spectacular sight, as Madonna enters the scene through the giant Swarovski crystal ball coming down from the ceiling, and galloping horses are depicted on huge screens behind it. Horses play a role in this show due to the fall of the Madonna. In this show, the scene with the image of the Madonna on a crucifix is ​​notorious: a huge screen has 12 million, that is, the number of African children orphaned by AIDS. At the end of the website address is suitable for anyone interested in donating. Then we turn to the subject of the environment, and the images of politics and religion are shown again. There is a break, and then the show begins again to the music of "I love New York" and "Ray of Light." This part of the show is one of my favorites, as the dancers make there funny hand movements. At the end there is a musical number with the song Inferno Disco, mixed with the song, and the dancers make more presence known. The end is full of energy again, as the show ends with Lucky Star and Hung Up tunes, and hundreds of gold balls fall from the ceiling at the end of the message "Did you confess?" A DVD is worth buying, and when it came out, the soundtrack for the show was added as a bonus. Jonas Akerlund did an excellent job with the footage for this show, supporting him according to the style of the tour.
