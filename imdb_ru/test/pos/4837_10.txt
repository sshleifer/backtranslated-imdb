We will never see this film being broadcast by HBO in the near future, if it ever appears. If someone encounters this in a video store, just take it earlier than anyone else, because I doubt that it will ever be reprinted. <br /> <br /> An incredible and timely film about the first attack on the World Trade Center on February 26, 1993, and how government agencies, whose mission is to detect and prevent terrorists from harming and harming American citizens, and American property completely collapsed to work and unwittingly allowed this to happen. <br /> <br /> Carefully, because we all now know that the terrorists detained at the end of the film will not be the end of our nightmare, which broke out on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> The film described everything that went wrong in 1992-1993, which allowed this first tragedy to happen in WTC. However, it took another eight years to realize that we had to learn from this first attack on the World Trade Center to be more vigilant and ready to prevent a second and much more destructive attack on the World Trade Center. It was harder for me to watch this movie after the events of September 11th than the video about the attacks of September 11th. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this film is not to watch it alone. The ending itself is so powerful, as prophetic, that you will be shocked by the knowledge of what we know today, and you may need someone to be with you, but not watch a movie to bring about medical help.
