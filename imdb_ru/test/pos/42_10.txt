This is one of those movies that you just donâ€™t want to finish. Characters are rich, like a well woven tapestry. Colorful costumes, music and characters attract you and tell about people who lived in a boarding house for decades during the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. A young man accepts a dynamic, spiritual woman who runs the house, and these stories are based on his experience. <br /> <br /> I could not believe that it was made for a television movie. It was so well done. S. Epata Merkerson is wonderful as a nanny, and she brings so much life into this role. You want to be right there among its members. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie so much that I bought a DVD.
