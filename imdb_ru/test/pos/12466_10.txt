I do not understand why he is so underestimated by IMDb .. This film is just perfect .. The best adaptation of all times of the Tarzan myth! As a Frenchman, I can say that this is the best role of Christoph Lambert, funny in many films, but here is absolutely wonderful, charismatic, incredible! The plot is excellent, well-told, the story is great, the direction, the atmosphere, the music, everything is perfect! No matter how cool these episodes with Elgar's music are, just great. <br /> <br /> Greystoke is really an incredible film, underestimated here, I don't know why, but I really appreciate
