This is an exciting documentary about a 15-year-old black guy who is accused of killing a tourist in Florida and a subsequent lawsuit. This film shows how corrupt the American police system is and how easily an innocent person can be convicted and how old is the old fool who thinks that one black person is very similar to the other, and is daring if he rot in prison because that he was the man who killed my wife. The star is a defense attorney who is great not only in his work in court, but also in what the police have had to do all this time. Fascinating things. 7 out of 10.
