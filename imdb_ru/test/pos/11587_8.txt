The true story of the Spanish paralysis, Ramona Sampedro, who for decades fought for the right to be put to sleep. This film, along with the winner in the “Best Film” nomination of the same year, “Million Dollars”, caused a sensation in that year with their images of people with disabilities wishing death. Both advocates for people with disabilities and (unfortunately for advocates for disabilities), conservative groups against abortion protested against both films and their Oscar nominations. The nominations also came during the entire debacle of Terri Schiavo, just to present all this in some historical perspective. Protests, especially by groups of people with disabilities, against a million-dollar child make any sense ?? the film clearly portrayed, without hesitating, the life of the paralysis as worthless. The protagonist of the film, Maggie Fitzgerald, becomes paralyzed, does not seem to receive any advice, any help, and immediately wants to die. The film is, frankly, rather dull and uncomplicated. The “sea within,” based on real events, is certainly much more thoughtful on this issue. Most likely, he fell into the same category as Million Dollar Baby, and the protesters did not even see him - an incredibly common phenomenon. The film gives time for different sides of the dispute. And here it is stated that the desire to die is the desire of the protagonist and only the protagonist. However, he is guilty of several crimes, and I still understand why disability groups may have problems with this. First of all, this is the meeting of the protagonist with the bishop's paralysis. I do not look kindly at how he is depicted. His orally-controlled wheelchair is depicted as absurd, and there is an almost comic episode when his effeminate servant-boys drag him in a chair up the stairs. He can't even get to the room where Ramon is located, and one of the toys for the boys is forced to have a conversation between them. I should have thought: well, things, perhaps, if Ramon lived in a little more accessible house for people with disabilities, he would not have spent his whole life in bed and could have found life more rich (who knows how closely the film depicts reality). Director Amenabar (“Others”) also includes some ridiculous scenes that try to make this suicidal film more life-affirming, for example, a cross-cutting scene where Ramon looks thoughtful and gives birth to his lawyer's child. But besides a few ugly moments, the film is very good. It hurts that someone may want to die when he has the ability to bring so much joy and understanding of the lives of others. However, in the end, our life belongs to us. Shouldn't we have the right to choose? The film’s strongest advantage is its minor characters and actors who play them. This shows how Ramona’s struggles and decisions affect others with great precision. The family members, in particular, are wonderful, and Ramona’s last departure is absolutely heartbreaking, and I was in tears. My favorite performance in the film comes from Lola Dueñas, who I felt gave the best, or at least definitely underestimated, performance at Volver Almodovar last year.
