First of all, before I start my review, I just read here all the reviews of the “Muppet Film” and I cannot believe that anyone can give a negative review to a film like this. (Fortunately, there was only one.) I mean, I understand that someone might not like Star Wars because of the whole fiction genre, but I don’t like the movie that shot some of the most attractive puppets in history of humanity. almost sad <br /> <br /> Well, now I’ll come down from the soap and watch this movie. <br /> <br /> “The Muppet Film” came out when I was seven years old. All my friends wanted to see it as their birthday, so I think I saw him about four times in the first month in cinemas. <br /> <br /> In my childhood I was attracted to many and other things. Puppet films and series. The singing was probably basic. Most of the songs in The Muppets are classics. From “Rainbow Communication” to “I am going to return there sometime,” they are interesting and make you think. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I see the “Muppets film” in almost a completely different light. Yes, the things that excited me when I was a child still exist, but these are little jokes and things like that that are just funny. <br /> <br /> I mean when you think about it, Jim Henson is a sick person. <br /> <br /> Kermit - a frog in love with a sweet pig that wears purple gloves and can cut you into karate. Fozzy is a stand-up comedian-bear. Gonzo is “anything” that is in love with chickens. Then you have two old guys playing a piano, playing the piano, a rock band with a maniac drummer, a Swedish chef you can't understand, and a number of other characters who are just eccentric. <br /> <br /> However, for these and other reasons, Henson entertained millions of children and adults, giving us all something special to observe and remember. <br /> <br /> “Movie Muppet” will always remain in my heart for many reasons, but I think that the most important of them is a film, unlike many recent children's films, in which I feel comfortable children are watching. Plus, I did not miss the jokes that reached the level of my children. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent film that will be remembered forever.
