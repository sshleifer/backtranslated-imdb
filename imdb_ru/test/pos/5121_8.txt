This film was not a good cinema, but definitely a good film worth seeing with the family, especially with children 10-15 years old. This film raises good topics for discussion, such as bullies, the environment, and work to fix it. Jimmy Buffett's music was a plus, and the scenery was great ... The young actors were excellent, and I would expect to see this film on the Family Channel or on the Hallmark Channel. With the exception of a few words in the dialogue, the high school can show this film to start a class discussion. Hopefully this will be shown in Drive-ins this summer so more people can see it. It really followed Karl Hiassinâ€™s book well, and it was fun to see him in a cameo.
