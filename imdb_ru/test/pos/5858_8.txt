Killing by numbers is a pretty good movie. Even though the plot moves at the speed of a snail, with the character of Sandra Bullock, confused with her partner, and the film returning to the previous traumatic situation she was in, it really helps keep the viewer in the film. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I think it helps a lot in creating such an eerie "who did it" atmosphere. It makes you guess which of the boys really was behind the murder, if not both of them. I think that Ryan Gosling and that other guy (laughs) are doing a good job selling these hooligan and stupid relationships. I'm not sure that Gosling plays a bad ass, but for a guy who would later play a major role in a film like The Notebook, he did a pretty good job. However, as soon as the film begins to develop, I really got involved in this story, as if asking myself: “Oh God, what would I do if I were in such a situation?” As I said, a good movie like CSI may be not for an extreme drug addict from a crime drama, but a good movie from around the world. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
