I agree that this film was exciting. The way that Jamie Fox captured not only the impression of Ray Charles, but the essence of Ray Charles really made the film. His life has made a great story, and it is good that it is finally told. I also found a great interview with Jamie Foxx about this role of Ernie Manaus from InnerVIEWS on KUHT, Channel 8 of Houston. Link to http://video.google.com/ videoplay? Docid = -3001837218936089620 & q = innerviews + jamie + foxx & hl = en, I urge everyone to check this out, as it discusses in detail what went into his role and his personal feelings for Ray Charles. The only problem I could mention in the film is that the shooting style was sometimes quite soft, but at the end I think it helped make the story more realistic and focus on the person Ray Ray, not on the movie Ray .
