Simply put, Goldeneye is the only best N64 game to date. The learning curve is almost perfect, and you will continue to play it with your friends for several months, since the multiplayer mode is nothing but an exception. <br /> <br /> The system for obtaining cheats at once requires a certain degree of skill, not just knowing which buttons to press, and calling Aztec at agent 00 level is simply amazing. <br /> <br /> In general, this is the best game I've ever played on the N64
