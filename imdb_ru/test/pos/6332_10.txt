I watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and really didnâ€™t like the show until season 4 started. This episode of "Silence" was seen by me alone in the darkness immediately after midnight with the windows open and a violent wind blowing after the storm. The authors of this episode did a great job, scaring me to hell. I was delighted with the whole episode that I just finished 2 minutes ago. Amazing does not touch the surface of what this episode performs almost without dialogue. If you have never thought about this show, at least watch this episode. If this does not impress you, then probably no episode will be. <br /> <br /> By the way, my heart is still beating ...
