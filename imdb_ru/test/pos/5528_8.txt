I watched "Six of a Kind" for W.C. Fields - he is only in this about 10 minutes and has one long scene, the notorious unification sequence he made famous in vaudeville, and several other remarkable moments. Fortunately, the remaining 55 minutes are also amazing, mainly due to jolly Charlie Raggle as clumsy banker J. Pinkham Winnie. He is the foil of everyone. He stutters and stumbles over our pleasure. Also his comedy partner, Mary Bolend, plays his wife Flora. George Burns and Gracie Allen are involved in the process. Boland is especially fun at the beginning and at the end, but Gracie and Ruggles use most of the painting. Gracie is pretty funny, but she can also get tired. And poor George Burns has absolutely nothing to do except to repeat Gracie all the time. I do not remember once laughing at him (although he has one wonderful scene with Ruggles, where Raggles is desperately trying to get George to take Gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while, and one with Fields, where he asks Fields to sell him a sweater, although this is a little exclusive for Fields). The situation is constantly funny: Winnie is going to California, but to help them with the expenses, George and Gracie are recruited. 8/10.
