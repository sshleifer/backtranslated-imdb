Buddy Manucci (Roy Shader, firmly playing the leading role) heads a secret police squad called “Seven,” whose tactics do not always follow exact laws. They do their job in their own way, without getting into the press, and this gives them the freedom to expand their ability to fall into the hands of criminals, which most of the working detectives and police simply cannot catch. Since childhood, Buddy has a friend named Vito (Tony Lo Bianco), who shares with him information about the types of mafia and jokes working on the streets of New York. What Buddy does not know is that Vito is carrying the scheme using the names from Buddy's “checklist” (he has an open book in which notes provided by Vito are written, but he does not know that his friend copied those very names, do not forget to arrange the crowd in a series of mafia kidnappings, collecting money from two police posers, Luna (always the villainous Richard Lynch) and Bo (Bill Hickman) working with him. When this scheme goes awry, with one of the Seven-Ups be killed, Vito gets scared because that he knows how Buddy can be when he stubbornly after someone..especially when one of his own is killed. <br /> <br /> An extremely undervalued flick of a policeman chases an exciting car chase through New York, as Buddy follows the kidnapper of a policeman trying to get them after killing his partner. The film is not too complicated after the plot is set up, and we understand who is leading the plot of thugs. Scheider has never been praised for his excellent main role. He has an emotional range, and we see how the loss of his cop and friend affects him. The film animatedly unfolds with good fighting episodes and presents an interesting story about betrayal between friends, since greed precedes that children's friendship and how what seems like a smooth crime against evil gangster families can kill police officers.
