I saw this film only once and I look forward to it again and again. Dear David (from Beligium), why did you write a commentary on this film? I only think that we can think of you (after reading your comment) that you are probably a non-sexual person (like Erica in the film) and you are not ready for a new movie theater that will appear I suppose you're a little older and sexy expression is not part of your "appearance". The Cannes Film Festival is by far the best film festival, and I am pleased to say that this film was awarded: Best Actress, Best Actor and Grand Prix. Isabel Happert is great, as always, who would make this film like her? One of her best performances. The music is fantastic, and again Michael Haneke presents reality on the big screen. It looks like a movie like Dogma95 because of the theme. Try to see it. <br /> <br />
