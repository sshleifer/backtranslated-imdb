I can't believe how many great actors can be in one show. This is realism and a great game that make it real. This must be the best comedy ever made to this day, and I love Seinfeld and Everyone loves Ramonda. This is just incredible, and everyone in my family seems to agree. This is not my isolated opinion. The whole world seems to be talking about various incidents, and they are trying to reproduce them. My hat to the team. Some shows have an actor who does the whole show. This story comedy has many (8) of them. That's what makes it so awesome. Some people pray for health, wealth or fame. I pray that the show never ends. Sickerly John. LKHUBBLE2@talkamerica.net
