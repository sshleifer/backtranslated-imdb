I remember how many years ago BBC1 showed this film in a very cropped form. I found it on video a couple of years ago and looked again. The film, although slow and a bit strange (mountain people look very strange), the atmosphere was very effective. This is one of my favorite slasher movies, and I have no idea where to find the uncut version. Currently being deleted everywhere (except for the USA where it was accidentally placed in a horror compilation!) It is a pity that you can not get this film as it was intended. The wrong turn (the newly created film by Stan Winston) is largely due to Just Before Dawn. One of the best director films of the 80s, deserving to be watched by wider viewers.
