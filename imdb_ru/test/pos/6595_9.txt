This film was not only exciting, but also brought me back to the past with his sound track. It was what we said and sang ... it was the songs that we listened ... all in the same time period, in the same era, in the south of Alabama. I could not have been one of the set of skateboards, but I was definitely one of the observers sitting on the sidewalk with the old transistor radio, listening to Neil Young, watching those more daring than I ever hoped to be, surfboards on wheels, using the tricks of Alva and Adams, hoping that maybe just, maybe for a short time, they will take on the Zephyr style. It just shows how much we all looked like on those wonderful days. ~ KLJ
