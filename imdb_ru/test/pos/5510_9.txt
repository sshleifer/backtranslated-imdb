This thriller is one of the few surprises (films) that I had for a long time. Everything - and I mean ALL - I talked when it was in cinemas, said it was awful ... but then I thought ... none of these people understand horror movies / thrillers or metal rock - so why? I listen to them in the first place ????? This film kicks ass - but ONLY if you are able to understand and enjoy this type of entertainment. In short (too late) - look at this with an open mind, and it may just open your mind. ... the soundtracks are great too ...
