Seeing Fargo, “oh, so acclaimed” and thinking that this is nothing more than an average level, I began to wander, if it would not be a good idea to rent one more Cohen's “masterpiece”. This time I was much less disappointed than with Fargo, and I must say that much of the merit of this lies in the good jokes and good playing of George Clooney. Mr. Clooney, well done, make more of these films, not “Perfect Stormish”. You can act, and you showed it here. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
