This is without a doubt the most terrific and amazing documentary I've ever seen! The images that are shown are absolutely fascinating and stunning. It is also a great learning experience. I'm not alone for educational documentaries, but this one captures you and does not let go until the end. You will be so fascinated and fascinated by what you see, that you forget to watch TV at home! You can buy this series on DVD, and I STRONGLY recommend this one! With all the evil and death in this world, this documentary series gives us proof that life is beautiful and worth saving and keeping it.
