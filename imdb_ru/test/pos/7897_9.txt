Caution - possible spoilers ahead? .. Just watched "Joe" the second time. The first time was 30+ years ago at the Air Force base. I was reminded of this coat by the Air Force with Tech. Sergeant strip worn by a guy / dealer; we, the pilots, laughed at the first time appeared on the screen, because this is the title of "life-long." Over the years I have brought several other images from the film. First of all, there was an absolutely beautiful and vulnerable daughter of the executive branch. As someone else commented, you couldn't take your eyes off her. Until now, I did not realize that it was Susan Sarandon, 20, in her first film. What a loss that she no longer starred in films when she looked like that. I also recall the irony of the fact that the hero of the counterculture, such as Peter Boyle, plays the main role of the right cannon. Not unlike George S. Scott, who plays the generals in Dr. Strenglov and Patton. And, of course, the shocking ending made an indelible impression. <br /> <br /> 30+ years ago, it was the most discussed film ever played on the base. We thought it was a great movie and I didn’t want to watch it again, because I was afraid that it would be as disappointing as Easy Rider. But looking today, I was amazed at how well the film survived. This is a very powerful scenario with a few holes, although you need to ask yourself how the guy immediately leaves the bathroom when Sarandon enters with him. <br /> <br /> In search of an explanation why this film is still so interesting I must think that this is somehow related to the perfect physical casting. Boyle was physically believable, as was Joe (as others have noted, his image will inspire Archie Bunker’s character a few years later). Ted Knight modeled his character "Caddyshack" - Judge Smails after advertising manager Dennis Patrick in "Joe"? They are alike and sound the same. Patrick was absolutely believable as a tied middle class leader. And the innocent, like Sarandon, the doll of Raggeti Ann still evokes a protective response from all men - the perfect casting. <br /> <br /> Nude scenes and scenes with drugs actually hold on (they were very provocative for their time) and as obvious as anything that can be found in Thirteen. The only thing that dates this film is that the violence is not realistic or graphic. “Joe” was about the same time as “Wild Bouquet”, and the tone of violence in the movies just began to change. <br /> <br /> Another reason this film justifies itself is that the events of the past two years have brought back the relevance of the theme and context of this film. In the film, both types of "conservatives" are depicted as full of fear and hatred for unconventional methods of counterculture; and are jealous of their free and hedonistic lifestyle. Counterculture is portrayed as a mockery of direct culture; and although paranoid about conservatives (legally, given that this was just a couple of months after Kent), they cannot resist exposing their lifestyle in an attempt to counteract. The political landscape is not so different 30 years later. I'm not sure that conservatives envy young people and liberals as much as the 1970s, but they fear and hate them more. <br /> <br /> An excellent film that is surprisingly as relevant now as it was in the early 1970s.
