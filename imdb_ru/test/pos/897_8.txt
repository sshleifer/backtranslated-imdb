The main reason to check it out is to watch Laura Gemser in all her glory. <br /> <br /> This is enough for me. <br /> <br /> She goes to Africa as guests of another rich guy, it looks like all these films. Huge mansion near the jungle. The hunters stop at parties when they don't hunt zebras. And these parties turn into drunken orgies. <br /> <br /> All types of high society in the films about Emanuel seem to be out of control. And most of them are Emmanuel. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato did NOT control it. He just ripped it off and used the same composition. And did anyone notice “subconscious” sexual images at the gas station? And why do most men stay dressed during sex scenes? <br /> <br /> Coordination? Hardly anyone. BUT GOD'S GOD IS BEAUTIFUL.
