It is a strangely powerful and touching experience to see the “English patient” again after the death of Anthony Minghella. Most of his work is devoted to one amazing moment. The endless moral struggle of those who deliberately follow a very thin line. In Talented Mr. Ripley, Minghella moves away from the immoral Tom Ripley Patricia Highsmith to give the killer a conscience. In Hacking and Penetration, Minghella gives the character of Jude Law the need to confess, and the awards move frighteningly. Here, in the English Patient, the characters in love are never too far from their corrosive feelings of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Christine Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They shoot their characters from all sides in irresistible complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is quite simply impressive, and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with the sensual innocence of "Minghellian". Anthony Minghella gave us films that somehow represented an elusive combination of art and commerce. He was true to himself, but he was thinking about his audience. He knew how to press our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and striking in Minghella’s opus. I miss him already, but I am grateful for the reflection of his soul that he left behind.
