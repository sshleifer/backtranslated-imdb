Although he is often considered the worst film of Peter Sellers, he is in fact an excellent example of medical corruption and abuse of power. Often misunderstood, a film is actually a deviation from the type of film that sellers were best known for; satirical farce. This film had excellent performances by Jo Ann Anflug and Pat Morita (from Happy Days and Kid Karate films), but it was marked by ribald, disrespect and complete demolition of the crazy medical industry of the time. He was ahead of his time (1972), choosing the frantic path that the Monty Python team would go to the movies in a while. Thus, it was unacceptable for the traditional admirer Peter Sellers, who found that sharper notches in this humor were something they were not used to. Currently, Peter Sellers films are in demand among fans, but this effort, “Where does it hurt?”, Has become almost impossible to find by its nature.
