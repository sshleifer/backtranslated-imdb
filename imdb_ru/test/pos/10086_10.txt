"The Tale of Two Sisters" should be one of the most creepy movies I've ever seen. In the end, there is no supernatural element, despite what can be expected from the film. It seems that the story of two sisters who, after returning to their fatherâ€™s home after some absence (it turned out later that it was a psychiatric hospital), had to deal not only with an outwardly schizophrenic and possibly bipolar stepmother the youngest of the girls, when she is struck by the mood, and happily tells them that she prepared a special dinner at another time, but some presence has not yet been explained. Later it turns out that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the dim minds of her older sister, who could not save her, and her stepmother, who was callous enough to allow her to die. Much of the specifics of a strange family is not revealed in the film, but it definitely leaves the viewer with an eerie feeling and grumpy hint of confusion. Definitely not easy browsing; watch it when you really want to think about what you saw. It's damn incomprehensible.
