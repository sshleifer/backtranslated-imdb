I screamed like a little girl during the final of this film, and I dare anyone else to hold it together without sobbing. Absolutely heartbreaking thing, but at the same time elevating it. <br /> <br /> An enormous effort on the part of Ann Margaret, who plays a mortally ill mother of ten years, who, knowing her husband suffering from arthritis, will not be able to support a family when she leaves, will arrange the adoption of her children she leaves. The role really deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> You really feel for this poor family, because the dying mother gives her everything so that her children do not fall into the poorly managed system of orphanages. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet seen, you will receive it if you can.
