This film was great, and I waited for it for a long time. When it finally came out, I was really happy and was looking forward to 10 out of 10. It was great and it justified my potential. The performances were great from adults and most children. The only bad performance was Milo himself. There was one problem I encountered in this (and other similar) film. All the characters I wanted to live were killed. Overall, I give this film an excellent 9 out of 10. Maybe we should pick the best people to kill them next time, ok?
