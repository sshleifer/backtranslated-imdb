Not all films should have such a predictable end to which we are all so used to, and itâ€™s great to see films with really unusual twists and turns. However, after all that was said, I was very disappointed with the end of l'apartment. In my opinion, the finale did not quite match the rest of the film, and it basically ruined the story being told. <br /> <br /> You spend the whole movie getting to know everyone and their feelings, but the events in the last 2 minutes of the movie would mainly affect each character, but the movie ends and leaves it too wide open. <br /> <br /> In general, although this film was very well made, and in contrast to similar films, such as Serendipity, all the scenes were believable and did not go beyond.
