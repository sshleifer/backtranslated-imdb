I really liked this movie, and I spent several years trying to get it. It is simply not available, and it has not been on television for many years. I liked this and the songs, because there was something else in them that made you think about how each person looks at something from different points of view. In addition, we often do not appreciate what we have until it is no more. <br /> <br /> My 12-year-old daughter just learned music and is passionate about some songs. Someday I hope to get a copy of the film so that she has the opportunity to watch it. (Oh, I would like to see it again!) <br /> <br />
