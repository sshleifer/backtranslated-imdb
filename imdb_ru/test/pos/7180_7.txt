You cannot watch the same movie unless you grew up in France (or spent there at least 10 years like me). I do not know if it will ever be possible to go beyond the French cultural boundaries (here I include Belgium and Luxembourg). You can't translate this kind of fun - every name is a joke (how many people outside Paris will understand the pun in Couloirdebus, the name of one of the Roman legionaries?) However, Monica Bel (l?) ​​Ucci is so beautiful that I almost forgot to breathe when saw her.
