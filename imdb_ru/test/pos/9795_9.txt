Radio Flyer is one of my favorite American movies. <br /> <br /> The really great work of two boys, Joe Mazsello and Elijah Wood (despite the terrible performance of T. Hanks at the beginning and at the end ...) with the amazing DMEvans script and the powerful and emotional direction of R. Donner Also, H. Zimmer's absolutely incredibly incomparable musical score allowed Radio Flyer to take one of the first places in the rating of my family films. br /> <br /> It is a pity that some film critics underestimate this good film. <br /> <br /> I just can't wait to watch it on DVD.
