Well, I'm a big fan of Tracy, so her participation in the film automatically puts him on a rating of 8.5+. But even besides the fact that she was in it, I thought it was a good film, especially because it was an HBO film. But I am afraid that if you remove Tracy from the film, everything will be fine. But the man can not do it, she is in it, and she is a wonderful actress. She just gets better and better.
