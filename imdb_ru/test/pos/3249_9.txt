Two hands restored my faith in Australian films. He took the old premise and made it fresh. I enjoyed this movie endlessly. I recommend it to those who love Guy Ritchie films. Brian Brown was fantastic and almost perfect in the role created for him. Ledger was pretty dull, and his performance was a very nice movie for me.
