Jewel Thief is one of those unknown thrillers in which viewers are completely aware of who the villain is. Suspension takes place from the very first scene, when the jewel thief becomes a national problem, and there are slyly hidden clues in the film so you can guess who the jewel thief is. The story tells that Dev Anand (Vinai in the film) and the jewel thief have the same faces. But you get a shock of 1000 watts, when you finally recognize the villain. There are a lot of surprises and a lot of something suspicious, but there is a time for romance and six eternal melodious songs performed by Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bosch, Kishore Kumar and Mokhmad Rafi. <br /> <br /> This film was also talked about the video of his song. Consider the tease and counter tease in Asman Ke Neeche. Or blocking the road Dev Anand, when Tanuja went out with her friends to Yeh Dil Na Khota Bechara. Or romantic Dil Pukare Are in beautiful Sikkim. Or the wonderful dance Vijantimaly in Hotho Pe Aisi Baat. Add to this the Rulak Guy Sapna Merah and Raat Akeli Hein, and you will never forget this film for any reason. <br /> <br /> Capable cast of Dev Anand, Ashoka Kumar, Tanuji and Vijantimaly, directed by Vijay Anand (Dev Anand's younger brother) makes it one of the most favorite films in Hindi of all time, even today.
