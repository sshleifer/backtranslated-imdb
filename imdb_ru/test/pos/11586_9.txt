This film tells about the real life of Ramona Sampedro, who lived 27 years in bed, breaking his neck, and fights for the battle to get legal permission for a person who can help with his death. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem is one of the best actors of his generation. Consider this: he should only wear this film with his face! Incredibly, he didn't even get an Oscar nomination. Now we all see that the Academy is a joke! The cast was awesome! Optimistic Rose, his lawyer Julia, the rest of the family ... Each person has his own opinion that Ramon wants to die. <br /> <br /> No matter for you or for euthanasia, your opinion is out of the way, because this film deserves to be seen by people from all over the world! In the middle of the film, I wept, and he didnâ€™t stop until the captions rolled. This film is so heartbreaking, but also nice to watch, and I can't wait to see it again. I give it 9/10, and, in my opinion, this is still the best film of the year.
