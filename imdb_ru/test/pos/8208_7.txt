Following the advice of a friend, I got this movie. I really love computers in general - so the 1995 film about the theft of personal data on the Internet cannot go unnoticed. I had some bad echoes about this, but in the end I was not so disappointed: the story, although classic, was quite interesting and must have been really new at the time when it was going out in theaters. I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that, contrary to what we usually see, computer actions are somehow realistic, since they use Windows 3.x and ordinary computers. The story is median and does not bother the viewer. The end is typically American. The acting is generally normal, Sandra Bullock usually annoys me with her behavior “My God, why I am,” but this time she seemed to be controlling herself. I would recommend this movie.
