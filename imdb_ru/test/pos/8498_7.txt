If someone pushed me for about 15 minutes at Ray and asked what I thought of Jamie Fox in the lead role, it would be time for a blank look. In the end, what does this (fictional) person say? It was not Jamie Foxx on the big screen. It was Ray Charles. This is one of the best performances of anyone in recent years. As in the soundtrack, Jamie in the role of Ray is simply amazing. <br /> <br /> The blind genius of the soul (who made a revolutionary step in mixing the gospel with R & B) died during production. The film about his troubled life is good, not great. The direction of Taylor Hackford and the script of James L. White follow a worn out biographical outline. A super-talented young man fights against adversity, achieves greatness and at the same time self-destructs, and then rises from the ditch for a happy ending. The film shows Charles’s flaws (heroin abuse, chronic woman, permanent fatherhood), even when he sucks you with his beautiful music. <br /> <br /> Kerry Washington and Regina King play the main women in the life of Ray, one of his long-suffering wife, the other his longtime mistress. Both actresses match Foxx strive for success. However, what brings him to another level is his deep understanding and supernatural imitation of a great musician. The entire cast is effective, especially Sharon Warren as his stubborn mother and Curtis Armstrong as a musical performer. Hackford stars are likely to be rewarded with trophies and - even better - more roles. <br /> <br /> I was not a fan of Ray Charles before Ray. Apparently, a lot of things are not taken into account in the film (as in all biographical films), but this picture functions as an old-fashioned crowd of viewers and a dark investigation of a brilliant / restless person. For those who are whimpering that Fox is not really singing (as if this somehow reduces his performance), go hiking. No actor can sing like Mr. Charles. You can't have everything. What the talented star in this picture makes is as close to “everything” as we are likely to see for a while.
