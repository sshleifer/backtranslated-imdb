Everywhere I hear that people call this show bad because its premise is too contrived ... well, maybe the friendly taxi driver in Philadelphia is promoting it a bit (at least, the taxi drivers I met), but this is what Shaw great <br /> <br /> The fact that this show is a little different from the reality track is a problem, but still enjoyable and fun. It's very watchable, and although you know, Mike wins in the end, he never wins in life. David Morse - a great actor and copes with the main role. His supporting cast is great and I must say that the layout of the show is especially great! <br /> <br /> In general, I’m not watching this show because I’m looking for a good dose of reality or a show with lots of action. I watch this show because it has a great game, a good premise and a great storyline every week. This is also a plus when I can choose the landmarks on which he is passing, or find out which intersection he is on. I love this show, and I love Philly! Give this show a chance!
