Even after all these years, it remains the “perfect movie” for me. I still remember how I sat in the theater for a long time after everything was over, overwhelmed by experience, overwhelmed with emotions. I have a DVD (of course!), This watch at least once a year. This is incomparable, and I cannot add what has already been written about its perfection and beauty. So glad that others love it as much as I do! Note: The author of the book on which he is based - Michael Ondatie - was fascinated by this film, and is quoted as saying that he would like him to think about some beautiful scenes written exclusively for the film ... the way Kyp invites " Khana is on his side with a trace of small candles, and the way he arranges for Khana to inspect the frescoes in the ruined medieval church.
