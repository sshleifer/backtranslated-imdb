I remember that I really liked BATMAN RETURNS when it was released in 1992, but now I think this is the best of all Batman movies (even though the amazing 2005 BATMAN movie, proposed by Christopher Nolan, and, of course, against over-exaggerated overvalued 2008 DARK NIGHT!). Initially, I remember thinking that the 1st BATMAN with Jack Nicholson was the best (and I still love him). But I think this movie really hits the head. The 4 main characters (Batman, Penguin, Catwoman and Max Shrek) are all vivid and memorable. You can really see what Batman / Bruce Wayne is in Keaton’s amazing characterization. Keaton is the best Batman, not Kilmer, Clooney, or even the promising Bale, who was exceptional at BB and could steal the highest rewards from Keaton if his character had not been destroyed by Nolan’s hacker movies at TDK! <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito in the role of Penguin is disturbing, scary, cheerful and deadly. DeVito is great and does not need to chew scenery to give excellent performance like the Nickolson Joker. The viewer can actually sympathize with this disfigured outcast and his position to fit into normal society. Before this film, I had never been a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer, but this is definitely my favorite performance of hers. Selina Kyle Pfeiffer is at first stupid and strange, and then when she turns into Catwoman, she is both sexy and scary, full of fatal sex sweat! In addition, I feel that Keaton and Pfeiffer have more chemistry than Keaton and Basinger from BATMAN; they form a tragic love story. And Christopher Walken as Shrek, well, as always, Christopher Walken! <br /> <br /> BATMAN RETURNS, more than BATMAN, is more confident and determined. This is confident filmmaking from start to finish. The way Burton represents Penguin’s heartbreaking prehistory captures you from the start. The first 5 minutes is one of my favorite beginnings in any movie: Danny Elfman's music sets a sinister premonition that defines the rest of the film. This is a modification from the original BATMAN and is great! <br /> <br /> Then we’ll go back to 33 years to modern Gotham, and we’ll meet with influential businessman Shrek, who wants to build a new power plant in Gotham. During the same scene, we meet the meek, mocking, incredulous secretary Shrek Celina Kyle. And soon after this is the exciting opening sequence of the film, as Batman must fight the Penguin Red Triangle Gang, a funny but deadly group of rogue and circus performers. The penguin begins a move to attack Gotham's Christmas celebration, kidnap Shrek in chaos and force him to help re-introduce him to society. Meanwhile, Selina discovers Shrek's criminal plans, and therefore he “kills” her, pushing her out of her high-rise office, after which she is enlivened by cats. <br /> <br /> Sound tangled? Yes, but Burton never claimed to represent a realistic story. He created a world in which the viewer can come to terms with the fact that such things can happen, a dark, noir world consisting of poorly converted, mutilated rogue people who, in the depths of their souls, want only adoption and inscribing. Sure storytelling if you ask me! <br /> <br /> Scenes of militants are few, but they are all exciting, entertaining and gnawing nails. They are not there just to show, as some in Batman. And they all make sense. The climate scene with the “army” of penguins marching in the center of Gotham, with Batman taking part in the shelter of Penguin and the assistant butler Alfred (Michael Gough in the long-awaited return from the original!), Helps Batman, is concise, hard, heartbreaking fun! <br /> I also love the winter time of Christmas, a setting that adds to the super-dark, cold feeling of the world of Batman from Burton. I also like the way Burton slowly presents Batman's “toys” to us without squeezing them into the throat. Each "toy" is suitable for the moment in the film, and we are forced to accept them for their intended purpose. And although it is dark, RETURN is still a funny movie. Penguin DeVito has a lot of fun lines. Like Walken Shrek. Batman Catwoman exchanges are extremely stimulating and filled with humor! Great ensemble! In general, BATMAN RETURNS is a closely intertwined story of dark forces that play in the funny world of the Tim Burton comics.
