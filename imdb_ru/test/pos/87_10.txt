Years have passed since I had the honor of watching this movie on TV. I just would like to contact someone to see it again. I married a man with three children, two had fetal alcohol syndrome. I didn't realize it, but watching this movie helped me understand more about their problems and more about how I can love them and help them overcome their difficulties. My stepson is now 35 years old, and, thank God, he miraculously bloomed, but he still has many consequences of being born from an alcoholic mother. Every month we communicate with patients of the rehabilitation center, who suffer from alcoholism and drug addiction, and this communication really made enormous changes in their behavior and desire to start a new life without dependence on drugs and alcohol. Please let me know how I can get a copy of the VHS or DVD of this movie or when they show the movie again on TV. If you were not in these shoes, you probably would never have understood its value. Thank you so much.
