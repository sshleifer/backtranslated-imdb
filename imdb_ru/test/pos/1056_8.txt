Although this is a Christmas movie, “Christmas in Connecticut” could be shot at any time of the year, as this is the story of a soldier who spends an idyllic time with Martha Stewart. This is what he thinks. In fact, the lady in question, depicted by Barbara Stanwick, has a popular magazine column on farm life with her husband and child. She has no farm, no husband, no child, no her recipes. They belong to the owner of a restaurant nearby. When her chief editor, Sydney Greenstreet, insists on entertaining soldier Dennis Morgan, she enlists the support of her boyfriend to use his farm, and she transports herself and the restaurateur there. There's even a kid ... well, actually, there is more than one. Chaos occurs, and it becomes harder to play charade, especially when Stanvik falls in love with Morgan. <br /> <br /> This is such a wonderful film, and even if you are in severe depression, “Christmas in Connecticut” can lift you right out of it. Barbara Stenvik is wonderful because a professional woman became a housewife. Despite the fact that not as luxurious as Crawford or Davis, she nevertheless was able to fulfill what any role required — she could be cheap, elegant, warm, nasty, cool and / or sexy, and she forced it It looks easy. Besides, she is always attractive and seductive. Dennis Morgan is a handsome and charming soldier, as an extra bonus he gets the opportunity to use his Irish tenor. Reginald Gardner's fiancée is all about and you can say that he isn’t quite suitable for Stanvik. the chef is cheerful, especially as he prays for Stanvik to turn the pancake in front of an audience. <br /> <br /> I can imagine how this delightful film influenced the end of World War II. It must have been a real beacon for better times.
