Yes ... I read David Lee Roth's autobiography, Mad with Heat (which, by the way, is an amazing read), and DLR says it was his favorite black booty movie as a child. In fact, he says that he always imagined himself black in Southern Calais. Mr. Roth quotes the words: <br /> <br /> “We saw every picture of Blacksploitation, and these films had a HUGE influence on me. Restless man, Superlife, Foxy Brown, Val, Cleopatra Jones, Blacula, Rudy Ray Moore, do his Dolemite vibrations - I saw it all ... "<br /> <br /> He continues: <br /> <br /> "Dolemit - Rudy Ray Moore - was one of the originals. He was a blue comedian, engaged in blue humor. As Redd Fox did on early party records. So he was the most ideal person to play the new secret agent. His answer was not “Bonds. James Bond. "His answer was:" Dolemit, mother *****! ". We will be waiting for this line in all his films. “Get White” will appear in every single film at least once, and we will wait for that too. They had cars. They had shoes. They had guns. Haircuts Slang. And a scam. And we all knew that all these blissful decisions at the end of the film were white bulls *** *. He is trying to feed the hungry children, but in fact he is a pimp ... bull ****. It was designed to make it acceptable for our moms and dads, so that they allow us to go and see the picture. ”They speak like a real genius. Therefore, after reading about Dolemit in Mr. Roth’s book, I immediately I bought it on DVD, and I like it a lot. Yes, it's super low-budget, and yes ... I hate rap ... but as a fan of Tarantino films, I see a lot in common, especially some of the 70s fusion. / funk ala-jaco pastorus, throughout the film.I also like the scene in which two policemen “ruin” him for Coca-Cola, and then one and he smells a whole bunch of them, as he did it a thousand times earlier, and says something like, “Oh, yes ... this ... This is McCoy!" ... and then he continues to talk, and he has a little bit of coke on his lips. CLASSIC! Some of the violence is a bit beyond the limits, but it is shocking that I consider it a positive quality. Not as predictable as I expected. Definitely going to pick up the “Human Tornado” very soon. 10 out of 10.
