It is a shame that this wonderful bright spot on the small screen had such talent of writers and actors, such wonderful scenery, which were an absolute escape for those who are in a state of closure from sun. Many of the actors went for the big stuff ... another indicator that something wonderful was unfortunately lost. At that time, I lived in Columbus, Ohio, with my entire (now ex) husband’s large family in the “NO NO !!” choir each time it would again be captured by the broadcast of a baseball game. <br /> <br /> Someone who wrote here mentioned that it was against “Rosanna” ... all my ex, and I noticed that it was always always supplanted by BASEBALL !!!! Yes, FOX really wasted something wonderful that no one and nothing compares to this ~! Thanks for the memories of this.
