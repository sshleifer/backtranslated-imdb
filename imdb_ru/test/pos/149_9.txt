Chan-wook Park, you have to hand this to a guy. In my opinion, he is not only a brilliant director, but also a brilliant director who can turn his hand to any genre and often gives something refreshing, but nevertheless ultimately satisfying. <br /> <br /> Thirst, in fact, is a story about vampires, but this one plays quickly and freely with some of the “rules” of the subgenre. Kang-ho Song plays the father of Sang-Hyun, a man who selflessly devotes himself to the research program, and then selflessly picks up the disease that he is trying to cure, die and return. All thanks to the blood, which he was poured. Being the only survivor of five hundred, he becomes a celebrity for those who know him, and all he wants is to return to normal life. Normal, however, now includes the ability to jump long distances without injury, to want to drink blood and get very hot under the collar when the sun's rays hit his skin. Soon he lives in a rather dysfunctional family that knew him in childhood, and hiding his new, strange way of life, he finds himself embroiled in a complicated love triangle, becoming more acceptable to darker thoughts and slipping on a slippery slope, which can lead him from man to animal and monster. <br /> <br /> Complicated mixing of several genres, the Park film seemed to me much more fresh and more original than “Let me in the right” (using the recent example), and sincerely struck me by his approach to the material that could be as good to wear and rephrase as any number of other vampire films we have seen over the years. It is a mixture of horror, melodrama and comedy, as well as reflections on such ideas as the power of faith, power over life and death, lack of immortality, etc. Some others have complained that this genre approach using blending weakens the film, but I personally discovered that it was a lively, interesting and always enjoyable film, which was helped by Song’s excellent central representation as a tortured priest and fantastic turns from an auxiliary staff without weak links. Many characters have to go through different emotions, and they all do it with skill and believability, especially a young woman (played by OK-Vin Kim), who becomes the object of love, lust and affection of the priest. <br /> <br /> Fans of Asian cinema (and Park in particular), as well as Talking Heart fans. (watch and learn) should chat about this, this is another cool movie from a man who seems to take everything to your taste and always manages to extinguish nothing less than continuous entertainment. <br /> <br /> Look if you want: Cronos, Near Dark, Dellamorte Dellamore AKA Cemetery Man.
