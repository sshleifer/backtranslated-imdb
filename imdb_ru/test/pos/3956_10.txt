I had the opportunity to watch the Blind Spot in Barcelona, ​​and I really enjoyed it. I thought it was one of the most exciting films I've seen in a long time. One of the best moments of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpected and brilliantly shot gorgeous places. Three characters demonstrate chemistry on the screen that permeates the entire film, making it so exciting. They are located on outstanding landscapes, seen by such an original look (the work of DOP is simply gorgeous), which makes you feel that you are opening them for the first time. The mood of the desert floods everywhere, and even the scenes shot on the streets of Los Angeles or San Francisco seem to be its natural extension. The story runs smoothly through all these wonderful conditions to bring you to a bitter-sweet finale, being the perfect climax for this perfect journey. Building the film itself is a master craft. Skillful use of innovative resources (such as frames that capture Danny’s memories in the film) will be comparable to those hand-made works that are so rare and so pleasant. The “blind spot” allows you to capture the essence of the desert, which leads you to a common understanding, where each of us can feel like a pioneer and a family.
