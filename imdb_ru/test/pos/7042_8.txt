When I was younger, this film was always broadcast on Friday evening in the summer on Channel 40 (it was years before Fox became a network and started programming). I always looked forward to it. I went to the grocery store with my parents and then sat down with a TV dinner in Swanson and Lady Lee Cola (the only time in the week I was allowed to drink Coke and enjoy. Of course, the script, as expected, was in the late 70s ). Little darlings), but this is a funny movie, and I loved Rudy and Tripper. Bill Murray starred in the film effortlessly, but he is charming. Gotta love Spaz and those taped glasses (before the nerd's revenge). Chris Mypic is in many ways the same character that he played in “My Bodyguard”, but he does it so well.
