The five teens are going to camp in the wild in Oregon, and despite the fact that the park ranger warns them, they soon realize that something is hiding in the wilderness while waiting for a strike. <br /> <br /> When it comes to old horror films, the only thing that continues to appear in every conversation is Friday the 13th, so I took it upon myself to find those good old horror films that are simply not comparable with Friday the 13th, ONLY before it happened to be among those I found, and it was really very impressive, it was not as boring as some of the things that you find today, it was very sharp from the point character development, since he had quite a few pleasant ones, and he has this very random pace, he is not in a hurry to get to Hack and Slash, he needs time to set the right mood and tone, and he is very atmospheric and creates some kind of deadly alarm, allowing you to always experience a feeling of fear know where it is or when it will trike. <br /> <br /> Where I live, this is certainly an underestimated stone simply because people have never heard of it or will not give it a chance, but I will say that it is not the fifteenth 13th robbery, these two concepts they donâ€™t even agree, but in my opinion, this is one of the most impressive slashers I've ever seen.
