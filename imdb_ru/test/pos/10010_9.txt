I first saw this movie at IFC. By the way, this is a great network for watching underground movies. I watched this movie and thought it would be pure drama and a storyline that does not stand up to scrutiny. But it was really worth seeing. The main character in such a rude form, and you do not want to see him refuse to help, but it does not matter that you just can not hate him. His dedication to the Beatles and John Lennon is a great metaphor for his life and helplessness that he feels. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the film is also great. Sometimes you feel that you can see what he sees, feel what he feels in some situations. This film leaves nothing to be desired, or does not like a loophole in the plot. NO loopholes (in my opinion). I have always been a fan of foreign films, especially now that films were being shot in America is very bad. I really like the foreign settings, because I feel that this can lead you on a journey, and sometimes understand another culture. This film has done all these things for me and more. Please watch this movie, and if you are new to foreign films, this is a great start.
