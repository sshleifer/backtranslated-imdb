This is a beautifully made film that challenges the future of all indigenous peoples, especially nomadic tribes. By focusing on the Saltmen of Tibet, the film moves at a pace that may cause inconvenience to some Western audiences. For some nations, life still continues at the same pace as it has for thousands of years. This film follows a group of fellow tribesmen in their annual two-month search for salt. Their tribe lives its life in the traditional way (slowly by modern standards) and always obeys many of its gods. This is a wonderful film that will save some of what, unfortunately, can become a story. It is worth spending time. Take your time when you see it.
