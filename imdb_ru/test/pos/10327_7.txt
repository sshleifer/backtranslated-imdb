This film was fried by the guys on MST3K, but in fact it is a neat and unpleasant piece of low-cost film noir. The plot is tight, the characters are believable (in the genre of "a good boy gets obsessed with a bad girl"), rhythmic, solid, the climax is well worked out, and the actors are supported by several excellent characters actors he is pretty creepy when playing the main character. The scenes between him and his father are pretty powerful, in a minimalist style. Of course, this is depressing, but that's the point. Good film.
