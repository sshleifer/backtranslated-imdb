This film surpasses the previous incarnation by a mile, raising everything to the next level. As always, the guys at JackAss are just incredible, and I personally laughed more at this theater than for a long time. Like the first JackAss, this is not so much a film as an eighty-minute series of stunts and jokes. This is pure circus entertainment, taken to the highest level. In fact, these guys are clowns who humiliate themselves for the sake of entertaining others. And this is great. Shenanigans are so low, outrageous, and often disgusting that they develop into a higher form of entertainment. <br /> <br /> You cannot rate this among other films in its class. And it shines. Go and enjoy this pure sight.
