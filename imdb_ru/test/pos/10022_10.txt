This short is one of the best of all time and is proof (like most of Charlie Chaplinâ€™s works) that sound and color are not requirements for quality work. In fact, this cartoon uses (and may have already appeared) some gags and devices that became standard in the animation in subsequent years, such as cartoons of celebrities (including the aforementioned Chaplin. Although the characters are silent, they "speak") with using balloons words, as in comics. Given that Felix started out in newspapers as a comic, this device is natural. The atmosphere and style of the short circuit fully harmonize with that of the comics, adding another dimension (in the literal and figurative sense) and makes this short delight to watch. It is worth spending time and effort to get. Most recommended.
