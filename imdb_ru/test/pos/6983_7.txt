In the future, a scattered group of people sleeping on board a commercial spacecraft is forced to improvise in order to survive when the spacecraft crashes on a distant, barren planet. They already have one problem in the fact that one of the passengers is an intense criminal Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel, in his first leading role); however, they are soon hunted by a strange kind of predator, which thrives in the dark, and a rare solar eclipse should soon occur. <br /> <br /> Although the script of this film is ultimately on the routine side, it acted decently and this is especially well done technically. Work with location, photography and design (production and design of creatures) is very impressive. This is far from the most original or stimulating science fiction / horrible picture ever made, but it still provides good entertainment. Diesel is especially good at penetrating its frightening nature. However, he is not fully predictable and gets a few points for having <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> a more politically correct ending than most of his types <br /> <br /> Filmed on a film set in the deserted Coober Pedy in Queensland, Australia. <br /> <br /> A kind of sequel continues. <br /> <br /> 7/10
