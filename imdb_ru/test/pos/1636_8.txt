Yes, I know that my title sucks. I could not come up with any other name. x] Ice is a brilliant episode of the first season. Very interesting idea and good acting. In my opinion, all these worms looked very creepy. I have never been a fan of insects, so all insect episodes are terrible for me. x] In any case, let's move on to the good and bad in this episode, <br /> <br /> The Good: a parasite. Cool! <br /> <br /> Scully finally trusts Mulder. Oh ... <33 It was a good idea to put another parasite in the ear. Although, if someone told me that they have to put this thing in my ear ... I think the whole cabin will be dead. <br /> <br /> Bad: How did the dog survive for so long? > <br /> How did Huffman not get these black spots? Or maybe she did it, but no one saw it ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a very good episode, especially for the first season. 8/10
