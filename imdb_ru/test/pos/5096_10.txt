"Chips" is an excellent combination of music, light comedy and drama with a perfect execution of a picture by Peter O'Toole and a light romantic auxiliary performance by Petula Clarke. O'Toole is able to show a shy, uncommunicative teacher who so much wants to be loved by his students and is able to express his love only when he married Catherine (Clark). She brings him the world of "How many flowers," and he has changed forever. He becomes Brookfield's favorite director as a result of the tragedy, but he knows that he could achieve his goal only because of Catherine’s love. All songs (except for the Music Hall number) are “mental songs” that emanate from the character’s emotions and thoughts, and the more you listen to them, the more beautiful they become - “Go around the world with me” and “You and me” O'Toole's best moment is the last speech he gives to students (this was the reason for the Oscar nomination.) As a teacher, we ask ourselves what the “book” training goes through, but, as Chips says, we taught them how to behave with each other, and this is really important. Perfectly shot, beautifully designed John Williams and one of the most exciting films about love and how it can change you. "I filled the world with love?" The boys sing their school song. At the end, Chips understands that he could do it - but only because Katherine was there
