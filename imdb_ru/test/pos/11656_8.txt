This film is a story about a Catholic nun who was an adviser to a convicted murderer on death row. The film tells about what she does as a nun, who has no productive role. She might have doubts about her real role. But in the end, she fulfills a role that only a nun could play, who has nothing but faith in Christ. There are a lot of films in America that describe convicted criminals or prisons. These scenes, especially the performance, are too different from Japan.
