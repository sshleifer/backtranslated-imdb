I was very lucky to see this film at the 2005 Melbourne International Film Festival just a few days ago. I have to admit that I am very partial to films that tell about human relationships, and especially about those that focus on the tragic side of life. I also love most of the Scandinavian cinematic proposals, often in the way the plot unfolds and the characters appear, there is a special deep quality. The creation of characters in this film is extraordinarily detailed and deep. And this is despite the fact that we are faced with a fairly large number of characters who have very specific personal situations and places in their community. The audience at the end of the show was very quiet and thoughtful. I still play some of these scenes in my memory, and I'm still amazed at their strength and significance.
