Here is one of the Jane Austen films, which seemed to me very amazing. I read the book first, then listened to it on a CD and was fascinated by how you can convince a young Victorian girl that she would marry the man she loved because of his lack of status or education. The joy of knowing that Anna is obviously reuniting with lost love. The fact that her godmother is trying to marry her to a useless cousin who lives only for money. Looking at the snobbery emanating from the upper classes, and how class differences can separate couples from following their hearts. Captain Wentworth is aware that he still loves Ann after seven years. He finally realized that Anna's love had been unchanged all this time, and that she would not allow her family to interfere in her true happiness and possible marriage with someone she truly loves.
