"Duckman" is a great show. I first saw him when I was 10 years old, and after school I rushed home and turned on Comedy Central. I saw a cartoon called "Duckman" and I loved it! This is such a fun and cool show. It is created by Klasky-Csupo, who are the great creators of cartoons. They animated some of my favorite shows, such as The Simpsons and Rugrats. <br /> <br /> I have seen many episodes of this show, and I think they are all very funny and cute. Actors voiced excellent work, voicing characters too. <br /> <br /> I would like Comedy Central to return this show along with Critic and Dilbert. <br /> <br /> But this is a great comedy series. Great job, Klasky-Csupo!
