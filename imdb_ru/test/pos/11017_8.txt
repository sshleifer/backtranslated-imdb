Niagra Niagra, of course, was not the best movie I saw. However, I cannot describe how the film made me feel while watching, and how I felt when it ended, as well as what I feel about it now. Very few films have such an impact on me. I like them or not. I look at Niagra Niagra as a work of art. We all see something in it, and it may remind us of something, or it may inspire fear or fun, etc. ... This film did not give me the best mood. In fact, it left me somehow empty. I think because the lives of these two people were so empty in many ways. They had no direction. Their only direction is to not have a direction. They had a lot of problems, and I think it was necessary to get away from what could not be a happy life. But on the way everything just got worse. A steady decline from where it started. It was sad, because it was so good, and I think that we all, most likely, saw someone in some situation that might somehow resemble the situation in which these people were. They could have a good life if they knew how. But it is clear that they did not know what to do. So they are like a tumbler somewhere that they have heard of. No real goal. They had no idea how to reach the goal. They did not know how to overcome the life that was predetermined to them. I felt bad, but could not stop watching the movie. Only good actors can make me feel that way about a film that I donâ€™t want someone to play a role. These two have done a great job to such an extent that you simply have not seen the action. I am very impressed and want to buy a movie when it appears on DVD. You know. It left me feeling like I left Los Vegas. But again this is in class. Not a very good movie, but worth it an hour or two on the right day. If you are a person who has problems, I would not advise you to watch it. This may depress you. It put me down, and I have no conditions in which these people were. JimmyJoeJetter
