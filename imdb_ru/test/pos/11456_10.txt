I love this young people trapped in the movie "House of Horrors". Not only because I am a big fan of Lynn Quigley-Jill Terashity, but also because sometimes it is very fun and scary. <br /> <br /> The special effects are amazing, especially Linnie's scene with lipstick and near the end, when almost everyone is dead and obsessed. <br /> <br /> Linnea and Jill expose a naked body, a lot of humor, a cool soundtrack, a large amount of body, etc. which has more blood, and in some scenes there is no assessed version.
