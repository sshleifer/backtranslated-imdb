I watched this film when it was released, and being really young and not too keen on cinema, it was one of the most exciting cinematic events that I have ever had, and it really left a mark on me. At first, I did not quite understand the story and probably could not establish the necessary correlations between the past and the present, since the film presents them to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Years after the first time I looked, I managed to watch it again, and it was a time when I fell in love with it. “The English Patient”, he touched me deeply, and for me he became the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Anthony Minghella made an absolutely stunning film, all the places are stunning, and with the help of his camera he manages to create incredible emotions inside you. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film’s music is such a big part of the entire emotional journey of the characters, and the film would not have been the same without it. <br /> <br /> But personally the best was the fragile performance that Ralph Fiennes gave to this masterpiece. He plays so well a man who slowly, but so deeply falls in love with Catherine Clifton, opens his heart and plunges into this forbidden affair. <br /> <br /> The most heartbreaking scene for me will always be the one where Kathryn’s pain is carried by Almashi to the Cave of Swimmers, and she wears a thimble that he bought for her. She says: “I always wore this. I have always loved you, ”and at this moment he begins to cry with the pain that flows from within him. <br /> <br /> Juliette Binoche is also great in her performance and really deserves an Oscar, which she won. <br /> <br /> In general, this film should be watched by anyone who claims to be a movie buff. of life.
