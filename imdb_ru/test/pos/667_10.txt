Anyone who has ever called this “bad taste” review is not so good ... it's so funny, brilliant and fantastic that you can watch it until your eyes become square! not to mention the rest of the work he did on the rest of the series ... everything is as good as the standards of Morris. if you think it is “terrible,” “unpleasant,” or “sick,” then I can only think of one thing to say to you: “go to hell. Thank you. it had to be said! I think that how many people complain was a complete joke ... I would like to thank all the people who actually did it: “don't you have anything better than to do your time? are you trying to prove thanks for reading my full review on this subject ... hooray
