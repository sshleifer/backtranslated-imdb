Sometimes reading user comments to IMDB makes me despair about this view. For those who reject the 2001 “Space Odyssey” as “boring,” they should not be interested in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of filmmaking. Finally, I understand why most Hollywood productions are so superficial and empty - they understand their audience. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, those who cannot appreciate Kubrick’s achievements still constitute a minority. Most viewers can see the intellect and pure virtuosity that went into the creation of this epic. This is a film that puts science in "science fiction," and its description of space travel and the future of mankind remains unsurpassed to this day. It was so far ahead of its time that humanity has not yet caught up. <br /> <br /> 2001 is, above all, a technical film. The reason he is slow and filled with trivialities is that the goal was to really imagine the future of technology (and the past, in reverent introductory scenes). The greatest strength of the film is in the details. Remember that when this film was shot, the man still has not reached the moon ... but here it is in 2001, and this is only the beginning of the journey. To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future, that after 35 years it’s still the best that we have, it’s impossible to believe - I still can’t understand how some of the pictures were taken. The only noticeable mistake of the film was the optimism with which he predicted the technological (and social) development of mankind. Unfortunately, 2001 was not like a 2001 film, not Kubrick’s. <br /> <br /> In addition to incredible special effects, camera work and scenery, Kubrick also provides the viewer with a lot of food for thinking about what it means to be human and where the human race is headed. Yes, the end is strange and difficult to understand, but such is the nature of the future. Kubrick and Clark set to the task, now the audience should continue. There is no neat resolution, there is no final stop, because then the audience can stop thinking after the final movie. I know that most viewers want this today, but Kubrick is not going to let us go so easily. <br /> <br /> I am glad to see that this film is in the top hundred IMDB films, and I would just like it to be even higher. Stanley Kubrick is one of the best filmmakers the world has ever known, and in 2001 he became his best achievement. 10/10
