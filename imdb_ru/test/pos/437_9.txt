Jean Renoir's dedication to Paris at the end of the 19th century is wonderful in many ways. Not only did it seem to have been photographed by Toulouse-Lautrec and Fly, it depicts geographic Paris; the streets, accessible only by stairs, the unpleasant end of fleeting popularity and the sexual opportunism of men with a product for sale in the uncompromising picture of show business, which contrasts sharply with the picture written by Hollywood. There is an obvious comparison with Lloyd Bacon's "42nd Street", which was made about 20 years ago, with Ruby Keeler as a dance sensation, with a new face from the sticks that came to New York to get into show business, which saves the show when the star fails - "You go there from the choir, but you have to go back STAR !!" “Julian Marsh” by Warner Baxter is a director who suffers for his art and is undervalued. Jean Gabin's “Danglars” continues to face genital politics, but when he talks about the show, he looks more like Knut Rockn than Julian Marsh. He is all about the game, except for his sharp things. He has a new profitable venture, wired up until his mistress envies a woman whom she recognizes as her next mistress. His prospects grow and fall with each new journey. <br /> <br /> Danglard takes Mistress 1 (Lola de Castro, played by Maria Felix), going on a dive, where she sees “Nini” (Francoise Arnoul) with her boyfriend and first lover, Paulo-baker discovers that she energetic dancer. He uses his charisma and the prospect of money to lure Nini to dance classes so she can go on stage. The prospect of money and fame enchants Nini, and she becomes Danglard's next mistress, as well as the capable student of Kankan, whom Danglard called the "French Cancan" to satisfy the current trend of the Anglophiles in dance. <br /> <br /> “42nd Street” and “French Cancan” is a tribute to show business - modern entertainment, which has its own iconography and its own vanity. "42nd st." around Julian Marsh, the great director of Broadway shows that he organizes with great personal energy and dubious sexual involvement. The underage male is a middle-aged fucking lumbago, who was replaced by Dick Powell, a handsome tenor with secret wealth that needs to be hidden. Danglars, on the other hand, passes from woman to woman, seducing them with the promise of glory, hooking them on with what should have been a very convincing gift. No one doubts that he is heterosexual and quite active. Postcoital scenes abound. <br /> <br /> A few days after seducing Nini from Paulo, he discovered Esther, the type of Piaf, and began to prepare her to work on the film's theme song, while he was playing her violin. This, of course, causes Nini's jealousy just as she causes Lola’s jealousy. (And, of course, Nini has already given up the privilege of being a queen!) The whole film is about how Danglard's sanctimonious love cost him money, and how even his restless excitement submits to his love for the show — how the audience demands devotion — and This powerful combination of phallic conviction and seductive glory makes Danglars a hero, claiming that a true show lover will never make as much profit as money. In the conclusion of the film, Danglard, bypassing lenders and jealous babies, approaches the new attraction, watching the incredible (and believe me, this is incredible) performance of cancan. "Have you ever thought about being on stage?" he asks, and the curtain falls. In the meantime, poor Julian is sitting on the fire escape of a theater and listening to how new Peggy Sawyer fans belittle his contribution to the success of the show. (I will not even go into the central line of 42nd Street: “Oh, Guy, it was GREAT of you!”) <br /> <br /> Moreover, I will not go into details you can see the legendary Parisian artists, including a brief vision of Piaf, as well as a vision of Paris, both urban and rural. Of course, there is a sample of styles that spawned Trenet and Aznavour. But these are memories of assertive and desirable masculinity, something unheard of in any Hollywood musical with which it can be compared, is a pleasant relief from the 30s-androgynous Hollywood musicals (including my beloved Fred Aster, not to mention Dick Powell), not to mention the fact that MGM unveiled in films such as "An American in Paris." All these fountains! We will keep a comparison of this turkey with "breakfast at Tiffany" and its deconstruction of the American male for another day. <br /> <br /> It is possible that in post-war France, Danglard was an encouraging vision. The hypermasculae meck, which could exist or not exist, is almost irrelevant. That he is a man, neither John Wayne nor Edward Everett Horton, is perhaps more goal oriented. That he is a man who loves ladies is never questioned. For example, I do not mind living my life in general. I wonder if Gabin was so lucky? <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this commentary, I wanted to talk about Baz Luhrmann and what Sinclair Lewis called Boloni. I have never gone so far. Baz Moulin Rouge ... well, Paris no longer places such things on the Seine.
