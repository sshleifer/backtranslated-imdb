Showtime is somewhere to the north of what some critics said, and a little south of what I expected a few months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro, united for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As in the case of “real” crimes or the police - and, for that matter, the plot - this is rather illogical, but the OU is a comedy. In addition, while the special effects, car chases, aerial photographs and the explosions of skyscrapers were present, but were not as important as in the Schwarzenegger film, I found it a bit tedious and overworked. The sensitivity of September 11th, for itself, all these pyro-techno-hypereffective things have become very old over the past few years. It seemed like a weak substitute for characterization, history, and exciting emotions. I hope that less of this in Showtime is an indicator of a trend in Hollywood. A downtrend is less using a stupid, less using an exploding building. <br /> <br /> Di Niro and Murphy are two of my favorites. Their presence on the screen and charisma - and even the depth of the character - have been a joy to contemplate over the years. It cannot be rejected here - they attract actors, and are interesting and attractive in this film. I can not understand it, but perhaps the explosions, the excessive effect and all this reduced the final product ??? Perhaps, or perhaps it was something else, or a combination of factors that give the impression that the film has not reached its highest potential. Anyway, “Showtime” was interesting — I would probably buy a DVD when it came out — but I had an atmosphere that, however, it was not what it could be. At least not everything I was hoping for. <br /> <br /> A very good movie, but not a very good movie. I gave him 8 out of 10.
