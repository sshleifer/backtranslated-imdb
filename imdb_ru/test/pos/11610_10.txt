I saw this piece of perfection :-) during the fantasy film festival in Berlin, and when I left the cinema, I felt that I was "stupefied"! I have seen a lot of films, but there are only a few that I would call ideal, like koyaanisqatsi or fighting club - subliminal cruelty is definitely one of them !!! half of the people left the show in Berlin, and I can absolutely understand them! This is not a film for "normal" people with dreams and illusions! a person who lives his dreams day after day, not wanting to see all the horror in our life and on our planet, will be very shocked by this film! if someone reads it now, who has seen s. and also thinks it's great: just contact me - until I met anyone who shared my opinion - that would be awesome !!! This film earns 10 points out of 10 !!! Finally, I really apologize for my bad English - I am not a learned person !!! (und das ist Ash Gut so * g *)
