when I know that Walter will never decorate another set. I was in my thirties when I first saw this sweet, sweet and shameless romantic film. I liked him from the first scene and right up to the end. Art Carney was his usual stupid self; Glenda matched Walter step by step with his wits, and Richard Benjamin delivered the sarcastic voice of reason, which he does so well. Along the way there were many actors that we all recognize, making them their usual brilliance. There are several lines in the film that SO and I have used for many years, but I will not say anything about them here. I am pretty sure that you will understand which two I am talking about. Just take this movie. Make popcorn, take your squeeze (if it's as juicy as mine, for which I am grateful to him) and enjoy this outstanding romantic comedy of the 70s. You will not be disappointed. However, I have a feeling that I am preaching here, because everyone who loves Walter will already be its owner. I am very glad that he finally came out on DVD.
