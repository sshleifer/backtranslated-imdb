Most likely, this is the best picture that not many will see. It represented a culture in a truly non-coulivable form. You need to see everyone who loves indie, and those who do not. I think this film will draw more attention to the indie scene. The game was top notch! Alice's character was portrayed so well. With perfect awkwardness. This film should be brought to the mainstream! I think this will do phenomenally! ALICE is the most realistic look at an element of our culture that I have seen since the days of GO ASK ALICE. A look that is not touched by the Hollywood hand. Such films show young people that these things are not adorable, but real and convincing. If you liked the pieces of April, you will like this one!
