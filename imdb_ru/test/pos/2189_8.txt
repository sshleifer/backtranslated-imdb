Well, I'm not the biggest fan of Sondheim in the world, so although I have an acting album and I listened to it several times, I have never actually seen this show performed, and I have not seen the version of the Tim Burton movie either. I felt I wanted to see something more true before I saw Burton and give him a chance just like a movie. This version is not a film at all, it is a filmed performance with the participation of some of the original actors, including, first of all, the role of Angela Lansbury in the role of Nellie Lovett. This is one of those performances that is like a conductor in the heart of the magic of Broadway and the theater itself. She must have had so much fun with this role. Sweeney Todd himself plays not Lena Kariu, who did it initially, but George Hearn. Hearn does a fantastic job; his voice is not as good as Kariu’s, but he seems to play him a little wider. <br /> <br /> The only problem I encountered was with the character Joanna played by Betsy Joslin, and to some extent her lover Anthony in the role of Chris Grendanda. Joslin’s voice cannot stand high notes, but I wasn’t completely sure if this could be the main reason, since I’m not very familiar with this piece. More importantly, I'm not sure that the story of Sweeney Todd really weighs enough to bear some music, but, fortunately, the creators do not take it all too seriously. Like a lark and a little comedy in the spirit of “The Great Guinol”, it's pretty nice. I do not feel that this is such a significant work as "Company" and "Into the Woods" or some of his other shows. Some of the music is quite impressive, but in other places it seems to exist in the world outside the show. <br /> <br /> I’m not going to talk much about it here because it’s a movie website and it’s really not a movie, but just a play shot on film. There were maybe 3 or 4 scenes in which they moved the camera, but that was all. People will want to see it because it retains Lansbury’s legendary view, which deserves its legendary status, because it’s a fun and insightful show. George Hearn can also be proud of his version of Sweeney. It would be a good movie to show children over 5 years old or so, to interest them in musicals, because blood and cannibalism will really surprise them. The kind of performance, shot with such skill and truthfulness, makes me wish that more such efforts have been made with the musical theater over the years, because I prefer the shows from the 20s to the 50s to these later eras. Sweeney Todd is an exceptional show of his era, however, many miles taller than A.L. Webber.
