This is a very sensitive image of life with unfulfilled or limited desires. What to do with the desire in the culture and society with strict rules? One husband finds a way out with an immigrant - since immigrants do not belong or are not accepted, they do not need to comply and clog their desires. Another husband seeks consolation in spirituality and tries to turn his desire into nothing. It fails - of course - and it breaks down in the last scene for several reasons. Sita still made sure that he found this moment to inform him that he was not responsible for her deviation from her blocked desires. His mother still could not find the strength to destroy his myth. She sees him as a child who glorifies herself in her control of lust, but should she give him the opportunity to finally grow up? Both wives find the courage and unity due to the general rejection of her husband. <br /> <br /> But the last act of refusal was committed by the grandmother — she could not escape her rusty thinking to accept Sita’s desire. A decade or more to receive help was not enough to break the shackles of her culture. <br /> <br /> It seems that the home assistant was the easiest way to fulfill his desires — as he is damned by his culture anyway — to be at the bottom of the hierarchy. Since in any case there is no respect and expectation, you can taste the taste of sin just as well.
