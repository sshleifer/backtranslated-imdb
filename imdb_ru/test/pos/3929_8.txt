Although HOUSE OF WAX is never mistaken for Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or HALLOWEEN, it does try and can ultimately be a worthy addition to creating quality horror films. There is enough tension and enough hidden blood to please today's young audience, as well as enough obvious blood to please some of the purists of yesterday. Overall, this is a pretty well-made film that should sound good on DVD. <br /> <br /> Six children on their way to a football match find themselves in a difficult situation, similar to the situation of DELIVERANCE, and what actually happens seems to have been pulled out of the discarded Deilverance, and it seems tease the group. In the end, the group must disintegrate, and half of them head to a deserted city to get spare parts for cars. The other half of the group remains in camp, and this creates the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> The House of Wax has many strengths. First, it is a very pleasant composition. Paris Hilton is good in her role, but she is far from the focus. Chad Michael Murray, Elizabeth Cuthbert and Brian Van Holt are three very charismatic actors, and their presence in the film adds some brilliance, some trust and some talent. I have never heard of Chad Michael Murray, only that he was a teenager heartthrob. But he has a presence to him. He fills the intangible for him, which seems to translate into his performance. He is instantly pleasant and has a strong character trait. I liked his performance much more than I thought, and when he was on the screen, the film was shown. <br /> <br /> Now the question arises: "Is this film worthy of a horror film?" And the answer to this is a resounding YES. As I mentioned above, this is not the same class as NIGHT ON ELM street, or LAST HOUSE ON LEFT, or even RING, but this is relatively intense, quite visual, and there are some very inventive scenes of death. This is not the WAX ​​HOUSE that your parents told you about. Vincent Price is nowhere to be seen, and when you start to see cut off fingers and hot wax covering comatose bodies, you realize that this film is slightly on the edge. <br /> <br /> I would like to see the uncut Director X rated version. I bet there is one somewhere that would be much more brutal than this one. Anyway, this is a very good entry into the horror genre, and it is head and shoulders above weak films such as “I KNOW YOU ARE THE LAST SUMMER AND DARK WATER”, as well as several others. It is definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 8/10
