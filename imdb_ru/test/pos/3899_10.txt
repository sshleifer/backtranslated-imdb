William H. Macy is amazing in this Alfred Hitchcock film. Macy plays the role of a film critic who accidentally kills one of her girlfriends. The characters that follow are funny. James Cromwell superbly acts as a blackmail private detective. As always, Macy is incredibly funny and gives a phenomenal view. Watch this movie when it's on tv. and check out your video stores, because this is the one you do not want to miss.
