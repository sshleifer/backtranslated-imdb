This film is one of the few historical documents that demonstrate the talents of many black singers, actors, actresses and dancers. Many who are no longer with us. Those that we have blessed to be able to enjoy today in 1999, thanks to this film, allow us to recognize the talents that existed then. That is why those people who still live today and those who died are icons of superstars. Because of the history of education in music, drama, filming, design, singing, etc., This film belongs only to the people of this country. <br /> <br /> I recently watched this movie. The sound was superb! The film seemed to be finished, the color and clarity were paid, but it was good, considering how many years this film was without any repair of personnel. I agree with all previous positive reviews. I have no negative opinions. <br /> <br /> I would like to make only one request. Please, to whom this is my business, please make this film available so that everyone has this historical experience.
