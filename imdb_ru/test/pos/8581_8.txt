I have already watched this movie twice, and I am very impressed with it. <br /> <br /> Conversations between Them and her mother, as well as with Them and Matthew are very touching. The Nigerian community is shown very truthfully and colorfully, as usual. <br /> <br /> Although some things could be done with a slightly more detailed explanation; if we knew why Matthew was in the south of France, first of all, the scenes when Matthew was found in his car would be more understandable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Optimum Releasing has a website with detailed production notes. This will help to better understand such scenes. <br /> <br /> I would like to see it again, but, unfortunately, it was released in limited edition in London and is no longer available for viewing. I hope that the video release will get it for a larger audience, because the film deserves it.
