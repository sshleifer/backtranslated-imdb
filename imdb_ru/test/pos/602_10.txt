Jim Henson as Kermit, Dr.Teeth, Rowlf and Waldorf. <br /> <br /> Frank Oz as Fozzy, Piggy and Animals. <br /> <br /> Jerry Nelson as Floyd Pepper, Robin Frog, Lew Zeland and Crazy Harry. <br /> <br /> Richard Hunt in the role of Janice, Statler, Glass and Scooter. <br /> <br /> Dave Goelz as Gonzo, Dr. Hannidwe and Zut. <br /> <br /> Charles Durning and Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> Cameos of Steve Martin, Carol Kane, Orson Welles, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor and others. <br /> <br /> This is the first Muppet film from a billion others that came out, as well as the best, of course! This concerns the Kermit frog, which sets off on a Hollywood journey and meets other characters along the way. In this film, besides the fact that he is already good, there are excellent songs performed by the Muppets, including “Rainbow Communication”, “Can you imagine it?”, “Moving Forward” and others. This film, unlike other Muppet films, has a strong sentimental value. This is such a good movie. It is also noted that this is a lot of cameos with Steve Martin, Mel Brooks and a dozen others. <br /> <br /> My rating is a plus. 109 minutes G rating.
