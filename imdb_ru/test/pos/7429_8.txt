A young girl becomes a wartime Marine buddy, and when he arrives at the end of the war, expecting someone a little more “affordable”, comic complications appear. Everything ultimately works well, but not before all the participants thoroughly chew the landscape. Errol Flynn's deadly impression of Humphrey Bogart from Casablanca is a highlight, as well as various issues of his own lousy image (the scene of "jumping" in the kitchen with Forrest Tucker is a riot) head and barrel over the goal line. He demonstrates a comic flair, more fully manifested twenty years later in F-Troop, and lends vitality and energy that Flynn repeatedly plays to raise his own performance. Eleonora Parker does an excellent job with the woman being pursued, and little Patty Brady fascinates Tucker as a pen-pal. A wonderful, easy comedy “Returning Home” in a sophisticated setting that children and romantics of all ages should find interesting.
