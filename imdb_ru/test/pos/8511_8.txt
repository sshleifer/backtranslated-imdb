Although Never Say Never (NSNA) has a weak sound track, it is far superior to its competitors at the same time as Octopussy. “Never Say Never” is an updated and improved version of Thunderball (Connery's least popular film). NSNA is rich in intelligent dialogue, wit, intelligence, sexual attractiveness and one of the best and most compelling bad guys in the entire Bond series. In addition, NSNA has a very talented young and beautiful Kim Basinger. British comedy fans also recognize the actor (Atwood), known as "Mr. Bean." I would not trade any of Moore's paintings for this one. However, earlier Connery / Bond efforts (with the exception of the Thunderball) are superior. <br /> <br />
