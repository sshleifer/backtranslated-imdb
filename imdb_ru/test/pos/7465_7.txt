This film begins a little slowly, but quickly turns into comedic equipment. Each of the three “teenage girls” offers their own believable, distinctive, assertive and entertaining personalities. I especially liked the dialogue and interaction between Keith and Lisa. If you look beyond the surface of the “action” that takes place, Keith’s character treated Lisa’s “flourishing” with tenderness and attention. The comic development that followed was also, in my opinion, experienced. David Boreanaz perfectly plays the role of an adult man who clearly gets into more trouble than he can handle. The dialogue was sharp, quick and beautiful. The director and screenwriter of this film clearly showed that not one of the main characters achieved moral superiority after all the machinations they had drawn out. Although the film seems light on the surface, it reflects all the gray areas of adulthood, human emotions and desires.
