Always loved "DOA", 1950, in which Edmond O'Brien starred and was very interested in this film. Dennis Quaid, (Dexter Cornell), was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out that she had an affair with one of his students. Dexter is associated with Meg Ryan (Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time fell in love with him very much and eventually got one night stand and in a sense loved him very much. Dexter finds out that he got a drink that was poor in content and would have caused him a lot of health problems! If you love Dennis Quaid and love Meg Ryan, you will love this film, Meg did an excellent job and kept this picture worth seeing!
