This film, made by NFBC, was made in honor of the dynasty of Montreal in the years of the 50s, 60s and 70s. My 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987, and also in honor of my return from a serious face injury in 1986. I was a fan of Canadians for 29 of 30 years of my life. on a scale of 1-10, I give this film 117. All hockey fans should see this, since I hope that it will be located in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto and shown at the Bell Center in Montreal or here in Edmonton in Rexalle. A place. Watch this movie with your family, this is a great movie. I also recommend the book in French and English. Go Habs Go.
