I love this show I hate it when it reaches the season finale, because it seems like forever, until the season starts again !! I watched this show from the time of his pilot, then all the way from where Rusty starts college, and see Casey, his sister, until he meets Dana. Besides, I'm so glad that Cappie and Casey finally came back together, which drove me crazy !!! As for Evan and Rebecca, I hope that they will come back together, and it seems that they will be in the final. I just looked at the main part of the cast, and I'm so shocked that Casey Cartwright (Spencer Grammar) is the daughter of Kelsey Grammar !!! it just surprises me a lot, and another thing that causes a huge shocker is that she was born the same year that I was and that she was born on my younger brother's birthday with my year and I watched all the time without a clue !!
