I always knew that this day would come. We all knew. There is so much oil in the ground, and one day we will end. But shouldn't there be enough coal to use instead? And wind power, or something. Things for future generations to worry about. <br /> <br /> Then this documentary hit me in the eyes. Oil makes fertilizer, which is the reason that for the first time in world history almost no one lives on farms. When there is an inevitable shortage of oil, a lot - air travel, lots of medicine, plastics, life in the suburbs - will become impossible. But the craziest idea from the documentary is this: oil gives us so much energy with so little effort that without this our life has to change. Even if substitutes and conservation are implemented immediately, at best they will smooth out our landing in the strange post-oil world, which (documentary statements) can begin NOW. <br /> <br /> Despite its grim message, the documentary is often very interesting. It contains incredible historical images (sober images of dark urban factories and funny fun things of the 1950s) that remind us of why we moved to the suburbs in the first place. It also gives hope that the ongoing large-scale efforts can both facilitate our transition from oil and make the world a better place. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about a documentary is that it doesn’t waste time solving the mystery of why we find it now. How can this be a big emergency all of a sudden? In the 1970s, we knew that we had to prepare for the world after oil, and we began to prepare for research in the field of alternative energy and small cars. If our inability to fulfill the initiatives of President Jimmy Carter 25 years ago doomed us to a hard landing in the world after oil, why didn’t anyone shout about it on soap boxes? <br /> <br /> In the end I found the documentary very convincing; and it left me with a terrible cold when they pulled me out of a very beautiful dream. This should be viewed for anyone who is not afraid to meet a very likely near future, with which we still have time to do something. <br /> <br /> Charles
