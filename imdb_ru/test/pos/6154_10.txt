This is a film that finally pushed me to register with IMDb so that I can vote (and comment). I just recently appreciated well-made war films, and this is one of the most thoughtful films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> “Awesome” is a word that comes to my mind when I think of this viewing experience. My husband and I watched this movie last night for the first time. It moves gently, but at the same time exciting (not a contradiction). This story in the hands of Hollywood could be just another tricky, intense action, a waste of time on Top Gun. <br /> <br /> The two main actors playing František and Karel played surprisingly well with each other; and Christoph Hadek is a very cute boy who does not seem to exaggerate and does not use this fact. From the point of view of acting skills and appearance of Khadek, my husband said (mockingly): “Well, he is not Tom Cruise.” I replied: "Thank God!" If you appreciate a beautiful and discreet game, look at this.
