Well ... so, by the 15th minute of the film, there is still no dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film came to me in a soft bag from under Down Under, with Sharpie encrypted information on the front panel. I am a programmer from the North American festival, and MOD LOVE was sent to me by our chef as a potential starter on the eve of the Moscow / Karlovy Vary interface. <br /> <br /> Immediately I thought that “this film is not for us” (without dialogue for 15 minutes ??), but I still continued to watch. Well, well, well. He built and built, and built, and halfway through I was involved in this film, because, like when you go to the zoo, at first you are silent, but by the time you get to some dangerous snakes, you are completely “there ". <br /> <br /> This film has a danger that is not at all similar to the highly promoted WolF Creek, but because it is completely “different” in all respects, and it seems that the Net is composed of all the fantasies of most independent beginners those. - gloomy weather, intrigue with red necks, strange splices, eerie music and plot, which, although imperfect and simple, has something in common with one of the “great Australian films”, for example, “Cars that ate Paris”, written Vier. But MODERN LOVE is actually not a very Australian film in terms of rebellion and playful self-deprecation that permeates many films of this country. He works in a more nightmarish kingdom from the very beginning. No cell phones, no brand names, no i-pods, no tough urban melancholy for the middle / class - just a dude married to a pretty beauty, an old Volvo and a little boy (son) who has strange teeth and chatter around. Oh, and it is located in a quaint coastal village where people look a bit "wrong". Photographer Nick Matthews (2:37) and the music of Tom Huzenroeder (Ten Canoes) MOD LUV succeeds where there are many Aust. films fail - that is, it rises irrespective of the "abandoned" country from which it comes out. Instead, he revels in a twisted but interesting riddle that the film itself cannot solve - and this is the weak link ... what does this film have to do with "Modern Love" ???? The final moments of the film seem to give an answer, or at least hints at one ... and when I sat, drank coffee and then ate my Hershey, all I could guess was that the director of this film, Alex Frain, would very fun with that. /
