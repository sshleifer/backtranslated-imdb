The scale of the Stalingrad tragedy is briefly presented in the final note of the film: â€œIn the Battle of Stalingrad more than one million people were killed in battle, frozen or starved to death: Russians, Romanians, Italians, Hungarians, Germans, Austrians. Of the 260,000 surrounded fighters of the 6th Army, 91,000 were captured, of whom only 6,000 returned to their homeland years later. <br /> <br /> History does not tell that Field Marshall Paulus, who surrendered, did not share all the difficulties associated with capturing his people. He had a special regime as the most senior prisoner taken by the Soviet army. When, during his presence at the Nuremberg trials, he was asked about the fate of 91,000 prisoners, he announced that everything was in order with them. He was released after the war and died in East Germany. <br /> <br /> The film presents only the first part of the tragedy - the real Stalingrad battle. However, apparently, the fate of the prison 91 000 Nera should not be forgotten.
