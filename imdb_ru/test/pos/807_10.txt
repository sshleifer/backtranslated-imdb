Excellent work around, especially the actress who played the wife Gerda (Claire Price), and also, of course, David Suchet. I actually found out who the unit is, but this is irrelevant. The end, which I will not disclose (someone describes it on the board in response to someone's question, if you are interested). I found really sad. Despite Agatha Christieâ€™s reputation for writing cardboard characters, I thought they were really well thought out. <br /> <br /> The story was good, and I liked to see Sarah Miles as Lucy and Edward Hardwick (son of Cedric, whom I believe, except that famous Dr. Watson.), as her husband.
