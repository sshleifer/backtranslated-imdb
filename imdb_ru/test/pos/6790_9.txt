First, let me say that I find films such as Shawshank Escape and The Green Mile, and most of Spielberg are absolutely terrible and stomach-inducing. Despite the fact that National Velvet on the surface, it would seem, belong to the same genre and have something that should be tedious, I got great pleasure from it, laughing and roaring throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The premise of the plot is a young girl with an unknown horse from a small village entering the Great National is definitely as implausible as possible, but this is the only thing you have to accept to work as a fairy tale or allegory. Characters have depth and grow throughout history. Ann Revere gives an absolutely amazing performance as one of the wisest women ever depicted in an American film. Her communication with the kindhearted Donald Crisp is funny and sweet. While Liz Taylor tries his best to be even more attractive than Margaret O'Brien (she succeeds), her passion and love for her horse shine on her face. Mickey Rooney demonstrates the magnificent nuances of the coach. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie. Some situations and scenes are slightly banal and outdated (for example, children's antics, Rooney scenes on the track and in the pub), but it doesnâ€™t matter. The plot remains true to the characters and leaves a little unsaid. We have no unnatural, overly dramatic and preaching moments - sometimes more means less. The final scene is an excellent example of this - the emotional dialogue is left to the viewer to fill. <br /> <br /> Strong understated views, rounded characters, meaningful dialogue, intelligent and internally consistent plot. We believe in the characters and are touched by their story. Yes, they just do not make them so ...
