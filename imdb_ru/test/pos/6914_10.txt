This is an assumption. This film could inspire Paramount Pictures to the film “The Core”. Both films have something in common. The only improvement for Inferno is the best cast. The cast of Inferno is still good though. Great movie 8 out of 10. It's worth seeing. In this film, it is true that heat waves are real. Another truth - interruptions in the supply of heat. Where I live, I heard transformers blow. Restlessness from the heat is possible because people who want to cool down can become noisy. There is a lot of teamwork in this movie. Again this movie is worth seeing. The film has a good cast. There are no slow spots in the film.
