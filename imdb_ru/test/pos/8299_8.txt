The stormy David Innes (the solid Doug McClure) and the cunning Dr. Abner Perry (delightfully dot Peter Cushing) make their way into the core of the earth in his car of graceful moles. The duet opens the ancient prehistoric world inhabited by dangerous giant animals and people whom evil telepathic pterodactylists use as food and as slaves. Directed by Kevin Conner, working on the stupidly stupid script of Milton Subotsky, he maintains a constant vigorous pace everywhere and treats the extremely stupid premise with surprising seriousness, thereby giving this picture some kind of awkwardly serious quality that is equally amusing and attractive. Attractive hockey (not really) special effects are pretty (unintentionally) funny. The cheesy variety of creatures at a reduced price, in particular, are positively relegated to the background: rude guys in obvious cheesy rubber suits, pterodactyls, equally agitated wild monkey monkeys, and a fun, ridiculous fire-breathing frog that blows very well. One highlight occurs when McClure mixes it with a thick and clumsy giant reptile. Another priceless scene depicts a dinosaur clutching a doll in slobbering jaws. In addition, we also get some strong fist fights and an exciting rebellion of climacteric slaves. It’s a real pleasure to see Cushing happily playing in a rare, broad comedy part and becoming the unlikely but enthusiastic action movie hero in the last third of the film. Eternally juicy Carolyn Munro looks very appetizing, like the charming Princess Dia, plus there are excellent supporting turns of Sai Grant in the role of a gallant warrior Ra and Sean Lynch in the form of the treacherous coward Hodge. Mike Vickers’s neatly varied scores alternate between gay orchestral music and a stinking, buzzing synthesizer. Alan Hume’s clear cinematography adds a glossy shine to contagiously meaningless hearings. Full march riot.
