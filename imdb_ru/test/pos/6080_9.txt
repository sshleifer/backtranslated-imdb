I can never understand whether this is the “Art soap opera” by Artiest or “The most soapy movie art”. No matter, John Power's cinematic picture is absolutely adorable. Roman Ondaye is not reduced, but this time elevated to the cinema. If there is a mistake, it’s in the original novel, and not in Anthony Minghella’s beautiful film. Anyone with problems with his length almost certainly did not read the book and probably cannot read. I do not like to repeat adjectives, but admiration serves a purpose. <br /> <br /> In addition to the storyline, the players are superb. But in the end, the Australian sense of light and shadow will prevail. Like some anti-Polish Dutch masters, Seal uses a flash of light where Van Raine would use a shadow. You could cry about such great cinema.
