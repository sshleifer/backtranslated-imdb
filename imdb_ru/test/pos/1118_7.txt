Walter Mattau can always improve a mediocre film, and this film proves it. He turns into a very realistic performance as a small equestrian trainer and a single father, without taking up the role of sugar coating. <br /> <br /> He can be, in turn, carefree and insane, and then with the iron hands of his boys, and we can see the same dichotomy in his approach to training a horse (we see that he does not want so that his young promising race horse overwhelms and suffers in small races, but it looks like he is ready to risk his life when he enters at a great time). <br /> <br /> This is just one of Mattau's great speeches, and I highly recommend it.
