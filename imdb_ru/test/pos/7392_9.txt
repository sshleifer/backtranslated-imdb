I think this movie is different from most movies that I've seen. In a sense, it was exciting, and whatever others say, I say, I was surprised by the final decision. Of course, did not expect this! Although it is sad, it is worth seeing .. I can not come up with a single film that would be so! The actors knew what they were doing. If you say this movie sucks, you probably say what most people say. But if someone says that this film is normal, I absolutely disagree. And Norman Reedus should be more visible. <br /> <br /> I may be a freak, but I really liked it. It was a mess, but who cares? I'm tired of boring and ordinary movies.
