One of Alfred Hitchcock’s three greatest films, along with Psycho and 39 Steps, Strangers on a Train, is as uncontrollable as the merry-go-round in Metcalf, and almost as deadly. This is a movie that you watch so merrily, you cannot even feel guilty about it until you have time to take a breath. <br /> <br /> Chief tennis amateur athlete Guy Haynes (Farley Granger) meets an extraordinarily strange stranger named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on the train. Thanks to the pages of gossip, Bruno knows all about Guy’s problems with his naughty wife Miriam and quite merrily offers each other a service: Bruno will kill Miriam, and Guy will kill Father Bruno, who wants to put Bruno in the institution, the Guy laughs off, but Bruno is not joking because Guy understands that he is in danger. <br /> <br /> This is a great prerequisite for the murder story, and Hitchcock gives “Strangers on the train” a run for everyone. his value, with the help of Walker, is arguably the best work in any Hitchcock film, including Anthony Perkins in Psycho. While Perkins makes his mark, playing against the grain, Walker, like Anthony, feels like home, either smearing the old women at a chic dinner, or strangling a young woman in an amusement park. <br /> <br /> What moves Bruno? Many commentators suggest that his apparent homosexuality is a match in a nice guy. Yes, Bruno lights the old gay gift, but Guy seems happy enough after the love has been restored with his socialite Ann Morton (Ruth Roman). Bruno's interest in Guy can just as easily cause envy of the fact that someone makes a mark on the world while he lives at home, and allows his mother to cut his nails. <br /> <br /> “Oh, I certainly admire people who do things,” Bruno purrs like a cat looking at a mouse. "You know, it must be very exciting, to be so important." <br /> <br /> Later, Bruno calls himself an “ass”, reasonably accurate, with the exception of our interest in him, even when he ruins Guy’s life. with his suicidal interference. This is the ultimate story of a perverted loser. There is a sense of integrity about Bruno, in his stubborn devotion, who commands our respect and that Hitchcock plays so brilliantly. When Bruno sails off the stage of his big crime, am I the only sick person in this world who is really happy for him? I think not, but Hitchcock keeps the story on the right enough path so that we can understand how low we fell. We do not want Bruno to win, but we enjoy his elan when he tries. <br /> <br /> Everything else is so perfect, or at least close enough, to make every shot unforgettable. Hitchcock always ran at least 2-3 good set sequences for the film; here you get them in the amusement park alone. (“20 Big Show,” says the neon side of the entrance, and they don’t joke.) Scenario, camera work, exciting tennis match, Ruth Roman’s stunning figure, is too great for one movie to accommodate. Even Granger does his youthful work here with more believability than Gregory Peck ever did. <br /> <br /> You can call it a clinic in filmmaking, but the “clinic” sounds too boring. “Strangers on the train” is a good unpleasant fun, all over, leaving you with a graceful sting in the tail, when you realize that you have been rooting for a stranger all the time. Gosh, I'll take this trip again in a second!
