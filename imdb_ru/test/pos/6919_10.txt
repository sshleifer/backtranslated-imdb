First, what do some of you think? This is the best film I have seen in recent years! <br /> <br /> Secondly, I donâ€™t think of him as a British film, as it was filmed in Dublin, mostly Irish actors in it - Moran, Gambon, Aisling O Sullivan (Rita), Deirdre O ' Kane, etc. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, I thought Moran was excellent. He was fun funny. Mikal Kane seemed only to understand the context of Moran. Every character he has acquired has been improved. <br /> <br /> Abigail Iversen, I think, was better than any other child actor I saw. She was believable as an intelligent child, and also as a child and an adult (yes, I know, it sounds weird, but hey ...). Even she managed to overshadow Kane. <br /> <br /> Iversen and Moran did a great job together and were very funny on the preparatory stage. <br /> <br /> Barreler (Gambon) was very funny in his incompetence.
