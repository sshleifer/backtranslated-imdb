During World War II, a severely burned amnestic, known only as the “English patient,” was found in the African desert and taken to Italy, where he joins a convoy of medical and other troops in an abandoned monastery. Among them is Hana (Juliette Binoche), a Canadian nurse, whose lovers usually meet with unpleasant goals; Kip (Navin Andrews) and Hardy (Kevin Waitley), two experts on explosives who are looking for bombs in the monastery; and David Caravaggio (Willem Defoe), a Canadian soldier of fortune, who knows the identity of an English patient and has an account to pay. <br /> <br /> Through the memories we learn the story of the Patient: he is Lazo Almasi (Ralph Fiennes), a Hungarian researcher who in the late 30s along with a group of British cartographers, including Jeffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) and his wife Catherine (Kristen Scott-Thomas), in the desert mapping of North Africa. After Clifton left them in government affairs, Catherine and Clifton fell in love with each other in the wilderness, which led to a novel that naturally had a less happy ending. <br /> <br /> If someone can overlook the illogical parts of the storyline (for example, why is a patient found in Africa sent to what is essentially the front line of the war in Italy?), then you can evaluate the "English Patient" as a return to David Lin's clever, multilayered, broad epics in the 60s. Much more than the recent Titanic or other epic romances, this film resembles Doctor Zhivago and Gone With the Wind - an epic love story against a huge historical background. You should not expect a war movie, although there are some striking (if too brief) scenes of violence that stand out more than romantic passages, as is usually the case (interrogation by Caravaggio by a sadistic SS officer (Jürgen Prochnov)) in particular). <br /> <br /> The film is very ambiguous, in almost everything. The central question of the film: how far are you ready to go for the sake of love? How quickly the critics of the film notice, at first glance, Almashi is a character, not very cute - he has an affair with a married woman, and he betrays his country, giving maps and intelligence to the Germans, which leads to the death of his friend Madox (Julian Wadham) and torture Caravaggio, and actually killing the British soldier who once arrested him. The fact that Almashi is in many ways prejudicial is a kind of point of view - he is in love with Katherine and narrowly looks at the world from the point of view of his love that loyalty to the country (or anything else in this regard) is secondary; as Almasi says, he hates "Ownership. Being Owned." These two are involved in a rather bold love affair (shocked by hundreds of people at the Christmas party), and it is clear that Catherine is more drawn to the mysterious, exciting Almashi than to the relatively boring Jeffrey. <br /> <br /> The plot of 1944 is somewhat wobbly and seems superfluous; the romance between Kip and Hannah is never completely believable, and I feel that the film could have done without it. But these episodes add an interesting texture to the mystery and complexity of the film, so I will not complain too much. <br /> <br /> As in the above-mentioned epics, the film is able to convey time and place through simple devices, such as crowd scenes, strategically placed posters and military presence. We do not need to dwell on the fact that in Cairo, 1938, but it is useful to know. Anthony Minghella’s handbook and cinematography in the John Power desert are absolutely magnificent; sand dunes, sandstorms and desert caves are captured in the smallest detail. Gabriel Yared’s account is ghostly and atmospheric. <br /> <br /> The game as a whole is solid. Fiennes gives a very multi-level view as a mysterious, complex and haunted character. The difference between the Almas of 1938 and 1944 is remarkable; one is exciting and somewhat carefree, the other is frequented and meditating. Kirsten Scott Thomas is effective in the role of Catherine, a female explorer looking for adventure, and Colin Firth gives one of his best achievements in the role of Jeffrey, who realizes early that he is not a rival for the exciting Almásy. Willem Defoe perfectly copes with the role of Caravaggio, running, hunting a thief, who became a spy, moved by revenge. Jürgen Prochnow gives a presentation reminiscent of José Ferrere in “Lawrence of Arabia” (and a similar character too): very short, but more memorable than some of the main characters. Some of the actors in 1944 are unremarkable: Juliette Binochett is not special, and Navin Andrews is good, but unremarkable. Kevin Waitley, as Kip's ill-fated partner, does everything he can with a rather small role. <br /> <br /> “The English patient” is not a perfect film, it is not a perfect film, but targeted attacks against it. film public does not deserve at all. Maybe this is a demonstration of how the sensitivity of the film has changed since the era of Leans and Kubricks, or maybe people were expecting something simple to understand. Complicated by fault, brilliantly directed and shot, “The English Patient” is a wonderful modern epic. <br /> <br /> 8/10
