This is a unique film, as it gives us the only chance to see the young Noel Trus in all his ironic glory. Because he seems so reticent and detached, he is ideally suited for the role of an unloved guy who actually uses everyone around him. However, in the deadly serious (not pun intended) last act, when Trus must act as a Flying Dutchman, he is much less comfortable. <br /> <br /> But his path with an epigram is incomparable, and Hecht and MacArthur gave him a few precious stones (MacArthur, the truth is, he was the wit of the couple). <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully lit by the great Lee Garmz, but has a slight camera movement, with the exception of a sequence of storms. Hecht and MacArthurus took care of one thing - to bring the dialogue to the screen. (NOTE: H & M has “blink and miss you” episodes like homeless people on stage with flophaus). <br /> <br /> The most famous support player is the one and only Alexander Woolcott, notorious on Broadway. A reviewer and close friend of MacArthur and Trus, who appears to be one of the craziest authors, always waited at the receiving office of the publisher Coward. <br /> <br /> It is curious that Woolcott will agree to make a film that the Algonquin Legendary Round Table, of which he was the founder, and MacArthur is something of an auxiliary member, is clearly being used. <br /> <br /> In fact, the villain won an Oscar for the best story, although this victory is probably more related to the impressive presence of Trusts than any brilliance in the plot. This is a coward, Woolcott and a dialogue that you remember ...
