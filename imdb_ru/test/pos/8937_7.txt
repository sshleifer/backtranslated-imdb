"Plots with a View" of 2002 is a delightful little comedy, as only the British could do it. The sense of humor in the film is moderately painful and black, but at the same time very attractive, and sometimes very rough. This is the only film directed by Nick Herran, which I have seen so far, and although I'm not going to watch any of his other films now (I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies), this film is very enjoyable and very funny. The film takes place in a small town in Wales, where Betty Rhys-Jones (Brenda Bletin) is married to a drunken and adulterous major of the city (Robert Pugh). The local undertaker Boris (Alfred Molina) from childhood desperately loved Betty, but was always embarrassed to admit to her love. In addition to desperate love, Boris has other problems, as the eccentric American undertaker Frank Featherbed (Christopher Walken) opened the funeral business in the same city ... The strange, very British mind of the film must entertain everyone with a sense of humor, and the story sometimes becomes rather strange . In addition, Plots With A View makes a profit from the beautiful cast. Brenda Betlin, who had already shown herself to be an amusing woman in “Rescue Grace” in 2000, plays the main role, and again she is very funny and very attractive in her role. Alfred Molina, who plays her shy fan, always shows excellent results, and Robert Pugh is perfect as Betty's scruffy husband. Beautiful Naomi Watts is also great as a “secretary” of her husband, I’m becoming a big fan of every movie in which I see her. However, the incomparable Christopher Walken (one of my favorite actors) plays the greatest role. Walken is great because he always plays the role of an eccentric Mortician who holds a rather unusual funeral. All in all, Plots With A View is a very interesting little British comedy that I highly recommend!
