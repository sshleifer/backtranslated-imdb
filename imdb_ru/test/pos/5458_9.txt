Over the years I have watched this movie many times since I watched it on HBO, and now I have a copy on DVD. I must say that it is very memorable and interesting, as well as interesting and informative. Any television fan can relate to the time of the early 90s, when the time has come to replace Johny Carson with the television legend of The Tonight Show, who will be Jay or Dave? This original HBO film “The Late Shift” remains true to form and describes real events well, showing a backstage battle between the heads of the NBC and CBS networks and even ABC, they all fought for Jay and Dave's services. Acting makes it seem real, since very few real television videos are shown by real people, and the actors depicting Leno and Letterman make it so real. I did not read the book by Bill Carter, so I don’t know if it was preserved on the pages, but I really liked this film for many years. From the moment he begins to show the entertaining chapters of CBS, watching Johni as a subwoofer, they decide that they want to participate in the night game. However, when Carson announces his unexpected retirement, NBC wants to stay true to Leno, but the conflict comes when Letterman also wants to get a crack in the slot at 11:30. It was fun to watch the stupid meeting with Michael Ovitz (Street Williams), which makes all the networks want to consider Letterman for the show. It was interesting to see Johnny talking to Letterman on the phone to get out of NBC and review CBS. And by the way, Rich Little was awesome, since Johnny Carson couldn't compare with his image. Many tense moments were granted when he showed how the talented manager Leno, Helen, quarreled and fired, forcing him to do the leadership of NBC. In general, an excellent film that showed what television really is, and proves that networks require a lot of energy and money, showing that this is a merciless business. Obviously, there is no such business as show business. Excellent work from HBO is very memorable, and the clock at any time shows the real story of the late night wars.
