Oh my God. Obviously, when you rent or buy this, you do not expect to see a documentary about the mating habits of small rodents in their natural habitat. You expect a visual feast of blood and blood, and perhaps even a panic or two. Well, for those who are sick and perverted, like me, you will not find much fright, but you will come very close to urinating with laughter. tricks in this movie will remain with you and your friends forever. The first time I showed this to my friends and colleagues was more than 3 years ago, but we still laugh at our asses and use catch phrases. it's just as exciting and fun as Sam Raimi's “The Evil Dead II: The Dead at Dawn” and “The Dead Alive / Brain-Dead” by Peter Jackson. From a completely ridiculous dialogue on the initial stage, to the best works of the Department of Spray and Smell, to Ed's amazing abilities, the director of the film, you will laugh and laugh again. As for the visual feast with blood and blood, oh yeah, they have it. And they are damn good at this ... "The neck bone is connected to the head bone ..." This film also probably made the best scene of a nightmare / hallucination / completely insane nut I have ever seen. and that this does not mean to be funny, but the peasant is well done (and creepy). In general, everyone who is not against a handful of blood and a hell of a good time, IF YOU ALWAYS SEE THIS FILM, GET IT !!!! this is on Netflix, I know that for sure.
