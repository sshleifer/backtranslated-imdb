The brilliance of this film is not in the process of creating a film, which is a common, but fulfilled, interwoven story about the lies of three servicemen after World War II, but that this story was told in general. Samuel Goldwyn deserves praise for having the audacity to push through a film that leads a disabled veterinarian with hand tongs, an alcoholic and a minor.
