I ran into this film in an Australian hotel room at 3am. My brother and I were on the channel, and whom we see, except for young Russell Crowe. But not the phone that Russell Crowe throws, which we learned, and quasi-love in the states. This film, to my great surprise, was amazingly creative and fun. It shoots awkward teenagers with funny stories about weird sexual experiences, including a clever salesman, prostitutes and an unusual sexy mother. If you are lucky enough to come across this film, I highly recommend taking it. I have to say that this film was amazingly interesting, and I thank the wonderful people of Australia who are doing this ...
