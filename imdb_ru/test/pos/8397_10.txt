Gone with the Wind is one of the most popular books ever printed. This is definitely a film from all films. Roman Scarlett and Rhett made people dream around the world and turned the main actors into cinema icons. One may ask, is it really necessary to continue? And ... there are big shoes to fill. <br /> <br /> Well, at first there was a book. Admittedly, Alexandra Ripley's “Scarlett” is well written and fully respects the world created by Margaret Mitchell. She understands exactly where we left our heroine earlier, and carefully leads us out of Mitchell's heritage into her own fantasy. In the book, Scarlett, who was defeated after Melanie’s death and Rett’s departure, goes to Charleston to live with her mother-in-law in the hope of regaining Rett’s love. Her typical manipulative behavior again provokes a lot of criticism from Rett and pushes them further away ... until a certain boat trip that changes everything. Scarlett now carries a secret. The series follows the book fairly accurately before Scarlett arrives in Ireland. Since then, books and TV shows have been slowly diverging. The actual end is different, but, of course, both have Scarlett and Rhett together. <br /> <br /> The production of the series was announced with the search for the next Scarlett O'Hara worldwide. Many countries have made their own television shows featuring young actresses on auditions. As a result, about twelve girls were selected to participate in the final tests and interviews in Atlanta, Georgia. Unfortunately, the producer did not find Scarlett among these actresses. Sad for girls, the main advertising for the show (it was already sold to many television stations around the world before the filming began). Robert Halmi, the producer who bought the rights to Scarlett, said that while watching TV, he found the right actress, called her and two days later signed an agreement. Joan Wally-Kilmer (who played a major role in the films "Willow" and "Scandal", the last film of which Robert Halmi watched this right evening) is not Vivien Leigh, but she is definitely Scarlett! Her performance is not a copy of Lee, she makes her character. The main difference between GWTW and Scarlett is that the lead character develops and grows as a person. This is the prerogative of the series, why copy what was done before? Given that there is a nearly seventy-year gap between the first and second storyline, it is natural that both authors emphasize different aspects of the characters. Whereas Mitchell works around Scarlett, dealing with the aftermath of the civil war and fighting for Tara, Ripley lets Scarlett confront her demons. For me, this is the most interesting aspect of the series, we will find out Scarlett differently, because she learns that not everything can always go the way she wants. I fully agree with Timothy Dalton’s choice as Rhett Butler. He portrays him with charm and irony and is a less cardboard figure than Clark Gable’s performance. The rest of the cast was chosen well. Julie Harris is charming as Rett's mother, John Gilgud plays a very funny role, because grandfather Robillard and Sean Bean are always at their best playing a dirty character, his Lord Fenton makes no exception. However, a bad choice with Steven Collins in the role of Ashley and Ann-Margret in adapting Belle Watling was a waste of money. Costumes, scenery and locations are thought out and convincing. The newly built Tara suite looked exactly the same, and this is the moving sequence in the series when the house first appears. <br /> <br /> Does it make sense to continue ... Well, six hours of romance for me. One watch!
