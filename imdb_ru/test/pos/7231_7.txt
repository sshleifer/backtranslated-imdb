This outlandish Trome film is actually a very good film. This is known as their epic and best and highest rated production. Their version of Shakespeare's play is extremely amusing, with the usual dose of naked body and Tromov's blood. Troma made some very good films, one of my favorites is "Street Trash" and, of course, the films "Toxic Avenger". I have one film about “Troma” “Horrible horror”, which has the reputation of the most horrible and vile film. I liked “Tromeo and Juliet” so much that I finally need to watch “Terror Firmer”. This is a 2-disk version of the Collector with four comments and many features. “Tromeo and Juliet” is an absolute cry and is highly recommended.
