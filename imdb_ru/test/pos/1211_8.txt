In the 1980s, the struggle was simple. Hulk Hogan was supposed to take on the role of Roddy Piper, friends of Bobby Hinan or Ted DiBias, and go out as winners more often than not. From time to time, he received such an ally as Randy Savage in 1988, but this was mainly due to Hulk Hogan vs. Bobby Hinan, and so it should be. <br /> <br /> But this night it was supposed to change, the new champion, the man who WWE thought was going to be their man for the 90s, was crowned. It did not work. But WWE was right in one thing: Halkmania was finished, and it was necessary to establish a new order. <br /> <br /> This historic Restlemania, the first one held outside of America, was launched from Rick Martel, the winner of Koko B Ware. Koko was never very lucky on Wrestlemania, and he was immediately defeated. <br /> <br /> Then the colossal mix of Andre the Giant and Haku put their title deeds against the Axes of Destruction and Destruction. and lost. New champions of the winning team have been crowned with victory. <br /> <br /> In the next match, the Earthquake defeated Hercules. Hercules was another person who was not very lucky in Wrestlemania. Good luck Brutu Bifkeyku when he finished Mr. Perfect's series of undefeated. Well, I think someone had to end this. <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper and Bad News Brown doubled in a slow but fun match, and then the Hart Foundation defeated Nikolai Volkov and Boris Zhukov in 19 seconds. Unfortunately, not quite suitable. Then the barbarian defeated Tito Santana in the short match. <br /> <br /> American dream Dusty Rhodes and Sapphire defeated macho king Randy Savage and Queen Sherry in a dirty mixed match. It was the only female fight that actually took place in WWE at the moment. <br /> <br /> The next one was a fun fight when Rockers Marty Janetty and Shawn Micheals beat the Orient Express at a fast pace. At that time there were a lot of good tag commands. Then Jim Duggan beat Dino Bravo in a match that was completely different. <br /> <br /> Then Ted DiBiaze staged his most cherished reward - the million dollar championship against Jake Roberts. Roberts was distracted by Virgil and counted out, allowing Ted to retain his title in an exciting match and one of the longest matches on the show. <br /> <br /> Next, the twin towers collide as the Big Boss quickly defeats Akim. This is followed by Rick Rud, who won a short match with Jimmy Snooka. <br /> <br /> Finally we got to the main event, when Hulk Hogan put the WWE title on the line with the Intercontinental Champion "Absolute Warrior". This is an interesting match back and forth, won by the Warrior after Hogan missed his foot drop. The crowd was extraordinary, and the match was a great show. <br /> <br /> So the torch is over, but can the Ultimate Warrior become the Champion WWE had hoped for?
