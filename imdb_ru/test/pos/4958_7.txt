Sorry, but I just can't help it, I love to watch the Iron Eagle. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that this is a great movie. No, rather, I would say that this is an infinitely interesting film. For people who cut this film into pieces for the fact that they are not realistic, they seem to overlook the course. Of course, the conspiracy of the Iron Eagle was ridiculous. But I think that his target audience were children, and I remember exactly that I found it cool when I was small. Now I just find it a fun treat, like Road House. This film is part of the great pantheon of the 80s, films that tell how to take on children. You should remember D.A.R.Y.L, Real Genius, E.T., etc. If you ask me, just watching Doug and Knotcher "Ride the Snake" at the beginning is worth the cost of a DVD. This whole sequence was so stupid! But, at the same time, it was fun, funny, 80s, all these good things. So the bottom line is that the Iron Eagle is a great treat from the 80s. Hairstyles, dancing, music, dialogue - all this is damn funny. I have an Iron Eagle on DVD, and it cost me only $ 9.99 at Best Buy. If you like to laugh at outdated, unrealistic action films, this is a must see. Oh yeah, and I think his plot was just a little more stupid than the other 1986 action movie, Top Gun.
