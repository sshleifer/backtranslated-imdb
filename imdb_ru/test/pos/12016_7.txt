Ex-reporter Jacob Ash (Eric Roberts) is hired by acquaintances (Raymond J. Barry) to find his ex-wife and son. Ash goes to Palm Springs and quickly finds the former Line (Beverly D'Angelo) with someone whom he considers his son (young Johnny Depp). But it turns out to be a bit more complicated, as Ash discovers that the former white trash Lane definitely married millionaire Simon Fleischer (Dan Hedaya), and her first son is nowhere to be seen. <br /> <br /> Director / screenwriter Matthew Chapman broadcasts BODY HEAT here, and this neo-noir of the mid-80s is watchable enough thanks to its starry composition and beautiful places. D'Angelo was still looking good at the time, so she had achieved a good femme fatale and was not afraid to show some skin. However, the mystery is not very convincing at the end. Starring Dennis Lipscomb, Emily Longstreet and Henry Gibson. Chapman made several thrillers in the 80s, but his “greatest” career achievement was co-writing the script for the infamous “COLOR OF NIGHT”.
