I expected this movie to be bad, but I got a pretty good slasher / blood movie. Most of the death scenes are pretty brutal. Teenagers are decent, with Penny McName is by far the best of them all. Rachel Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but does not bring anything special in the film. Kane was good, like a killer, and quite plausible, like a formidable jagernaut. I saw a "turn" coming from many miles, but I still enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> But what really stood out for me was the direction. Gregory Dark could make a career in a legal film. Besides the overuse of the horror film “Speed ​​Camera” (do you know where, how does the guy’s face tremble all quickly?), There are some good pictures here. Viewing angles and the environment really underline the size of Kane, making it look even bigger than it really is. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a deep plot or characters, it is not. But it's not a slasher movie. If you are looking for some good violence or if you like horrible movies, watch this!
