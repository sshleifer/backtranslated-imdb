The Night Breed movie is one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. Overall, I'm not a big fan of horror films, but this film has something more atmospheric and different from any other horror film I've ever seen. Many horror films that I saw, I liked to watch, however, because they are based on horrors, I know that these stories are unreal because they are fictitious, so I can not take them seriously. Nightbeed, on the other hand, is a unique horror genre, as it has a sense of realism that I have seen in very few other horror films. <br /> <br /> This film tells how a person is killed and ends. Living with the undead in an underground cemetery shelter with monsters of the undead is a story that a person could get from the “Nightmare of Dreams” because it is very unique and original plot. Most of the horror films that I saw are all rather unreal, but since Nightbreed was incredibly complex and ingeniously directed with superb play, especially with Craig Schaeffer's awesome special effects (Aaron Boone), great lighting and fantastic dialogue, I found this film to have a sense of depth and maturity without any silly parody of horror, as in many other horror films. Nightbreed, like horror, contains elements of thriller, romance and action - all in one. If you have not seen this movie, I recommend that you watch it, since I rate it as 10/10.
