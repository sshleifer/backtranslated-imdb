The name does not refer to a dubious poker hand, but to six comic players. They come in twos: Charles Ruggles and Mary Boland go to California for their second honeymoon in a couple, George Burns and Gracie Allen as another couple who share the costs, and V.S. Fields and Alison Skipworth as sheriff and hotel owner in a tiny town in Nevada. No attempt is made to create a sequential narrative - it is a set of comic bits that are connected together. All the first couple wants to do is to spend time together, but the characters of Burns and Allen are not married, so the men sleep together, like the women. There is a little plot: the bad guy puts in a suitcase for $ 50 thousand. Pinky (Ruggles) takes out of the city, but since the expedition is led by Gracie, the booty cannot be found. A bad guy appears in Nevada, and Fields accidentally captures him. A bunch of pleasant moments, Ragles embarrassed expression, indecent, irreconcilable speech of Gracie and Fields, playing billiards with a corkscrew and making a quivering, sharp, double double blow when threatened, and his surprisingly characteristic way to linger on the word. And, trying to remember the name “Gracie”, he says to Skipworth: “Hmm. It starts with K ... McGonigle. ” She replies: “Oh no, no, no, no ...” “Mmmm. Vangaghanki! "" No, no, no, no, no. Oh, Gracie. "Yes, it's right."
