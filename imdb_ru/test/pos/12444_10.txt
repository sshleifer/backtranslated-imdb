I can't remember exactly where I first heard about them, but I listened to a little one song, and I liked it. I went and bought a CD and finally found the type of music I like. I heard about this video and knew that I needed to have it. There are a lot of clips that they play in a concert. Let me tell you, watching this video doesnâ€™t even compare with them at a concert. I saw them twice at a concert and do not want to miss the chance to see them again. Two other things he has are interviews and even videos for one of their biggest songs. a couple of little notes ... I saw them on ozzfest 2001, and they drove there, but seeing them on the inside scene was much better (they had really cool things about being able to turn off the lights), another one if then wonders, votary means devout follower.
