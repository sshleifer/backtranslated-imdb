This scene shows how Wallaceâ€™s experiment with his invention of manipulating the brain goes terribly wrong, creating the werewolf rabbit. His desire as a social entrepreneur is to improve society for the better, so he created the "brain manipulator". He risked his own life to help solve the problem of the Tottington pest rabbits and, more importantly, to overcome the overpopulation of rabbits collected and stored in his basement. Although he thought his experiment worked, however, this led to the fact that he and Gromit put more pressure to find a solution before the Annual Vegetable Contest again risked his life. A rattle, silent faithful dog and faithful assistant, constantly thinking about new ways to save his master from his radical crazy inventions, which are terribly wrong. What is interesting in this film, trying to determine: who is more adventurous, Wallace or Gromit?
