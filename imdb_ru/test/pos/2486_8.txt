Some aspects of the “Park of Punishments” are imperfect, especially some of them. However, I feel that this is perhaps the most important film of the era of the "war on terror". I grew up hating hippies and continue in some ways. It was only when the United States began to follow the path of an unnecessary and false war in Iraq that I began to see the world through their eyes. I feel what they were supposed to feel. Although the film is somewhat outdated, viewing it brings unpleasant emotions about our current situation right to the surface. At the very beginning of the film, it is quite clear that the Park of Punishments is intended to become a concentration camp and a death camp for all the "non-patriotic" elements of American society. This, of course, is an exaggerated and extreme view of our polarized society, but it is RELIABLE. Sometimes I believe that the United States can easily fall into fascism. When I watched this movie, I could only think about how almost every day I hear similar feelings from people on both sides of the political spectrum. This film is a rough, concentrated picture of the modern political scene in America. I am impressed and saddened by the fact that something similar (and yes, exact) was filmed more than 30 years ago. If you look at the film more modestly and decide to believe that this will not happen here, take a closer look at Guantanamo Bay, some of our “enemy combatants”, rumored CIA secret prisons, and numerous incidents similar to one. in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1979 (8 full years AFTER the creation of this film).
