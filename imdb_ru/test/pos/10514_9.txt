The night gallery has never impressed me, but this episode stands out. <br /> <br /> The head of the television network listens to a strange act - a young, boring boy who starts making predictions. The executive director considers this to be a waste of time, until the next morning the predictions come true. <br /> <br /> What first seemed to be an act of the salon becomes a hit show, since the childâ€™s predictions are consistently accurate. <Br /> <br /> Then one day he refuses the show. Faced with the inevitable timing of the show, each at the end of wit, even threatening him with a lawsuit if he does not fulfill his contract and does not make his daily predictions. <br /> <br /> The young boy relents and predicts a seemingly utopian tomorrow. <br /> After the show, the bewildered manager asks for an explanation, only to understand why the complete truth is too terrible to reveal.
