I'm a fan of independent film. The driving force of the dialogue is what I need to study the character. Some of the other posts are right: “Wannabes” is not going to compete with “The Godfather” for the best movie about mobs. On the other hand, “Wannabes” is a well-written and well-presented picture, in which surprisingly good performances of each actor / actress. My problem with one of the other reviews: <br /> <br /> - Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irish member of the Italians. <br /> <br /> - Dubin is a Jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, but traditional ruddy, like Irish. It does not stand out, rather, demonstrates excellent results. <br /> <br /> It didn't bring many awards, but it deserves a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn. I found this for 7 bucks on Blockbuster and was pleasantly surprised, to say the least! Highly recommended.
