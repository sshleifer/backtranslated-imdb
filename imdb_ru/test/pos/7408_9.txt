Characteristically, this film is no more famous. It clearly lacks most of the elements that a successful theater film needs: heroes, villains, conflicts and resolution, romantic love interests. <br /> <br /> Here everything is upside down, nothing works out, as it should, everything is awkward sad, angry, offended and hungry, and no one has a solution for anything. In short: this is war, and this is hell for all participants. People try their best, but interests, dedication and so-called debt interfere. The picture takes us back to the days of the civil war with an intensity rarely seen in modern cinema. Direct honest images of intense beauty. The actors are very well chosen for the story, and they make the characters really come to life before our eyes. <br /> <br /> Silver dollar in a pile of nickels!
