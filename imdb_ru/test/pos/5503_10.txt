A completely different film by Jerry Lewis, not like the more well-known films that everyone knows. Lewis rather unconventionally solves the difficult task of the Second World War and National Socialism in Germany. But what is even more interesting and important, he does it completely un-American. And like in many other things in the world, especially in the film industry, non-American means more sophisticated, thinner, smarter, or simply better. For this reason, the film was not successful in the United States, but was a great success in Europe. <br /> <br /> In general, Jerry Lewis proved with this film that he can do much more than a simple comedy.
