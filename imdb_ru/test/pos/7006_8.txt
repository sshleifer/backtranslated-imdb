Black tar is a story of survival. This is about how to survive in a hostile, alien world against even more hostile enemies. The task becomes even more difficult when you can find the nearest enemies in your surviving group. <br /> <br /> The plot of “Black Pitch” is quite ordinary, and it has already been seen several times in different variations. But what makes this film shining above others is well-written characters. <br /> <br /> The group consists of completely different people, and few of them are more interesting than others: Jack, a boy with a secret; Fry, a pilot who has difficulty with his own conscience; Jones, a bounty hunter; An imam, a holy man, is confronted with the fact that God is sometimes cruel, and Riddick, a convict and a murderer, learns to value others, not just himself. Characters begin to live in the film. They are not only paper, as in many other films of this genre. You start to take care of the characters, especially Riddick, although it seems rather strange. He must be a bad guy. In this film, the line between light and pitch black is very thin. All characters are familiar with both. <br /> <br /> Another thing that works in this film is casting. Rarely do actors play their roles so well. Radha Mitchell is suitable for Fry. Cole Hauser brings the right amount of cruelty and sense of responsibility for Jones. But the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. It works great as Riddick. In his hands, Riddick is rather creepy, definitely very dangerous, and also a deep character, as he should be. <br /> <br /> So, how do you survive in the Black Hole? Keep your friends closer and your enemies closer.
