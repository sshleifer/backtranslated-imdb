This film is a great flash of action and comedy, it fits into it right from the start, there is no boring building. Chemistry of the main roles adds excitement and anticipation of the final, although my suspicions were not satisfied. The special effects worked brilliantly and were believable! I would like a different ending, but it still made me tremble with emotion. The storyline unfolds well, however this is a movie that you have to watch from beginning to end in order to thoroughly understand all the details in order to fully understand and get the most pleasure. <br /> <br />
