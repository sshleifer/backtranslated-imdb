I was very impressed with the latest products from Mick Molloy. As his fan, I’m used to a different type of humor than here. He wisely chose a more subtle, wider comedy of style in Crackerjack, rather than his usual low eyebrow, nonsense in your face. Sometimes it is contradictory and uneven, but a decent script works after that and makes it interesting to watch. Directed by Paul Moloney (who directed almost every conceivable Australian series), Crack Jack tells the story of Jack Simpson, the guy who belongs to his local bowling club for the sole reason for parking. When the club faces financial problems, it has to compete in a duel, trying to raise funds to save the club from becoming a poker machine. A familiar and successful formula that copes well. There is no denying that the film owes its success to the magnificent casting Molloy. It seems that he had a great connection with Samuel Johnson and excellent chemistry with Judith Lucy, and although the character is probably not too far from his own personality, one can not wonder why he did not try his hand at the cinema earlier. To smooth out the experienced cast, the adorable Frank Wilson and Bill Hunter support and often steal their scenes. They are two great actors, and the couple easily fulfill their roles. If it were not for the huge success of “My big, fat Greek wedding,” Crackerjack would have come out on top in the Australian ticket office, but if you consider what it takes and who participates in it, even surpass it. 2 was an outstanding effort. In general, a witty, pleasant to the touch movie. A great cast, a great team and a great soundtrack are combined into one of the best Australian films of 2002. 7/10.
