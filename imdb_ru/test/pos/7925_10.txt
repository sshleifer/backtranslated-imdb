I watched this movie after I read Tom Clancy's Rise of the Red Storm. Eternal masterpiece that the Germans captured the Russian in the 13th century. The film was shot in 1938 by order of Joseph Stalin to warn the Soviets about Hitler and Germany. The battle scenes are beautifully made, showing that you do not need computer animation to create a magnificent battle scene. Probably the greatest work of Sergei Eisenstein. See also “Battleship Potemkin”. Any history buff or major politician should watch this movie. 10 out of 10.
