Fata Morgana by famous director Werner Herzog is incredibly unorthodox. Although characters appear in the film from time to time, there is no real story. The film is also not an educational or historical documentary. This is a movie without an accompanying script. <br /> <br /> The film consists of curious background music and a somewhat illogical narrative action, the combination of which overlaps a long sequence of images, mainly, though not exclusively, from the Sahara desert. Some images are surprisingly strange and unusual. The camera captures ghostly images, or mirages, optical illusions that tease and hypnotize. <br /> <br /> This general cinematic tendency is interrupted by occasional observational observations on random topics. For example, in one sequence a person wearing glasses gives us a mini-tutorial on lizards. And in what was for me the most exciting and bizarre sequence, in the small insertion room there is a man with dark glasses who sings in a voice that is completely distorted by the microphone that he uses, accompanied by an elderly woman who plays an energetic melody on an old piano It seems that neither the man nor the elderly woman does not like what they are doing. Like baroque. <br /> <br /> Fata Morgana really has a basic concept that combines a wide range of strange images and eclectic sounds. But this concept is so subtle, so opaque, that you will never understand it without help. From this fine topic, the film really makes sense. However, without this point of reference, a film may seem tedious and endless, meaningless parade of random earth images and esoteric gibberish. <br /> <br /> Indecently redundant, thematically confusing and cinematically heretical “Fata Morgana” most likely, you will either be delighted or sick of you. You either take advantage of the Zen-like qualities of the film, or be tempted to split the DVD into a thousand pieces. One thing most viewers agree with: “Fata Morgana” is ... more.
