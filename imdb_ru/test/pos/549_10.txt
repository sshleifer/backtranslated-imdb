Last night I was able to see “Anywhere, but here” as a preview. I absolutely loved the movie! I was attracted to this because of the realistic portrayal of the relationship between mother and daughter ... there was definitely a connection between Adel and Ann. I think this speaks of the outstanding speeches of Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. Sarandon was just a suitable actress to portray Adele, and after leaving the theater I could not think of another actress in this role. Portman was as excellent as Ann. She brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to a role that I think no other teenage actress could make. I think that the Academy of Cinematographic Arts and Sciences should pay tribute, if necessary, and appoint Sarandon and Portman for awards in the categories “Actress” and “Secondary Actress”. It would be a shame if they were not noticed.
