It is not particularly well written. Songs are not remembered. The cast, however, survives a great deal from this Martin and Lewis in a navy situation. They both look great like young sailors. They are believable. Submarine scenes show how boring she should have been in those submarine missions in the 1950s and earlier. <br /> <br /> Many sailors in many scenes. Hundreds, perhaps, on a large field for training in the open air and again in the boxing arena. <br /> <br /> You will see James Dean in his scene. He really stands out, although he is superfluous here. In the scene where Jerry walks down a busy street, we see some of his “almost random” comedies that he will play in Patsy in a few years. <br /> <br /> Dean, who gives Jerry boxing instructions, is a good comedy film. follow up. Jerry in the boxing ring shows his high energy, which was his trademark in the late 40s and early 50s. Dina and Jerry's dances are kind of fun. Not much, but better than most non-dancing movies. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing if you don't mind black and white. Happy end. <br /> <br /> tom willett
