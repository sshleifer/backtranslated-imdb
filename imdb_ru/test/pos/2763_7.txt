Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall caused tears in his eyes because of his fascinating epic “Alive”, there was already the legendary Mexican director Rene Cardona who used the same drama as a draft for his ambitious film Supervivientes de los Andes. " The unforgettable fatal flight of the Fairchild 571 crashed in the Argentine Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident took the lives of many passengers, most of whom were members of a professional rugby team. But 16 of them were ultimately saved due to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the remains of their unfortunate fellow travelers. Of course, you cannot argue that this cheap and rudely edited film is better than the famous version of the 90s, but I definitely appreciate and respect this film more. In the end, a film about exploitation requires much more impact from both the actors and the film crew, while the Marshall film with a large budget, although intense, looks more like a routine making money. Sets and special effects, of course, cannot compete with “Live”, but “Supervivientes ...” provides an equally impressive sense of hopelessness and creates an even more nightmarish hellish snow. Cardona's film is ambitious, surprisingly convincing and easily ranked among the most wonderful Mexican productions. I'm really surprised that Cardona’s view of this story is no more exploitative and frank. Scenes where deceased passengers are opened and consumed, however, are difficult to digest, but they only increase the credibility of the crash and highlight the inhuman conditions of survivors. Very commendable for the evil director, who gained fame thanks to his obviously bad films, such as “Night of the Bloody Monkeys” and the TV series “Santo”. Unknown young Mexican actors do an excellent job, and the music is very attractive. Of course, the story is well known, so the script does not offer unexpected shocks. Either from the story, or before seeing the Living One, you know what dramas these people have to go through before they are rescued, and you can only wait for them. However, this is a good film that should not be made as it happens too often.
