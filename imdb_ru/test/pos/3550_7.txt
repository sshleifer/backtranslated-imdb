Of course, he has his own pretentious moments, he plays as an art-house, a live game “Fantasia”, but there are also moments of profound beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem, but I have always shown great interest in them. Now I will evaluate the segments individually. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Rog - “Un Ball in Machera” - this segment can spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole group. It is difficult to follow, mainly because he is trying to stick to a clear plot (beaten). Photo not completed. The best thing about this is a bit of lesbian homoeroticism with which it never does enough. This segment made me VERY nervous about continuing. 2/10. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturridge - “La virgine degli angeli” is an unclear segment, but it hardly matters. The film has the best cinematography of all, mainly because it is in stunning black and white. The segment is fabulous and beautiful. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard - “Armida” - I chose the bold this vicious film for the Godard and Altman segments. With Godard, I was much more impressed than I thought. I cannot say that I have seen so many of his films since he has shot so much that almost no one has seen it, but judging by what I have seen, this may be his best work since the 60s. This is the funniest episode in this film and the most artistic. Bravo, Jean-Luc! 9/10. <br /> <br /> Julien Temple - “Rigoletto” is a very funny segment, it is also quite predictable. However, this story about a husband and wife who cheat each other at one resort is miraculously filmed using long, complex tracking frames that depend on the exact choreography of the actors. It also has a great joke about the omnibus films themselves. The final scene is very weak. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Bruce Beresford - “Die tote Stadt” - there are too many lovers (I think) in this short segment in Venice. It is beautiful, with some nice shots of pigeons flying around the city. This is a little, but nice. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman - “Les Boréades” is not one of the best segments, unfortunately, this is more a music video than a conceptual short film. It is attended by the inhabitants of an insane shelter, attending theatrical performances. The music and the images go well together, so at least I can pay tribute to the fact that this is a good music video. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Frank Roddam - Liebestod is somewhat unfortunate for the Beresford segment, this segment is very similar to it. As you can guess from my phrase, this one struck me a lot more. This is a young man and his girlfriend who travel to Las Vegas on a fatalistic journey. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Ken Russell - “Nessun dorma” is perhaps the most visually vivid segment, playing in the fantasy world more than in reality. This is a beautiful tale of a fallen angel. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Derek Jarman - “Depuis le jour” - I heard a lot about Jarman, and this is the first part of the film I saw from him. Hope I will see more in the future. It's also a music video, but it's better than the Altman segment. This mainly concerns an elderly woman who remembers her young days. Editing and using various films to represent time and emotions is very beautiful. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Bill Bryden - “I am a pagliacci” - a sad clown, perhaps one of the most famous arias (especially memorable from an episode from Seinfeld), this serves as the material that separates each segment and final. It is simple and effective. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give it a solid 7/10. This is not as bad as you heard.
