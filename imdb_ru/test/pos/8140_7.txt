I am so happy not to live in an American small town. Because whenever I am shown a small town in the States, it is inhabited by all sorts of monsters, including zombie hungry to the flesh, evil aliens and ominous ghosts are the most harmless. In this film, a former doctor who just took the time to accidentally kill his wife in a car accident directs his steps to the nearest small town — he must have never in his life seen a single small town that happens to be a purgatory. of course, as soon as he arrives there, all hell will break loose. He meets a blond chick, which of all creatures is most like a cow, both in facial expression and in brain function, and immediately falls in love with her. But there is a tiny flaw, she is already married to a very small drug dealer, who in a minute gets a mortally wounded shot. To find out what came of it, you have to watch the movie yourself. I'll just tell you that this is a bit like Oliver Stone's “Turn”, but in all artistic properties this is the way down.
