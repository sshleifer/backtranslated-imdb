While most of the films in which people encounter horrible aliens end up becoming a cheap imitation of the “Aliens” series, “Black Pitch” is a great idol and a great movie. Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film is the lighting. In this film, many different colors, shades and intensities of light are perfectly used, which set the mood and give a unique feeling to the film itself, something different from the “normal” lighting of the film, which we usually undergo. Vin Diesel perfectly embodies his character, skillfully avoiding the routine image of a hardened criminal. In the end, a film about the personal journey of Riddick (Diesel's character), so that, fortunately, Vin does not throw the ball. The rest of the cast (with the exception of the talented and gorgeous Claudia Black) was unknown to me, but it all turned into amazing performances that enlivened various characters with unique quirks and manners. Black tar is a great example of making a good movie without excessive budget resources. Special effects are more than adequate, but at the same time they are by no means the only goal, as in many high-budget “blockbusters.” This is a great film because it uses science fiction as a means to tell an interesting, provocative story, rather than tell a mediocre story to use a flash of science fiction.
