I think that by the time I saw this episode, I had seen enough Twilight Zones to figure this out beforehand. This is a strange collection of characters that are at the bottom of the cylinder. They are fine until an excessive soldier appears among them. This is his main directive - to run away, so he gathers strength and forces them to work to reach the top of the cylinder. There are many discussions about the goals, the causes and the speculations about their past, but no one can remember anything. They represent different professions: piper, ballerina, clown, a man in a tattered hat. Why are they there? This leads to an adventure and is solved at the end, but I think I had a pretty good idea before it all happened.
