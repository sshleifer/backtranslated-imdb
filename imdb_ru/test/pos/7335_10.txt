Wow, what I can say is that it was a good film, very different from all the boring remakes that we see lately, the only thing I would like to see a little more end, like when Jane left her husband, I guess she was going to Serena because she fell in love with her, not only with her, but with all that she is, I would really like the producers to really show such an end, instead of leaving their imagination for themselves, the end, I really hate it when they do it. The aerial performances looked funny, but I think you should be light and muscular, I would like to see more films like this one, maybe they could do some sort of sequel to Jane and Serena. If I were in the shoes of Jane, I would go to the girl, too, she was attractive.
