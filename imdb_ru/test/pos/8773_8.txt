I’m a big fan of Hitchcock since I’m watching Rear Window on TV. “Diversant” is not the best for me Hitchcock, although it is very good, but not a masterpiece. It has its drawbacks, some parts move rather slowly and, as a result, rush to write it off, the script seemed rather incomplete. But Hitchcock’s leadership is superb, and the performances weren’t all that bad. While Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane do a good job, Otto Krueger and Norman Lloyd are very close to stealing the show. The story is good, about an unjust man on the run, very similar themes used in the "39 steps" and "North to the northwest", and slyly provides some much-needed escape. The music score was absolutely outstanding; the music in the title sequence was phenomenal, almost like a distorted march, and I liked the excavations at the 1st Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto and Beethoven's 5th Symphony. The cinematography is also crisp and smooth, the landscapes and landscapes are almost dazzling, and there are also many very effective scenes. Namely, the culmination of the Statue of Liberty, but a meeting with the circus troupe and a shootout in the Town Hall of Radio Music is also for money. Overall, not Hitchcock is the best, but definitely worth a look. 8/10 Bethany Cox
