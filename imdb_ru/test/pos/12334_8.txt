"One Dark Night" - the main product of the horror genre of the 80s. Filled with retro-pun, clothing and scenery, “ONE” takes the viewer to a simpler time, when horror films were just that ... Horror! <br /> <br /> Nothing so intense that you cannot understand what is happening The film tells a dark fable about what happens when you mess with the dead. He is well acted upon by the stable queen of screams and the wonderful directorial work of Tom McLaughlin, who enjoys time and makes him believe in what he represents. No "Who did this?" and of course there is no big twist at the end. It’s just the horror in your face from start to finish, with a lot of 80s humor added for added spice. I give him "8" simply because some special effects do not come to the end of the film, but at least there is no CGI ... The perfect film for new fans of the horror genre of the 1980s or for those who want to experience a fun night of classic horror bliss.
