I do not see how a film of this quality gets an average of 5.7 points from voters IMDb. This is a classic Australian setting, reminiscent of the past year, such as LOVE and OTHERS etc. As a 19-year-old university student (Newton, perhaps in her best role, at least on a par with CHANGI) with a bored, super-religious mother, gets a shock from her life when she decides to enroll in the same course. , as he, - and before you start thinking ANOTHER FIL M, it is not, there is some real substance here. Of course, this is a simplified view of life in general and of students of art, in particular (but, nevertheless, they are rather simplified, despite the fact that this is a philosophical impasse, isn’t it?), And, perhaps, the study of Sinead’s character Cusack is sometimes a bit confusing, but the film is bright, funny and has some important messages. The principle of action is amazing: Cusack and Newton are great, and Rose Byrne (see also “DIVINE 1967”) is so underestimated that it is not funny. She is a beautiful, fresh, self-confident actor who deserves all the praise she receives. I gave MY MOTHER FRANK 8/10.
