Of course, as he could. He apparently used several aspects of this excellent film, which was also based on the sensational French case of the self-proclaimed “doctor at the World Health Organization,” who killed his family and himself when he was finally exposed as a fraud. Emilio calls his son "a monster", he sings on the radio in his car, he hangs out on park benches and specializes in investment schemes to deceive his family and friends - all this and more directly removed from "Time" Out ", which went a year before Nobody's Life. This is very bad, because this film is pretty good in itself, with good play and writing. Considering that Vincent from Time Out is a much more subtle character who seems to there is a sense of ethics, even though from time to time it turns into knots, The main character here seems to be devoid of any character, with the exception of his winning appearance and charm. Seriously, the part where he used X-rays that show his mother-in-law's cancer to get more money from his father, then uses a subtle twist on the same fraud, to avoid eviction from his quaint house because of non-payment of rent time is almost too much. The guy has no shame. In fact, he looks more like a major role in “Father” than a poor fellow who is fired and so humiliated that he cannot accept the disappointment of his family and friends and feels compelled to invent a brilliant New Life for himself, as he did Vincent in Time Out. Thus, it was possible to feel the increase in tension in “Nobody Life” and a violent conclusion. “Nobody's Life” has one thing that “Time out” definitely lacked - this is a love interest, except for the gullible wife of the protagonist. It is not difficult to understand how a sexy nanny could charm and enslave Emil to such an extent that he ignored the danger of her natural curiosity and allowed her to expose her less carefully built rogue. Given the reservations mentioned, this is a pretty good movie that we found interesting. If you crave for something like these elements that go deeper and are more intellectual and spiritual satisfaction, I highly recommend Time Out.
