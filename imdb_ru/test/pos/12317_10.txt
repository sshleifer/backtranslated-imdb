There are so many “Top 10” lists that can easily match “Dead” - the best drunk screen, the best literary adaptation, the best use of music not written specifically for the film, the best use of poetry, the best on-screen speech, the best acting ensemble and finally, maybe , the best movie ever made. It was the last and best John Houston film adapted by his son Tony from the story of James Joyce and filmed on the evening of Epiphany in Dublin in 1904. Basically, it is limited to one place where the Morkan Sisters live, and not much happens in the usual "dramatic" conditions. They entertain their guests; there they sing, dance, talk and talk a lot, but you can not see this movie anywhere else than in this company. <br /> <br /> Finally, of course, “many”, much more. It is about love, loss and regret, those stable supports of the great drama. In the final scenes of the tenor film, Bartell D'Arcy (Frank Patterson) sings the song "The Lass of Aughrim", which recalls Gretta, (Angelica Houston), Gabriel's wife, (Donal McCann), her first ghost and probably the biggest love, a boy who died at the age of seventeen with confidence from a broken heart, and suddenly Gabriel realizes that he never really knew his wife and that he was not the great love of her life, after all. Emotionally, these scenes are incredibly strong, at first Gretta tells about the circumstances of her beloved's death, and then when the voice in Gabriel's head sums up his own feelings. This is a great cinema, monologues, superbly presented by Houston and McCann. <br /> <br /> But then all the performances are outstanding. This is an ensemble game of the highest order, and although it would not be prudent to single out one performer over another, the screen ever gave us a more pleasant, ingenious, or convincing drunk than Donal Donnelly, or when poetry was delivered with such passion that IRA in "The Quiet Man") leads to the fact that he reads here the translation of Lady Gregory "Donal Og"? Of course, one should add spice, knowing that Houston himself was close to death when he acted in this film, which seems to me to be the culmination of the work of his life. Death may well be its central theme, but watching this film is a life experience.
