This is one of those films that have never been advertised and therefore were missed when it was originally shown in cinemas. <br /> <br /> I ran into him when switching channels and immediately plunged into the story of the aging rodeo homeless. whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I often wanted to watch the movie again, but I could not even remember its name and had never seen it in rental stores. <br /> <br /> James Coburn and Slim Pickens were great in their roles, and the rodeo shots were first-rate. Being a fighter and having a western atmosphere and theme, anyone can like it, regardless of its taste in films.
