Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, relieved of his official duties, contributes to the war effort by producing pieces of prose for some propaganda branch of power in Whitehall. <br /> <br /> Thomas is depicted as a free-thinker who believes in free love, married to a woman with an equally demanding artistic character and also with a penchant for extramarital romance. Thomas, writing and repeating his poems in a systematic household disorder, becomes a bit picky by the end, somewhat awkwardly relying on connections with society and putting the title of a war veteran who shot his house and accidentally married a woman he had. I had an affair with . <br /> <br /> The real story of this film is the love of two women, one (Keira Knightley), whose first love was Thomas (Matthew Rhys), the second (Sienna Miller), who is Thomas's Wife. Sometimes it reminds of “The Singing Detective”, as on very good television with a slightly ominous overtones, filmed on the scenes of surrealistic absurd camp.
