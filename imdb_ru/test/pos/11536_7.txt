The novel Jennifer Egan was screened by Canadian director Adam Brooks in the film, which, based on some of the comments of the authors of this forum, sounds like a bad sentence, but in fact it is much better than you could believe. <Br /> <br /> This is a story about two sisters who loved each other dearly. Faith, a blonde and carefree hippie, takes her younger brother Phoebe under his wing. Phoebe clearly loves Faith; When the elder decides to go with the guy Wolf to Europe for the summer holidays from Berkeley, she promises that she will send Phoebe a postcard every day. Vera does this until the cards stop coming, and one night, some time later, the family will be called to inform them that Vera has died under tragic circumstances. <br /> <br /> Phoebe can't forget Faith. That is why in a few years she decides to go the same way as the older sister. She takes cards from Vera and visits all the places, starting from Amsterdam, then moving to Paris, and she wants to end the trip to Portugal, where Vera met her untimely death. <br /> <br /> In Paris, Phoebe contacts Wolf, who is no longer a hippie and lives with his girlfriend. The wolf tries to convince Phoebe to abandon the trip and return home; she suspects that Wolf holds the key to the mystery, and when she is about to leave for Portugal, she makes a discovery when she finds a picture that clearly contradicts the version of Wolf that he told Phoebe. He feels guilty and, against the wishes of his girlfriend, decides to accompany Phoebe to the city where Vera died. At this point, the story changes, and we return to the memories of what Faith experienced in Europe and what happened in her last days. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the Invisible Circus is the performances of the leaders, something for which Mr. Brooks should take a loan. The big surprise is the Cameron Diaz range, which, like Vera, seems to choose light comedy episodes when she is fully capable of doing good dramatic work under the guidance of the right director. Jordana Brewster is considered the eldest Phoebe and makes a wonderful contribution to the film. She is an amazing beauty with what seems natural to acting. Christopher Eccleston is Wolf and shows that he is also capable of more serious drama. Sweet Camilla Belle plays the younger Phoebe quite convincingly. Blythe Danner looks like a mother of girls. <br /> <br /> Henry Braham nicely photographed European places. The film is also complemented by the musical score of Nick Laird-Clowes and the original song by Petra Haden. Elizabeth Kling is edited with great elegance. Ultimately, this film shows Adam Brooks in great shape, as he gives the right tone for the adaptation of the novel and receives a reward by performing the right cast, working wonders for him.
