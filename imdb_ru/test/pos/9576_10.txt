This is the only film about Christopher Geste that competes with Spinal Tap and Princess Bride for entertaining value, but one way or another will never achieve recognition. The plot surrounds the participants of the competition - the dogs - and their owners, when they go to the world of competitive dogs ... Well, this is a dog show. The owners really are characters, as you need to be tied to their dogs. It's really all you need, but it makes it quite funny. <br /> <br /> You can never convince me that mockery of dog shows would be funny before catching a funny scene where Levi and O'Hara visit Larry Miller’s house on TV ... but this really all that is needed to turn any doubter. Spinal Tap is nonstop gaiety, joke for joke, while Best in Show had a few more sleepy moments (and I mean, say, 3 minutes on MOST, where something incredibly funny doesn’t happen), but loud laughter . <br /> <br /> The casting in this film is great, and even the typically inappropriate movie in general, Parker Posey does an excellent job with his work. In fact, her tirade directed at Ed Begley Jr. and the pet shop owner because of a lost toy for a dog is probably the most fun game in the movie. <br /> <br /> What is surprising in this film for me is how the writers somehow managed to weave the plot, as simple as it was, around these great jokes, so it actually seemed like he has a direction. I assume that there is freedom to have such a minimal conspiracy. The role of each is fairly well developed here, and the characters are rarely excessive. The realism of how pathetic they seem to an outsider makes it funnier than the Mighty Wind or the uneven Guffman. I really come across wierdos like this from time to time. If you even like Guest things, you should definitely have this.
