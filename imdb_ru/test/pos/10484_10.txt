Exalted - perfect - deep - the true lesson of the idealized meaning of life. We are fully immersed in the life trips of Martina and Philippa and <br /> <br /> Babette. Their aspirations, desires, sacrifices resonate long after the film ends. Looking at it many years ago - when he gained a lot of fame because of the audacity of his plot - half of the film was one dinner - the audience "sighed and ached" when some of the courses went to the final <br /> A magnificent figure laughing at the reaction of visitors, when they were completely seduced by the taste pleasures that Babette presented to them, and were completely surprised by the turn of events at the end of the film. Afterwards, after seeing the film years after my own turns, I realized how deep this film is. On this viewing tears flowed freely. <br /> <br /> The film reflects on time and how it uses a seemingly simple story to comment on life, love, art and generosity, and this is really something to be cherished.
