So let's start!))) <br /> <br /> The film itself is as original as Cronenbergâ€™s films are usually shown ... <br /> <br /> I intend to see that JJL was definitely one of my favorite actresses. She is as cute as usual, this cutie! <br /> <br /> I would not say that this is my favorite movie. However, it is quite interesting and interesting to follow. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is not very impressive, but this is not a kind of star array. ;) <br /> <br /> I recommend with confidence!))))
