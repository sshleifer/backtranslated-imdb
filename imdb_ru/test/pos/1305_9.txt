I noticed this film at the Duane Reed pharmacy branch in New York during the holiday, and it seemed a bit silly to me. And, of course, the whole premise is ridiculous, except for words, but it turned out to be a very pleasant fighter for children and their parents. <br /> <br /> 10-year-old Ricky Bernard (Jordan Garrett) most of the time his head is in the clouds, much to the disappointment of his father (Larry Miller). As a member of his school orchestra, Ricky and his classmates fly to a concert performance ... and again Ricky’s mind “flies up” and suspects that there is some kind of criminal plot. <br /> <br /> Reluctantly, Sasha’s best friend, who is a fan of hot sauce (what a strange plot trick) helps, and others whom they are trying to unravel to solve the mystery help. Oh, yes, and Riki's skills, 1000 hours of flight experience on the simulator, are helpful when he is asked to save the day at the exciting climax of the film! It was nice to see Eric Roberts and Marc Daccoscos play roles in the family movie. And looking at the DVD interview, everyone seemed to enjoy the participation. <br /> <br /> I really liked Junior Pilot; charming and good-natured performances, funny plot lines and real ones; feeling of pleasure and complete nonsense. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an entertaining family movie, you can do much worse than buy this one.
