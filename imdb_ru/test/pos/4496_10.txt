Ok, I did not read the book ???? Or maybe the book was better ????. WHO KNOWS ??? // But I liked the movie. It was interesting, not a bit boring, pleasant and most of all heartbreaking. The friendship between the two children was so pure and innocent. These children behaved so well, especially the servant's son. Oh, my GOD, it is like the form of GOD on the face of the EARTH. ARGHHHH he steals our heart so easily. ********* Spoilers ************* Another Friend, a rich guy, - Kid, and his confusion and frustration can be understood. BUT I was really pissed off when he left and ignored his friend at the time when he needed consolation. In any case, he was just a kid and a little stubborn. I would like the film to also show the old version of the poor child. Oh, it hurts just to think about the ending. This movie is sad. I was terribly sad during the final. Tears flowed from my eyes. Yes, background scores are fantastic, WOW scenes. Kite scenes are fascinating. And well it becomes a little adventure in the middle. Perfectly acted and great cast. The kids acted so well. GREAT DIRECTION. I do not know why this film failed woo Critics. But this, of course, woo me. 10/10 must see ??????
