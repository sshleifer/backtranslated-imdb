Before dawn a great horror movie. It is atmospheric, filled with tension, made from wonderful shots of wildlife, in which only a few young people meet their doom in the form of two crazy full bastards who kill them. Jeff Lieberman is a very talented and intelligent director who, unfortunately, is underestimated. He succeeded in building tension not with blood, but with the display of a threatening nature. Lieberman manages to build tension in a very linear, simplistic way, which is also the best way not to show the viewer blood, but to let him imagine the worst thing that happens to the characters. <br /> <br /> Before dawn, it was always compared to the Texas chainsaw massacre, Liberation and Hills have eyes. He looks as good as Liberation, better than Hills, I mean more frightening and better worked out, and he is creepy like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. <br /> <br /> JBD - one of the best horrors of the last decades, finally lives on DVD!
