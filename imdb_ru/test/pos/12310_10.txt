I waited for years for THE DEAD to video, fairly putting my copy of VHS to shreds. This is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holidays. This takes place on the Feast of the Epiphany (Twelfth Night) and is a simple, piercing vignette of characters present at a dinner prepared by three Dublin women. Central to the story is a couple, devoid of love, a wife who once passionately loved a young man who died for her, and a man who wants to have the same passion for his wife, but feels incapable. All the performances are awesome, and the script goes well with various characters at dinner. Of course, his source material is the story of James Joyce with the same name, and much of his narrative structure is fully preserved. John Houston’s long career as one of Hollywood’s greatest filmmakers had a really fitting ending with this film, the script of which was written by his son Tony Houston; starring his daughter Angelica Houston; and is dedicated to his wife, Marichelle. Thank you Lions Gate for purchasing the rights to this film and releasing it on DVD. For lovers of everything Irish or for people looking for a literate, subtle, but incredibly touching, festive film, this is a real gem.
