Obviously, the movie B ... B should mean a better game and a better message than we get today in the pictures with the big budget "A". Modern films aimed at young women are certainly not designed to encourage depth of character compared to petty selfish behavior ... or to increase the self-esteem of young girls who do not meet the "female" standards. (In the end, criticism is false and bright, as this film does, will not help to sell more products that depend on how girls are * not * satisfied with their natural qualities or inner beauty.) <br /> <br /> Laraine Day is cute as a tomboy prone to mechanics who flies into rooms and confesses his inability to flirt. She associates herself with Robert Cummings because of similar interests, a general sense of humor and her honesty, loyalty and good friendship, which he gradually begins to appreciate compared to the surface "charms" of her selfish sister-glamor sister (which only reveals his own selfish , reckless playboy trends). <br /> <br /> Although Larain is externally beautiful, it's nice to see that inner beauty is valued more, and the image of true friendship leads to the most complete romantic relationship. I would like young girls (and boys) to receive such a mundane message today. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, if Hollywood returns to filming films “B” with a modest budget and tries to be content with a modest profit ... what am I saying? Sacrificing the blockbuster mentality to create something more sincere on a smaller scale is like expecting a guy to give up a little sex sweat for a sweet girl who really cares about him. This is a crazy conversation. <br /> <br /> Please, someone has already invented a time machine! I live in 1940. <br /> <br /> I would rate this film higher, but the ending is too sharp, and perhaps it lacked sufficient signs of a change in the opinion of Robert Cummings. (I like the fact that B-movies are short and fast, not bloated and self-indulgent, but this time it could take more than 70 minutes.) It was also somewhat unrealistic that the widow and small children would not suffer from a sudden death in their family ... or, perhaps, forgiving the one who caused it. I mean, I think it is * good *, but a bit more grief or bitterness would be only natural. Maybe this is a deliberate choice to make this family act thoughtlessly about their loss, to reduce the consequences of the tragedy and to ensure that * we * forgive those who are involved in death - anyway, this is just a plot device, and not real point of the movie. Still strange though.
