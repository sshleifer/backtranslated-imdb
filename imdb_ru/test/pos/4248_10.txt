I have to admit that I have never heard of this movie. I caught it last night at TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed and loved the finale. Imagine what kind of film the Marx brothers would like to get if they collaborated with Salvador Dali and Malcolm X, and then everyone abandoned LSD. <br /> <br /> Nowadays this is a funny and harsh word that is often used in this film, plus about 200 IQ. The points of most comedies today are surreal. I was supposed to be at 6:00 in the morning and watch it before 2:30. I slept and missed my obligations. Still worth it. I would not recommend renting it, I would recommend having it. It was so good. <br /> <br /> The only warning I have is that these links are dated and cannot be received by young people. Naked with it and use your head. <br /> <br /> I would have to put this in my main comedies of all time.
