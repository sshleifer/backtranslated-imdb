Sherlock Holmes films from the classic Universal epoch tend to vary in quality. This range ranges from very good to above average, none of them is terrible or strikingly brilliant. Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon fit tightly into the average level of quality, and, as always, it's a pleasant walk that will appeal to fans of the series, like me. This film sees Holmes in the middle of the 2nd World War conspiracy of the evil Nazis for stealing the invention of the Swiss scientist, which could be a key element on the battlefield. Sherlock Holmes films from the Second World War are usually not as good as in Scarlet Claw, where Holmes conducts private investigations, as they are often pursued by too much propaganda or plot that is more about War than mystery. This one, however, is largely kept away from both, and, focusing on Holmes and his investigation, the film works much better. Perhaps Universal saw what the former “Voice of Terror” brought down and because of this changed focus. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone once again demonstrates an excellent personality as a first-class detective, and Nigel Bruce does not show as usual, it's nice to see him when he does it. They don't spend much time together, which is disappointing because their chemistry is always one of the best things in Holmes films; but it gives Holmes more time to demonstrate on boats in various costumes, which is always a lot of fun. Dennis Howe's "Lestrade" is definitely my favorite of the secondary characters, and although he is not as funny as usual; his expression is gorgeous, and his presence helps to emphasize how great Holmes is. His scene with Watson in the car, in which there are drops of paint on the road, is my favorite moment in the film. It's nice to see Holmes, the sworn enemy, the return of Professor Moriarty, even if it seems that he has just been thrown into hell. Lionel Atville's game is not as good as George Zucco in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, as he never convinces himself that he really has a brilliant mind; but to see how he plays with the main character is fun, and it's nice to see him in the film to compensate for the themes of World War II, which have never been as interesting as Holmes himself. The film begins as a thriller, rather than as a mysterious film; but as soon as it starts, it's hard to break away, and this is more than a solid record in the work of Universal.
