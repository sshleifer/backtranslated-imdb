The reason why this film is not more famous and more valuable to me seems to be due to its theme. Due to his controversial issue, this film has not received the due big release and still remains a rather unknown one to this day. Not that his topic is now so controversial. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is a film about a white man who is friends with a black man. Friendship does not seem forced or unrealistic, but the way it is portrayed in this film makes everyone feel very real. We see how these different ethnic groups mingle with each other, as if this is perfectly normal. Unfortunately, of course, in those days it was not considered normal. Watching a dark-skinned man talking to a white girl, and just having fun with her as a friend, was probably difficult, for example, to watch some proportions of his 1957 audience. <br /> <br /> You can really understand why Sidney Poitier has always been and still is highly respected by the Hollywood society and the black community as a whole. Of course, this is one of the reasons why he also received the Honorary Award at the Oscars in 2002. In his films, he often struggles with discrimination and biased issues, and, of course, “In the heat of the night,” as the best example of this, the Real role model that undoubtedly inspired many African American actors to this day. But besides that, he was also a great actor. Yes, he is still alive, but he seems to have completely left the cinema, since his last role in the film has been from 2001. <br /> <br /> This film was the directorial debut of Martin Ritt, and he was also not given too much film to spend on his film. The studios were probably also a bit reluctant mainly because of their concept and / or because it was Ritt's first film. Or perhaps it was just because MGM was no longer so big, and he left his best days behind. Since the 1950s, Metro-Goldwyn-Meier has earned a reputation for not-too-good and cheap films, while in the first years before that it was indeed one of the largest studios with many stars and recognized directors. which made many award-winning classic films. Fortunately for them, their reputation begins to change again, and whenever the MGM logo appears in a film, people no longer expect a smaller film. <br /> <br /> In any case, even with limited budget and limited resources, they managed to make a great movie out of it. The film is very simple, with several characters and a simplified storyline. The film, however, still manages to capture you with its history and plots, without even starting to preach or anything about it. This makes the film effective with its objects. <br /> <br /> Indeed a film that deserves to be seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10
