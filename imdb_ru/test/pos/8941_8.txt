In this film, Woody Allen felt distinctly, so if you're not a fan of dry humor, dark humor, or awkward humor, you can probably find something else to do. If you, however, this is strange, with some nice twists and a smooth, natural dialogue. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite fascinating, not quite like a train wreck from which you can't take your eyes off, but close. I mean that at its best. There are many intrigues, enough turns to fully utilize the senses, and the characters are completely attractive. <br /> <br /> I had a great time with this movie. <br /> <br /> He estimates 8.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
