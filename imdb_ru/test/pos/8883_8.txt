stars: Danny Devito, Billy Crystal, Ann Ramsey, Kim Grist, Kate Mulgrew, Oprah Winfrey and Rob Reiner. <br /> <br /> After a college lesson, teacher Larry (Crystal) wants his ex-wife to die, and Owen (Devito)) wants his mother (Ramsey) to die. When Larry talks about what he wants his wife to die, Owen knows what he must do for him in order to get a favor in return for Larry to kill his mother. The devito is absolutely cheerful in this, like a dead-minded writer who dreams of poisoning his mom and sticking scissors into her head. He has a role similar to a child, which makes him seem a more embarrassed person than a murderer. Ramsey was actually nominated for an Oscar for this because of her remarkable work as a mean Mrs. Lift. In addition to comedy, the film also has a heart. One scene between DeVito and Crystal begins, it would seem, as a joke, but it goes deeper, in fact, it makes me a little sad. Danny Devito made a film and did a good job on a dark tone. For any fan of comedies, I recommend it. <br /> <br /> My rating: B plus. 84 minutes of PG-13 for language, sexuality and violence.
