There are films that make a career. For George Romero, it was the NIGHT OF LIFE; for Kevin Smith - CLERX; for Robert Rodriguez, EL MARIACHI. Add to this list the absolutely amazing game Onur Tukel in DING-A-LING-LESS. Impeccable filmmaking, as confident and professional as any of the aforementioned films. I have not laughed so hard since I saw a full month. (And even then, I don’t think I laughed so much ... So to say.) Tukela’s talent is considerable: DING-A-LING-LESS is so full of twofold intentions that you have to sit down with a copy of this script and spend it line by line so that fully appreciate its width and width. Each shot is beautifully arranged (a clear sign of a confident director), and all the performances are impeccable (there is not one of the amazing scenery that you would expect from such a film). DING-A-LING-LESS is a movie whose time has come.
