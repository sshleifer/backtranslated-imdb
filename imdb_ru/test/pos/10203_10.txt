Here is another Western of the 1940s, which I watch whenever he goes to TCM or FMC, because although he may be historically wrong, he is extremely interesting and works well, plus he has Randolph Scott, my favorite actor , second only to Gary Cooper-Uela Good, fourth after COOP, Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck. But the film itself, for me anyway, is quite historically accurate and, as I said, it acted well and “flows” very well - I bet that I saw it 50 or 60 times, and I like each view more than the previous one. I have it on tape from TCM, but I would buy it in a minute if it ever appeared on a DVD. Look, if not - I guarantee you will like it!
