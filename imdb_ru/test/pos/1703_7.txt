The name suggests that this film is a sequel to "American Werewolf in London." None of the characters from the previous film is returned and is not even mentioned in this film by name. So, as a sequel, AAwiP fails, one could say. <br /> <br /> I dare say the opposite. <br /> <br /> The American werewolf in Paris is a charming and effective horror movie. This is one of the best films about werewolves that I've seen in a long time. And I saw my share, such as “American werewolf in London”, the “Howl”, “Wolfen”, “Wolfman” and “Underworld” trilogy. <br /> <br /> The story tells about three Americans who came to Paris for the holidays. At the top of the Eiffel Tower, one of them saves a woman trying to commit suicide. What begins with a romantic relationship gradually turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets that are hidden in the city are revealed ... <br /> <br /> I really liked the game in this film. Especially the two stars of the film: the woman who tried to commit suicide, and the guy who saves her. They have good chemistry together. But two other Americans also play their part perfectly. I really didn't find anything annoying in acting, so thanks for that! <br /> <br /> The effect on werewolves is pleasant. It doesn't look too cheap or fake for me. Of course, opinions on this issue are divided. But let's just say that I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie also has a lot of humor. There are some really funny scenes that you will probably remember for a long time. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize: the American werewolf in Paris may not be a direct continuation of its predecessor, but it is still a pleasant movie. Perfect for werewolf fans! 7 out of 10 stars!
