A criminally short-lived show that spawned three additional films (Naked Gun 1, 2 and 3), this is a fast-paced comedy with fast fire, with more hits than blunders. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen plays detective sergeant Frank Drebin, an incompetent detective who fusses and sorts out his affairs with the able assistant of his boss, captain Ed Hocken. <br /> <br /> At best, the plotlines are false, but they are deliberate, since the good thing here is not in telling stories, but in weaving a constant stream of jokes along with some really weird and wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> The jokes themselves come in various forms, be it a word game, a farce, a pun or background jokes, most of which hit the target, although some fall a little flat. With this approach, “gag every few seconds” is inevitable that some will fail, but the ratio is good. <br /> <br /> Characters delight. From the guest star of the week, dying in the first seconds of each episode, from a laboratory scientist who seems to conduct cruel and unusual experiments on children, to shoe cleaning, which is a certain form of an oracle, writing is witty and sharp as a dirk. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that at that time they were not particularly successful, they quickly created a cult of followers, many blame the relative lack of show that he was well ahead of his time and too sophisticated for the target audience, mainly of which is none other than Matt "The Simpsons" Groening, and he should know. <br /> <br /> By today's standards, if you can see this aspect, a treat awaits you.
