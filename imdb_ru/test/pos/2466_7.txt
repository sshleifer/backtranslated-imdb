Connection with James Dean? In short, we see Emilio Estevez playing with a teddy bear (recall Ray’s first scene “Rebel Without a Cause”). In addition, the main conflict is Estevez versus Shin, father versus son, and in “East of Paradise”. The soldier came home, and no one could communicate with him, not even his sister (a psychology student, what a mockery). A mother, a rude matron (excellent Kathy Bates), gets stuck in a nugatin, unable to understand that her values ​​(religion, family) are a thing of the past, especially for someone like his son, whose innocence was betrayed. The father, an indecisive man, under the thumb of his wife, although he tries to play macho, wanted to fill the mediocrity of his life. Therefore, he saved his “honor” by forcing his son to fulfill his duty. The scene in which Esteves ’hate for his father explodes very intensely. The actor-director gives a discreet presentation, learned as the disciples of Lee Strasberg did, and his last surge of anger increases tenfold.
