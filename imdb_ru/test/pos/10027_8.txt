If you keep a strict historical perspective aside, this film is actually quite interesting. It has action, adventure and romance, as well as one of the main combat matches of the era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead roles. As can be seen on this board, the picture does not pass by purists who are looking for one hundred percent accuracy in their stories. To go beyond this, you only need to put aside a book on history and enjoy history as if it were a work of fiction. I know, I know, it's hard to do if you remember Caster's “Last Battle” on the Little Big Horn and its prominence in the history of America after the Civil War. So I think that there is an unresolved difficulty with the image, no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> There is something to take here, although the picture shows two hours plus the opening hours. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first head scraper, soaring like he does in full military regalia. Sharp's practical joke (Arthur Kennedy), who put him at the headquarters of the major, probably should have caused them both trouble. <br /> <br /> Ironically, many of the scenes in this war movie are played for comedy, like in the Custer movie. The first meeting with Libby Bacon, and subsequent meetings, which include the reader of Callie's tea (Hattie McDaniel). I had not noticed this before in other films, but McDaniel reminded me of a terribly many other my favorite actor from the forties, Mantan Morland. So much so that in one scene, Moreland felt like he was wearing a dress. With this in mind, the owl scene was also a scream. <br /> <br /> With regard to Flynn, it is interesting to note that the year before he portrayed J.E.B. Stewart opposite Ronald Reagan’s image of General Custer in the Santa Fe Trail, both claim the attention of none other than Olivia de Havilland. In this film, Reagan does not give any arrogance and vividness to the character of Custer, who remembers the story, while in the image of Flynn here it is more than obvious. But this is not close to what Richard Mulligan perceives as a war hero in the 1970s, “Little Big Man.” Let's just say that it was a little overwhelming. <br /> <br /> The best thing that took away the painting was for me the manner in which Caster continued to preserve his good name and not risk it in risky business. company. This is his loyalty to the people he fought in battle, and the discipline he developed throughout history. The most acute was the last clash with the main competitor Sharpe before going to the Small Big Horn, in which he stated that hell or glory completely depend on someone's point of view. Earlier, a similar comment could give us a better idea of ​​the character of Custer, when he said: “You take away fame when you have to leave.”
