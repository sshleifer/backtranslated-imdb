Great, just great! On the West Coast, appeared "Dirty" by Harry Callahan, on the East Coast - Sharkey. Burt Reynolds plays Sharkey in Sharkey's Machine, and I enjoyed every minute. Playing at the individual drug dealer in Atlanta, GA is what everyone wants. Instead, he is sent to the vice squad. As in the films "Dirty Harry" or in any other films about the police, the captain will always be a jerk. When I was a kid, I was curious that this film means Sharkey’s Machine. Well, I knew who played Sharkey, I wonder what kind of car it is. It was his fellow cops. Having revealed the murder, he does his best to find the criminal. When he turns out to be the big mafia boss, Sharkey doesn't play. When he brought another prostitute to a safe place, Sharkey fights hard and well, despite the fact that he lost a gangster. And I also like the part where the bad is blown out of the building through a glass window. It was a BOMB! “Street Life” by Randy Crawford really gave the film the right mood, and the movie itself is a really big hit for me, ALWAYS! Rated 4 out of 5 stars.
