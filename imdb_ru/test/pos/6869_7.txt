There is not much plot in this movie. There is a wealthy baseball team owner who dies and whose wife is going to sue the hospital for negligence. Not much more, but .... IT DOESN'T MATTER! <br /> <br /> It doesn’t matter, because you have some real actors giving life to the dialogue, and because of the cast you have some hysterically funny scenes, and even if you don’t laugh, you have there is a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Matto plays Charlie, whose wife recently passed away, and who considers herself the object of desire of several women in the hospital. He is happy to try everything that is available in the menu. He then meets Ann Atkinson (Glenda Jackson), who, firstly, is a patient in the hospital (their first scene together is very funny), and then they meet again on a televised discussion show where they disagree on almost every topic being discussed. <br /> <br /> Charlie begins to like Anna, and vice versa, except for the fact that she loves monogamy in men in her life (her husband was a crook), and they decide to give her a chance - two weeks of loyalty. <br /> <br /> I will not give out anything else, but I want to mention the chemistry that Mattau and Jackson show on the screen. Usually she is not the first one to think about in a middle-aged romantic comedy, but her touch on the comedy is very light and pleasant. At every step, Mattau approaches her, who is as charming as ever. He does not need to play Mr. Sensitive or Mr. Macho to get a girl, he just has to be himself. <br /> <br /> Art Karni is a riot in itself, like a practically old doctor. The scene where the dust of the owner of a baseball team is buried at home is priceless. He also has a very funny scene parked with Richard Benjamin. Richard has nothing to do in this film, and more often he is just a straight man for Carney and Mattau; the role does not burden his considerable talents, but he had a good time doing this comedy. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended ... 8/10 <br /> <br /> PS. For your information - Mattau gave Jackson his first best female role of Oscar, and Jackson presented the best male role to Art Carney for his role in "Harry and Tonto."
