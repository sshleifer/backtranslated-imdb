A few things that can be touched as an answer to a previous person’s comment. You just have to pay attention to what is happening in the film. <br /> <br /> (I guess these are spoilers) <br /> <br /> David’s red stuff? Poison ivy, the wife says not to scratch it, otherwise "it will spread." <br /> <br /> David is “going crazy” because a stranger tells him to leave the house, which probably confirms David’s theory of the romance between his wife and a stranger; he runs after the man. <br /> <br /> David does not lose him in the woods, he just hits a stranger a couple of times and leaves his wife to collect pieces. <br /> <br /> Only the wife eats the mushroom. <br /> <br /> I must say that after this single conversation with my wife and a stranger, I began to feel disappointed. But the ending caught up the whole movie. <br /> <br /> And for this very last scene ... this is one of my all-time favorite movies. I should have collected it earlier, but let yourself be distracted. To be honest, I was very surprised. <br /> <br /> This film is interesting, if not more. But if you don’t watch it on the performances that the actors give, I would say that you had better let go of this one, because that’s all that holds this particular film together.
