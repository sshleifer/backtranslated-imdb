Mr. Bean of Rowan Atkinson ranks with Laurel and Hardy, Buster Keaton, the Marx brothers and other great comedians. I have never seen people laughing so loudly and literally falling from their chairs, as when I presented them to Mr. Bean through my videos, and now to DVD. I will never forget the first time my brother saw him. He was visiting, and I asked him if he had ever seen Mr. Bean? "Who?" he said. So I took out a video and showed him where Mr. Bean is in the church and begins to sleep. My brother laughed so hard that he fell off his chair and did not let his belly laugh so hard. He immediately became a fan of Mr. Bean. We all know how funny these episodes are, but the most interesting thing is to share them with others. I saw how many people laughed until it hurt! Favorite episodes: visit of the queen, hotel accommodation, late arrival to the dentist, Christmas episode (classic ... plus children like it!) And the New Year party. Rowan Atkinson - comic genius!
