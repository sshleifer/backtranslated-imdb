I saw this movie last night on HBO and did not expect me to be hooked - I usually fall asleep when I watch HBO. But it happened, and you too. This is a tragic documentary (2002 Oscar winner) about the murder of an elderly female tourist in Jacksonville, Florida, and the subsequent investigation, arrest and trial of a 15-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie today and get a sense of how we progressed as a society. This film was the most worthy of the distinguished Oscar - you will be moved to tears.
