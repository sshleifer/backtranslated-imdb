Lackawanna Blues is a great movie too. Casting was perfect. Every actor and actress was perfect for the role they played. Their chemistry together was awesome. The game was excellent. I felt as if I knew the characters. I could almost "feel" them. They reminded me of people I knew as a child, in the 1950s and 1960s. Oh, the memories !! I personally think that this film should have been on the big screen so that everyone could see it. I watched this movie so many times that I almost read lines that the characters utter. I can't even list my favorite part, because I have so many favorite parts. Thank you for returning a part of my youth, which I have never seen in our time ... and these are black people who love each other, care for each other, respect each other, care for each other and do everything we can help each other. I have to go. I have to go see it again.
