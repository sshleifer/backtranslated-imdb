I read the latest commentary on this film and must completely and completely disagree with it. <br /> <br /> You see, I am a Portuguese citizen, and although this film has little to say to someone from Boston, he probably says something to both the Portuguese and Brazilians, as well as to immigrants everywhere. <br /> <br /> And why, you may ask? Well, firstly, this film tells about two fraternal countries: Portugal and Brazil. Brazil gained its independence at the beginning of the 19th century (through the hands of the heir to the Portuguese throne), and relations have since improved significantly. <br /> <br /> However important it may be, there are still many biases. Due to the economic climate in Brazil, immigration to Portugal increased significantly during the 1990s. You see, Portugal is not only a country that shares language, culture and beliefs similar to Brazil, but also a gateway to the rest of Europe. Thus, some people were forced to decide to cross the Atlantic and look for a better life, and Portugal was the first logical place to which they immigrated. <br /> <br /> As is still the case with many immigrants, they were paid on average below the minimum wage, and they were treated like “dirt” - only in this case, because the language is similar, they were constantly informed of their status immigrants. <br /> <br /> Another curious thing in this film is the idea that he conveys how a man so knowledgeable about the history of his country was still trying to quickly make money by exporting the desired national resources. It is these people who support Brazil in a state of continuous development, since the country is well supplied with natural resources and can easily climb the economic ladder if it is given a fair opportunity. <br /> <br /> In some sense, this shows how colonialism still exists - Pablo, representing exploited people, Igor, a man whose status is “nobleman” (or at least rich or “well-off”) foreign colonial power, which, in turn, in the face of Kraft. <br /> <br /> If you have seen other movies from Salles, you will recognize this as a constant theme - the fight against oppressive forces. I do not want to lecture or patronize to teach history, but I thought that this film, symbolically speaking, is very powerful. I am not saying that there was no room for improvement (as always), but I think that the last comment written on it was not only narrow-minded, but also uninformed. <br /> <br /> And the last thing to say on this is that I must assume that you watched this film through the eyes of an “American film director”. This remark did not cause any harm, but I mean that “foreign” films cannot be about “beautiful landscapes” - art is concerned with the problems of its time. You don't expect Otto Dix, for example, to paint all the beautiful places in Bavaria and the Black Forest ... Why should you expect the director to focus solely on the scenery when he feels that there are more important issues that need attention? br /> <br /> In short, do not judge films lightly and only by two or three criteria. This film is very interesting, his photo is pretty good, and even the idea that black and white coloring conveys goes hand in hand with what she deals with. I believe that the image is purposefully grainy ... as a reality, no? :) <br /> <br /> See and draw your own conclusions ...
