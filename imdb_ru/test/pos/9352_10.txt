What a wonderful movie! Unfortunately, being in 1947, the film script could not follow the book from which it was adapted, but the killing of a homosexual would be too hot to cope with it in that era. <br /> <br /> I thought all the performances were outstanding, as well as the script, direction, brilliant black and white cinematography, music and the atmosphere of noir in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I really understand that in 1947 the film could not portray racism against blacks and prejudices against homosexuals. (Robert Young's story about prejudice against his grandfather, who was Irish and who survived this racism 100 years ago, was rather unfortunate, but times dictated that the film avoids further studying racism.) one observation and one question to ask the viewer: 1. Did you notice that Robert Young didnâ€™t aim his gun when he shot and killed Robert Ryan, who quickly ran in the dark, and Young shot from the top story window into the dark without aiming? 2. If Robert Young's grandfather was killed 100 years ago in 1847 (the film was shot in 1947), and Jung was 40 years old, the timeline would not be logical. If the grandfather had been killed 50 years ago, then the time frame would be realistic.
