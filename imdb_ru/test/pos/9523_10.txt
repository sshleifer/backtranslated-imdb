For all of us, American fans of Deneuve, this little gem is a bit hard to get. Fortunately, I was so short that I saw a preview on youtube.com that I was ready to go at all. I found it on ebay.com, ordered it directly from France and changed my laptop so that it could play DVD of Region 2. Let me tell you that it was worth it. Be careful - there are NO subtitles (unfortunately, Pate should not have released it on DVD, Koh Lorber should have been - they are good about subtitles) I don't speak French. I can pronounce the syllable here and there, order a drink and whatnot. Having said that, the film was still a pleasure. I could not fully appreciate the alleged "obscene" humor or witty dialogue. Watching Deneuve and her colleagues was enough for me. I understood what was happening without dialogue. It really speaks about the film, when those who do not speak this language enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is wonderful. London is adorable as a son-in-law. I really liked my lesbian mother. And, of course, what can I say about our dear Mademoiselle Deneuve. She is one of a kind. These eyes, this smile. I could watch her movies all day. She really goes beyond beauty. People always say she is gorgeous. Well, yes, it is. But she is also very talented. I believed her every second of the way. Her talk about chocolate and vanilla with London is too sweet. Her character is even arrested for smoking a dope with a 15-year-old on the street. DO NOT MISS! Fly to France and buy it if needed. Fine. ten
