While I fully agree with the statement below that Mary McCormack is releasing a bag of milk on TV, the rest of the show is fantastic! Phil Hartman was a great professor, teaching celebrities all the finer points. Foley is nuts, but in a good way. You never know what self-deprecating humor he is going to come up with next. As for the gameplay, it is interesting, filled with witty banter, and is great for any beginner who might even be interested in the game. It is a pity that he no longer works :( I just checked the schedule until August, and it looks like it is not scheduled for some time in the future. Bad Bravo! You deserve a beating!
