* May contain spoilers, read only after watching the last episode of the season 2 * Think about it. Are you guys at the north pole? Earth Center? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: "did we miss it again?" So was another abnormality? Of course, that was when the plain collapsed! I think this whole island is a setup. I installed her daddy. She found out about this and is looking for her Desmond. How else can she know what to look for. <br /> <br /> In general, this is an island in a magnetic shield. Everything is fake. All signs are. Fake beards, fake doors, fake medicines, fake surveillance stations, with fake air mines that lead nowhere. This is really a project, and because of the final scene in the finale of the second season, I know that this is somehow related to Desmond, his chick and her father (and maybe Libby, she is strange, maybe she’s really This is connected with the crash of the plane. Okay, now I am leaving). <br /> <br /> Also in this episode, Henry Gale tells Michael to go to some coordinates, and he will find their salvation. This is probably some kind of door in a magnetic shield. “As soon as you leave. There is no way back. ” <br /> <br /> I think it’s pretty obvious, despite the many questions that I have left, and I hope to get answers next season. If you recall what we learned in season 1 and 2, I’m sure that we’ll get a lot of answers in season 3. <br /> <br /> Can't wait. <br /> <br /> Can anyone agree with this theory? Hope to hear from you again ...
