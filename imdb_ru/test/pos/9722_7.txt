Despite their pedigree, the most interesting in this series are not animatronics or puppet theater, which, although charming, represent more than just a show, at least in the story I saw, Brief History. In fact, although I must admit, the main pleasure of the program is that it is the most ancient art, storytelling. <br /> <br /> John Hurt in Rowley Birken QC-mode, a grotesque, medieval makeup, tells a story about storytelling, sitting by the fire accompanied by a cynical dog. One winter day, hungry and poor, he notices the same beggar who is thrown out of the royal kitchen by a nasty cook. The narrator talks about this last, giving them excellent soup. Furious, the Cook begs the King to allow the villain to be boiled, but, pleased with the Narrator's wit, the monarch offers him a reprieve - for 100 nights he must tell the King a new story: if he does not, He will pass it on to the cook. <br /> <br /> The story may be old, but it is told with great pleasure. Anthony Minghellaâ€™s screenplay is superbly dramatic (as the dramatist befits), witty, and with some disturbing worries under the fun, such as fear for yourself or the culturally self-generating power of storytelling associated with the continuation of ideological power. For a program aimed at children, it is invigorating self-reflectiveness (with a little nonsense about the film being a new oral culture); Despite the Americanized style, there is a charming medieval vanity, its grotesque and arbitrary horror, as well as its magic and power.
