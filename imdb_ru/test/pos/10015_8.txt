Even if you are a fan of the unique work of Gene Rollin, you will be taken aback by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory. At this time, in the field of view there is not a single vampire girl with a transparent dress! In accordance with tradition, the budget was too tight to fully implement the director's intention. Yet this is largely offset by his obvious love of the cinema genre, his devotion to his craft and pure ingenuity. Atmospheric cinematography by Jean-Claude Kuti makes most of the foreboding of places, and Philippe Brezhan (a / k / a “Gary Sander”) offers a striking soundtrack, which, fortunately, is not like any juicy stuff he composed for hardcore. <Br /> <br /> Shot in and around an office building in Paris before and after work hours, the film was largely flooded by the regulars Rollin was already well acquainted with from his "Michelle Gentil" XXX monetary collecting efforts, first and foremost French F * CK Film Royalty Bridget Lahai in demanding leadership. Playing Elizabeth (quite well, I might add), she caught Robert (Vincent Garder), who was wandering the nearby highway one night, returning home at the end of a long working day. Barely able to put together the series of events that led her there, Elizabeth seems to lose her memories just a few moments after the events occur, even forgetting the name of Robert and his heroic role of savior before their night flight ends his apartment. Before making love, she rightly calls herself a virgin (another merit is that Brigitte says that she so convincingly copes with this line, being one of the most active adult actresses of the 70s), because she doesn’t may recall a single touch. preceding it. Because of this elegant context, the relatively long sex scene that follows completely avoids rewarding other “commercial” breaks that Rollin had to include in other works in order to secure funding. <br /> <br /> When Robert goes to work He is inevitably erased from Elizabeth's weak mind. The mysterious doctor (comedian Bernard Papino effectively throwing against the type) and his threatening assistant Solange (hitting porn sterlet Rachel Mhas) to move along her while she is missing her protector and take her back into place, she happens to have escaped from. Here we get one of the film’s strongest scenes, as she is again introduced to her roommate Catherine (late Catherine Greiner a / c / hardcore performer “Katie Stewart” in a quiet destructive turn), both girls desperately put fake general “memories” for each other in an attempt to get ahead of their inevitable fate. This deterioration is not limited to the mind, it becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch, and Catherine is not able to control their movements, trying to eat a spoonful of soup. Catherine also voices the director’s compromise with the demands of commerce when she calls on Elizabeth to undress and embrace her, because sex is all they have left when their mind and physical abilities have left them. <br /> <br /> Somewhat pretty clearly - if not quite hardcore - the sex scene is midsection and French porn fans of the film must admit to loves Alain Plumey (a / k / a “Kirill Val”), Jacques Gateau and Elodite Delage, alongside with shimmering and skipping a little bit from the future porn princess Marilyn Jess, whose rape in the hands, mouth and dick Plumey was present only in the movie of the rarely screened XXX version of FILLES TRAQUEES. The key part of Véronique, the girl that Elizabeth seems to almost remember, and with whom she is trying to escape again, is perfectly controlled by the graceful Dominic Journet - in her unforgettable debut - that will play a significant supporting role in Los Angeles Franco Zeffirelli. Traviata. Six feet under the end shows that the deteriorating condition is the result of a nuclear spill, quarantine "patients" ultimately leave barely breathing an empty shell, unceremoniously thrown into a fiery furnace. The last shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on Chaplin's MODERN TIME, when Elizabeth is approaching total collapse, and wounded Robert stumbles along the railway bridge, clumsily clutching each other's outstretched arms.
