I first heard about Begotten, when my girlfriend shot it in the “iconic classic” section of my local video store. She knew that I liked obscure movies, so I shot them and brought them home. He sat on my TV for a couple of days, and then I put it in the VCR before going to bed. I thought that maybe first I would see what it was, and then I would devote more time to it the next day. What followed was that it actually woke me up. I sat through the whole movie and loved it. After I completed the closing credits, I watched it again. Only after you see the closing credits will you get an idea of ​​who is who. Once you know that you can look it up again with a new rating. Do not listen to people who tear this film apart. It is not for everyone. If you do not like to read subtitles, then this film is not for you (not that there are subtitles, there is no dialogue at all). If you really own Rush Hour 2, then this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> This film is truly original and inspirational. It does what other films have never done. It looks nothing more and bolder than almost everything - from 1989 to the present. You can say that everyone involved in the creation of this film really loves the art of what they do and understands what can be captured in the form of a movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to be entertained, then the film is not for you. However, this is pure escapism in some extreme form and in the form of a film. As if someone had attached the wires to my head and taped one of my worst nightmares. But this nightmare makes sense if you really sit and watch the images, analyze the actions of the actors, and do not sit there passively, fooling your guitar, but look and do not blink. <br /> <br /> People compare it to Eraserhead but the Born have a lot more. I do not joke when I say that this is my favorite movie. This is an important film, visually stimulating, mechanically inspiring and hypnotic. One review I read about it is very truthful: “No one will pass through the Born without a mark.”
