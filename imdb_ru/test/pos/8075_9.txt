LA ANTENA (Esteban Sapir - Argentina 2005). <br /> <br /> A completely unique look at the silent cinema in this fabulous story of Esteban Sapir, beautifully filmed in black and white and almost without dialogue. ” “La Antena” is a feast for the eyes and a must for fans of German expressionist cinema, most of whom are dedicated to the work of Fritz Lang and Friedrich Murnau. <br /> <br /> “City without a voice”, “La Ciudad sin Voz” is operated by Mr. T.V. He took the voices of the inhabitants and fully controls all the spoken words and images, forcing everyone to eat their own brand of television food. Mr. TV is not just a monopolist, he is the personification of evil and totalitarianism, even the swastika repeatedly appears as a symbol. He is secretly working on a hypnotizing device to control all the minds of citizens through his television programs. To this end, he kidnaps the only one left with the beautiful singer The Voice, but the television repairman watches the abduction and runs to the old television antenna in the mountains to stop Mr. TV’s evil plans. <br /> The design of the production is stunning, with beautiful decorations and images. Although Esteban Sapir is mainly in the language of silent cinema, he also adds some new personal techniques, such as a combination of typographic and animated techniques. Everyone talks to each other through text balloons (usually floating around the mouth), the louder they talk, the larger the characters. The texts themselves can be pushed or crushed. In the opening sequence we see a book called “La Antena”, which opens and the city of paper rises from the pages. It is unlikely that there are any links to Argentina. It is constantly snowing, which gives the film a non-Argenine feel, while a surrealistic setting suggests any big city in the northern hemisphere, and only a few songs reveal the Argentine background of the film. <br /> <br /> The tempo is fast and there are so many things happening on the screen that it is difficult to track the film’s surrealistic plot. Not only does it look amazing, they also give us a few messages about media monopolies, corruption and totalitarianism, but they are impeccably packed. One of the most original films that I have seen in recent years. Delight. <br /> <br /> The film was shown at the opening of the IFF in Rotterdam in 2007. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
