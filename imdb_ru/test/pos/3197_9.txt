Oh, I love it! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon does not really need to be summarized, as this is what it is ... a cat chasing the moon, to a Spanish poem. This is artistry that is interesting. In fact, there was this animated short film called “Fan and Flower”, which won the Academy Award last year (2005) ... yes, almost the same thing that makes me believe that it could just be a breakdown. <Br /> <br /> But this is really a good short one, with sharp black and white figures shifting and turning into beautiful movement and poetic seduction ... If you believe that cats are poetry in motion, look at that, and you will believe it more. <br /> <br /> He has such a touching ending. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
