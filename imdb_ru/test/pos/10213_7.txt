I saw it many years ago, and it is interesting, but not deep. The main story is about a young man who dreams of a Midianite, although he is not sure where he is or even if he really exists. <br /> <br /> Spoilers follow: Finally, he visits him, turns into a creature of the Night Breed to be bitten by another. He must then help other members of Nightbreed because they are being attacked by Canadians. (Except for accents, they all behave like good boys. Not very much in harmony with the Canadian psyche, eh?) Someone watched "monsters" or "night breed", replacing "Jews" and for Canadians / people, replace " Nazis, ”and you should get an idea of ​​the monsters fighting against humans. Well, maybe. <br /> <br /> One of my main objections was that although the underground city was interesting, it was rather dilapidated and, frankly, dirty. This should be a convention for films with underground settlements. One would think that if the monsters were good guys, some would have a little sense of decor. <br /> <br /> The storyline is a bit thin, but this is an introduction to the characters. But it is interesting enough for re-viewing.
