It was truly a “nightmare movie”; I saw it about nine years ago on cable television and since then have not forgotten about it. Pixot is a 10-year-old boy who lives on the streets of São Paulo (Brazil) and leads a criminal life in the company of his teenage friends Lilika, Dito and Chico; they steal, pimp, sell drugs and kill to survive every day ... In the first half of the film, Pixot is delayed by the police and sent to a sadistic foster family, where he witnesses all sorts of insults from older prisoners and the rest of the children; One night, the guy Liliki is killed after being beaten, so Pixot and his friends decide to escape during the riots. The rest of the film shows Pixot's descent into criminal life; he does not show any feelings or remorse after killing someone, perhaps because he knows that good feelings are useless in the world in which he lives ... But in the middle of the film, however, there is a tender scene; Pixot and his friends are at the beach, missing (and wanting) that there was one of his friends from the correctional facility. I thought it was a poetic and dreary scene in the midst of all these terrible events ... the boys obviously yearn for not only their friend, but also a better life. "Pixot" directed by Hector Babenko is a bold and depressing film that does not shy away from showing the harsh reality that many people, including myself, tend to ignore or misunderstand. This film is likely to open your eyes and make you better and more compassionate.
