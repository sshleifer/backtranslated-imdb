Well, well, no one in their right mind (s) will choose a film called “The Man with the Screaming Brain” and expects him to be serious. This is an outrageous b-movie, and it means a really funny plot, strange characters, clichés, incredible action films and very nice plot lines. For this strange segment of the population (including me), who enjoys this kind of things, this is a gem. <br /> <br /> The game is better than expected. Stacy Keach is built into his character. Bruce Campbell brings an energetic, convincing performance. His physical comedic abilities are truly impressive in this film and return to The Evil Dead.
