Dead Walking, absolutely brilliant, in tears to the end! You cannot watch this film and not think about the problems that it raises; how you can justify murder (be it murder or the death penalty) and to what extent forgiveness is possible (not only by spiritual means). Do not watch this movie when you have down! But LOOK THIS !!!
