Of all the actresses in today's film, Kristin Scott Thomas would be my choice if I had to choose one to enter a desert island. <br /> <br /> I could just watch her, say, sitting in a chair for a couple of hours. Therefore, it is difficult for me to be completely objective in relation to one of her films. <br /> <br /> However, I liked this film and its story, in fact, more than the average rating among many people who had previously commented on this site. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford is not one of the actors whose performances I like the most. But he is one of the few who has reached the transition level from 7 to 8 per film, so who am I to argue? <br /> <br /> Although Ford often displays a ridiculous demeanor, and sometimes it seems that seriously need an antacid and a dose of caffeine - and this group includes "Random hearts". <br /> <br /> His obsession with probing losses, which he and Thomas experienced in connection with their connection to the Spouses, is understandable, given his detective profession - but not to the level presented here. Although not far away, he crossed the line into the category of “annoying”. <br /> <br /> However, most of the scenes after he and Thomas became involved were interesting and well played. <br /> <br /> This film could be 9 *, but I would lower it a couple of levels based on the general characteristics of Ford, and one more, because it contained a bit more extraneous plot elements than it seemed necessary.
