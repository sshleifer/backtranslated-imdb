“The Empire Strikes Back,” directed by Irwin Kershner, “Never Say Never,” a remake of the 1965 James Bond film “The Stormy Ball”, does not exceed the original Terence Young, but this film is not Harry Salzman and Albert R. Broccoli is good to see if you call yourself a 007 fan. However, despite the lack of smart gadgets and the lack of a vibrant musical score, “Never Say Never” is rated as an excellent, tense doomsday thriller with the best performances by experienced actors, including Sean Connery, Kim Basinger, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Barbara Carrera, Edward Fox, Bernie Casey, Alec McCoven and Rowan Atkinson. The film is replete with surprises in a large number of invigorating sequences of title titles for a generally exciting, but lengthy 134 minutes. Unlike the James Bond franchise with its breathtaking moments, Never Talk Never, provides several such scenes because of its transcendental budget. In fact, there are only three gadgets in the film: an explosive ballpoint pen, a wrist watch with a laser and a reinforced motorcycle. In addition to the elegant introductory song of Lani Hall, the orchestral music by composer Michel Legrand "Ice Station Zebra" leaves much to be desired. Legrand does not reproduce any of those quick, jazz tips that made John Barry's music for the usual Bond franchise so memorable. In general, “Never Say Never Again” seems to fit the first two Bond films “Doctor No” and “From Russia with Love” and “About Her Majesty's Secret Service” from the point of view of his greater down-to-earth approach to subject. <br /> <br /> “Never Say Never” introduces James Bond to Sean Connery as a senior 007 who saw his day and was suspended from active service to teach. Ironically, Roger Moore was a year older than Connery, and Bond Moore's films were viewed as 007 as an active young guy. Sean Connery seems to be responsible for making 007 a more mature secret agent, and there have been a number of changes in Lorenzo Semple’s script that highlight Bond’s age. Initially, Connery lobbied to play Bond without a hairpin, but, fortunately, wise minds prevailed, and Connery had a hairpin. He looks tanned and in good shape and looks in better condition than he did twelve years ago when, at the last moment, he was thrown into Diamonds Forever to replace John Gavin. Connery was working on another film and gained weight for a role he couldn’t shoot in time for Diamonds Forever. At 52, Connery still has youthful energy, despite the flimsy demands of the script. <br /> <br /> The action takes place alone when 007 tries to save a kidnapped woman on a remote desert island. He sends several guards armed with machine guns and frees the woman, only so that she stabs him in the side when he is not looking. It seems that this whole sequence was an exercise developed by M (Edward Fox from The Day of the Jackal) to test Bond's ability. The new M does not share the use of its predecessor field agents. M decides that Bond must clean his system of all "free radicals", and sent 007 to Shrubs. While in the suburban clinic, Bond notices the suspicious activity between the nurse and the patient and notices while watching them. The nurse is nothing more than SPECTER's murderer Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera from Dr. Moreau's Island), and she is responsible for ensuring that no one sees US Air Force officer Jack Petachi (Havan O'Herlihi from Superman 3). Petachi is part of the SPECTER plan, made by millionaire businessman Maximilian Largo (Klaus Maria Brandauer from Out of Africa), to blacken the world powers by stealing two nuclear warheads. The villains implant a double eyeball in Captain Petachi, who has access to very sophisticated computers and can order weapons. After he stole a weapon for SPECTER, Fatima Blush knocks him out of the way, throwing his beloved snake on his knees, and then attaches explosives to his broken car and blows it up. Indeed, the first part of Never Say Never, other than the SPECTER planning conference, belongs to Fatima because she controls Petati’s stay in the clinic and then repeatedly tries to kill Bond, alone at sea with sharks, and then in a motel room. with an explosive device. <br /> <br /> In the end, Bond meets the beautiful blonde Domino (Kim Basinger from “Mother Lode”) and sneaks into the Largo charity banquet at the Monte Carlo casino, where they meet in a complex video Game called “Domination” to see who will rule the world. The bond is superior to him, and Largo now hates him twice, because 007 is his only competitor to Domino and the spike on his side, which even Fatima, it seems, cannot remove. Bond and Fatima figure it out after a motorcycle chase, when he returns the service and blows it up. Their early encounter in the Bahamas, when she attached the device to lure the shark after him, is rather lame. As in the original Thunderball, the villains return captured nuclear warheads to the sea, but only the warheads themselves. <br /> <br /> Bond flies to the Bahamas, where he meets his diplomatic representative Nigel Small-Fawcett (none Less than Rowan Atkinson from Mr. Bean, who is concerned that Bond can kill someone and spoil the paradise island Of course, Nigel Small-Fawcett serves as a source of comic relief for the film. The CIA sends Felix Leiter (Bernie Casey) The Weapon of the Magnificent Seven to back up Bond. For the first time an African American portrayed Leiter. Bond faces its share of the problems associated with saving Dominoes from Arab slave traders, while Leiter and he save the world. ” Never say never ”is a richly respectable James Bond thriller with a lot of neat touches, but it never creates the atmosphere of danger that Bond franchise films have. Indeed, “Never Say Never” looks like a worthy production of the Theater Masterpiece 007.
