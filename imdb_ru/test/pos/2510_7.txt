Although it is definitely a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours and is always worth seeing, this film never reaches a goal that should be for two reasons. First, after the first forty-five minutes or so, he focuses on Helen and Johnny, who are far less interesting characters than most others — Janet, Jennifer, George, and Miss Scattergoods are much more tempting. Although at first it works, because in life we ​​do not always know everything about everyone else, and since it is emphasized that, perhaps, Helen is a little involved in herself, she is quickly exhausted, and we want to see more of the other characters. . <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film seems to lose its relevance from the point of view of the plot in the second half. The letter itself is of much less importance than in the first half, and, again, although it works well in some respects, it seems strange to leave so much potential displayed in the first half. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is sweet and good-natured, with some really fun moments - for example, Janet explains the seasonings to an avid audience. The lazy, but quietly desperate atmosphere Helen feels is heavy, and the feeling of life in a small seaside town is accurately depicted, but the film is not as intelligent as it tries to be. It’s just boring to be a light romantic comedy and an intelligent portrait of life. Still, it’s still good, and if you have a chance, it’s definitely worth a look.
