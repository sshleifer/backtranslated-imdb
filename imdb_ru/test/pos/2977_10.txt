I was attracted to Friends by the soundtrack, which was recorded by a very young and not yet famous Elton John, whom I saw at a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea about the emotions and the influence of the film. I was recently returned to the film with a song that Heart made under the name “Seasons”, and then I discovered that Elton John's song “Friends” thinks it is the same song ... it was 35 years ago. One way or another, the flow of emotions from the Friends has returned, as if he saw an old photograph of your first true love. I have more memories of how the film struck me than about the actual details of the production, plot, and so on. So forgive me for a rather bad review. I remember that I invited a couple of special friends on a date to watch a movie, and they were just as excited and wept at the end, just like me. I'm worried and nervous to find a copy and see it now. So many films that then seemed so important to me (that is, “Graduate”, “Easy Racer”), now just seem silly, and I don’t want it to fall into one category. But I will find it, and if it turns out to be stupid, then at least I can turn my wife into a great ... no ... great soundtrack. When we met, we went through the "Last Tango in Paris." The young people I work with (I am 56 years old) respect my opinion, but it is difficult to explain the feelings of the sixties, as well as films and songs that reflect such strong feelings, but seem a bit "aged" now. I just can't understand, the aging process is a movie ... or me. “Friends” is a special, sensitive and wonderful film. I am sure this will give me a lot of special feelings. By all means, rent or buy a copy ... India then was not as strong as it is now.
