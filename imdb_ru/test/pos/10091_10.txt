I have to say that I am an avid fan of horror films, and at the moment I canâ€™t get enough foreign horror. Because American horror really depends heavily on blood. <br /> <br /> This movie is fantastic. This film reminded me very much of the Sixth Sense of M. Knight. The way the film was directed was great. The director was in no hurry to set everything up. It took about 40 minutes to turn a movie into a horror movie. I thought the film was just a drama. This film only accumulates, and the payback is not too great. <br /> <br /> I have never done this before, but this is the main reason I liked the movie .... I actually screamed out loud because one scene just hit me ... something kind of sorry ... but it's great for a movie.
