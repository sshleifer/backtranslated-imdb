Images control this film. Characters, although interesting, will eventually recede into the background. The first scene I remember is a black and white frame of the ocean, which then opens in full screen and in color. The bubbling of water gives way to a small coffin that breaks the surface. The theme of the film here is that death can be accepted and brought into the realm of the living. <br /> <br /> Water as a higher consciousness, as an instrument of God, is used here to make people bring their “houses” in order (Judgment Day). The dead should be counted and delivered to the best place. Anything that remains unresolved or unresolved will be washed away. There is no attachment to the past, to the hidden memory of what happened. <br /> <br /> This film is compared to the film “Oh, brother, where are you”, and the threat of water and its use as a cleansing force is similar to this film. This film is different in that the coming of water can be understood, and, again, the emphasis is on what needs to be done with the help here and now. <br /> <br /> I agree that some scenes resemble the work of David Lynch. Take, for example, the dinner segment with a deep and androgynous waitress. A person gets the same surreal feeling from the setting and the strange character as from the speaker in the scene from Fire Starter. The difference is that Lynch attacks us with an image to express the psychological processes of the problem character, while this film seems to use surrealistic elements to create a moral message. Men in black suits cannot have anything they want - they must be patient and accept what is available.
