I just discovered this obscure 70s horror movie while watching on YouTube. For low-budget efforts, this has a lot of compelling moments in gradual stimulation, resulting in a surprisingly shocking end. While there is one woman who constantly takes off her shirt, the fact that she is a nympho woman makes these scenes important to the story, and there is one scene with a curly young man when he tries to seduce her, which turned me on pulls away made her scream crazy. A young nurse who comes and gets a job is seducing herself, and I'm not surprised that she is posing for the Playboy cover. Some characters are very annoying, and some scenes seem ridiculous. For the most part, however, “Don't Look in the Basement” (this is the name I saw on YouTube) provides enough drama and chill for an entertaining B-movie.
