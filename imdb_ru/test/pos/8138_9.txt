This short film intends to focus on one issue, sociologically known as cultural shock. The film tells about the state of the average Romanian in democratic Romania, who learns that life and problems are no different from the communist period, and if you want something, you have to bribe in order to get it. <br /> <br /> Our main character is fired after some time, he is about 50 years old, and he needs to get a similar job, but the only available job is the youngest one. He is forced to take it due to lack of money. <br /> <br /> My opinion is that you have to live in Romania in order for this film to be as real and tragic as it seems.
