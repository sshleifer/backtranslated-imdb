I remember watching Elizabeth Montgomery's film when I was maybe 5 years old (if that is the case), and to this day I can remember this film (just in parts). It was a movie that I remember for a lifetime, because I was so scared. I think I remember part of the story, and the house was constantly getting dark. the main part, which was the most bizarre for me, was that Elizabeth walked around the house in the dark, and then someone was in the field outside. At the time, I thought I was an old witch, but the memories of it are now a bit hazy, so I can't remember who it was, but it was someone who was definitely hidden in the field ... and this part infuriated me most. I really would like to see this movie again. if anyone knows how to get a copy, please email me at valid908@yahoo.com
