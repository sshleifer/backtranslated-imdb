I saw Anatomy when it came out, and recently bought it, and the sequel of 2003, and since I watch a lot of foreign films in different genres, you will probably have to watch movies in the original language. Not only is it annoying that the voices do not belong to the actors, but they always seem funny, as if the whole movie is one big long advertisement for toothpaste or something like that. Because of this, a terrific movie seems terrible, and I had to draw the attention of many of my friends who used to think that foreign films are not as good as North American ones - that they are not “quite Hollywood”. In addition, they never translate correctly, they are too literal and spoil the atmosphere of the film, even if it basically says the same thing. Last week, I myself watched Anatomy in German, and then with subtitles from my roommate, because he was sitting on his laptop and didn’t want to skip parts when he couldn’t see the subtitles, because he was typing. 30 minutes later, and he begged me to let him finish his work, and then start the film with subtitles. He loved it! Both films are awesome, like intelligent horror movies! Kelly
