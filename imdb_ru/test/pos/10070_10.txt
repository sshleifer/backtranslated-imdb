Do not listen to what critics have always said about this cute, charming little film. Madonna is gorgeous in this clever comedy. I worked in a video store for several years and offered this film to many buyers - no one NEVER returned it or shouted at me for telling them to rent it. Everyone always enjoyed it. This is really a great movie for kids too.
