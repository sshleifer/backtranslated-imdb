A wonderful film about the arrival of the early silent film in China. SHADOW MAGIC cleverly combines a love story with a drama of cultural clash between ancient Chinese traditions and modern western culture in the form of a film. The amazing first film of Chinese director Ann Hu. If I correctly understood Ms. Huâ€™s comments at the 2000 Sundance Festival, this film was shot as an American film with co-financing from the Chinese government and shot in China. SHADOW MAGIC reminds me of films such as IL POSTINO and CINEMA PARADISO - not necessarily in the subject or plot, but they have a similar feeling.
