Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure is a cool movie with which many children today can relate. This is a well-presented story about a child who longs for the freedom to do things his own way, and how he achieves this freedom is only part of what makes this film interesting. Just forget about tiny disappointments, such as the fact that there were only adults in this film based on the puppy's point of view, because this is only 0.5% or less of the film’s wonderful effect on the viewer. Great music, a lively game, talented animation and direction, as well as a powerful storyline tell about the difference between freedom in the streets of New England and a cozy home with family. And that no matter how bad everything looks, your family and friends are “always there” to help you in any difficult situation. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to get a soundtrack!
