This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film (which is excellent). He takes the basic premise - the man was poisoned and spends the rest of the film, trying to find his killer. But I like the fact that the screenwriters chose an English professor instead of a private member as the main character. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film moves fast enough so that you do not sleep. But what darkens this film is a strange, obsolete quality (probably due to the horrible music of the 80s), combined with the feeling of noir. Dennis Quaid inexplicably grins throughout the film at odd moments, but he is still irresistible in general. Meg Ryan is good as a student assistant / love interest. When a movie gets bad, it's when Dex (prof) meets a British bodyguard / chauffeur, and their duels are pretty funny. The bodyguard works for a rich widow (played by the beautiful Charlotte Rampling), but these scenes are too shy to help the film move forward, although the family “storyline” is quite interesting. Dex also continues to appear in the same place and find this bodyguard, which is rather random. In the last part of the movie, the man was shot by the window, and from the outside you see him jumping out of him - that was a pretty bad direction. But apart from some of these obvious flaws, I think it's still ok. Of course, I did not predict the final, so it was good - there was a turn, and although some posters here think that they were misled, I thought it was a good and plausible end. Dennis Quaid, with his strange grins and black eyes, is prettier in “Right Things,” “Fireballs,” “Inner Space,” and in Cold Creek Manor. But here, like Dex, he must be something of a jerk, so he coped. Pretty decent movie.
