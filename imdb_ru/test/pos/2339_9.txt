All novice directors should watch this film - it is in itself as a master class in digital filmmaking. Some scenes look as if they were shot at a much higher production rate than they actually were. It is very encouraging that such a well-executed part of the work can be done with a small budget. The acting is very good, and the characters are very interesting, especially the heroine (John Kilti), who manages to play a teenager who has difficulties, while remaining really cute. His beautiful, but withering mother was also very well depicted, and the relationship between her and her boss was very intriguing. This is a very unusual, interesting part, and I will look for something else, made by the same team. The director is definitely one to watch.
