Comeundone, I love you! I could not come to a better conclusion than you about this film, and it ends. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time I looked at him alone and found that it had a strong influence on me. Although the film is very long, I was tied to the story and amazed at the ending. At first I thought it was strange how she just disappeared, but at some level it makes sense. <br /> <br /> But, as Comundon said, this film does not make sense of reality. Instead, it makes the viewer think about what the word “normal” means. It also gives you the opportunity to personally think about what the final means, I can say that I liked how it happened, and I am happy for Mitya.
