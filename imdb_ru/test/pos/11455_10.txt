This film took me by surprise. The initial credit sequence includes a beautifully made animation. After that, we plunged into a semi-ridiculous production, betraying it with a low budget. Characters, typical American teenagers, are introduced slowly, with more personal details than is usual in such films. By the time the drummer hits the fan, we know each of the characters and either love or hate them according to their individuality. It's a slow climb, sort of like riding a really high roller coaster. Fortunately, as soon as the action begins, this is a full-blown old school HORROR! The effects of the makeup of Steve Johnson are amazing. Equal in quality to movies with a large budget. And fears are shaking. Kevin Tenney presents his best film in the entire history, with heartbreaking surprises and terrible alarming settings. Mocking, sometimes stupid, humor marks this film as the pure horror of the 80s, unlike the moody tone of the earlier genre, like “Night of the Living Dead” or “The hills have eyes”. But for true horror fans, this one is worth checking out. Play it as the first entry on a double count with the 1999 haunted house on the Haunted Hill remake. The setting and dynamics of the characters are so similar that you really wonder what movie they actually reworked?
