I was ten years old when I watched Subspecies, I immediately had ideas for Michael Watson and Laura Tate, they do have some great screen chemistry in the early parts of the film. I ordered a copy in 1993 from the Full Moon and learned this: the servants Ion and Rose play a much more important role in the script along with the King. What most people don’t know is that an alternate sequence should have appeared in the final scene: Michelle and Stefan are being pushed into the room, and Michelle has an idea for Stefan to make her a vampire to help defend Rada and her demonic controlled former friends . However, for one reason or another, this script never did it on camera. Another scene in the script, which can be confirmed in the original trailer, shows that Stefan is drinking blood from a wolf, or actually in a trailer you see how he picks up blood on his chin. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 9 because it's from my childhood, and I have nice memories associated with the characters; Despite the fact that Stefan and Michel were my favorite characters, I think that Anders Hove's “Radu” is a purely sensual, evocative action, so many feelings in his work.
