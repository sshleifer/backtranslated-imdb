Even if you are not a “theater man,” I strongly recommend that you see it. Based on the play of Christopher Bond of the same name (which, in turn, is based on the old London legend), Sondheim did a wonderful job, bringing it to the stage of musical theater. The score is simply amazing - certainly the best of Sondheim, and perhaps one of the best written for the musical in history. The show was filmed very well, my only complaint was that Betsy Jocelyn portrayed Joanna. This is good, note, and she is a very versatile actress, but she does not sing very well "Goldfinch and Linnet Byrd." But other than that, it's all phenomenal - Angela Lansbury * made * the role of Mrs. Lovett, and she just does it so well. George Hearn was a good substitute for Len Kariu in the title role, and Ken Jennings played a great Tobias. The ending will give you chills. Top marks for a great show.
