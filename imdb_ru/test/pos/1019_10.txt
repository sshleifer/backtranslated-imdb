Well, I love this movie !!!!! I watched it over and over. It's hard to say who the attacker is. You continue to think that this is one person, then another, then again the first person, then the other person. He is so intensely full that you want to rewind the TV to the end to find out who he is. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: Gail Osborne is raped and left in his home. She is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped. She goes from her meeting with her regular boyfriend, to her teacher, who she likes, to her ex-boyfriend, all different stories, all suspects. But who did it? <br /> <br /> I love acting skills, they have a lot of great talents here. The wait is great and the settings are excellent. If this happens on TV, watch it. *** 1/2 stars 10/10
