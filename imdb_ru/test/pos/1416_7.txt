Brief history of time. The cosmological content of this documentary is exciting, thought, and man ... brilliant. And yet it was hard for me to enjoy this documentary. <br /> <br /> The way family members and professors are interrogated seems unnatural. These members were interviewed on purpose-built kits and received uncomfortable instructions. Mostly, their reports looked very active and forcibly directed. The (intentional) non-inclusion of the questions asked leads to the manipulation of this information in a very sharp and impersonal format. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know who is responsible for the interview, but they did a terrible job, and it took away the impression from the audience. <br /> <br /> In general, a fascinating documentary film that is worth seeing at least for interesting concepts presented.
