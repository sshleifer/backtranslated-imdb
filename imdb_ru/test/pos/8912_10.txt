Alien Warrior (or King of the Streets) is one of those 80s gems that you accidentally stumble upon, then watch the shock, wondering how surprisingly stupid and excessive it becomes. <br /> <br /> A rather wild alien arrives on earth (or rather, in Los Angeles) and stumbles upon the world of drug dealers, gangs and corrupt police officers. He falls in love with a beautiful flaxen-haired teacher who only wants to help the children in the city read further. He also manages to piss off a drug addict who snorts from a Coca-Cola who swears to destroy him. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this movie when I first watched it ... I'm sure it is stupid, stupid, and low-budget. But you can say that the filmmakers had their heart in the right place, and damn it if it didn't work! I only pray that it will be on DVD soon. <br /> <br /> He has a hot soundtrack, break dance, violence, nudity ... all with a positive, helpful message! See it.
