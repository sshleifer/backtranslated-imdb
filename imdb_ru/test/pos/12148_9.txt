The movie “Classic Risks”, directed by Claude Sothe, was not a film, to be honest, I ever really heard about it, until at a cinema forum in New York they said they would have a two-week film with new English subtitles. When I also read that it was in the spirit of classic French crime films a la Jean Pierre Melville, I took the opportunity to check it out (at best, it would appreciate his great work, and at worst I would get some good popcorn in a big theater ). It was worth it to admit it, because Classical Risk is one of those French films that is just waiting to be opened (or opened for the first time). With a tremendous effort, Sote keeps tensions in a tense position for the first forty minutes of the film, maintaining a good (if not large) middle part, and then ending up with what is always expected with these films, but with fascinating motives with the help of characters. With the movie in this spirit, you know how it will end, but this is a cool, observant journey that matters. <br /> <br /> The film is a performance with some real truth and honesty, among the "Criminal Code of the Old School", Lino Ventura as Aldo, who at the beginning of the film (one of the best beginnings of the film in this genre and country) steals a huge amount of money with his crime partner.) Suddenly, at night, on the beach, an unpleasant turn of fate happens, Aldo is again on the run with two young children. He gets help from Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo, the role in tune with Le Doulos) greater humanity and charisma), which The thief is also a thief and takes him to Paris. But there are some problems with some of Aldo’s old business partners, and one old account may be just the right ticket. The plot may seem slow a couple of times, but it’s not like that. Like Melville, Sotet isn’t admits no fat in its history, and it is a very tightly structured film, with some good doses of humor here and there (sometimes I smiled at the boldness of the criminals in the initial chase sequence, as well as with a particular woman who had a fastidious thing with her cat and yboy). <br /> <br /> Along with the great score of the great George DeLair, exceptional cinematography and a mood that is rarely met, not to mention complying. Currently, Classe Tous Risks is a reminder of the bridge between the real old school film. and criminal films of the last days. The gangsters in these new films, The Life of the Bandits, have the 1000th class and the honor of the thieves in this film and are the second banana for the work of Melville and Jules Dassin (compliment, I assure you). It also helps that he has a good realistic moral advantage.
