This is not the best Canadian film, IMO. I will not go out of my way and call 3 or 4 better. Just a couple of nights before I saw The Bicycle Thief, a highly rated Italian classic, and there are some parallels. Both directors shot their film at a certain time and place, with minimal resources from the point of view of the set and the actors. And the result in both cases is exciting and a joy to watch a realistic setting and only characters. Prolonged shots on faces and landscapes almost make it worthy of attention. At the same time, this is not quite in the same league as the Italian classics. Filmed in the cold, deserted city of Quebec, where asbestos is mined. This frigidity contrasts with the warmth of the people and the look of the director Claude Jutra. In fact, you get a series of vignettes, which are probably nostalgic memories of Utre — not ha-ha, funny — but poignant, and probably sometimes difficult at the time, but now heated by patina nostalgia. The film squirms; There is a little stress. Somewhere around half or two-thirds of the way the story begins. Everyone you met up to this point is involved, and you know these characters quite well; so a little patience from the start. The story is good; it makes you think and includes sex, love and death, all the basic elements. If you like Bergman, Godard, Truffaut and all that, you will not be disappointed with this.
