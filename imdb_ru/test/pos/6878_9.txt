“House Calls” is a wonderful romantic comedy that can best be described as “how they made them.” Starring Walter Mattau (in one of his best roles), the recently widowed doctor, who again goes on the dating scene and gets into salary, because he seems to have another woman every night. Then he meets the hospital patient Glenda Jackson and soon establishes a relationship with her. But this is one that will be rigorously tested, as she informs him that she is a woman with one man and expects that he will be a man with one woman. <br /> <br /> This is a cute, very funny movie, in which the main role is played by Art Karni. Senior Hospital Doctor and Richard Benjamin as a friend and ally of Mattau. This is a must see for any Mattao fan or light comedy lover. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
