Edith Nesbitt's best book has been turned into a truly great movie, I love it. The film itself has excellent cinematography and an excellent realization of the subject. The end is enough to cry how beautifully done. Lionel made some really excellent films, such as The Amazing Mr. Blunden, but this is his best film as a director for a mile. The costumes were absolutely cute, which matched the beauty of the countryside, and the sparkling and comfortable-precise scenario helped things. Nevertheless, it is the quality of acting that unites this film, since it is no shorter than the incredible. Dina Sheridan is accordingly sincere as a mother, a very necessary character trait, and Bernard Cribbins was as cheerful as Perks. In fact, I preferred Perks on the film, since it is not so humorous in the book. The kids were beautiful. Gary Warren and Sally Tomsett both gave energetic performances, but this charming image of Jenny Agutter Bobby that impressed me most. Another special mention is the great music of Johnny Douglas, the name of the music reminded me of “The Smile of Charlie Chaplin”. In conclusion, a funny and sharp masterpiece, which is better than a book, I think. 10/10 Bethany Cox
