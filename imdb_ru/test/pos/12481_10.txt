One of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The performance of Louis Jouvet is fantastic. He really "fulfills" his role, and this is wonderful. He is such a good actor that you cannot think of anyone else to take part in it. <br /> <br /> Both Susie Delaire and Bernard Bleyer are as good as ordinary French people, trying to defend themselves in a fight born of murder ... <br /> <br /> The story is breathtakingly embedded. You can feel the atmosphere of Paris in this period (approximately 1930-40), between the two wars ... Clubs, old small buildings, neighbors. <br /> <br /> All this contributes to a great movie.
