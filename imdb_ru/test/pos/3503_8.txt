Sasha Baron Cohen - a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film barely achieves the quality of a television show, it is still very funny and has some evil moments! I liked Ali G since I first saw the material from the show. I think he is one of the best comedic characters of all time ... there, say, Peter Dragon ("Action") and the Blues Brothers. The biggest surprise of this film was that they really have serious actors who do this (Dance and Gambon). After that, I will respect them even more, because I have the common sense to take advantage of this opportunity. I can't say anything bad about this movie, it's very funny. Very young, but hey, so what ?! <br /> <br /> One more thing, mister. G: PLEASE PLEASE! <br /> <br /> **** / *****
