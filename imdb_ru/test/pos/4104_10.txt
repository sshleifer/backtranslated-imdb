This may be a remake of the Capra film of 1937, but it is wrong to consider it only in this way! It was supposed to open the Hilton novel in a completely different way. Like a musical excellent. The scenery is awesome, good characters, and anyone, for example "Leonard Maltin", who considers Barakharahaâ€™s music to be terrible, must be completely deaf! I highly recommend it.
