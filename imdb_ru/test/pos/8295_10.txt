I liked this film, it was a magnificent image of a family that had many ups and downs, but in the end they knew that they loved each other. I saw a lot of movies with Jakleen Smith in the lead role, but oh, it was one of her best films, although it was released 12 years ago. There was a star cast in this film, and what I liked the most was that he opened my eyes to see other actors I hadnâ€™t seen before. This film was quite long, but I enjoyed every minute. This is a film that you can sit down with your family and watch, although we will have to turn the eyes of children several times due to discretionary love scenes. In general, I rate this film on a scale from 1 to 10 points. Lifetime does not show it enough, so if anyone knows which store it is for sale, let me know because it is necessary.
