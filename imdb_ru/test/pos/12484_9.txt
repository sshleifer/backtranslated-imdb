Clouseau followed Le Corbo, where no one knew who composed the poison, so everyone was suspected, with another masterpiece, Quai des Orfevres, four years later, in which we know from the very beginning (or we think we know) who did it. Louis Zhuv with top accounts does not appear for forty minutes, and by that time Kloso created a rich environment of Music Hall, music publishing houses, etc., as well as a wonderful set of colorful characters; Similar to Angela Lansbury (Lansbury appeared in the Paris Woman in the same year) Susie Delaire is considered a singer whose desire to improve her role is inspired by her husband’s husband / accompanist Bernard Bleere, who follows her into the nursing home of Lechi, only to find him is dead. From here things are not going as it should, his car is hijacked before he leaves the premises, so his alibi prepared in advance is outside the window, while, unknown to him, his wife confesses to killing his neighbor-photographer, who is in love with the closet. she, who voluntarily returns to the scene of the crime and takes away Deler's scarf, and while she is there, thoughtfully wipes the prints of the murder weapon, bottles of champagne. At this point, the investigator Jouve interferes, and since then the matter has been that the plates rotate in the air. The exit of Closo was relatively small, but practically all of this was, as Spencer Tracy said in a different context, “chers”, with Le Salaire de peur and Les Diaboliques still ahead. In short, this is a must for lovers of French cinema.
