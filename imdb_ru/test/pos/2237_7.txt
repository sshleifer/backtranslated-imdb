I filmed this film late on TV and waited for a low-budget “masterpiece”; I was surprised by a rather decent film. Angelina Jolie's unique acting abilities (or should I say the lack of such?) Make her an excellent android, and other actors, although terribly average, are at least not terrible. <br /> <br /> There is a plot; a rather complicated plot involving conspiracies and lengths, for which the couple (one person, one android) will pursue their illegal affair, with the “big brother” figure and the android killer thrown into the mix. Production and sets were also much better than I expected. I have not seen the original Cyborg, so I cannot compare it with many others; Of course, this film is not Blade Runner, but as a late night, a futuristic pleasure from guilt, it is worth seeing.
