This film, in which there are only two characters, brings you closer to these two people, the investigator and the prisoner, than in most of the films any character, no matter how well thought out. <br /> <br /> Pure confusion, terror and the pain that Madeleine Stoweâ€™s character is deeply disturbing, as is the sadistic but charming investigator Alan Rickman. <br /> <br /> This film is too possible and develops to a shocking apogee, the effect of the film as a whole leaves you sitting in silence at the end. It will haunt you for a long time.
