The second in the trilogy of director Cohen about the comedies of the Second World War (the others - "Separate us to death" and "Adolf Hitler - my role in his fall") - this is the forecast forecast for the long-standing (and very beloved) situation of the BBC. comedy. Like most television shows, this film suffers from a lack of plot and is rather a compilation of sketches. Some of them work better than others, for example, a scene where a high-ranking army officer is floating on a river is an unforgettable, surreal moment. <br /> <br /> The joy of this film is a vision of the past, which England probably never existed, which is defined by the picturesque countryside and the opportunity that it offers to see veteran thieves, such as John Le Mesourie, given their main roles in the movie. Arthur Lowe is great in the role of Captain Meinwaring, a bandler, who, when the chips do not work, shows great courage and saves the day (the culmination of the character is probably the greatest moment of the character). <br /> <br /> Episodes of the television series are certainly funnier, but as an introduction to British legend, you cannot find anything better.
