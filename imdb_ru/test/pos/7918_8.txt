It is important to understand that Eisenstein was a staunch Marxist filmmaker who adhered to some very specific and specific theories about what a film can achieve and how. <br /> <br /> It is simply useless to compare Alexander Nevsky with anything negative for the same period in the United States; This film comes from the oldest film school in the world, from another continent, from a completely different approach to cinema. <br /> <br /> To appreciate this film a little more, try to learn about the theories of editing Pudovkin and Kuleshov. For example, or read the Wikipedia article on the theory of Marxist cinema. If you feel really brave, you can even explore the triad forms of Hegelian dialectics. <br /> <br /> It follows from this that if you watch this film without some understanding of Eisenstein's ideas and ideals, you probably won’t get it. In Alexander Nevsky, the main characters do not play themselves, they must be the embodiment of the character of their nation. Nevsky and his generals are deliberately shown more than life, because they represent the stylized, heroic aspects of the entire Russian people. <br /> <br /> The action is not wooden, it should be slightly educated. It is a school, completely different from the more naturalistic, narrative style that Hollywood quickly adopted. Eisenstein's films are specifically designed, not realistic. If something seems “obvious,” whether it's lighting, language, or a pose that the actor is affecting, then it should be. Eisenstein was one of the first proponents of cinema as an art form, not just entertainment. <br /> <br /> If sometimes it seems that editing consists of a collision of images, then this is the idea. Frames are designed to contrast with each other, Eisenstein’s films contain and embody elements of a political / philosophical argument, namely the Marxist dialectic. <br /> <br /> So sit back, shout out the cheers of Russia and its defenders, the national hero, the cowardly nobles and the Teutonic invaders, and enjoy the difference.
