I really liked this movie, and I usually don't like animated pictures. But I thought the cats were attractive, and the storyline was charming. There is a good song called “Everyone wants to be a cat”, it’s very fun. It has some comic moments and an interesting adventure. I think it helps to be a passionate cat lover to enjoy this movie.
