According to Colin Wilsonâ€™s book, Cosmic Vampires. This (in my humble opinion) is one of the best horror works of Sci-Fi from the eighties. The effects (made by ILM) still meet modern standards. The actors are mostly British, and the British seem to give this film a greater depth of realism. <br /> <br /> The film was strongly criticized by critics, and, unfortunately, it failed to succeed at the box office on both sides of the Atlantic. , Tobe Hooper blamed the advertising work that was done before its release, as the main reason for its low earnings. But for some reason, this still does not detract from the fact that this is a great film with a great cast and a well thought out plot. <br /> <br /> Not to be overlooked.
