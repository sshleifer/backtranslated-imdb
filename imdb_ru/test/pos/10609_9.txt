I had no expectations (I never saw the preview of "Marigold"), and I liked the characters, modern music and sharp dances in this carefree movie. Although 98% of the conversations are in English (which is great for me), I would like the DVD to have subtitles to help in some quick moments when the characterâ€™s accent may be difficult to understand. I would not judge this film by Bollywood films, but only by merit as fun entertainment (a film about musical people). <br /> <br /> I got hooked on Ali Larter as an actress (and her interview in the Bonus material indicates that she is a good person). Since then I have watched this movie several times (each time it gets better).
