Located in Venice mainly on the Lido, Visconti's “Death in Venice” is the triumph of filmmaking, combining the distinctive characteristics of Dirk Bogard and expert photography of the resort area in all its various everyday moods. For those who love Venice, this is a film to keep. <br /> <br /> Mahler’s music, often heard throughout the film, intensifies the drama. The mood that it creates is not always happy. But what else can you expect with such a name? <br /> <br /> There are not many dialogues in the film. Rather scant actually. These are mainly background noises and chatter and laughter among hotel guests. An intriguing part is the interpretation of the exchange of views between Gustav von Ashenbach, a famous composer, and slender teenager Tadzio, who occasionally see each other at the tables of the hotel’s dining room, on the beach and in strange unexpected places. around venice. It seems that at first they shyly acknowledge the presence of each other, a little more than the suggestion of a smile, but later - with a strong, exciting and urgent look. <br /> <br /> Each viewer will have their own interpretation. The composer lost his own child. Is this behavior an expression of longing for the child he loved? Is this sexual attraction to this fragile young man with his dazed somewhat girlish look possible? Could he find a new inspiration for a musical masterpiece not yet written? Who knows? <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, this film reflects the true spirit of Venice of the 19th century. The elegance of ladies, chaise lounges on the sand, children frolic in bathing suits from neck to knees, the glow of sunsets and the general sense of satisfaction from the world. While some may think that the tempo is sometimes rather slow, the film has a generally mild quality, but with boiling indecision between two depressed people. Get ready for a sad and beautiful finale.
