This French study of disgruntled youths of the 50s (in the early 20s, in fact, “matured” but not yet accustomed to the adult world), probably missed the mark in terms of an accurate description of the 1958 French youth. (Doesn't practically ALL youth films made by adults do not do this? Those who don’t do that - River's Edge comes to mind are really rare), but screenwriter Marcel Carne from Les Enfants du Paradis is famous for too accurate observer of humanity to NOT give an insightful picture of the nature of these characters. In a sense, the details are not important - you could change the details and install this film today, and it would work just as well - but the loneliness and uncertainty, the superficial passion and complacency of the characters' anger are well reflected. Young Pierre Bryce and Jean-Paul Belmondo play minor roles, but the leading ones Jacques Charrieux, Laurent Terziev, Pascal Petit and Andrea Parisi play roles with subtlety and depth. There is also a wonderful jazz score, which you can get on CD JAZZ IN PARIS - JAZZ & CINEMA VOL. 2. Unlike some who commented on the film, I do not see the director Karn, who would judge these characters - he seems to be an objective observer for me. Of course, these middle-class characters may seem spoiled by people who have nothing to whine to some viewers of the film from the working class, and I think Karn surely knows about this. For this American viewer (I watched a duplicate, I would say, literally, version of this game called THE CHEATERS), the film represents an interesting window to France in the 1950s. It is also deliberately poetic (the scene on the ledge saving the cat is just one example of this) and has intellectual aspirations in such a charming way that only French films can go - I can imagine the power Melodramatic, shallow way that this kind of material would be processed American studio production, and sensational, moralistic, suggestive way that this kind of material would be handled by American cinema driving / exploiting . I feel that Marcel Karn caught the gist of this period, say, between the end of high school and the fact that by the beginning of the 1930s people were largely established in the routine, whatever it was. Those who want to watch a film with an open mind and not look back at the many easy goals that it offers should find a serious and valuable study of people in their early twenties. And even if you do not want to do this, you can go to another room while playing the film and just enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with great jazz and instrumental pop music of the 50s, including the wonderful original score by the American “Jazz at Philharmonic”, which includes Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Goetz (titled “Goetz”), Roy Eldridge and Ray Brown.
