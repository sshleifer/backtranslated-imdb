I just saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival at the beautiful Elgin Theater. I was amazed by the wonderful cinematography, the brilliant adaptation of a very tricky play and, last but not least, the brilliant play by Al Pacino, who was born to play this role, which was perfectly balanced by the equally strong play of Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> The film deftly explores the themes of love versus loyalty, law versus justice, and passion versus reason. Some may argue that content is inherently anti-Semitic, but they should take into account the historical context of the story and the delicate and nuanced way it is told in this adaptation. <br /> <br /> 9/10
