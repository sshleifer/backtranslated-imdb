If this is not my favorite movie of all time, it is definitely among the top five. I like it. Everything is perfect in this - clothes, scenery, lines - yes, they are not like normal people, but ... even small scenes, especially at the beginning of office girls, who change clothes, choosing wedges, watering the plant with ivy in the office, laying lunch in the fridge ... Identical to what we, office girls, are doing today in 2005. I think all the minor characters are beautiful. If someone, like Joan Crawford, rolls over, it's all part of a package. If you choose a lot of things in the film, it will become obvious that this was the beginning of the sixties, when women started to “stay up”, at least if they didn’t want to. For example, if the characters are contradictory, for example, the character Suzy Parker behaves as if she throws everything, but then becomes too attached to the character Louis Jourdan, isn't that what many people look like - contradictory? They are mixed in real things with scenes such as the character Diane Baker, who finds the love of his life after he brings his illegitimate child in an accident - lies in a hospital with a big old bandage on his head. This is also part of the package, this charm is a glossy escape. I like the combination of real-life stories that are relevant today (the stereotypical career of a woman who has relationships only with married men and therefore has no family when she is older) with those that make you want, “oh, if only I could get in love with Doctor, and he will love me, although he knows my dirty past and saw how I spoiled everything after a scandalous accident !! "Besides, I just got a DVD, widescreen, it's even more beautiful than fullscreen ... Yes!
