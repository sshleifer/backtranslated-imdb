It was a very good PPV, but, like Wrestlemania XX about 14 years later, WWE filled it with so many matches that some of them were useless. I'm not going to go through every match on the map, because it will take forever. <br /> <br /> However, the highlights included the HUGE popularity of Destruction, winning command belts from Haku and Andre the Giant, the first ever mixed tag featuring Randy Savage and the sensational Queen Sherry against Dusty Rhodes and the late Saphira, and also the first the clash between the Absolute Warrior and the Hulk Hogan. <br /> <br /> Some matches were a waste of time. Like the “Bolsheviks” against the “Hart Foundation”, it was only about 40 seconds, Coco Bi Weir against Rick Martel was not enough, and Big Bosman against Akim was too little. <br /> <br /> Mr. Perfect - Brutus Bifcake and Ted DiBiaz vs. Jake Snake 'Roberts was really very good. <br /> <br /> Overall Grade - B
