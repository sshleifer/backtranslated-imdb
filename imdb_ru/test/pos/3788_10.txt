In one of Charlie Chaplin’s best long shorts, he places the Little Comrade in the trenches of the First World War, where he brings his unbearable politeness and endless patience into the routine work of the trenches where the troops lived for months at a time before finally going beyond overtake the enemy and, as a rule, until his death. To become something so dull, like a trench warfare, in such a brilliant comedy, someone from Chaplin’s skill is required, but the irony that he uses in the film makes even the most uncomfortable conditions very funny. <br /> <br /> All the best of Chaplin’s films, short films and others, this one filled with brilliant and memorable scenes, such as the scene where he marks the killing with a piece of chalk on a blackboard in a trench, erasing one when he gets his helmet off , the scene where he and his fellow soldiers are sleeping under water, opening a bottle of beer and lighting a cigarette, and, of course, overtaking the enemy. All these scenes are show-stoppers, reminiscent of the most wonderful scenes of Chaplin. This should not be missed!
