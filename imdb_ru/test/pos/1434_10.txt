Frankie Mashin (Frank Sinatra), who received a six-month drug rehabilitation program and dedicated himself to distributing cards in illegal card games, has high hopes of becoming clean and gaining new life as a big band drummer. However, returning to his old crime quarter in Chicago, he soon discovers that pressure from people around him, including his wife in a wheelchair Zosh (Eleanor Parker), is increasing to return to the old “Dealer” lifestyle that brings money he entered the path of self-destruction, which is a heroin addict. <br /> <br /> Very rarely in the film are there so many great characters like this one. Frank Sinatra is great, like Frankie Machine, and realistically depicts the symptoms of a drug addict undergoing abstinence, perhaps better than anyone else before him. Sinatra seems to have a deep understanding and awareness of his character here and expresses a constant struggle for control of his own life, which always happens in the heart of a person, which is Frankie Machine. Parker, like his crippled wife Zosh, wants Frankie to take over forever, to “make a deal” to earn good money to take care of her and pay her ever-growing medical bills. She seems frightened by everything that she considers to be a threat to her control over him, such as the freedom that a drummer’s life can offer, or everything that can change the status quo between them. <br /> <br /> The observer Molly (Kim Novak), a girl who lives in the same building and seems to have real, strong sincere feelings for Frankie, not wanting to control him, but only to help him, proves that the best that Frankie does for him in the world is if he can just stay right long enough to wake up and figure it out. Darren McGavin, as a heroin dealer, Louis, nevertheless, is always waiting in the wings, knowing only the right buttons to say, just say, to make the former addict return to this old habit that is good for Louis but deadly for the addict. <br /> <br /> The situation also seems to take on a life of its own, constantly gloomy, sandy, battered and criminal, where there are not enough positive things to expect in life, a place where it is too easy to escape through a bottle or drugs, fast “Correction”, which actually does not correct at all, but works only to keep a person in the dark away from daylight and all the bright prospects that the world can offer. It is pleasant to note that when Frankie is on the right track, the situation always seems brighter than when he is on the wrong road. While some claim that it is a bit outdated, for me this is a sandy film with a realistic inner war in a person for control over one’s own destiny, in which the very strong characters of all the participants are shown. Given this, the MAN WITH THE GOLD OF HAND receives my highest possible recommendation.
