All I have to say is that this film is a bomb. You will cry when you see it. I mean, this is a reminder to everyone how hard and easy it is to fall in love. It reminds you of the days of your youth, when you were carefree, and everything that was bad for you was washed away with a kiss. Although I am still a teenager, this is how I live. When I'm with this kind of person, everything that was negative in my mind was erased. So, I give this film 10 for his emotional message and touching story. Actors Josh Hartnett and Chris Klein I also give 10 for a sweet face.
