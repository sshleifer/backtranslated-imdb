I’m not here to tell you that Armored is Kubrick, Hitchkian, or Fellini Esq. Nope The directors to whom there are references are more like Don Siegel ("Charlie Varrick") and Walter Hill ("Warriors"). These two assistants did not fool around with such subtleties as the inclusion of women in their films. No need to use skirts. They improperly filmed the guys in the movie. Weapons, a lot of weapons. The men met a violent death with a twitching jaw. Their films were like juice in the head. Do you want a friend? Get a dog. <br /> <br /> “Armored” is a movie about guys. Armored truck duels? Bloody gunshot wounds? Exploding money? If it doesn’t excite a part of the lizard’s brain, then stay away. <br /> <br /> After 88 minutes, “Armored” is all muscle without an ounce of fat. We meet with six guards, who drive armored trucks, three per truck. The six, led by Matt Dillon, are planning a fake takeover involving two trucks. One day, their mission is to deliver 42 million dollars from the federal reserve (I think). The idea is to take both trucks to the warehouse, hide the money, and then organize a seizure. Of course, the cops will suspect them, but if they stick together, they will cope. <br /> <br /> The trouble is that one of the six, played by Columbus Short, is an adversary. Initially. But he faces eviction. And he is the guardian for his spoiled little brother. He needs bad money. <br /> <br /> Matt Dillon persuades, pleads, convinces. No blood on anyone's hands. Clean rest. Everything is good, not bad. You will be rich forever. Blue skies are smiling at you ... <br /> <br /> That's right. <br /> <br /> Of course, everything goes to hell. This is one damned thing after another, and the stakes continue to rise. And almost all of this happens claustrophobically in an abandoned warehouse somewhere in Los Angeles. In fact, the film is trying hard to project against the backdrop of the industrial collapse of the city. I like industrial urban decay. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Matt Dillon, who plays the main bad dog. He goes from charming to disappointed, disappointed, outraged and completely insane during the film. Love this guy. <br /> <br /> In addition, the merit lies in the menacing, throbbing, blistering and completely sinister electronic soundtrack of John Murphy. I guess he heard some Tangerine Dream recordings. <br /> <br /> It is also surprising that this is a PG-13 film. I caught one ?? one! ?? F-bomb in the whole movie about violent robbers tough guy. At some level I like it. Take the children. <br /> <br /> The director is Nimrod Antal, a Hungarian who made an excellent performance of noir in the Budapest metro system called “Control” The screenwriter is a guy named James V. Simpson from nowhere. <br /> <br /> Many people are just starting out in this movie. I bet that the respect for the film will increase with time, and these directors will advance in their careers.
