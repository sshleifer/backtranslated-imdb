I must say, I thought the Greek show would be very funny and stupid. Since I am part of the community, I didnâ€™t want Greek organizations to look bad ... <br /> <br /> but I think Greek is fun. Yes, they have stereotypical communication and fraternity, but this is not a mockery, but simply cute humor. <br /> <br /> All the characters are pretty cute, except for Rebecca Logan (I just can't stand her), Casey and Grow good chemistry like brother and sister. Then there is cappy. Who doesn't love a guy like Cappie, haha. His character brings so much to the show. Rusty's roommate, Dale, played by Clark Duke, is also fun. <br /> <br /> Watching the game for the second season is definitely fun. I can't wait to turn it on again !!
