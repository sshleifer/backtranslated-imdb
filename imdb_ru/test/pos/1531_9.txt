This film took me by surprise. I first saw him more than 10 years ago, and he remains with me to this day. He has just boring moments, and I would personally end it differently - it would not in any way dissuade me from watching him again and again and recommending others. Valid _fantastic_. The cast and director do an amazing job with the script, and anyone who loves “different” films, who has the patience to sit down and say, “What the hell is this?” chance. If you just want Alan Rickman to be stupid or to see something explode, this is not a movie for you.
