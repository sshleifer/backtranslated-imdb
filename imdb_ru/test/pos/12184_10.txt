I have to say this movie is just awesome. I do not understand why he received such a low rating. It has romance, music, darkness and vampires. Also Stuart Townsend did a great job, being Lestat, the acting was great. In addition, I usually do not enjoy this music, well, sometimes. But I must say that in this film the music fits him perfectly. If you like dark vampire films, this is definitely for you, or even if you don’t know, there’s a love story in it. But all I can say is one word: Amazing! My rating is defiant: 10 out of 10. In any case, I seriously advise you to watch it. I remember that I had not seen it for years, I watched it again about a year ago, and I became addicted to it again. lol A great movie!!!
