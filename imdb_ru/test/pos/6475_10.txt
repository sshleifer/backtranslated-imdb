The real story of life, perhaps the greatest football coach the game has ever known. Knut Rockn brought the football game out of the "Stone Age" with innovations such as the front passage and the change of offensive formations. But he is probably best known for his motivations in the locker room. On the way, he brought the glory and glory of a tiny, small, unknown Catholic school in Indiana. Pat O'Brien is incomparable in his role as Rockney. Awesome cast, which includes Ronald Reagan, who perfectly plays the role of the first, real superstar of Notre Dame, George Gipp. <br /> <br /> For football fans, this is the greatest football movie ever made. Do yourself a favor and rent a black and white version. (Some versions for some reason deleted scenes). If you get a good version, look for the immortal Jim Thorpe's short cameo when he shoves his head in the dressing room, telling Rocna and the team that they have only a few minutes left before the 2nd half begins.
