Chen Kaige lost his sense of tempo. I envy Europeans and Americans who can watch a film without listening to the dialogue with their ears, because it hurts: it is slow, unnaturally hard and excessively thought out. But Westerners, on the other hand, suffer from the poor quality of translation of subtitles, due to which it is possible to lose all the subtleties and double meanings that make a careful study of the film very exciting.
