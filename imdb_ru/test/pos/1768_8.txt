I suppose I like good things in life, like everyone else, but until five years ago the opera was not part of my entertainment decisions. Oh, I made several attempts to find out what was discussed; I watched several television productions — in particular, fragments of the Wagner’s Ring Cycle on public television — in the hope of understanding other people's passion for art. And I knew that I could like parts of different operas (I remember being surprised as a child that I really liked the fragments of "Madame Butterfly" in "My Geisha", and I liked the opera scenes in "Moonstone" and "Pretty Woman" ) But unlike the characters in these films, I just did not “understand.” <br /> <br /> Then, in 1995, I saw a live performance of Rigoletto, represented by the New York Opera Company, and that was the Night, I "got it." What a wonderful, gorgeous contest of color and music and raw emotions! And I mean emotions with a capital E! The key, I think, is that opera music allows performers to play excessively freely. and believable in a way that would seem silly if their words were spoken. Everything depends on the music, of course, and when music is magic, like in Rigoletto, opera can be great entertainment. /> <br /> A sympathetic family member gave me a laser replica of a television production of an opera in 1982, and I found that since I don’t see the live punch of the Rigoletto State live on a regular basis, this video version is an excellent replacement. Luciano Pavarotti is beautiful in part of the duke; Ingvar Wicksell is excellent as his meanest court jester Rigoletto; and Rigoletto's favorite daughter, Gilda, plays the somewhat rustic Edita Gruberova. The sets and costumes are gorgeous, and the footage from the movie on the river at the end of the film introduces a dramatic plot to the dramatic plot that can never be compared on stage. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen Rigoletto, or if you think that you don’t like or understand the opera, I urge you to find it on videotape and buy or rent it. If you don’t like it, if this Rigoletto production doesn’t make you appreciate the power of the artistic form of the opera, just drop it and move on to something else. But I suspect that if you are new to opera, as I was, you will be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Bill Anderson
