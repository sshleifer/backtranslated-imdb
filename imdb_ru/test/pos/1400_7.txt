Finally, I had the opportunity to stop and compare the two versions of this film that are currently underway: firstly, the good old dark, dirty VHS Embassy print called “SCREAMERS”, and then the new fully restored Italian DVD by everyone’s favorite new media company. No shame Italy. <br /> <br /> American advertisements for "people turned inside out," as everyone says, are completely misleading and show that Roger Kormanized his opinion that it would otherwise be an excellent fantasy thriller. Adventure. is growing. The full Italian version is a somewhat stretched, well thought out and thoughtfully taken “Dr. Moreau's Island”, and there is nothing wrong with that. This is a luxurious, beautiful Euro Horror picnic with intelligence, good storylines, character development, shooting locations, stage costumes and shootings, etc. <br /> <br /> But I have to admit that 14-year-old bog grass with herbal heads still hiding somewhere inside me got a bigger blow from a more sinister, scruffy and untidy version of Roger Corman, in which there is some nice upstairs blood, a luxurious but ridiculous intro segment, and then most of the original Martino film, although a few shortened to make room for entertaining ideas eniya Roger. The pacing was somewhat faster, the shock sequences came closer together, and you see as much of the fantastic form of Miss Bach as in the extended Italian version. <br /> <br /> I still don’t have that much idea of ​​a particular story, though: there are several plot twists and random characters that were rather difficult to track down. The local plot of voodoo did not really help, and it’s funny that everything ends only with another fight between a noble prisoner and a mad scientist ... Perhaps a few more views. I will say this: film fans should take advantage of one of these PAL imports and take a look at what is actually a film, and not just another muddy old home video - widescreen compositions once again show that Martino had an eye to fill his screen interesting things. Nobody tears their heads off, as in the print SCREAMERS, but this is still an interesting material, and another proof that, although its standards may have been largely limited to the area around the gutter, Roger Corman had a new cheesy entertainment when he did it for him, and side by side these are truly better films than they should have been. <br /> <br /> 7/10
