This is one of my favorite movies for many reasons. Let's start with the outstanding performances of the beautiful Debra Paget as the princess / dancing girl, Michael Rennie as the villain, the handsome young Jeffrey Hunter investigating crimes in her city / state and others. The film is an extraordinarily colorful adventure, and we even see the princess rehearsing a dance that she later performs (this time). She manages to turn Hunter before she finds out that he is on her side; also photography, Travilla costumes, Lionel Newman's music and film style are extraordinarily good. Add to this inspirational action, smart characterization and accurate guidance of veteran Harmon Jones from the script of Gerald Drayson Adams, established in 1249 AD, and you get the components of a pleasant Greek Middle East. But there is a lot of praise for the unusual and well-developed storyline, because here you can praise much more than the fast paced film, well-managed sequences of physical actions and excellent technical aspects. Classically trained actors, such as Michael Ansara, Edgar Barrier, Wally Cassell, Jack Elam and Don Drake, are usually not seen in the same movie "B"; and there are no exciting sets, lots of places and the secret of quality that comes here. One way to evaluate the film: “If I was guaranteed that I survived this experience, would I prefer to go through these events and perform these actions?” Since in this case my answer sounds loudly “yes”, this film remains one of my favorites and very underrated cinematographic works. Could it be that the American critics' too frequent disdain for women as warriors and thinkers, which, as in many other cases, made closed minds misjudge the obvious anti-tyrannical and pro-entertainment qualities of this wonderful film?
