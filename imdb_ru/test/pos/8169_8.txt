Last days - the best gay movie of the homosexual genre. Most movies entail juicy stories, one night, and let's not forget the infamous baseball teams? The last days actually contain male affection besides kissing in the dark, and pretty graphic material that made me think about whether the movie belongs to Blockbuster or badpuppy.com. The emotional journey of films is what puts him above the rest of the genre. Only in this film I saw the story of such a strong passion, love and torment that it can bring. I think that when people cry during movies, they need to be beaten, but I found myself crying in several scenes because of the realistic nature in which we live. I suggest every gay man watch this movie, and if you have a boyfriend, thank him ...
