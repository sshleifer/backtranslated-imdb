I was surprised at how the great Moan of the Black Snake turned out to be. Being a fan of Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson, I decided to try. Well, when it was all over, I was just stunned by how good this film was. I mean, everything was fine and very accurate in this regard. This film shows how great director and writer Craig Brewer (who made Hustle & Flow another great movie) can just take something, even something like ludacras, and turn it into this.We, I like how it's just a good time, like a movie that just makes it there in a good way. I also like that he does not show the big stereoes of the South and how he is portrayed in things as the most disgusting place, but not this film, which he makes very accurate and because it repeats very many times. The situation in this film was simply phenomenal, especially from Cristina Ricci (who deserves an Oscar for this role), always great Samuel L. Jackson and even Justin Timberlake did a great job too. Otherwise, everything is wonderful, and although this film is not for everyone, it is definitely worth seeing for anyone who can have a good time. Three Cheers for the Black Snake Moan !!!! <br /> <br /> 9.3 out of 10 stars
