This film is a part of the time in which it was made ..... Realistic. The films were not covered in candy in the late 60s and early 70s. The manufacturers did not try to create some kind of happy ending that did not exist. The absence of a happy ending will cause excitement in the audience, which we hope will push them to action. At least it seemed so at the time. In the modern world of cinema, this film probably will not be made. Definitely, there would be no such ending, however realistic it may be. The sad fact is that the film depicted a situation that could not be improved without actions related to improving the relationship between the white southern traditional thinking and the progressive movements of the time.
