I just went to see this movie because I always liked Kevin Costner. I felt that Ashton did a great job in the butterfly effect. Unfortunately, even though these two actors were / are capable of good, if not excellent acting moments, something was missing here. Some scenes were simply implausible and did not have enough support for the storyline. <br /> <br /> Although the film talks about the impact of Hurricane Katrina, there was very little of this effect (no). . <br /> <br /> In general, I liked the fact that the film tells about what saves lives in terms of water. <br /> <br /> The special effects were pretty good and more than a little intimidating. I'm not sure that I will ever go deep-sea fishing again ... <br /> <br /> I expected a bit more emotion in the movie that was submitted. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie that could have been seen on DVD.
