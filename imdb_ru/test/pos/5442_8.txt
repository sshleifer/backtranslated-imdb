The political satire of the comedian (Williams), who, after the breakdown of political campaigns and presidents, is forced to flee. But we are shockingly winning and mocking the office. "Man of the Year" is not the funniest and not the best film, but in small doses it really works. Williams reunited with Levinson after the hit Good Morning Vietnam. It seems that they are well versed in chemistry and work with each other. I do not compare them with Scorsese and De Niro, but you can get a picture. Although I would not say that you need to hurry and watch a movie in cinemas, I would advise to rent it. This film is comedic, but there is a great satire in it, please, if you like films like “Scary Movie 4 ″, this is not for you, bring your brain to watch it. - ***
