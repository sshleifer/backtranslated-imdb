The second historical drama "Being Warner Brothers", which described the "Civil War" and "Battle for the Little Big Horn" by General George Armstrong Custer, "THEY DIE IN ITS OWN BOOTS" (Warner Brothers, 1941) was much more accurate of two; especially when compared with SANTA FE TRAIL (Warner Brothers, 1940), which did not really set the bar too high. <br /> <br /> Although vehicles were shot for Errol Flynn in both scenes, changes were made in the casting. part of general custer. Whereas the “Dutchman” Ronald Reagan himself portrayed the bright, selfish cavalryman in the earlier picture, where Mr. Flynn played Virginia, and then the general of the Confederation hero, J.E.B. (or jeb) Stuart; Errol took on the role of Custer for the fact that they were dying on their downloads. <br /> <br /> Again, the Warner Brothers propensity to use a large number of reliable characters from the Warner Repertoire Company is used to film a kind of authenticity, and everything really happens right before our eyes. The main roles are played by some more famous actors and actresses, such as: Elizabeth Bacon / Mrs. Custer (film colleague Olivia de Havilland), Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy), Samuel Bacon (Gene Lockhart), The Main Horse (Anthony Quinn), "California" (Charlie Grapvin), Major Type (Stanley Ridges), General Philip, General Philip (John Litel), Callie (Bacon's Maid, Hattie McDaniel). <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is just jam-packed with uncredited but skillful players, such as: Joe Sawyer, Eleonora Parker, Minor Watson, Tod Andrews, Irving Bacon, Roy Barcroft, Lane Chandler, Spencer Charters, Frank Ferguson, Francis Ford, William Forrest, George Eldridge, Russell Hicks, William Hopper, Hoppy Hooper, Eddie Kean, Fred Kelsey, Sam McDaniel, Patrick McVey, Frank Orth, Eddie Parker, Eddison Richards, Rey appe; American himself), Minerva Urezhal, Dick Vessel, Gig Young and many, many others. <br /> <br /> Movie moves very fast, especially at the beginning; then this species slows down due to the need as history advances to the years after the civil war, the appointment of Custer as a colonel in the 7th cavalry and the final fate on the Little Big Horn in Montana. Under the direction of director Griffith Veteran Raoul Walsh, the film amazes with various emotions; from very serious, exciting battle scenes and compelling historical scenes; looking like they were photos of Matthew Brady’s civil war. As with most of Mr. Walsh’s films, he emphasizes and speeds up the end of many scenes with a little humor; but without going overboard and thus risking turning the film into a comedy (in fact, into a farce). <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, this is much more factual than its predecessor, SANTA FE TRAIL (last time we mention, honest Schultz, scout honor!). However, this does not mean that it was not without a few small "artistic and literary licenses", as, indeed, in any biographical film. It would be impossible to make any such type of film, if indeed every fact and the Incident should have been tried to be included in the script. Perhaps the most erroneous inclusion, as well as the most obvious appeal for the Literary license, is that Caster accidentally received the rank of brigadier general. It did not happen. Nevertheless, the “gag” helped the film to move forward, while he emphasized all the light, carefree feeling that permeated the early part of the film. <br /> <br /> DIRECTOR Walsh and Mr. Flynn collaborated, giving us what may seem to be a characteristic of this legendary Civil War Hero, who was very close to a real person, and they did this in addition to recreating the incident that had been massacred by Lakota Siu , Cheyenne and Fukovi of Caster and his 7th cavalry in Little Big Horn. At its inception, on June 25, 1876, “The Last Battle of Custer” was just as big an incident and a shock to the national psyche of the Americans as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941) or the atrocities committed on September 11, 2002, Islamic the fascists go to the New York trading twin towers and to the headquarters of the US military in the Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia. <br /> <br /> SIMPLY as many films of that period of the Second World War (and several years before) there were so many incidents that, if they were not intentionally committed, were a demonstration of the virtues that will be needed during another Global conflict, such as we were at the time when THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON finished their initial theatrical release. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
