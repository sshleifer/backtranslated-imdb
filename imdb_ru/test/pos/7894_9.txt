I was surprised at how emotionally I invested in this film. Peter Boyle is the tourist power as a socially conservative fanatic of the working class, Joe. I actually sympathized with some of his complaints. Of course, he does not mention the main historical socio-economic reasons for many of his prejudices. The film also gives an interesting insight into the rapid changes that were taking place in American society at this time. Drugs, casual sex and the challenge of parental authority came into vogue and replaced the more respected traditions of respect for God, the country and seniority. Fans Susan Sarandon will be delighted. Joe - her movie debut. It also provides viewers with visual pleasure at the beginning of the film. Recommended, 8/10.
