Alexander Lu, the star of such classic films as Super Ninjas and Mafia vs. Ninjas, appears here at this fascinating martial arts festival. <br /> <br /> The evil Abbott White (who boasts an incredible and frank character) is involved in the plot. somewhat scary-looking white eyebrows) enlist the support of the ninja clan to overthrow the Shaolin Temple. <br /> <br /> He achieves this goal and, moreover, destroys the majority of its members, although, of course, one or two manages to survive and rather predictably move to the exact possible revenge on the attacker Abbott. <br /> <br /> .... Well, the plot is not entirely beyond the scope of creativity, but someone watching a film with a title like “Wu Tang vs. Ninja” or “Ninja Hunter” really cares about such an irrelevant factor as the plot? Of course not! - These are the fights that matter in these films and the cud - you get your money here! From everyone involved in this, some great martial arts are shown, and it rarely seems like a minute goes by without a fight for some reason. <br /> <br /> If you like martial arts films at all, this is a Must See!
