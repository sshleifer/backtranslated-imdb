This drama, apparently, caused some excitement six years ago, when she debuted on television - not receiving a lot of television news, she went under the radar; but seeing this, I am not surprised that it caused a stir. Not particularly because of the content (although it is a bit more “original” than ordinary TV feed) —it is more associated with the reactionary media in this country. In any case, this three-part series is based on the book by Sarah Waters, and it focuses on lesbians - although the plot also has a place to explore some of the other “dark” sides of sexuality. Our main character is an oyster girl named Nan (short for Nancy) from Winchester. She is bewitched by a female to a male performer dragging Kitty Butler, having seen her on a theatrical performance, and soon begins to attend all of her shows - ultimately attracts the performer’s attention and becomes her dresser. Soon, Kitty is invited to play on the big stages in London, and, having become friends with Nan, she invites her for a walk. The action gets bigger when Nan enters the stage and the couple becomes a stage duet ... but Kitty breaks Nan's heart, leading her into an odyssey in the gloomy lower stomach of London. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that my DVD collection has no lack of dirty and dirty films, so there was nothing in this film that could shock me. Despite the fact that it annoys me a bit, I must say that I am still surprised by those who say that this film has gone too far; Of course, there is some lesbian sex and other things, but they are never exploited or used too often, and the film really could not have been made without it. The focus is always on history; and the story is really well done. The film lasts almost three hours, but, for that matter, it's not enough to understand everything. Sarah Waters is obviously an inventive writer, and the film remains interesting all the time. The game is good, as one would expect, but I have to admit that it seemed to me that leading actress Rachel Sterling was clumsy and at first it was difficult to deal with her; although it turns into its role well, as the film progresses. The performance is a small problem, and the director Jeffrey Sachs is too intrusive, in my opinion. In the end, the story also gets a little sad, and it's a shame, because this film is strongest in the dark moments (episode 2 is the high point of three for me). There is no definite point in the film - or at least one that I could see. This is not important, as I understand it; However, as Tipping the Velvet tells a good story and exceeded my expectations. It is worth checking out for people who love such things.
