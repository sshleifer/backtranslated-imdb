I was very curious to see the original six-hour mini-series on which Stephen Soderberghâ€™s latest film was based, and now that I have, I am happy to say that one is no better than the other. They are both smart, attractive and extremely interesting. The only real advantage the mini-series has over the movie is that it lasts three and a half hours, so we will get to know the characters in more detail. <br /> <br /> There are no false remarks. In this production, you should definitely devote time when PBS re-broadcasts this mini-series in 2001. You will not regret it.
