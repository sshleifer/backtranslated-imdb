I found this to be an underrated, quietly persuasive Spaghetti Western (also known as DEAD OR ALIVE). Despite modest credentials (except for multi-purpose co-author / producer Albert Bend, the only prominent member of the film crew is composer Carlo Rustichelli), the film clearly benefits from the presence of his three American stars (newcomer Alex Kord is an ambiguous antihero) while veterans Arthur Kennedy and Robert Ryan gives the audience a mythical quality), as well as an unusual plot (with the participation of the crippled protagonist, an amnesty ploy encompassing the strategic cleansing of the city, and the law of which goes to the side of the arrows against the hordes of Mexican gangsters). <br /> <br /> There are several hard fighting scenes at hand ?? the film is crowned with a terrific climax, in which a star trio precipitates in a glowing cabin ?? plus a couple of outrageous moments that are something like the Spaghetti Western trademark: from the middle of the street, Kord sees a hidden action movie by the window reflected in a bottle of whiskey; a man who helps save Korda repeatedly plunges into a puddle of oil with villains. Nicoletta Machiavelli also makes a pleasant impression of the village girl with whom Kord lives; The cast is thus strewn with familiar (if largely anonymous) faces ?? they are mostly genre. <br /> <br /> I wasnâ€™t aware of the fact that the English version of the movie on the MGM / UA DVD-R1 was cut off: I was fooled by the wrong lead time to be listed on the back cover; the film lasted only 99 minutes, not 118 ?? apparently, the character of Korda is killed in a longer Italian version!
