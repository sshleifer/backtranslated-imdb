I was wandering through my local library, looking through VHS tapes, when I saw the movie that made me drop my mouth - Waterbabies. I was hoping to see this film again - more than 22 years have passed since I saw it (TV channel about 78-79). I remembered a lot of details, in particular, Grimes. My son is 4 years old and I watched him. <br /> <br /> He agreed with me that Grimes was “Bad,” and the best way to describe it was that he didn’t like Tom. He accepted it. It was amazing that I still remembered some songs! They were stuck in my head for 22 years - and that means that they needed to be remembered a bit, huh? <br /> <br /> This is a good children's film, with parental guidance in case of questions that the children had to go through it was not a nobility / society in time. This is what all children face every day (with the exception of a few lucky ones), and although we are trying to make films on Disney discs, making them more attractive to children, this does not mean that there was no cruelty - or even not. I liked the animation. It was not Disney, no. I don’t think that Don Blute touched the brush in this film. <br /> <br /> However, a lot can be done. David T plays two roles! (I really like him!) James M too. The water children themselves are cute. You feel sorry for Tom, and cheering for him. Then Billy herself is extraordinary in the role that she plays - as if her eyes are magical! I'm a big fan of WoO, TLW & TW and the company (and looking forward to HP!), And I served it along with such films. Yes, he jumps into the water, but not because of suicide. He jumped because he trusted the lady in black - she always appeared in front of him. <br /> <br /> I think this is a good movie! If you have children, take a rental copy. If you happen to find a purchased copy, let me know where! Jan liked this! :) Dee <br /> <br />
