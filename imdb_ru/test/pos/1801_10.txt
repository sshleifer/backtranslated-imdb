It is a romantic, albeit affectionate film, which is one of my favorites for all time. This is one of many CLASSICS of the 80s genre, such as Pretty in Pink or Somery of Wonderful. <br /> <br /> Nick plays a traditional punk guy in love with the traditional Julie Valley, a neat girl. This is a touching love story that makes you cheer for him to eventually defeat the girl. <br /> <br /> True, most of the acting sucks, but ... <br /> <br /> I have been in love with Nick since I saw it in cinemas, and I saw almost all the films in which he has been since. He really grew up as an actor, but in this early film of his, it is obvious that he has a LOT of potential. <br /> <br /> If you like movies of the 80s, you LOVE this classic. <br /> <br /> Go rent it !!!!!
