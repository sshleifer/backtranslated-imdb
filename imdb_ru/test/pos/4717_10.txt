This is an excellent film in many ways ... perhaps the most important is that it introduces a wonderful, tragic story to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her struggle for freedom and democracy for the Western audience. Great game, great cinematography, breathtaking and intense rest: everything is in “Beyond Rangoon”. I have seen this film several times in the last ten years, and each time it means more to me. Not everyone will like it (hence the relatively low IMDb rating), but this is because this is no ordinary Hollywood deadlock; rather, it challenges the viewer on several levels. I never watched it without sobbing at the end and promising to live a more meaningful life.
