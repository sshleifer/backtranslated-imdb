I like this version of DORIAN GRAY, and the MGM version. Both add a little girl at the beginning of the story, who grows up to have a connection with Dorian (this is not in the original book), and this is my only complaint. I especially like Angela Lansbury as Sybil Wayne and George Sanders as Harry in the MGM version, but Shane Bryant as Dorian in the TV version looks much better (I think) and much more ruthless than MGD Heard in the MGM version: I think Bryant more faithful to Dorian's novel. In the end, this is a very good adaptation of the novel (he even hints at Dorianâ€™s relationship with men, like Wilde, which could not be done in the MGM version).
