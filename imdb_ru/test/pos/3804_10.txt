When I first saw this film, I just thought: “What the hell?” 10-year-old child, traveling around strange places, meeting strange people, going after a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yes! I really liked this movie! <br /> <br /> Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a shame that he stopped acting. He interprets his character Gus very well in the film. <br /> <br /> Gus loses his eye, gets tattoos and travels to the strangest cities, filming Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! I want more? <br /> <br /> Well, don’t even try to understand the story, but why do you need this film !? Just open your mind and let Gus take you on this journey. <br /> <br /> "Motorama Gus, you won the Motorama"
