If “Love Me Tonight” is a “musical for people who don't like musicals”, then it should be said that “The Gay Desperado” is definitely not a musical for people who don't like opera. In fact, despite the fact that it seems to be based on a comic operetta, this is not a musical at all, but a faked story with bandits with interpolated unrelated arias to show the voice of one character; and what a voice. <br /> <br /> Nino Martini, a young singer Chivo, who joins a band of bandits to get a place on the radio (no, later the plot does not make much sense), or ...), has a magnificent golden tenor, whose style is not dates back from the day he was recorded. The trilling and thrill of some of his musical contemporaries belong to a long-gone fashion, but it is very easy to imagine how Chivo shouts out "Nessun Dorma" in front of the crowd of the World Cup and heads the charts. Unfortunately, although he has an attractive smile and a decent dramatic range, he is completely unable to play and sing at the same time. The result is that the rest of the film at a fast pace subsides every time Chivo puts his hand on his chest and starts announcing, and the viewer's tolerance for the result is likely to depend on his appreciation for the operatic performance. <Br /> <br /> In addition to this flaw, the film is a pleasant broad satire on Hollywood conventions and, in particular, on the Mexican gangster stereotype, which allows you to achieve the vital goal of all such parodies, to make your characters be enough involved in their own right. keep the viewer's interest when the joke would otherwise become stale. The head of the gangster and his accomplice have a traditional double-acting relationship, there is a mysterious peony with a carved teak face and an energetic heroine (young Ida Lupino), who plays generic “you say you hate me, but love me” is really “a routine with a refreshing surprise ". <br /> <br /> In general, the film is interesting and quite funny, and I feel that I have received the value of my money - but it cannot be denied that the musical break, while in its own admirable, introduces serious problems with cardiac stimulation .
