Finally, I watched the third film in the Mehta trilogy: “Fire”. To begin with, I will say that “Water” was an indisputable masterpiece at all levels. The fire goes near the Earth in order of quality. Fire: there is so much going on in this movie that I need a few more views to drink it all. Writing is excellent, the script that creates friction, starts the whole process of “heat” from beginning to end when it really turns into a fire, conflicts turn into a complete breakdown of relations. <br /> <br /> Mehta is one brave lady: she sees with a clear eye a lot of jaundice, false and repressive in relation to the great society from which she has emerged. Nowadays, India is changing rapidly, but in many respects it is economic change. The fact that she met such violent opposition to the creation of “Water” after clarifying the scenario shows that there are still many forbidden topics that Indians can no longer look directly into their eyes, can not investigate or discuss. Worse, if someone like Mehta has the courage to repel these problems, she faces death threats. So, although India considers itself to be a pluralistic, tolerant society, the facts are not always the same. Considering that the “Earth” was simply a historical setting for the massacre of the civil war after the independence of India, Fire and Water point to personal, social and religious issues that, as I say, are considered so strongly (in a negative sense) that open to the Artistic dialogue many more years. At the time of this writing, “Water” should be shown in India at the end of this year. I will believe it when I see it. <br /> <br /> Fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional mystery that I saw in “Price above Rubies.” Whether it is arranged marriages (as was the case with Jews about 150 years ago or like many modern Indians), they run the risk of facing a bad couple in both men and women; or just simple marriages without love ..... However, this is not a real problem. Mehta is clearly impatient with absolutely rigid religious attitudes that either make widows suffer (Water) or make women enslave in marriages without love (Fire). I am not an expert in either secular or Hindu divorce laws. The film seems to imply that the stigma (divorce) is almost as bad as a sad marriage. In any case, the film Mehta is a very touching, powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds contemporary Indian relations to a thorough examination. The fact that all three of these films made themselves felt in India as an unreasonable attack on their culture sounds to me like a predictable noise of repressive thinking. Mehta makes you look at the problems no matter how false. I admire her work and cannot recommend her films enough. Excellent, alarming, provocative, destructive taboo.
