This is a great documentary about a story Iâ€™ve never heard of before. The first solo, non-stop sailing race around the world took place in 1968-69, and several riders took part in it. This is a really exciting story about a man against nature and a man against himself. The story focuses on Donald Crowhurst, the tragic figure in this story. The film elegantly combines interviews and footage shot by the sailors themselves in their boats. The story is very tense and sad when we learn the details of the story of Donald Crowhurst. This is one of the best documentaries of the last few years. It contains real human emotions, since men are faced with this almost impossible task - to constantly move around the world.
