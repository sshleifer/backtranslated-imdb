Five minutes later, I began to feel how naive it looked, you have absolutely no heroic hero and his overweight fool from a friend. Saw it all before, yes, that's right. I was preparing to get bored out of my head for a good few hours. This is what I'm used to ... is not it all. Then after a few minutes of testosterone violent insults and so on, the truck appeared. Well, the shooting techniques used to make it look fast were clumsy, but who cares! This truck is awesome! Soon, however, it climbs again, and we return to the geek and his complete friend. But now I am sure that at least it will not be too terrible. Then I am amazed again and again by the tricks of the film. There are so many jokes on their account, as if everyone except for two are involved in this world. The mind behind the makeup and effects was a genius, I swear to that. Believe me, if you are a man that you lack in this film, then there is so much that only a girl can understand. <br /> <br /> Brother Bob is by far the best killer that can be found anywhere, the fact that he is stitched together only adds to the effect. There are, of course, some really stupid scientific facts, but this is not always the case. When our “hero” is bleeding from the nose and using blood to bring Brother Bob to his death, now it's rubbish. There is no way that nosebleeds can be so bad and not mean a severed artery or something else. I use too much blood, but it goes too far. Incest jokes are a bit predictable, but fun nonetheless. And how Brother Bob meets his end is more than a classic. In general, this film rules, it really breaks out of the excessive melodramatic tension of horror that we received in 2003-2005. The end of this step simply could not be better. <br /> <br /> It definitely needs to be watched by someone who loves their horror with several side orders of blood and relationships.
