“Tumbling doll of flesh” Tamakichi Anaru is a Japanese shocker about three thugs who torture and sexually harass a young woman during the filming of their terrible actions. There is no plot, just a lot of difficult main sex scenes (optical censorship again) and a lot of blood. The special effects are not quite impressive. The dismemberment of the Japanese porn actress is shown in unshakable detail. graphically, and finally, one of the patients has sex with her intestines. “Psycho: snuff coils” actually remind me of “Guinea pig: flowers made of flesh and blood,” but this is not so memorable. So, if you're a fan of ultra-depraved Japanese ailments, such as "All Women Are Whores" or "Raping My Virgin Slave", take a look at this 8 out of 10.
