So, there was a strange hole in the plot through which the airship could have passed, but how well did it deal with emotional things? It would be so easy to immerse yourself in the fun, but the writer coped with it. The image of a former cyberman woman crying when she / she saw her reflection after the restoration of her emotions is something that will stay with me forever. This is already two times that the monsters showed a soft side and were fleetingly presented with sympathy, the previous one was the last Distant from the first series, but it worked for Jove. Add to this another ex-woman who was “modernized” on the eve of her wedding, and Jackie Tyler recognizes her husband after she became “cyber,” and you have a constant lump in your throat. Keep it up!
