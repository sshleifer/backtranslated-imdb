One True Thing towers its potentially bold material to give us an idea of ​​the family of complex relationships and imperfect, real people. It all starts with Rene Zelewegger discussing the death of his mother with the district attorney; ridding us of cheap cinematographic frames of "shocking" illness and death. From there, he proceeds to consider the family system, in which everyone plays according to unexplored rules and uses his mother's cancer to show what happens when all the rules change. <br /> <br /> William Hurt in the role of the most important father and Meryl Streep in the role of mother Susie The master of the house is both excellent; nuances, not what they seem. Zelewegger boils, angry and surprised. Tom Everett Scott doesn't have much to do, but he does it well. <br /> <br /> History is predictable, and it has at least one horrible turn that did not have to be done, but appearances and a view of the family as a place where anger and love are equally mixed makes it worthwhile.
