I think I don't need to add much. I discovered that the comedy was still funny more than ten years after its release. <br /> <br /> The only thing I noticed was that the music during the dialogue was distracting and often made the film very attractive, it had to be. The use of songs is fine during the film, but the orchestral background is too busy, too ingenious, and if the film is ever edited for a DVD, I would seriously recommend lowering the background music to almost inaudible. This reduced the overall perception of the entire film, and I can subconsciously understand why many people refused it. <br /> <br /> There were many levels in the film, working on the script, plot and comedy. level. It is a pity that the producer and director felt that they needed a musical slok to improve their mood. Now, knowing this, I find it difficult to watch, and I silently curse the one who was involved in the musical editing of the film. It had all the subtleties of a jackhammer.
