(Review of the original version of the 1950s, and not the restored version of the 1980s). On a land where no one likes the king, and no one likes the king, the shepherd and chimney sweeper from two nearby paintings come to life and run away. A portrait of the king who loves the cowgirl kills the real king and takes his place. The huge bird, the wonder bird of this name, acts as a kind of hero and helps our two lovers. <br /> <br /> This is a strange weird movie ... not surreal, very very very surreal. <Br /> <br /> The background style is very European, while the Fliescher characters meet with Warner, but at the beginning of the arty Warner are not the main characters. They move both realistically and in cartoon manners. <br /> <br /> This is a strange movie, and you need a little bit to get into it, but Peter Ustinov is a bird, a riot, his children and a puppy are wonderful. There are police ducks in rubber ducks and a bear that makes you smile. <br /> <br /> The film has a deep philosophy about the existence of a world beyond ... outside the underground city of Metropolis. <br /> <br /> This is a really great movie. There is something so strange and unique in it that rewards you if you stay with him throughout the trip. It's not perfect, but what the hell. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to search. If your local DVD basket has a capcom version (paired with Alice in Paris), buy it. It should cost less than ten bucks, probably about five, and the price is absolutely worth it, especially if you realize that it comes with two full-length cartoons, two short cartoons and a few neat commercials and other fun things.
