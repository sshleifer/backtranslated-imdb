.... can it be that ITV will not want to release this absolute classic, because it will show their current Mike Bassett series as it is? Discussing Mike Bassett with some colleagues, I mentioned the Bostock Cup as a much superior offer and was surprised to find that I seemed to be the only person in my entire office who actually saw him. It may not be right for a movie that must have been the funniest thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, ITV doesn't have the best recent recording for a comedy production, so you might think that they would take the opportunity to at least repeat something really funny. Perhaps, if this could be combined with a lucrative competition on the phone, where we think the bus driver will go further, they might be interested. <br /> <br /> Went to ITV, some of us still want to watch original, high-quality comedy / drama. Do a decent thing. Repeat this then output it on DVD.
