Best In Show keeps track of the stories of several participants preparing for one of the largest dog shows on the calendar. Any amateur psychologist would say that unconditional love and obsession with pets is a sign that something is missing in someone's life, and each of the characters somehow fills this phrase. There is a former high school beauty who is now married to a defiant male, a childless, label-obsessed couple yappie, single outdoors, the young wife of a rich old woman (with her short-haired dog trainer) and a gay couple. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so funny is how it portrays these stereotypes perfectly believable - in many cases almost tender. Every ridiculous thing that one of the characters does or says - with your dog as an innocent bystander - looks like a behavior that you absolutely expect to see at a dog show. <br /> <br /> The biggest laugh comes from a team of American-style sports commentators who compare the moments at a dog show with parts of a baseball game, and his English, canine academician, foil. <br /> <br /> Tests of the calling husband as his blond wife meets an amazing number of men from her past, which is also always good for laughter, like the crazy behavior of a yuppie couple as the pressure increases while their hound remains completely spotless. <br /> <br /> Well worth a look - even if the cats are bigger in your bag.
