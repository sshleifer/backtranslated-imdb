I firmly believe that a film, a television series or any other form of art should and will be fully appreciated if you take into account the time factor - when they are written, produced or conceived - <br /> <br /> Yeh Jo hai Zindagi - one of these series. I remember watching it in the mid-80s on TV, and reruns through libraries of videotapes in the early 90s. and laugh out loud and be addicted to it. It made me buy a full set of DVDs and surprise with surprises - the comedy and moments of good old days simply did not come true for me. Even the very popular "30 years of experience" "GULAAAAB JAMUN!" and the “sofa bed” didn’t cause as much fun as I thought. The time factor: for the 80s it was a significant step. Main event. The mother of all television comedies. And it worked in age and time! Perhaps this can not be said right now, but, nevertheless, watching the DVD brought back pleasant memories. <br /> <br /> I wish the seasons with Shafi Inamdar and Swarup Sampat were longer. Satish Shah was incredibly good as the heart of the show with equally effective support from Farida Jalal, Tika Talsania and Bengali neighbors. Rakesh Bedi Hams everywhere. <br /> <br /> In general, the experience that will bring back memories to those who saw it in prime time may not appeal to young viewers or viewers who are watching for the first time!
