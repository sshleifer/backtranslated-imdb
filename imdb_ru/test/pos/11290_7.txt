Although it does not matter much for the film, it is a myth about the creation of the world. God (convulsive, bloody figure in the chair) cuts off his organs with a straight razor and dies in his own dirt. Mother Earth rises from her corpse and permeates herself with his seed, giving birth to Man. However, it is unlikely that you could figure out any of this without first reading the overview, and this is not particularly important for the film you are making, because itâ€™s rather a surrealistic art-house image, all inky, black and white. A terrible, dismal atmosphere is created with an absolute photograph and minimal sounds (mostly water drips, moans, scratches, etc.), But each scene lasts too long, like the film as a whole. It could be wonderful, as a short film, and the scene of killing God was superb and extremely creepy, especially in the first place, which you see, but it's hard to be patient when it goes on for so long, and you don't even know that you see a big of the time. <br /> <br /> Still, a good movie with original style, images, atmosphere and content.
