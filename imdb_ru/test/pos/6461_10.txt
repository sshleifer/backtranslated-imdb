This is a powerful film that never seemed to revive after Joe McCarthy’s censorship period. It influenced me as a Jewish teenager who had friends of different colors and whose father’s family suffered from the fascist regimes in Europe in the second quarter of the twentieth century. Unlike the later plagiarism, “On the Embankment,” which seemed to take some of the same themes and distorted them to fit the forced Hollywood political correctness of the time, he told his story directly and with respect for the characters and reality this fictionally reflected. It was the antidote to Gone With the Wind, The Birth Of A Nation, The Triumph Of The Will, and many other glorifiers of hate and violence. I would put it next to a recent German film (also practically hidden in the USA) “Rosenstrasse”. <br /> <br /> I remember that the television version, both black-and-white and storyline, was blacked out at some stations, because the black hero's wife seemed white. As a young civil rights activist, this caused a conflict in me because, on the one hand, I was against smoking cigarettes, and on the other, against the boycott in Georgia of the TV show sponsor, a large tobacco company (I don’t remember which anyone else?). <br /> <br /> I would like to find a CD with a film or a TV show so that my sons could see something that influenced my opposition to racism everywhere (as opposed to just fighting racism against Jews) and recognizing an inherent connection between racism and militarism.
