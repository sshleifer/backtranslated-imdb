Crispin Gloverâ€™s mode of action (and not only that) is enormous. You really want to believe him, because his body language and performance are perfect for the person. He gives Lane an extraordinary individuality that makes this film a cult. Like Fek, whose role is very well performed by Dennis Hopper. It is about choosing the right or wrong side, without logical thinking about the scene. Friendship is more important, and I think this is what makes the choice difficult. Rivers Edge lets you experience it with serious melodies and family mothers. I really enjoyed watching it. I saw it a month ago for the first time, but if you like the good feeling of the 80s, then this is what you should see. I am the same thing that I did not know about this before.
