I liked this film not because Tom Selleck participated in it, but because it was a good baseball story, and it also had a semi-over-dramatized look at some of the problems that BASEBALL player ends up in major. The sports league must face. I also liked the cultural differences in American and Japanese baseball and the small facts about how games are played in different ways. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good film that can be watched on cable television or rented in the cold winter. At night, and look at the "Dog Days" of the summer and know that until the spring workouts only a few months. A good movie for a baseball fan, as well as a good movie "DATE" ?? Trust me on this! * Wink *
