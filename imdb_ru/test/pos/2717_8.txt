Our family and friends loved this movie. The theme was well developed by the director with excellent performances of Shaban Azmi, Konkan Sen and well supported by good performances of other actors. The climax was well built, but for an ending that was far from being called “Good.” Are we still trying to understand what the director was trying to convey? They lacked ideas or the end was beyond the comprehension of ordinary movie lovers? A better final would have made an indelible impression on the audience and increased the number of viewers. This, however, should not divert attention from Konkana and Shabana Azmi for good relations with the characters!
