Screenwriter Dean Bell gave a lot of surprises and interesting moments in this modest, but convincing road film. His dialogue was quick, and his use of very short episodes of memory was particularly effective in the narrative structure of the film. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the film is Alice’s character, who flees from her New England past in desperate attempts to get to Florida. Along the way, she travels with a pair of eccentrics, Bill and Sandra, who are incredibly trying to find Alice as a prostitute who earns at the truck stops. <br /> <br /> As a newcomer, acting in her first role on the screen. Emily Grace in the role of Alice sensational. There is no false note in the character selection. But the film is worth watching primarily for Sandra’s insidious but sensitive character, masterfully created by Judith Ivy. There is a particularly tricky subtext at almost every moment when Ivy is on camera. As a viewer, I found that I stopped recording, turned on rewind and looked at her scenes to try to see the psychological subtleties. <br /> <br /> In the film, the next question is about the characters: Bill and Sandra? Are the good Samaritans, or are they an evil pair of Dikkenian predators hunting young Alice? One of the strengths of the film is that it never fully answers this question. Alice seems more confident than she began as a result of her experience with Bill and Sandra. But is she really the best person? <br /> <br /> This comedy, an excerpt from the film and the drama of adulthood - this carefully thought-out film successfully attracts us on many levels.
