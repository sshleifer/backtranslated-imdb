It is precious. Everything is lit sweetly and sublimely ridiculous from the first tasty line of dialogue. Oh, how I waited for this to come to Austin. While Elijah Wood is fascinating, as is Jonathan Safran Foer (the real author of the novel “Everything Is Illuminated”), it is Eugene Hatz (played by the Ukrainian guide and translator Jonathan Alex) who truly steals this film. Alex is a hip-hop-loving Ukrainian break dance who, along with his grandfather, helps Jonathan find a woman who saved the life of Jonathan's grandfather during World War II. The Ukrainian village has never looked so exciting. I think to collect all this and move to the former Soviet state. <br /> <br /> However, the tone of the film changes when Jonathan and Alex finally meet the woman they are looking for, and suddenly this delightful comedy turns into a heartbreaking historical drama about a Jewish village that was destroyed during the Nazi occupation. Everything is illuminated - this is history, heritage and wisdom, which can be obtained by discovering the past. It's perfect.
