Stalingrad is a terrific film, well-played and directed, and rather mundane in its approach to various bizarre aspects of war and its politics. This, together with Das Boot, is one of the best war films (together with the Finnish Winterkriget (Winter War, in English, I think)). It depicts the testing of some German soldiers who fought - and died - in and around Stalingrad during World War II. No heroics of a great time, no excessive emotional vagueness, only the fear of everyday death in war. The mood of the movie is similar to "Das Boot", and this should give you some tips on what to expect, I think. So if you like realistic non-Hollywood war movies: rent them, buy them, just make sure you see it! Finally, a movie lover remark: for some of the previous reviewers, I just want to add that “Stalingrad” is not the director Wolfgang Petersen (who made “Das Boot”)!
