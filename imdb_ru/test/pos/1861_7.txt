The real husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly play a major role in the Creation of the World, which tells about the period of Charles Darwin's life before the publication On the Origin of Species in 1859, his notorious, changing world of evolution and natural selection. Darwin's research created a huge schism, a rift between the believers of his time and the scientists. At that time he was told that he was going to fight against God and even "kill God." <br /> <br /> The film tells about the life of Darwin with his wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is superb as his extremely pious and loving wife. Initially, there is an exponential scene when she leads a prayer table at the dinner table, and Charles cannot say that “Amen” foreshadows what follows, and the sharp differences between them. She is convinced that he will be forever damned and will bring misfortune to their family, rejecting God. <br /> <br /> Darwin is torn between his strong love for his wife, her faith and an even stronger mind. There are wonderful moments when he observes animals, analyzes their behavior and the sequences that make up their lives, explains the selection phenomena of their children, the firstborn, Annie, with very painful curiosity. We see how he interacts with Jenny, the first orangutan of England, playing with him as with a child, deciphering her every look and action. <br /> <br /> Annie, the eldest daughter, later dies, and her death follows Charles, who was closer to her. In my opinion, this part was too long, bizarre and stretched. I didn’t like the messy scenes where he seems to be losing his mind and being haunted by his daughter’s ghost screaming and ranting. Although Charles thinks his wife accuses him of a fatal illness, she says very poeticly: "The truth is that if I knew then what I know now, I would marry you tomorrow." Their connection is strong and inseparable, despite the huge differences in beliefs. <br /> <br /> When Charles finishes his manuscript, he presents his wife with the final version, telling her that she can burn it if she does not agree. She does not sleep reading it in the evenings, and finally gives him a package, a book, ready to be sent to the publisher. In the end, reason, and perhaps also love, is a triumph, because he makes an accomplice from his faithful adversary. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Darwin received a complete Christian burial in Westminster Abbey, proof that its foundation Of course, innovative ideas were considered controversial, but already then they were recognized as vital knowledge for human development. <br /> <br /> The film definitely tells about Darwin's family life, his joys and troubles. I happened to love this aspect, but Fabio said it was like watching a documentary, I quote Hitler’s “passion for table tennis”. In some respects, this is true, and I cannot disagree with his desire to learn more about the theories of Charles Darwin from this film than we do. Nevertheless, it remains well-executed and flawlessly played historical drama. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 Fabio: 7 Overall rating: 14
