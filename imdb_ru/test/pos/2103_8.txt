With his re-release from ADV Films, I had the opportunity for the first time to watch “The Giant Magin” without deep cuts and unkind words from late night horror theaters. Guess what? This is a damn good movie! <br /> <br /> The TV series is authentic, the acting is muted and believable, and the giant Majin is majestic, powerful and adamant. I liked the subtle fantasy touches (enchanted tree, luck talisman, etc.) and the betrayal of God as a little less than “good”. <br /> <br /> This film is asking for a remake in the new century!
