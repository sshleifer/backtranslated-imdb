Red Skelton (in his first starring role) is played by Wally Benton, who plays “The Fox” in a radio show. He writes murder mysteries and how “Fox” solves them. Joseph Jones (Konrad Wade) is trying to figure out how to commit the murder committed on someone. He kidnaps Benton, his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another girlfriend (Virginia Gray). He tells Benton to write the perfect murder ... or his girlfriends will take him ... <br /> <br /> Very funny and enjoyable movie. Fast moving (just 77 minutes), a good script and a perfect cast really reflect that. Skelton is very good in his first leading role - very funny, fast, beautiful and smart. Wade is excellent as evil Jones. Rutherford and Gray are very funny girlfriends Skelton. All three play well with each other - their verbal sparring is the highlight of this picture. It’s also fun to see Eva Arden in a small role. <br /> <br /> Worth the time.
