Naked City: JWAB does a good job balancing two A-B stories, although I don’t really like multi-subject movies. Both Scott Glen and Courtney B. Vance do a great job with the dual screen. However, I’m not sure what message the film sends when two flat-foot village girls can get off Scott with freedom with murder, big theft and, to top it off, win a free flight home (at least in appearance of their clothes anyway). Gee, I think the blue wall of silence is still more likely to think! <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
