Erica Kohut - a woman with deep sexual problems. At the beginning of the film, we see how she is late home. When her elder mother protests, Erika falls into insanity, attacking an elderly woman without pity. Erika, as it turns out, is a music teacher of a certain fame at the conservatory where she teaches. The next time we see her, she will be a model of self-control, but she shows a cruel side in how she attacks a young student, because she feels that he is wasting his time and his own. The same goes for unsafe Anna, a talented girl that Erica hates, maybe because she sees a promise in a young woman that she does not want to promote. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, we watch Erika, as she goes into the entertainment area, and go to one of the cabins, where pornographic materials are shown. Erica freezes, watching what is happening on the screen. Another time, Erika arrives by car where the film is going. Her attention is directed to a parked car, in which two lovers have sexual intercourse. The camera pauses on Erika when she is lost in thought, watching what two lovers are doing until she is surprised by a young man in a car. Erika runs in horror, she was discovered. <br /> <br /> When a rich couple invites Erica to a concert in their luxurious home, she meets an impatient young man, Walter, who is associated with the hosts. Walter is immediately carried away by the game of Erica; the young man himself is a talented pianist. His desire to compliment Erica was met with skepticism on her part. Walter decides to audition for Erika's master class, and he is accepted. <br /> <br /> In this way, Walter begins the pursuit of Erica, who is dumbfounded when she realizes that the young man’s motives are in fact. In turn, Erica begins to fantasize about Walter as much as her mind could, imagining what she would like him to do when and if they get together. Walter is distracted by a letter written to him by Erica, which describes in detail the sexual activities that are disgusting to a young man. <br /> <br /> The end of the film reminded us of the last sequence of Mr. Haneke’s current “Cache”. , We were taken to the concert hall, where Eric is going. She is seen in the lobby, waiting for the arrival of Walter, who goes into the hall, not noticing her. Erika's facial expression in front of the camera shows much more of her mental state in the last moments of the film. When she leaves the lobby after hurting herself, the camera throws her and concentrates on the front of the building, which seems to remain on the screen for a long time. <br /> <br /> La Pianiste is Isabelle Huppert's personal triumph. This gorgeous actress makes one of her best screen appearances under the confident hand of Michael Haneke, one of the most interesting directors working today. Ms. Huppert works with her budget gestures, but she projects as much of her soul as she burns through the screen with her Erica. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast does wonders under the direction of the director. Annie Girardot, always superb, as beautiful as Erica's mother. She seems to be the key to what went wrong with her daughter. There is a hint of incest that plays with subtlety in the context of the film. Benoit Magimel played well in the role of Walter. This young actor does a wonderful job in the film, being a young man so in love with a woman who is obsessed with demons, that he can never chase her away or make her fall in love with him in the usual manner. /> <br /> Michael Haneke’s films always interfere with watching, but they offer so many awards because he dares to go where other men do not. The great music heard in the film is mainly owned by Schubert and Schumann, two composers who are Erica’s favorite works. The film is greatly helped by the cinematography of Christian Berger.
