If you want your films to make you emotion, if you like movies with a guy you can root for, and treat him, if you like your movies in black and white, you should watch this movie! Watch it from start to finish, because you don't want to miss a beat. It is sometimes slow, and it makes you wonder when something happens, when the plot starts to unfold, you will find yourself on the edge of your seat! I know that was! My mother told me about this film, because the same thing happened in our family as in the film. We loved Frankie, who convincingly plays the main role. Whatever you think of Frank Sinatra, put it aside, in the film he is thin and does not sing, so keep yourself open. For the era in which he entered, he tells a story that is still told today in homes all over the country and, perhaps, all over the world. Please see if you like old movies, try this one.
