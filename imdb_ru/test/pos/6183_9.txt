A touch of Lubicz - more than ever in this film. Humor at any time and very thin. The plot is simple, but the director portrayed amazingly. The film is very smart and adds a comic effect. This comedy, which does not age for the viewer of the XXI century. Heroes Cooper and especially Claudette Colbert are very clever and angry with this poor Michel in the film. She avoids the traps of her husband and turns the situation in their favor, very funny. And there are no problems, with Lubich there is always a happy ending. A film for men, too self-confident with women. Don't let your girlfriend watch this movie ...
