This is a great example of a very Hollywood film industry, which is very provoking, exciting and does not deprive a sense of humor. Kevin McKidd and Paula Sage are superb. <br /> <br /> I really watched it on TV late at night, and I understand why I missed it in the cinema, this is not the movie that multi-screen "mega" cinemas are showing today, is even more pitiful. <br /> <br /> I'm going to watch a DVD. Not for those who prefer the current trend for special effects and no history. If you like the best-selling book, The Curious Case of a Dog at Night, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best Scottish films such as Little Faces and Train Train. All films in which Kevin McKidd also starred. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
