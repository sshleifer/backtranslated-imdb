It's nice to see the film with the participation of children, whose idea of ​​“acting like an adult” is not connected with sensuality. Instead, these children see the problem in their community and take responsibility for helping to solve it. Hoot is a film aimed directly at families looking for a fun movie day. Performance indicators are good, especially large-scale shots from Montana and Florida. Jimmy Buffett's soundtrack is perfect. Young actors are energetic and refreshing. <br /> <br /> The story of three guys who work together to save some burrowing owls from the death of an unscrupulous builder of an empire of pancake houses will attract children. So many films make children seem powerless, it's so nice to watch a movie in which children work hard to change something. And although parents are absent or temporarily distracted, it was nice to see children who want to follow in the footsteps of their parents and try to correct injustices. <br /> <br /> If you are tired of all self-indulgent stories, the lines about children who fill the cinema give Hoot a chance. Then take the time to talk with your children about the adventures of serving others and caring for the world in which they live. Positive message from a positive movie.
