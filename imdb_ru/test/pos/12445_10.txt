Slipknot is a heavy metal band from the great city of Des Moines, Iowa, in which the rockers wear their own masks (I know that someone has already said this, but I need to fill the space for this review). The band members are Joey, Mick, 133, Sid, Clown, James, Corey, Chris and Paul. In my opinion, this band is one of the best new heavy metal bands, and everyone who loves hardcore rock should hear it. Another good movie called "DISASTERPIECES", which shows the performance of the group in the London arena. The video "My Plague" was filmed there and included on the DVD. The best song they did is also there (Sic). So, if you like the band, you need to see it, and if you like heavy metal, then you have to hear this band.
