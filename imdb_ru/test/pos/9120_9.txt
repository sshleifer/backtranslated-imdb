Just saw it at the final film of the Austin Film Festival. Upon entering, we saw several fragments of their performance at the Alamo Drafthouse and thought that the trailer was funny, but I did not expect such an epic themed music, and using Tarot cards is a genius in the title sequence. Beware of cameos from Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins, as well as the darkest lord (who has a fetish for KG). A lot of fun, and the songs are so contagious. Chasing the car was my favorite scene. I know that this will immediately earn a cult status and attract new Tenacious D fans like me. I hope this is good in movie theaters. “Follow me, we are the shadows”
