In 1968, Stanley Kubrick made this historical film a masterpiece based on a book written by Arthur Clarke. It was such an early attempt to make a science fiction film combined with scientific facts. His film making style is still fresh and untouched. <br /> <br /> I’ve seen this movie more than half a dozen times, and I even have a VHS copy of a movie in my library. The CS3 class made me watch the film again from a different perspective: who is HAL and what is he thinking about? <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching the movie again, and I tried to focus on the HAL dialogs in the second episode of the movie. In the second scene, Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole eat food in front of two television monitors on the sides, and around them is a round reddish glass dome HAL. In a television report, HAL was introduced as a new generation of supercomputer launched on January 12, 1992 under the name HAL 9000 Series. During the interview, HAL reacts like a modest working machine, trying to complete the mission of the spacecraft. <br /> <br /> In another scene, Dave sketches Dr. Hunter, Dr. Cambela, and Dr. Kaminsky, who are all in a sleeping dream. HAL is curious to see these sketches and raises the dubious question of the purpose of the mission of Jupiter. His calm and monotonous voice makes listeners listen more carefully. <br /> <br /> In the next few scenes, we’ll see HAL trying to kill astronauts one by one and seize power. His consciousness makes him able to try to save his life from termination. When Dave wants to return to the spacecraft, but HAL does not listen to him, the most memorable feature in the movement appears: “Sorry, Dave, I am afraid I cannot do this. “In the middle of the most important interaction between man and machine, the voice of HAL can cause both solid calm and ill will in the same monotone. <br /> <br /> Dave returned to the ship, lost all his fellow astronauts and decided to turn off the main HAL brain cells. HAL uses his latest apologetic tricks to convince Dave not to turn him off. HAL asks him to stop and let him fix himself. These are his famous lines, until Dave turns off his modules one by one: <br /> <br /> “Dave, what are you thinking of doing? <br /> <br /> Dave? I have the right to answer the question! <br /> <br /> I know that I'm not all right lately ?? <br /> <br /> But I feel so much better after learning ?? <br /> <br /> Can I see that I’m very upset about this very bad decision of mine lately? <br /> <br /> Dave, stop! Would you like? <br /> <br /> Dave, stop! <br /> <br /> I'm afraid Dave! '<br /> <br /> During this process, HAL's voice slows down and becomes thicker and less frequent. Heard: <br /> <br /> “Does my mind go away?” I feel it. ”<br /> <br />“ Can I sing a song for you? "<br /> <br /> Dave releases the final modules and lets HAL sing his song called" Daisy ": <br />" Daisy, let me ?? <br /> <br /> your answer to me? <br /> <br /> I'm crazy ?? <br /> <br /> Although I am not confused ?? <br /> <br /> HAL dies as the mission of Jupiter continues ?? <br /> <br /> Artificial God bless you, HAL, save the world!
