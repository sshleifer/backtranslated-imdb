So, first things first. <br /> <br /> Angels and Demons is a much better and completely different film than the Da Vinci Code. <br /> <br /> After the recent murder of comics, remakes and the dubious resurrection of old franchises. It's nice to watch a very solid and fascinating film, devoid of shaky video techniques, lens flare, excessive GCI and excessive sequence of actions. <br /> <br /> In this respect, the Angels and Demons almost feel old-fashioned. It offers a good and measured debate about the age-old subject of religion and science, gives an idea of ​​the parallels between the great houses of God in Rome (beautifully shot, by the way) and the modern temple science, which is great at CERN. object of the hadron collider. <br /> <br /> Hanks is Hanks, who pretends to be a smart guy, and the second time he fits the role much better than his wooden play in Da Vinci. Good support is offered by a solid cast, with a special highlight being the staunch cardinal Armin Muller-Shtal. but the main grace of the films is the tempo. I have been completely absorbed in this story over the entire period of my work, and the film never gave me time to sit and identify the shortcomings of logic. <br /> <br /> My only serious criticism is that some of the sciences depicted are controversial at best with respect to the authenticity of the real world. But this is not the fault of filmmakers, rather the observation of the old saying that you should never let the truth interfere with a good story. <br /> <br /> Talking about what a hacker story is, mixing adventure and a time trial with a good splash of intelligence and a nice turn on the way. <br /> <br /> In general, I highly recommend this to fans of any of the national treasure films (which it clearly mimics, but with a much more serious atmosphere) and fans of explosive adventure stories in general.
