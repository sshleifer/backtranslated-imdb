This is a special film if you know the context. Antonioni, when he was over eighty, was hit on a stroke. Silent and half paralyzed, his friends, who, by the way, are the best cinema in the world, organized for him the “directorial” last significant film. The idea is that he can create a story just by looking at it. So, we have a film: about a director who imposes stories with simple observation. And the question (four) stories about how the visual imagination defines love. <br /> <br /> The film appears, giving us the tools to bring it to life through our own imagination. The result is a pure world of cinema: every person (except the director) is good in aspect or movement. Some of these women are very sweet, and they exist in a dreamy, foggy world of sensual encounters. There are no nuances and hints that something exists, except what we see; There is nothing at work except what we create. <br /> <br /> I don’t know of another film that has so successfully manipulated our visual thirst for making us create the world we see. He understands something in order not to touch. No one understands Van Morrison visually like him. Morrison's cosmic music is based on the same concept: sensual touch, which implies, but does not concern physically. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's red-haired wife appears, respectively, as a shopkeeper, and she also directs the dim creation of the film, which is on DVD. <br /> <br /> Ted's score - 3 out of 4: Worth seeing.
