One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 1930s was a variation of criminal fiction, known as the “murder mystery,” as adding sound to movies helped make a more accurate translation of what the audience experienced in the original. plays And since horror films were very popular in those years, thanks to the strengthening of the elements of horror stories, murder mystery films gained popularity almost equal to the popularity they used in the previous decade (in which the first films of the genre were made). Aspiring playwright Charles Belden saw in this renewed interest in murder mysteries a chance to make a name for himself after Warner Bros. chose his three-act play "Wax Works" to create a horror film in 1933, "The Secret of Wax." Museum. Belden joined independent director Frank R. Streier to continue making films, and Ghost Rides was one of his best. <br /> <br /> In Ghostly Walks, John Millian plays Prescott Ames, a young playwright who wants to impress the famous Broadway producer Herman Wood (Richard Karl) with his new play. Ames takes Wood and his assistant Homer (Johnny Arthur) to his country house to read his play, but his car gets stuck in the mud during a terrible storm. Three men are asking for a refugee in an old mansion, which is owned by one of Ames' old acquaintances. Inside the house, Wood and Homer witness a strange relationship between Ames and the owners of the house, but this is all a plan that was conceived to impress Wood: everyone in the house is an actor who plays a role in his murder mystery. Unfortunately, the murder committed is real, and although Wood and Homer think that all this is fake (after he learned the original Ames plan), the actors know that someone in the house is a real killer. <br /> <br /> How is it that Charles Belden’s script for “Ghost Walks” is expected to include classic elements of mysterious murder stories of the time, as we have a stormy night in an old dark house as a setting, an obligatory group of suspects and a touch of comedy. Nevertheless, it’s interesting how Belden turns the film into a real parody of the genre with a lot of twists and turns, which he puts into his story in order to play the clichés of killer and mysterious plays. The dialogues are excellent, full of wit and carefree charm, and although the plot definitely loses a lot of steam at the end (in any case, it follows the routine of the murder mystery), it never ceases to be interesting and interesting thanks to its clever twists and especially its bizarre characters. Interestingly, there is an obvious gay overtones, which, although it is stereotypical, but never defaming and sometimes truly ridiculous. <br /> <br /> By 1934, director Frank R. Streier was already an experienced master in the film industry fighting for poverty. But his partnership with writer Charles Belden would give him a couple of his most interesting films, and “Ghost Walks” was one of them. Despite the fact that he was clearly made with a limited budget and the typical production value of independent films of his time, Streier manages to take advantage of his set and create an atmospheric film that fits perfectly with the mood and tone of the story. From time to time, it goes a little slower, but Streier knew that the strength of his film was in Belden’s script, and made the most of it, letting his actors make the most of their characters with excellent results. Of course, the performance is a bit typical and unoriginal, but the Strayer does an effective, albeit restrained work in this film. <br /> <br /> As written above, the script is filled with gorgeous lines that make bizarre characters play, and, fortunately, most actors play with it to their advantage. Veteran actor character Richard Karl is surprisingly funny as a capricious producer Herman Wood, adding a lot of charm to his character, especially in his scenes with Johnny Arthur, who plays the bright secretary of Homer. Arthur - the one who gets the best scenes, and he gives and fun work as a cowardly, but witty assistant. John Milian is simply effective in the role of Prescott Ames, nothing surprising, but nothing terrible, and the same can be said about June Collier as Gloria Shaw (an obliging love interest), which is all right. However, Donald Kirk is really pleasant as the wicked Terry Shaw, and it is a shame that he did not get more screen time. <br /> <br /> As usual with the films of Frank R. Streier, the low budget severely damages the film. While the Strayer does its best, the film sometimes seems quite simple. However, the main problem is that it has a very slow pace, because even when the film is filled with brilliant moments of witty dialogues, it moves so fast that it can momentarily become boring and tedious. It should also be said that, although they are effective in their roles, Milian and Collyer are rather boring and average in comparison with Arthur and Karl, and I want the film to be more focused on the comedic couple they do than on the main couple. Finally, as written above, the ending is weak and does not meet the high standards of the first and middle parts, although Belden should be commended for keeping creative plot twists until the very end. <br /> <br /> It can be said that Charles Belden is the unsung hero of the mysterious murder genre, as among the many horror films and mysteries that came out in film studios B, nicknamed “Poverty Line”, “Ghost walks” are easily included best (along with the previous movie Strider Bat Vmapire), despite its flaws. And even when it’s definitely not a masterpiece of the genre, it’s a good way to spend the night enjoying the way he pokes fun at his origins as a mystery killing game. Highly recommended movie if you like the genre. 7/10
