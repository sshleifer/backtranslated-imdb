Like a very expensive episode with Buffy, flavored with lots of humor. Lots of wire and kung fu trick. The Twins Effect is on the list of classic HK films. Vampires have a cool mix of jumping ghost type and cute European-style boy. If you have the opportunity to see it in the cinema, itâ€™s worth 30 minutes, otherwise buy an imported DVD before someone messes it up by making a bad copy.
