You MUST see this movie ... I saw him when I was 13 years old, in the theater, on my first date ... Shuffle through 20 years, and I'm now gay (Thank you very much One Dark Night !! LOL!). This film hit me so damn when I was a kid (the mausoleums are still doing!), But as an adult, the thrill of this film is not in the storyline, but in the hysterical laughter he holds ... Highlights listen to the names that teenagers call each other, from the “mental brain” (my personal favorite) to the “turkey”. In addition, watch the scene in which Carol (blonde, older sister) is trying to hang her phone on a can of soda (I can not believe that they did not do this!) ... Among other highlights, you can call too much Adam West and sticky corpses. If you are a fan of real horror, I would suggest this film only because for me it is almost a parody of horror. There def. a terrible factor, and the plot is good, but do not watch it if you want to get scared to the mind (if you are not 10 years old or something like that).
