I just watched Nightbreed for the first time since I saw him in the theater almost 20 years ago, and although I remember that I liked it at the time, I don’t remember that he was as stunned as today. I really can't complain about anything in this movie. Craig Schaeffer is excellent as Boone's protagonist. I never understood why he didn’t have a more successful career, because most of his early work was outstanding. As good as Schaeffer, Cronenberg is even better. His depiction of Dr. Decker's psycho is unforgettable and steals the show. The rest of the cast, which includes Doug Bradley, is very good, with the exception of the ridiculous over the top sheriff of goon. The visualization is good, and in some pictures is excellent. The score compiled by Danny Elfman is as good as possible, and is one of his best works. The ending was epic, nonstop for nearly twenty minutes. Overall, Nightbreed is a huge achievement for Clive Barker, and he is considered to be my favorite movie, slightly ahead of Hellraiser. 9/10
