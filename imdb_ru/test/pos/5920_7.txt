“In 1927, a young man, alone on a single-engine plane, flew non-stop from Roosevelt Field in New York across the North Atlantic Ocean to Le Bourget Field in Paris, three thousand six hundred and ten miles away. The triumph of the mind, body and spirit of Charles A. Lindberg influenced the lives of all people on earth - after all, for 33 hours and thirty minutes of its flight, the air age became a reality. This is the story of this flight. ” /> <br /> Billy Wilder adapts from the novel of the same name by Charles A. Lindberg, who won the Pulitzer Prize, to recreate the historical solo flight of Lindberg in 1927. “Spirit Of St. Louis, backed by James Stewart's much stronger lead role (who is himself a pilot) in the role of Lindberg, and containing Wilder and Wendell Mace's intelligent script, is a genuinely well-told story. <br /> <br /> In the fact that sometimes threatens to become a monotonous film, Wilder makes you think, using the memories of the life of Lindberg. After nicely narrated preparation for an event, such as danger, perceived as Nungesser and Coli, disappears {never to be found}, trying the same trip back, we learn things like, for example, how he came to buy his first the plane and its work with flying circus. All this is connected with the understanding of man and his apparent passion for flight. It also helps to give us a complete picture of Lindberg, thus putting us with him in his insulated cabin when he embarks on this dangerous journey. Fighting isolation {his only company is a fly} and chronic fatigue, this is where Stuart beautifully portrays Lindberg's dedication to this task. Thanks to the amazing results of Franz Waksman and the effects of the Oscar award by Louis Lichtenfield, Wilder's film turned out to be an exciting story about human interests, which received a completely professional production. 7/10
