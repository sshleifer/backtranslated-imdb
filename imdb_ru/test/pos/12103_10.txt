Like many other commentators here, I expected a taste of music that would satisfy my curiosity - and received more than I requested. I heard and saw a powerful, refined, sometimes obsessive, sometimes touching, lyrical, sentimental (literally) and absolutely amazing mix of music and musicians. He reminded me of some forms of Indian music (East Indian), but at the same time was very different. <br /> <br /> Starting from the first track of Baba Zula and ending with the Kurdish singer Ainur (what a voice). ) Siyasiaband at jam session (or “Dzhugalbandhi”, as we call it in India) at the small Turkish bar at Selim Seslar (now a big fan :)), I enjoyed every minute and wanted it to not end. /> <br /> One of the best musical comments I've seen and heard in a long time. <br /> <br /> I long for a CD with a sound track and hope that I can soon find it somewhere on the Internet, as well as for the old and recent albums of Baba Zula. <br /> <br /> A day later, the music still crashes into my brain, and I don’t want it to go away. Turkey and especially Istanbul now seem such beautiful and exciting places - and I'm going to start saving today to go and take it. <br /> <br /> Vera Akin is a pearl.
