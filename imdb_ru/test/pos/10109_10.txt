Beauty. Terror Poetry. Horror. Innocence Guilt. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is almost all I have to write in this comment for TALE ABOUT TWO SISTERS. It’s best to just watch this movie without knowing anything about it. I myself did not even know anything about the story of two girls when I entered this film. I just looked at the beautiful cover, did not even read the synopsis on the back and put it into the DVD player. I only knew that he had won several prices at festivals around the world, and this was highly recommended. <br /> <br /> On the cover of the DVD it was written “The worst film from the time of the RING, BRIDGE and DARK WATER”. Although the frightening part may be correct, you can forget about the rest, because the only thing that “Tale of Two Sisters” has in common with this film is ... a ghostly appearance with long black hair. It is even a little unfair to compare it with these famous Japanese films, because this Korean film has much more to offer, and in fact it is a bit more complex and more intelligent than others. <br /> <br /> This film is just a small masterpiece, and here are a few reasons (without telling anything about the plot): The film itself caught me off guard at least twice with clever unexpected turns. And only when you think that you have a conclusion (you get it or not, it does not matter at the moment), and you think that the film will end ... this film lasts a little longer. The cinematography is awesome, using bright colors during the day and dark colors at night. Camera work is excellent, the director sometimes chooses impressive, if not innovative perspectives. Some shots are pure poetry (for example, a top shot with two sisters on the lake). Everything looks very stylish. The main characters are only four, but the intrigue surrounding them is intense. The story itself begins a little slowly, but there is a lot of variety of tones and emotions to make it interesting. There was even one scene (when the girls flew up to the lake), in which I suddenly remembered Peter Jackson's “HEAVEN CREATIONS”. But when horror begins, it is quite effective. It also has some good surprises. Hell, I jumped right off the couch. The musical accompaniment is excellent, and sometimes, when it should not be scary, I could not help but notice that the Italian feeling is felt in it. A bit strange for a Korean movie. But nevertheless, an excellent score. So much attention was paid to every detail of this movie, including perfectly balanced surround sound. <br /> <br /> I also think that calling TALE OF TWO SISTERS just a horror movie is not enough to give him his due. This is more of a mysterious horrible drama that works on both a psychological and a supernatural level. No matter how you look at it, this is an Asian horror that ranks among the best. It may not be terrible, but sometimes it becomes pretty scary, and the subject is quite concerned. So, if you haven’t seen it yet, find a copy, insert it into your DVD player, go with the flow and make sure that you give this film all your attention for 110 minutes. <br /> <br /> There, I hope that I did a good job praising it without spoiling anything.
