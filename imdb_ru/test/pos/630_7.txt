This is without a doubt one of my favorite horror movies! I really can’t believe that it didn’t get much more popularity when it was released, especially when the main contenders at the time were the usual sequels of Wes Craven and imitating horrors, Mute Witness has all the twists and turns of the storyline, the expectations and the rapid fire Hitchcock / DePalma combined with a very sharp black comedy and a great storyline. He never promises to be more than a good movie about popcorn and hot dogs, but it's hard not just to enjoy the movie as it is. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on Billy Hughes. dumb girl working on the set of a horror movie, which is filmed in a Russian factory. As a result of a series of events, she was accidentally locked in and came across a filming of a snuffing film. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the film is the lack of screams that seem to embrace every horror. film ever made. Since the main character is dumb, she can't make noise - something that is a blessing at some stages of the film and a curse on others. <br /> <br /> The director seems to have studied his Hitchcock very well. Even the opening scene is a mocking nod both in Hitchcock's Psycho and in fairly general scenes from the movie Slasher. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that from time to time, acting can be boorish, the whole movie holds it. together, not only adding a couple of great scenes that put you right on the edge of your seat, but also a few neat little questions about how the movie ends. <br /> <br /> In general, a very overlooked, dynamic and action-packed psycho-thriller, which I would recommend to any harassed viewer who is looking for something a little different from the usual Freddie / Jason / Crick / Michael Myers reggae / Damien in hallowe'en.
