"Cruel people" marked the best collaboration of Rudolph Mate with Glenn Ford in the drama of saturated crude primitive justice. <br /> <br /> Ford is John Parrish, the former cavalry captain, who is eager to get married and start a new life ?? His fiancee Caroline Vale (Mae Wynn) is desperately trying to move east and see how he sells his distribution to Lee Wilkinson (Edward J. Robinson). <br /> <br /> Parrish is not even a very cattle breeder ?? but does he understand that there is something big in the valley? In the army, they called it "enemy pressure." First, Cole Wilkinson (Brian Keith) returns from Texas to help his brother control the Anchor. Then a tough guy with an unusual gun (Richard Djekel) appears on Wilkinson's salary? Then all the little ranchers are crowded out, getting the same offers ?? Parrish saw that he either runs like them, or gets up and fights ?? <br /> <br /> But can he easily cope with a man who sends six killers to shoot an old man in the back? Can he easily argue with a man who started out on several acres of land and now owns almost the entire valley? <br /> <br /> Has this grass and sand ever meant anything to a former Confederate army officer for the past three years ?? Was this a place to regain your health ?? Out of habit of taking advice, Parrish argues: "What happens in this valley is not my business." And much to the dismay of the remaining ranchers and farmers who make him stay, he decides to accept Wilkinson's offer to fulfill the promise he made to his bride ?? <br /> <br /> When younger brother Lee Cole made the wrong move trying to get Parrish to make a decision, lynched one of the ranch hands, Parrish got angry and warned two brothers that he was going to stay and would fight with them for the privilege of being left at rest ?? <br /> <br /> Brian Keith plays a loyal brother who is behind the murder ... Does he dream of a position and respect to manage one day Anchor ?? <br /> <br /> Is the ambitious wife of Lee Martha (Barbara Stenwick) secretly hates herself and her husband ?? Does Stanvik play the role of a loving wife who does not tolerate the touch of her husband's hands ?? <br /> <br /> Edward J. Robinson is good enough as the disfigured owner of Anchor, who promised the whole valley to his wife, not knowing that she has an affair with his younger brother ?? <br /> <br /> Is Dianna Foster too sensitive because the unsociable adult daughter knows the burden of her mother well ?? <br /> <br /> “The Violent Men” uses widescreen technology to highlight the scale and power of this heartbreaking action drama, making it a perfect example of the most enduring classics of the genre ??
