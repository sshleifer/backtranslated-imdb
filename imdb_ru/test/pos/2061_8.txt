"The Long Kiss Goodnight" is a nice and very cool action movie and career breakthrough for Gina Davis. The plot is very familiar with the plot of The Bourne Identity, but so what. Scenes of struggle - a real pleasure for the eyes, and the storyline is strong enough to keep you in suspense for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> He is directed with a delicate sense of style and avoids most of the fighting clichés. Gina Davis is great as an action movie and plays her usual role as a “good wife.” Samuel L. Jackson, as usual, is good as a support player. The villain in the movie is too stupid, and you can tell what will happen to him. <br /> <br /> It breaks away from ordinary mediocre, such as Commando and On Deadly Ground, and is definitely one of the best action films in recent years. Good fun and good popcorn fun. 7.4 / 10.
