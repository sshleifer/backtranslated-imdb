Most of us, children who grew up in the 40s or 50s, were Western lovers, but it was he who escaped me until today's viewing on the Cinema for Men channel. I liked the story of the film, the cinematography, as well as the great cast of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr., starring along with the consistently reliable Ward Bond. Apparently, this film was the inspiration for the later TV series The Train Car, in which Bond again acted as the boss of the cars heading west. Johnson steals the film with his riding skills, and it's nice to see the actor doing his own stunts, like Ben does in this film. Other celebrities include the beautiful Joan of Drew in the role of Denver and the early non-speaking role of James Arness, who later became famous for his role as Marshal Matt Dillon in Gunsmoke. If you like movies of this genre, you can not but like this.
