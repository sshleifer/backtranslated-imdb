Garlin is undoubtedly a comedian and comedian for anyone looking for a good time. His first film, entirely dedicated to his own creation and production, tells the story of a struggling Chicago actor James Aaron, with whom Jeff clearly identifies himself. He perfectly compares James with “Marty” Paddy Chaiefsky and “Poor Soul” Jackie Gleason, revealing James's dilemmas with many actors who are real friends of Jeff, many of whom are associates of the Second City. <br /> <br /> He delightfully uses Sarah Silverman’s diametrical appeal and incredibly absurd humor to show how, despite common sense and talent, life satisfaction can too often contradict relentless disappointment. Bonnie Hunt is a charming game as a romantic interest. <br /> <br /> Don't let a simple story mislead you, characters and conflicts are well thought out and ring true. Those who follow Garlin’s career and understand that his humor is based on a playful presentation of reality, rather than creating fiction that is too easy to imagine, will appreciate his story based on dialogue. <br /> <br /> We will surely see how Garlin works a lot more as a director and writer with other talented clever comedians who take on the challenge of making life funny.
