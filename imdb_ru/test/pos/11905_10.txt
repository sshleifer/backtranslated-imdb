I like this movie and I recommend it to everyone. Damian Chapa and Jennifer Tilly played their parts perfectly. Just the characters alone pull you to the film. The direction was also great. The most creative shots that I have ever seen. I was During the entire movie there was not a single scene that was slow. The film also has a lot of action scenes, car explosions, etc. The film is just a masterpiece. If you like real entertaining movies, then watch it, because you will always be on the edge of your seat. I put this movie in my top ten for all the time, because the movie is never boring, and this is my type of movie. 2 thumbs up, until the very end !!!!!!!!!
