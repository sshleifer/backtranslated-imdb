This film will not be considered an Academy Award, but if you like a film that does not take itself seriously and simply wants the viewer to enjoy for ninety minutes, this is not a disappointment. You will like to send Darth Vader for the villain (breather), female Batman for the heroine (but much nicer with a much smaller suit), as well as a joke with cigarettes and the police captain, which is very funny. By no means a great cinematic achievement. But if you enjoy hiking fun, itâ€™s worth a look. God help me, I liked it.
