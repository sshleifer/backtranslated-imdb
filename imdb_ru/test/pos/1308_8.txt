This film is called “Junior Pilot” here on IMDb, but “Final Approach” on Netflix. Go figure it out! The film gives pleasure to both the target youth audience and adults who can suspend their maturity long enough to watch this film through the eyes of their youth. For an adult, this story is quite predictable and perhaps banal and melodramatic; while the story may seem new and creative for young people who have not yet seen or read many films or books with such a plot line. <br /> <br /> In any case, credit should be given to the filmmakers, especially director James Beckett and cinematographer Denis Maloney, for creating this most interesting and visually interesting film. The cuttings of the fantasy thoughts of the young main character Ricky are funny and delightfully filmed. <br /> <br /> Young actors give equally believable performances, seemingly quite embedded in their roles - as silly as many scenes. Jordan Garrett plays well the main character of "Ricky", having an excellent presence of the camera. Jeffrey Tedmori creates a deliciously soft and sensitive "Shashi", which of all the ridiculous things thrives on spicy sauce. Skyler Samuels and Adam Cagley also show solid views. <br /> <br /> Larry Miller, as is usually the case in his beautiful game, creates a solid parental figure around which the children's, real, partially fantasy world revolves. Compared to his father, the other main roles of adults seem superficial and one-dimensional, deliberately and with a sense of humor, therefore, certainly. <br /> <br /> This film is a simplified story focused on young people. Of course, it’s still quite fascinating, perhaps more than once for the target youth crowd, but also for at least one viewing by adults who retain the ability to watch such a film from their once-youthful point of view.
