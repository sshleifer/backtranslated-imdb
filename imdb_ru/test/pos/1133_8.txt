I just stumbled on this show when the ABC family had the whole marathon before the premiere of the second season. I remember watching the preview for the show back in 2007, and thought it would be short and not very well written, because it was on ABC Family. <br /> <br /> Never doubt the ABC family show! This show surprised me the best way. The show is not only well written, the storylines are realistic, funny and enjoyable. I expected a lot of talk about relationships, something like "this guy met the girl who left me for the sake of this child ... etc." But this show is not like that at all! Characters are attractive, and you really feel the connection between them. There is a lot of chemistry between the actors, and they can really make you feel that everything is happening right before your eyes. <br /> <br /> Do not doubt this show, it is really nice to watch it. and get hooked;)
