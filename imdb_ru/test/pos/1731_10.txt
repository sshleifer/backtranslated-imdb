Doctor Who is awesome. This is every "cup of tea." It should be. Boys will love the monsters, as well as action and adventure, and the girls - the emotions and feelings. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper was an outstanding Rose Tyler. She was so emotional and made Rose so real. <br /> <br /> David Tennant is also so witty and funny, and so nice to look at. <br /> <br /> But now Billy is gone, and Rose is stuck in a parallel universe with her boyfriend Mickey, her mother and father (he died when Rose was a child, but this Pete Tyler is from a parallel universe). It will be very strange if Martha is a new companion, since I only saw her with Rosa (except for “Runaway Bride” with Catherine Tate). <br /> <br /> Frime is better to be good !!! <br /> <br /> But nobody can beat Rose !!!
