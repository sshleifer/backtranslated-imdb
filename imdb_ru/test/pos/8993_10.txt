I wonder how someone can be scattered in this film? This is based on a true story. This is not necessarily about Rugby itself, so the one who wrote here that they need to make a “real” Rugby film, you missed the point. This is not another typical sports film where the team sucks, they hire Emilio Estevez and turn the team around, win the championship and give everyone a warm and fluffy look. It focuses on HISTORY. It shows how someone can change their lives for the better. Nowadays films about sex, drugs, parties, etc. This is Hollywood. I'm a big fan of movies, but I have to say that it was an inspirational film with a great message. If you consider yourself a "cool guy", do not watch the movie, it will not meet your standards. If you want to watch a good, inspirational film, this is a good film.
