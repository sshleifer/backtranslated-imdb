I was half asleep watching late night selections of short films - but I sat straight from the first frames of “I scream for love” and could not take my eyes off its full, short, perfect length. With an incredibly confident pace and performances, this film retains its funny / sad / insightful tone. Credits at the end went so quickly and in such a small form that I had to go online to find the person responsible for this master's work. What a pleasant surprise to see the name of Sarah Polley, a major actress who was too rarely seen. <br /> <br /> Kristen Thomsen (Tessa) and Matthew Ferguson (Bobby) are transformed into rich, touching ideas when a couple is in agony of destruction. Working on repetition of Tessa's favorite moments spent together, both actors reveal aspects of their characters and their relationships in such a way that they bring only honor to their talents and skills of a director / writer. The film creates a touching story with ludicrous moments and sad breath. <br /> <br /> “I scream about love” is undoubtedly one of the greatest and most memorable short films I've ever expected to see. He has a wit, heart and amazing originality. It is important.
