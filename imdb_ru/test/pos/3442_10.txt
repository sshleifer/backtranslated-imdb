In 1984, Edgar Reitz surprised movie lovers around the world with his epic opus entitled “Kheymat: Chronicles of Germany”. Eight years later, he came up with the sequel, “The Second Geymat: Chronicle of Youth,” which is even more striking than its predecessor. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is not really a sequel. This is more of a “midkvel” because it covers events that occurred between the ninth and eleventh episodes of the first Kheymat cycle. <br /> <br /> The second Heimat begins in 1960, four years after Hermann Simon (Henry Arnold) was separated from his first love, Clarchen, because of his intolerant mother and older brother (the controversy was that he was a minor when she was about 25 years old). Still outraged by these events, the young man vows never to fall in love again (a grandiose, if scary scene), and decides to move to Munich (like the director himself at about the same period), hoping to become a professional composer after several years spent in the music academy. . He stays in Munich for ten years, and the thirteen two-hour episodes of Heimat 2 cover this period of time, each of which is dedicated to another person among Herman’s fellow students, people who, like him, are looking for a “second home”. country, "whether it be music, film or something else, in which they can finally live peacefully. <br /> <br /> Like the first Heymat, this second cycle is the perfect union of film and television: an episodic structure and various Romantic scenes make him look like a soap opera, in fact, the Second Heimat must be considered entirely so that it can be successfully covered, while some chapters of Heymat 1 can be viewed as separate stories (in particular, the story of Herman’s teenage years).) and the content, however, is pure cinematic, with well-known black-and-white / color transitions (in fact, a bit more predictable this time) and ambiguous characters, the latter element emphasizing the relationship between Hermann and cellist Clarissa Lichtblau (Salome Kammer): they clearly love each other, but continue to do business with other people, postponing the inevitable until it is too late. This time Reitz seems more pessimistic about his characters (at some point Hermann is so disappointed that vorit: "The Beatles are much better than us!"), creating a whole episodes around dark, controversial issues such as abortion and suicide. The decade that he explores is not suitable for everyone, since some of them are dramatically traumatized by the main events of the 60s (especially the revolution of the 68th). <br /> <br /> Reitz also seems to have made this mini-series especially for movie lovers, given the numerous references to films (including the brilliant quote from Casablanca) and ingenious jokes (one episode set in Venice, whose film festival played an important role in the success samat Heymat). And since 1992, film lovers have never stopped thanking him for giving him the 26 most compelling hours ever devoted to celluloid.
