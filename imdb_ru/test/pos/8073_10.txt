For those who appreciate the intersection of silent films and social commentary, this is a unique film. Partly a tribute to German expressionism, partly an allegory, the film is replete with visual symbolism and artistic style that competes with everything seen since the 1920s. In addition, the attention to detail of the period and the visual composition of the scenes as a tool for promoting the story is staggering. In addition, the plot offers an interesting commentary on the role of the media in society and its impact on the social voice, perception and opinion. In truth, not so much silence pervades the film, as the loss of voice and the loss of words to communicate and express the thoughts that inevitably follow. In general, this film is not often seen, and, as the producer of the film said in subsequent questions and answers, it will make you think about its meaning the next day.
