“Come back to me” is a movie you want. This is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages. The story, although it seems impossible, seeks divine intervention, when a man loses his wife in a tragic accident and again finds this love in a woman who receives the heart of his wife. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give warm hearted performances as intended for lovers who meet by chance. But the real story is friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trials. Carol O'Connor, like Minnie Driver's grandfather, is genuine in every scene. Bonnie Hunt as a girlfriend, whose wit and encouragement emphasize Minnie as a “sister,” funny but warm in the scenes, especially with James Belushi as husband. Classic scenes and writing make this story so pleasant and touching to look again and again. Thank you for making a film in which family and friends are shown as solid caring people who love each other in difficult times.
