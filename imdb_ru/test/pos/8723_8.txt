As much as I liked Walter Mattau, I felt that most of his roles were focused on his personality. This role is one of the exceptions. He plays a dentist who is charming and dishonest. This role requires much more acting than most of his other roles. I liked the fact that the film was honest about how a professional can be dishonest to avoid commitment in a relationship. His whole goal was to find a way to be in a relationship with a much younger woman, but not to be faithful in any way. Alibi - using his secretary (Ingrid Bergman) to pretend to be his wife. At some point in the film, the feigned Mr. and Mrs are in fact mistaken, believing that in fact they are really married. The ending was good because a middle-aged man found that chasing someone in his age group would be better. The film was funny, interesting and was not sold, being a preacher.
