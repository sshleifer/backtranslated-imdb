There are so many positive reviews about Returning to Me that my opinion is not necessary to encourage you to watch this movie. However, I feel the need to express my admiration for this unique film. Bonnie Hunt proved that she is not only an exceptional actress, but also an excellent director and screenwriter. This film has everything, and it is full of humanity, tenderness, sense of humor ... Do not miss, do not wait anymore. And do not pay attention to bad reviews. Some viewers forget that films of this type must be watched not only with their eyes, but also with their hearts. If some viewers prefer Notting Hill or “You Have Mail”, it’s their mistake. For me, “Return to me” is a real gem, an unforgettable film.
