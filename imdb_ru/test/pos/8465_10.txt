The fact that this film was shown at the Barbican in London makes me think that the press should be sufficiently acceptable for such a show. Now the question arises: why is this long-lost and important film not available on DVD (or even VHS)? Many people in Europe and the USA had hoped to see this film for many years, if only for some other reason, besides the wonderful music written for him by Sergei Prokofiev. What needs to be done to get such a great production available to the general public, and not just to the Barbican patrons in London? Being a devoted listener of Prokofiev's music for many years and knowing about this film, PLEASE someone out there doing the right things and releasing them on DVD.
