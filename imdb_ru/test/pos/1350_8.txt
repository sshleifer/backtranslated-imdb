I read the movie and thought it would be a cute, good movie on Saturday night. I did not expect anything great, I thought that it would be mostly fluff, but I hope that this is not a completely bad experience. I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was perfect, most of the actors were exceptionally good, and everything went well. Ash Christian was perfect, his ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was good to see. He could turn this character into something that we all saw before, but instead moved away from stereotypes and focused on the character's wit. It was great to see Jonathan Cauetta again, I didnâ€™t know what he would do after Tarnation. Ashley Fink is a gem, a wonderful young actress who, hopefully, will get more work. <br /> <br /> In the film there are moments in which you could use some work, but in general a good time in the movie. A friend of mine described it as gay Angus / Napoleon Dynamite, but this is something more. This is a study of the nature of how to grow a gay man in a small town, there is pain, but the humor behind this pain (which only age can clarify) is increasing. I look forward to seeing new meetings with Ash Christian, Ashley Fink and Jonathan Cowe.
