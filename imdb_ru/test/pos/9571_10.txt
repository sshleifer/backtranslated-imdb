This film should be one of the funniest films in history. His cousins ​​The Mighty Wind, Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman are amazing in themselves, but Best in Show will win. <br /> <br /> A film about the idiosyncrasies of dog owners who show their dogs competitively, precisely the subtleties of the characters make it so good. After seeing the film about 75 times, I came to the conclusion that there is no weak character or actor in this film. The interaction between any "groups" of characters is very small, but it only adds beauty to the film. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie and don’t find it as funny as I imagine it, watch it again. The first time I saw this, I thought it was working, but not too fun. This is a movie that grows on you. Definitely a movie that you will quote often. <br /> <br /> Characters: Hamilton and Meg Swan: A +, if you get a DVD, see how these characters are “born”, it's amazing that these two hit the head like that. And find out that they really did not follow the script and sort of came up. <br /> <br /> Jerry and Cooks Gugleman: Cookies are especially funny, and she does a fantastic job selling the character Cookies. Jerry (Eugene Levy) provides his standard stellar performance with a cheerful, uncommitted weak half. <br /> <br /> Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donalan - A + Find me a more funny character than Scott Donalan, I dare you! He will forever remain for me the same character as he was so natural and, it seemed, by no means was forced. Stefan (Michelle McKean) was also very good, and they interact here (and a short performance with Gugglemans) to show why he is always in these films. Great actor with a razor like wit. <br /> <br /> Harlan Pepper - B +, I don’t want it to look like he’s not funny, he is sure of it, but being the only “solo” act, he cannot be as funny and others above. He uses the dog more than others, and he has some other features. <br /> <br /> All the others are great too, there is no weak character. Watch this movie at least twice. Buy, you will not regret.
