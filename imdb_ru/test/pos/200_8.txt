I have long wanted to see this romantic drama (with the decorations of the Second World War), and now, when I have, all I can say is that this is a real masterpiece of Russian cinema! <br /> <br /> Soviet films are known for their excessive propaganda, but, fortunately, this film lacks such an accent - thanks to a strong interest in the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a cheerful girl, doomed by the outbreak of war, for which he is happy voluntarily, but from which he will never return. The girl (Tatiana Samoilova’s wonderful performance) is also loved by the young man’s cousin, and when she doesn’t hear from her boyfriend, she surrenders to the latter and marries him. He, however, is a novice concert pianist, bitter about the war, which has cut his chances for success, and, knowing that the girl is still loyal to the soldier, begins to neglect it. Finally, the word reaches the girl about the death of her beloved person, but by the end of the film she learned to accept it as a sacrifice to her native country and was content with memories of him. <br /> <br /> The film shows truly amazing camera work, which uses screen space extremely intelligently and, often using tracking, oblique and high or low angle shots, lends great force to the unfolding emotional drama. Separate sequences are equally impressive - two, in particular: a terrific scene, furiously edited and sped up to boot, in which a girl saves an abandoned boy from being flooded by a truck; and the premature death of a young man in an unfortunate incident at the front is undoubtedly one of the best of its kind that I have ever witnessed (the sun moves away from him, symbolizing the life that seeps from his body when he imagines his wedding day never will be!). It is also noteworthy that the scene in which the girl goes to look for her parents in her home was hopelessly devastated during an air raid; as well as her last violent capitulation to a concert pianist, which she is trying to resist, repeatedly striking him in the face — during a later air raid and especially effective use of a set of heaving curtains! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the DVD R1 of this outstanding film is a work of bare hands (RusCiCo edition contains several additions, but, being export, tends to be highly overvalued and hard to find for download!); “Criterion” released it along with another Russian classic film on the theme of the war “BALLADA SOLDIER” (1959), about which my friend told me at a local DVD rental that he was preparing ... <br /> <br /> another film I watched from this director the arctic epic THE RED TENT (1969; albeit through a much shorter American version!), the star international production based on real events; given the unmistakable artistic quality of the film “The Cranes Are Flying,” I regret that I missed his famous documentary “I AM CUBA” (1964) several times when I was in Hollywood at the end of last year: besides the one-week theatrical performance, it was repeatedly shown TV accompanied by a full-length "making of" !!
