Well, the film turned out much better than I expected. This is not boring and not unoriginal. This is really not a silly romantic comedy. The situations in which the characters fall are very unusual, of course, we are still talking about the film, but the main characters are really believable. Donald is an exaggeration, of course, but he is just a pawn in the film, a way to prove something. The end is not one of those ridiculously happy, always the same, morally containing pieces of shit that you usually see in the movies of the genre. I really liked it, and I find it hard to please when it comes to this particular film genre. It is worth seeing. In addition, it is better than in other films, the storyline always rises, the characters themselves rise. And they do not experience this miraculous change, and love is not revealed to them as this artifact of the holy god, yad, yad. At the end of it all, you actually see how you go through it all, the film makes you feel something, you can even learn one or two things. This is no ordinary hopeful, moisturizing tissue idiocy. This is a good film, not a consolation prize for tearful women around the world.
