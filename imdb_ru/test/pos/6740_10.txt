Which of us read the book or saw the play, and then when the version of the film came out, we were terribly disappointed? Well, maybe this will be one of those films for those who also saw the performance, but as a person who has never had the opportunity to watch it on stage, this movie amused me very much. The characters were funny, the music was great, and the story was interesting and made you feel sincere sympathy for the characters, the flaws, and everything else. Jonathan Silverman has such good comedic plots, and his lines are especially funny. I'm not going to give any spoilers, it's just a well-made, fun movie, showing the inner workings of a middle-class family during World War II. Therefore, if you have never seen the performance, and if you liked other films of Neil Simon, do not hold back a couple of negative reviews that can be seen here. "Memoirs of Brighton Beach" - a great movie. I guarantee it (no refund though).
