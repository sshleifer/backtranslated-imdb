Apparently, the film arose from the idea that arose from one of the authors, when he "saw" one of his creations in the supermarket. Residents of Royston Vasey go to "our" world to convince the authors not to stop writing about them and thus destroy their world. <br /> <br /> If this sounds too serious, do not delay for tomorrow. During the first few minutes, we get: Bernice (the vile female vicar) allows you to break the unfortunate penitent during confession; Chinnery (a veterinarian who carelessly kills every animal he touches) is trying to get sperm from a giraffe; Mickey (fat to the bizarre), ah, fat; and Tubbs (inbred sister wife and local shopkeeper), as always, sweet, but still disgusting. <br /> <br /> Some ordinary characters are missing, but the Gents new idea introduces some 16th century characters - and we also have Gents in action. If you're new to the Gentlemen League, this is a simple introduction and a lot of fun. If you're a longtime fan, you have everything you expect, including the joys of Jeremy Dyson. <br /> <br /> Everyone says that he has the same surreal humor, which is the hallmark of the series, plus a few moments of a rather touching "introspection." Herr Lipp, for example, retains a gentle dignity, having learned that his creators consider him a “one-joke character”. Although most characters remain as they are, some develop in unexpected ways that are completely natural when they occur. <br /> <br /> This film is a “swan song” for Royston Vasya, but also a showcase for Gentz ​​who prove that (gasping!) They can write other things - and this can be very funny. (But you still knew it.)
