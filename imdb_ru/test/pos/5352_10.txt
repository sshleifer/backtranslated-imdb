After returning home after the third viewing of The Curse of the Were Rabbit, I decided to switch to IMDb and see what others think. I noticed that many Britons liked it, while in America they did not understand it. This is really not shocking, because America does not understand what “English” is. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are very English. English for the middle class, in fact, with a hint of eccentricity is added for good measure. The film is very similar to our two heroes; simply and modestly. It has a good and gentle plot, so children are not lost, yet there is enough beef there to entertain adults as well. There is some slight understatement (which seems to have offended the evangelist — oh no, the drama!), But there is nothing more rude than a butt for a short moment. When people are insulted by a plasticine anus, you know that the whole world is spoiled ... <br /> <br /> One quick note for those (of all Americans whom I saw) who think that Chicken Run is the best movie: Chicken Run was created to indulge your sense of humor, and I think it suffered because of that. The curse of a werewolf rabbit is witty, in English and smart. The Thomas The Tank Engine film was destroyed because it was made to please the Americans, and I am glad that Nick Park did not allow this to happen to another great British institution. <br /> <br /> To sum up: you can leave your chicken Run, your Shreks, your Madagasgi - such a rough, rough comedy with farces simply cannot be compared with the wit and grace of Wallace and Gromit in the Curse of the werewolf rabbit. English to the core, and let Wallace and Gromit remain so.
