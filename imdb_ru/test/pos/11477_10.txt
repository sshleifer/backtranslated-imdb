This is probably one of the best Portuguese films that I have ever seen ... I really liked the plot, because as the story progresses, you would become more interested in how their world really turned upside down ... only one part that doesn't really fit into the film, it's a strip for girls ... It doesn't add anything important to the story, it looks like it's just for the entertaining male goal. The ending is a bit unexpected, but at the same time somewhat expected. If you donâ€™t understand, then follow me: after so many odd incidents, the viewer is so used to the oddities that ending the film with completely unexpected relationships (for example, with Mimoso and Susana) sounds completely natural after watching the rest of the film. But above all, Sorte Nula is a film that makes you think hard, trying to solve mysterious events, laugh at their unhappy lives and spoil your mind about what can happen in just a few minutes when you turn away from something ... for all of this I rate 8/10
