Title: Opera (1987) Director: Dario Argento Cast: Christina Masillah, Jan Charlion, Urbano Barberini, Daria Nicolodi Review: The only other film “Argento” that I saw was “Suspiria”, and this film impressed me with its style, flowers and creepy plot. Then I decided to go with the Opera because I was told that it was one of his best. Dude, I found that I will eventually become one of my favorite horror directors. <br /> <br /> Opera about a young opera singer, who gets a big break when the main star of the creepy modern opera takes on Mac Beth hit by a car. Betty is an understudy, so she performs her role herself. It is a pity that behind her is a psycho who makes her watch the brutal murders of her friends and colleagues. <br /> <br /> Wow, I heard good things about it, this film, but I was not ready for it. the level of greatness to which this film will lead me. Yes, the film has its flaws, which I will reach later. But for the most part the film shook me. <br /> <br /> Firstly, this film is not as saturated with colors as Suspiria. I expected it to be a bit like suspiria in this department, but no, to my surprise, he had his own appearance. The film for some reason, devoid of color. It has many colors in certain scenes (for example, a kitchen / living room workshop sequence) where Argento fills the screen with rich green and blue tones, but for the most part the film has a grayish, black tint, and I liked that it had its own special look. <br /> <br /> The real stars of this show are incredibly well organized death episodes. Wow. Each death scene was like a work of art. Beauty in destruction. These are not just your typical hacker and death beats, these deaths have been carefully designed to shock and take maximum advantage of their situations. I liked every second, there is a lot of blood and chaos, but with style. Do not spoil them. <br /> <br /> Then there is a direction. Dude, there are some really original and beautiful pictures on this one. I loved the inventive use of the camera on this. You thought Tarantino starred in Kill Bill vol. 1 where we see that the bullet coming out of the pistol chamber was original? Well, this is the film from which he shot it! I truly believe that Tarantino was heavily influenced by this particular film with certain scenes in Kill Bill Vol. 1. Damn it, he mentions that the Italian Giallos influenced the whole scene with Beatrix at the hospital and with Ella Driver, who came to kill her, and here my friends are proof of that. Anyway, except for the mention of Tarantino, there are some amazing camera shots in this film, such as scenes of crows flying through the crowd in the opera house ... great things. And the main reason Argentos becomes one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The cast of most of the actors was fine, but the best so far was Christina Marsillah as the tortured young opera singer Betty. The looks in her eyes, when the murders were committed, were magnificent. The rest of the cast was a bit wooden and tough, but nothing that could stop you from enjoying the movie. <br /> <br /> In this film there were very few things that I didn’t like. First, a certain logic was thrown out of the window in certain scenes. Especially those related to Bettis reactions after she saw the killings. It seems to me that for a long time she just went about her business without telling anyone about it all. Even the police. I mean, if you see someone brutally killing a loved one before your eyes ... you do not just walk away from the scene of the murder and continue your life. Someone would have tied her to the murders. She could even become a suspect herself ... but no. Also the final is a bit anti-climatic. You have to see it in order to understand, but how the film ended seemed a bit unnecessary, it seemed that it could have ended earlier. It would not seem so redundant. But this is all not very big problems for me, because I enjoyed the rest of this beautiful film. <br /> <br /> I still have a lot of Argento territory to cover ... but I am devouring every step, as if I eat a plate of the most expensive caviar. This guys are really good. I think of his films as works of art, and I only saw two of them! I can not wait to open the rest of his films. Argento, you are a man! <br /> <br /> Rating: 41/2 out of 5
