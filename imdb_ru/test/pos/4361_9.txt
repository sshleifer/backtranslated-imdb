I had the opportunity to see this last evening at a local film festival. Herzog presented the film and then did the sentry Q & A. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliantly made “documentary”; Later, the Duke explained that he did not consider his films to be real documentaries, because the facts sometimes hide the truth. Instead, he writes scripts and some commercials to present a new element that he might have missed if he followed the original story outline. <br /> <br /> Little Dieter, unlike Timothy Tredwell, is a real person you fell in love with; You support him, you feel the suffering he feels. You admire the sense of humor and joy for life that he showed here 30 years after he was captured in Vietnam. You are disappointed to know later that Dieter passed away not long ago. <br /> <br /> As with most of the Duke’s films, the images are stunningly beautiful with a wonderful selection of background music. Especially the scene of the battle, taken from the archives of the Vietnam War, but fitting into Dieter’s storyline. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film is Dieter’s return to the hellish jungle where he was a prisoner of war, and he again talks about his journey with the local people. I look at us painfully, I can’t imagine what he felt when he was again connected. <br /> <br /> One of the best films to portray and discuss the nightmare of the Vietnam War. This should be a lesson for all of us.
