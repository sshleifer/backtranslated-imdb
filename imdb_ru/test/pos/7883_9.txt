It is a classic film that dramatizes the plight of a person who cannot adapt to the changes taking place in society and feels increasingly alienated, leading to violence. Joe is a worker, he is unhappy and angry, and all he needs is an excuse to lash out about what the story is about. Alone, Joe is calm; with someone else he becomes deadly. And what makes Joe even more frightening is that he fully rationalizes his violence, so for him it is not only not bad, but necessary. For Joe projects his own violent tendencies on those whom he considers an “enemy”, and therefore considers himself in a war, and in this film the “generation gap” is portrayed as war. But this is a war only for Joe, because in this case the “enemy” is in his imagination. Nobody wants to fight Joe, but Joe feels he has to defend himself. Although this film was released in 1970, its message is as relevant as it was then, as society continues to undergo major changes that lead to a strong alienation, which the film effectively dramatizes.
