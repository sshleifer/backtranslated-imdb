Before I saw this film, I did not expect much from him, although my friend suggested otherwise. At the request of my friend, I decided that I was really going to watch this movie. The minute I sat down to watch a movie, I was just shocked. From the credits I fell from my place; I just could not restrain myself. A film about Hitler in all its glory comedy. Hinkel is an absolute double for a Jewish hairdresser who returns from war. Thanks to the heroic barber, he manages to save one of the Germans and thereby get on board a member of the enemy, which helps in the struggle in which the Jews were. But everything went wrong, and Stoltz was arrested, but only to escape to the limits of the Jewish suburb, the "Ghetto." Because of this escape, the German army began a search, which meant that Barber and Stolz were arrested, but again they fled, only to be mistaken for Hinkel and, therefore, took his poison. ***** THE SPEECH THAT MAKES THE CHAPLIN AT THE END, FANTASTIC, THAT MEETS THE MORALS THAT THE SOCIETY CAN STAY ONLY ON THE DREAM. In speech, he contradicts the full meaning of the film, because it is the seriousness and sincerity with which he coped, and it definitely works, because I felt guilty because we live, thinking about ourselves SOMEBODY OUTSTANDING SUCH AS A WAR.
