It was really good to see; the dialogue was - for the most part - absolutely outstanding (I thought that the female roles were a little better written, which is a pleasant surprise). The performances were also very good. Frank Gorshin exaggerates a little when he enters his various minuses, but this may be his excessive compensation for what I see as weaknesses in the way a character is spelled; otherwise, he is VERY good Harry Groener also copes well with a slightly signed character (Tony), slightly overdoing some of the character's evil scenes. Ursula Burton is gorgeous, like Sister Teresa, really showing off the film through some of its flaws. Seymour Cassel and Louise Fletcher are a bit undervalued here, although I liked their work as always. Shirley Jones, Wendy Malik, Jill Eikenberry and Fay Grant are also very good (I couldn't help but think that Grant reminded me a bit of Catherine O'Hara here); Cloris Lichman rather rushes to his role with pretty good results. <br /> <br /> I wish there were more confident hands behind the camera. Sometimes framing or staging seemed a bit strange or awkward. Close-ups seemed to me excessively (or were used randomly). And we do not always go from scene to scene as smoothly as we would like. Some of the tough-guy approaches to the federal agent (music, costumes) were too overwhelming for me. And some fantastic episodes didn't really work. But there are things that were VERY well done; for example, the opening sequence was established in Buffalo around 1970. And, frankly, all the scenes related to Theresaâ€™s church work (I suspect that the writer and actress really liked the character, which helps). The scenes between Malik and Aikenberry are VERY good. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably a bit overloaded - it seems that several too many patterns occur at once to keep them all straight from time to time, and there should be a little too many coincidences. And I was a little concerned about the finale (should we REALLY root for their biggest cheater who has not yet succeeded?), But the trip along the way is very pleasant. It would be nice to see more independent films like this. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
