I love such movies. Blood, Revenge, Lots of action, Very dark, Shoddy and more. But this is not the kind of genre you might expect. When I saw Kite Birds and Ichi the Killer before, I had fun watching them, but why not? Dead or Alive: Final is a decent anime, it is not hardcore, and do not even expect nudity in this film. At the very least, add a few more actions to entertain your audience. Even the drama was not so good. Well, I do not want to spoil either the film or the plot. But I felt that Dead or Alive: Final is a bit boring. So, without further action. I do not recommend this film to everyone, but I recommend it for people who love decent and well-directed anime. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphin and University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
