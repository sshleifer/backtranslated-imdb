This film tells the story of several couples coping with life after World War II. Through the many moving bills, the audience learns how the war changed people, while their human spirit became a triumph. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where a young soldier who returned home as a double amputee (after losing both hands to the elbow) is sure that he would be useless for his lover who still wants to marry him. His girlfriend simply said that she would help him with things that he could not do, but that they would be fine together. Inspired by this true manifestation of love, a man embraces his bride in tears. <br /> <br /> The scene when a soldier asked for a bank loan is also a highlight. When he was initially denied “high risk,” a high-ranking bank employee takes over, saying: “You fought for our country and kept us safe — that's enough for me. Your credit is approved! ”“ The best years of our life ”won 6 Oscars, including a special statuette for a disabled actor, which showed us that life goes on and will continue to live, even with a serious shortcoming. This film is a joy to watch again and again. A real classic! Highly recommended!
