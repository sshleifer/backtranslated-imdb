A sleeping cage is what should have been 24. 24 is a cartoon. (I look 24, but I feel cheated with every stupid episode, all four or five seasons so far. Who can see how they are all the same. Then ...) Sleeper Cell is really well made and much better. Unfortunately, they blew it up with ending in the second season. I can come up with half a dozen of the best endings on top, which would be better suited for the obvious purposes of the writer and would not be so contrived. Shame on the authors for ruining what was before the end of a really good series.
