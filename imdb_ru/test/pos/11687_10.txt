One of the main successes of “The Fall of Western Civilization,” an indie breakthrough by director Penelope Sferis, is that he may like not hardcore fans, but hardcore ones. More importantly, it captures a moment in history before the movement became completely “market-based”, when groups played (or at least tried to play in some cases) in raw, dirty clubs in front of an audience that had as much self-respect as they respected groups. For a fan like me, there are precious interviews with some of Los Angeles' punk-filth quasi-legends, some dead, some still living and still working hard on stage. <br /> <br /> Among the speeches and interviews such as “Round Jerks”, “X”, “Black Flag” (in the days before Henry Rollins), “Catholic Discipline”, “Fear”, “Alice Bag Group” and the most memorable (in my opinion)) Be a germ. While I was aware of several bands and performers in the film (mostly The Jerks and Black Flag), I only heard rumors about lead singer (deceased) Darby Crash, and from the frames in the film he seems to be one of, if not , incarnations of punk movement. He does not take himself too seriously, he likes to drink, sometimes when he says that this is a complete gibberish, and the attitude he takes on stage is funny and in a free form. Such a performer is likely to scare Steve Miller and Jackson Brown from their skins. <br /> <br /> Reducing the level of Western civilization may not include every non-punk fan who is looking for this film (it’s hard to find in the video), but it doesn’t have to turn them off. As a kind of anthropologist who penetrated the party, Sphiris discourages the behavior of these people, their motives, their sympathies and hatred, as well as the power that was their characters on the screen and behind the scenes. Some of them almost go out as usual, some are not, but they are offensive only for those who are not too open to things. On top of that, this film is a must-see for those types of children who consider themselves punk fans just because they listen to Good Charlotte and Blink-182: if you want to get a real idea of ​​the movement and the genre Rock, which you profess in love Give a chance to the pioneers.
