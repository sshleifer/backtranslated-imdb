I am surprised how a director, notorious for his political zeal, could have made such a thin, non-English picture. If you are for the death penalty, you will still be behind it when you see it. If you are against the death penalty, you will still be against it. But whatever your position, this film will at least make you think about why you feel how you do it. There is not a single false note in the film.
