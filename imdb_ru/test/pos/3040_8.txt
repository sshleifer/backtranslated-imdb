Just watched konraka for the first time. Although the last third of the film leaves much to be desired, it is a very touching and touching study of human evolution, in order to overcome his youth and upbringing in the biased south and the teacherâ€™s creative approach to communication with students, despite different experiences and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing how a teacher adapts to her students and prepares them for all the difficulties that life can offer, and not just the lessons that can be found in textbooks, is a valuable concept that we all need to recall. The thread of the Vietnam War rings true even today. Worth seeing.
