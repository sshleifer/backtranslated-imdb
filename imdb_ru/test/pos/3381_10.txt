After I became interested in the mini-series “North and South”, I could hardly wait to continue “North and South II”. Then, years later, Book III appeared: "SKY AND HELL - NORTH AND SOUTH - BOOK III." Finally, the last installment came for the ongoing saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so fascinated by this show that I shot every part of the TV, and then I managed to hook my family and friends, and I watched them again, every time someone new wanted to see them. My recordings are old and I long for this trilogy on DVD. If you missed Book III, you didn’t get complete satisfaction and you don’t know how it all ended. Do yourself a favor and ask for this DVD set!
