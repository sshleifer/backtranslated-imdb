I first started watching “Outer Limits” back in '95, when I was 10 years old, and it just amazed me every week with every episode, every episode had a turn, and every week I couldn't wait for the next one. The way the authors managed to do each episode so well and to distinguish it from each during 7 seasons is beyond my power. This show helps us talk about life, robotics, encounters with aliens and humans, as well as how paranormal and how it affects people. What really makes this a good show is the characters in each episode, they really show emotions and really good actors. The fact that you will also notice every week is an actor / actress, which you will learn about from the past show, which is rather neat in its own way. <br /> <br /> If you want to relax and unwind a science fiction show, then Outer Limits are for you.
