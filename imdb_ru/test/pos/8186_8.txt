Leaving aside the flaws and shortcomings of the film mentioned by other viewers, I must say that it seemed to me a film about power, which, in my opinion, is one of the most tempting illusions. I saw the drama of the emperor and the people. It seems to me that the director wanted to raise the question of what a nation is and what the price of “happiness” is for everyone. Is there an excuse for coercive gain and “happiness”? How much can you lose for the security of the nation and a peaceful existence? Is it worth thinking about creating a powerful potential empire so that it turns into poverty and kills thousands of its citizens now? It seems to me that the emperor himself does not know the answer and seeks to study it all the time while the film is on. He is desperately torn between these desires and at the same time psychologically persecuted due to the discovery of his true origin. It seems that he half hates his subjects because he had to renounce his father and his love, half love people, as a good emperor should do. It is not surprising that his actions are contradictory, and emotions mixed up. It seems to me that as another film representing the problem of man’s power over other men, the film is a success.
