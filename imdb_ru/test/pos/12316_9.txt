In his latest film, John Houston sent his daughter Angelica in a film adaptation of the story from "Dubliners" by James Joyce, and he gave us one of his best achievements in order to recall it. <br /> <br /> Joyce is about how it is impossible to make a film like anyone else, but “The Dead” at least present a traditional story for the work. Most (in fact, almost all) important information in the story is between the lines, in the thoughts and expressions of the characters - there are big moments, but they are brainwave - they are not the material from which the films are made. But somehow, Houston gets it right, and he manages an almost flawless adaptation. <br /> <br /> Angelica is great, and the film is intrusive and strong. <br /> <br /> Rating: A
