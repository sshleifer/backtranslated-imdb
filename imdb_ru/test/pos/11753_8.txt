Holden and Jones in this film are PLACED, but not in the way we think about how this can be done today - it is very subtle and imperceptible, but tangible. Jennifer Jones in particular is SO SEXUALLY HOT in this film (much more than a caricature as Monroe ever was) because she creates a real woman - with ALL aspects of femininity: she is intelligent, intuitive, graceful. She is willing and desirable. <br /> <br /> On this famous hill there is a scene where it lies in the grass, looks at Holden, and the expression of her eyes is evaluated on X, but in the context of the scene and character, in the full sense. You do not need all this to be said in a dialogue - stated as rude evidence in most modern films. This is all in her eyes - sexy, but elegant. What a stunning, underrated actress she was. (I first saw her "Madame Bovary" recently, and he was equally amazed.) I will take her for Bergman, Davis, or two Hepburns on any given day.
