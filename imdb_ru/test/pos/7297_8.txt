I just watched this movie for the first time since ending the book last week. What is the problem here? People admit that the performances are magnificent - I mean, Lange is a star! - and that the film is beautiful, but it has less than 6 points! I do not understand Come on! Scripture is not so bad! <br /> <br /> Having read a lot of novels that won the Pulitzer Party, and saw a lot of films based on them, I think that the work of providing The Scenario is together. I thought that the end of the whole dialogue in the novel was performed almost perfectly. There were quite a few conversations in this story, and this story did appear on the screen, despite the fact that only part of it was used. <br /> <br /> ** BOOK SPOILER PART ** I was, however, a little disappointed that there was no “Ginny trying to kill Rose” in the story. I thought it was one of the most emotionally annoying parts of the book, but it would probably be nice to leave it aside. I think, avid moviegoers, more than avid readers, are less inclined to forgive heroes who pull antagonistic things. This can be confusing for Johnny Lunchpale and Joe Sixpack. <br /> <br /> If you liked the book, you will like the movie. If you hated the book, chances are you will hate the movie. <br /> <br /> ******** <br /> <br /> horn
