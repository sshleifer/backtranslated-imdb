This is a risky job - to make such generous productions of The Merchant in Venice. It can be a heavy, wooden, antique item, or it can be funny because of its excesses. This version is neither. While I am not completely sold out by a very discreet Shylock Al Panchino, he does give a competent and honorable speech. Antonio Jeremy Iron, as always with his weary roles, got carried away. Some of the minor roles seemed to be a little bit in the spirit of fierce merriment, "the boy's Venetian adventure story," but the central plot is effectively and sympathetically moving forward throughout the film. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that the shooting, costumes and interiors were breathtaking, almost mad. <br /> <br /> One thing I donâ€™t want to comment on is the anti-sesetic content of the play. The film is so sympathetic to the difficulty of the Jews, while at the same time portraying Shylock as a tool for his self-destruction. This is a sad comment that four centuries later the director of this film found it necessary to comment on his nuance before the premiere of the film in Toronto. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie and I look forward to a few views.
