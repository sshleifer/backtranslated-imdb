I love the movies that take you to them. A film that actually makes you feel weak when it ended, and this type of film is rare. <br /> <br /> Damian is so talented and versatile in many ways of writing and representing different characters on the screen. This film has a cutting edge. The main stream on such a low budget. Why can a person with such great talent and charisma (not to mention sex appeal, go beyond most other actors) with so little money to work with ????? These actors really believe in his script and the raw talent of the director, writer and actor. I am so pleased to know that such a modern, brilliant day exists, let the passion for art move it and take us as an audience with it. Damien I heard about you through many different circles and do not allow the jealous of this world to get to you. Martin gets it, Fellini understands it, and you always get it. The fire and passion in you is what we love to see on the screen. Thank you for being different and have the courage to write like you. You are a one-of-a-kind director, do not listen to empty vessels.
