We all played Halo, Socom, GTA, Resi, etc., but none of them stand up to GE007. The game itself is excellent. I literally burned my N64 while playing this wonderful game, along with Zelda OOT. This game itself has created a template that is necessary for all modern shooters. on top of that, the multiplayer game is great. Story mode itself is worth playing a hundred times and more. This is a great game for those cases where you and your board just want to shoot down some people, and you have endless unlock possibilities. (cheats, aztec, egyptian, god knows how many multiplayer spells, three difficulties, as well as the famous difficulty "007". Our modern games are great, but when you sit down and play this game, you have a certain feeling that few other games can give you. And with the possibilities of online new shooter games, we rarely see this old two-for-two game style, and when we make it, it's not as good as these games. And when you get tired of the story, there are endless puzzles, glitches and easter eggs you can find and use in your their interests. <br /> <br /> It is certainly one of the greatest games-shooters of all time.
