I really like this movie. I love it, not only because it’s a great movie from the early 80s with a great soundtrack, but I found that there are some thought-provoking moments in it. These are just moments; not the whole movie. It definitely doesn’t look like Less Than Zero. <br /> <br /> Scenes deal with typical peer pressure, as well as more complex issues such as betrayal of trust. These problems are not easily solved or forgotten by characters. Some scenes stand out and encourage reflection on their own teenage experiences and how this experience could affect his character and worldview as an adult. <br /> <br /> You can watch this film and think about the problems that young people face and your own experiences. Or you can just pay attention to the desire of boys to deviate themselves! :) Anyway, this is a good movie.
