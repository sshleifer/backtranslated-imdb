Being a Cornish and brought up on the history of tin mining, this film is special to me. Filmed in various parts of Cornwall, he tells the story of two of your children who are trapped in a mine with a group of miners. <br /> <br /> The name "Ghosts" refers to "Springgins." - the ghosts of children miners who live in the mine and, as they say, bring evil to everything that is there. Events happen when an American wants to invest in local tin mining, but when the young local boy Josh is haunted by the ghosts of a little boy, he and his American “girlfriend” decided to solve the mystery of his death, the culmination in saving themselves and several miners from almost certain death A new shaft is open and spiggins saves them. <br /> <br /> The best film, albeit low budget and short, but worth seeing from Cornwall and / or in the extraction of tin!
