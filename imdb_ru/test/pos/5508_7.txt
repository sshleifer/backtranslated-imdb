Everyone told me that this film was not very good, sick, and so on. Therefore, I finally shot it and was amazed. I thought that torture would be much worse, but it was really shocking at the end, but that was all. I would not call it a horror film, maybe a mystery or something in the category “Silence of the Lambs” and / or “Kiss of the Girls”. Sometimes it became stupid, but the rest of the film kept me on the edge of space. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R - for strong torture, violence, language and sexuality
