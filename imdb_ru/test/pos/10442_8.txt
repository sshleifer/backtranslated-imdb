When I watched this movie as a teenager, I tried to find a soundtrack. Some groups of the soundtrack, I did not know. However, during the film I already noticed its quality. U2, Blondie, Police. Quincy Jones, Commodores. Sensational soundtrack. <br /> <br /> In Brazil, this film has long been not shown on television. Today he went on cable television, and I remembered visiting the site to make a comment. <br /> <br /> The end of the film surprised me a lot, but this is what happens in real life. It is not always what they think about being an ideal, this is what happens. <br /> <br /> Life gives us a lot of surprises.
