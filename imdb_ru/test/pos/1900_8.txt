The various franchises of Law & Order and CSI are better to be glad that Dolomite is not passing. The lady cops, ADA, and the coroners would be delighted, and the men would be subjected to such a trembling soul, significant jumps in the melting speed of the badge (Would you not like to just look at Horatio David Caruso and learn all this from CSI to get dolomite puppies pulled from their asses) Ice T may start crying and return to the Playa Trail. <br /> <br /> Low budget, bad but enthusiastic game, as well as the vision that gutbucket nightclubs offered to their patrons; funk bands, soul singers, the last remnants of old-style artists Chitlin Circuit (that strange dance troupe) James Brown, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, and many others came from these clubs to glory, while their peers worked in local or regional glory. Rudy Ray Moore came from this background, and the character of Dolomite is a mixture of bold black bullies wading through them. He did not have to go to the door-post, the pig did not have a warrant, as his mediocre, plump self maintained a true kung-fu stable - this is a mystery that only a student of cults can explain, but everything except the point. This is a glorious home movie of the legendary performer, which, compared with the mirrors of actors, ranging from "Established Hollywood" and ending with snorvests of indie films, is striking in its popularity. Merry dumb movie!
