Alteration of the classic 1951 "Things from another world." 12 people are at a completely isolated station in Antarctica. They are captured by a thing from space - it devours and completely duplicates everything that it wants. It starts like a dog, but it is released - and has a chance to duplicate any of the men. Soon nobody trusts anyone else - they are isolated - the radio is destroyed - their helicopter as well. What are they going to do? <br /> <br /> The 1951 film was just a big, superhuman monster. This movie was scary. This one too - but the story is different (and based in more detail on the source material - the novel “Who goes there?”), And this is scary differently. The film begins immediately with Ennio Morricone’s extremely creepy score setting just the right tone, and — when Things are attacked — the amount of blood hits. Blood and body parts are flying everywhere - hands are bitten off, heads are torn off, and at the strongest one person first eats his face. The effects of blood are STRONG and real nightmarish stuff. I do not frighten easily, but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw this back in 1982. The effects of Rob Bottin are incredible - how this picture came out with an R rating, taller than me! It also has a very eerie feeling - aside from the blood, it is very tense. You are not sure who is what, and the direction of Carpenter and the bill really creates tension. One complaint - no one is given any distinctive personality traits. They, the actors, just stand straight and speak their lines. It is annoying ... but the film still works. <br /> <br /> This was a critical and commercial catastrophe in 1982 - it competed with "E.T." and many critics complained about the amount of blood, and there were no female characters in the film. Now he is considered one of the best John Carpenter. Be sure to look ... for strong stomachs. NOT a date with the movie! <br /> <br /> Funny note: when it was released, Universal sent the note along with all the prints of the movie. They offered the theater owners to play a movie in the assembly hall next to the rest rooms. They were afraid that people would be so disgusting from violence that they would have to be near the object to throw them out!
