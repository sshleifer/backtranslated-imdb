On top of the success of “Rebel Without a Cause” came a wave of “teenage” films. Perhaps this is one of the best. Very young MacArthur stands out here as a teenager, not too worried. History concentrates more on the perception of crime than on any traumatic event. The supporting cast is remembered, Frankenheimer directs, like an old professional. Just a story about a young man who finds others taking his actions too seriously.
