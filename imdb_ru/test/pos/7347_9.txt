I really liked this movie. It is rare to find a star that can convincingly remove the physical aspects of any sports / dance film, as well as cope with acting. In this film you will find two stars that fit the occasion. Both women give warm, touching and sometimes humorous performances. The film also touched on a range of topics, from racial issues to sexual identity. Yet the approach was not harsh. Production values ​​were also top notch for a small film. I saw this at the gay and lesbian film festival in Philadelphia and came back the second time. It was a real crowd, please. Everyone I spoke to seemed to like this movie.
