First of all, I want to say that most people who give a bad review do not like such comedies, the film is great if you are unbiased and not afraid to laugh at some nonsense. <Br /> <br /> This film is shot as a television show with many short clips assembled into one long movie. In some scenes there is not even a dialogue, someone will just come out and do something unexpected, and this is funny! The only negative that I had was that I felt that I was wasting money on my Popcorn and Ice, I could not eat or drink during this film, which I constantly laughed at. I was genuinely nervous because I drank some Icee and saw something that made me laugh and shoot it everywhere. <br /> <br /> If you don’t mind any male nudity, and you like the Jackass movie, damn the show, and viva la bam, then for YOUR watch this movie. <br /> <br /> And if you don’t like the first movie or TV show. Do not see, and if you see, do not leave a bad review about it. Hardcore Christians who see it and beat it just don't seem to suit me.
