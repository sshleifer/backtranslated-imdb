If you are looking for a movie with fantastic music, a good cast and a storyline that is not difficult to understand; FAME for you. <br /> <br /> I have a few scenes that I love in this film; some make you laugh, others make you think. Editing, I think, is wonderful, very fast and often fun. Of course, perhaps, in all this there would be some potential, the whole story somehow remained on the surface; maybe there are too many characters involved. But I don’t care, because real stars ... <br /> <br /> ... music scenes! One of my favorites: a sequence of hot lunches and jams. This piece is so raw, cool and made in a special way (in the style of handcamera in "music-hell-Break-luchi"), it is simply electrified! I miss this raw energy in today's music videos; the only such energy that I discovered, perhaps in the Rose by Bette Midlers, in all frames of the concert. It is about capturing something “wild” that “really” is happening, and not just doing it perfectly; take by take. <br /> <br /> So, FAME is a wonderful nostalgic trip at a time when there are no synthesizers available, where there is no heavy and walking person. I recommend it once a year; certainly not for everyone.
