Un Gatto nel Cervello, or Nightmare Concert, better known among English-speaking viewers, begins with the horror film director Lucio Fulci (played by Lucio Fulci himself) going to dinner after the filming of a very horrible and cruel scene, but he orders steak And has a terrible vision associated with cannibalism. Grotesque visions, hallucinations and dreams continue and begin to influence his mental state, Fulci decides to seek help and is associated with Professor Egon Schwartz (Dvid L. Thompson) for psychiatric care. Schwartz argues that Fulci cannot separate fantasy from reality and agrees to help him, however, Schwartz has a more sinister ulterior motive, since the serial killer begins to brutally kill prostitutes, and Fulci believes that he may be in charge .... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was co-authored and directed by Lucio Fulci, who also starred in the film as a horror film director named Lucio Fulci, who, in fact, does not feel that a lot of effort has been invested in it, in any case, Un Gatto Nel Servello, if nothing else, I rather liked that one. The screenplay of Fulci, John Fitzsimmons, Giovanni Simonelli and Antonio Tentori is no more than a grueling excuse to edit many bloody scenes from other Italian films. I guess he copes well with his task, and to see that Fulci on the screen causes some admiration if you are a fan of him or are familiar with his films, the final is in a hurry, as if they ran out of money because he just has a policeman. saying Fulci they killed the murderer and that's it. One more thing about this ending, when two cops laid a white sheet on the dead killer in the field, and then they left, leaving him there without any other police presence, I mean, the police in Italy will just leave the dead body in the middle field by itself? It moves at a good pace, and if you like your blood, then you have to see it, although if you don’t like blood, you will hate it with passion, it all depends on your temper, so the choice is yours. <br /> <br /> Director Fulci was never the most skilled cinematographer, and he shows it here, because his frames are soft, flat and look as if they were shot for television, the frames from other films (only 7) are not ' does not match the material shot by Fulci, and it is obvious that it was from different films. If you are looking for blood, you won the jackpot, people are dismembered by a chainsaw, passed through a meat grinder, faces melted, there are several decapitations, there are several cuts in the throat, someone is terribly crushed under the machine, the tongue is pulled out, someone has cut the throat when he runs a wheelchair, a lot of beats, someone removes the guts with a hook, someone has a rotten corpse with larvae, someone has a hand cut off, someone has a broken head in their eyes bloody death from the piano wire, which cuts through someone's throat, around a bunch chopped off x limbs, gallons of blood spray, a scene where some cats eat brains, and that's not all. Having said that, some of the special effects are a little fake and look silly. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 100,000, it shows that it is rather cheap, it doesn’t have any visual style or artistic merit, but then again, why are you like that when you see the Nazi orgy and blood from wall to wall? It's terrible, including Fulci. <br /> <br /> Un Gatto nel Cervello is the best movie if you are a hound like me, however, if you are looking for something with a little more substance or even any substance then this is not for you. This is a movie that divides people right in the middle: you either love what he does or hate him.
