My taste for films continues to amaze me and probably infuriate the readers of my reviews, but everyone has his own, and I have a weak point for insane horror, fraudulent clicks, and “Do not see evil” - that is and much more !! I think that the biggest mistake that the producers and directors of this film made is that they advertise it as a WWE film in the lead role. WWE may have a lot of fans, but this is a very, very specific group that keeps an eye on the incredibly trashy and (sorry guys) kind of trailer park “sport” and those who don't like it. HAATTTE IT !! This will cause them to steer clear of another typical fraud that people would come out in droves to see. See No Evil opens up NO new horizons of horror, this is definitely a game of a typical horror game with horrible bloody scenes that honestly make your screen creep. They will really take him home and go to unreasonable legal violence. There is no psychological aspect to this, although the pursuit of this monster has some elements of fear. <br /> <br /> Kane (a wrestler), also known as Glen Jacobs, plays the religiously and physically tortured man Jacob Goodnight. He is the ultimate cross between Leatherface and Jason Voorhees. He is not a real killer, and even his murders are not really unique or original, except for the fact that he strangles a girl to death, forcing her to swallow her mobile phone ... yeah !! He does a good job, and the man is justly awesome !! He stands at a height of 7 feet and without any special effects is monstrous !! Tiffany Lamb, Penny McNami, Samantha Noble, Michael J. Pagan, Luke Pegler, Christina Vidal, Rachel Taylor all play in the typical group “I think they are invincible,” arranging parties for teenagers who unwittingly become victims of a serial killer. The story is that in exchange for a month from serving the sentence for petty crimes, ranging from theft to drug possession, they are sent to the old hotel to carry out "community work", correcting it. It turns out that the serial killer lives upstairs, and he removes the eyes of his victims in order to cleanse them of their sins. Luc Pegler stands out as a bag with scum who eventually becomes a kind of hero, even saving his ex-girlfriend whom he beat. The rest all play their promising roles pretty well, but this is not a big stretch of acting ability. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the porn director ... yes PORN ... Gregory Dark does a good job putting a modern slasher together. He even goes down in history with the murderer, and although his background is not unique, in fact it is a bit outdated, but still quite interesting. And in a few shots where the viewer of the film actually looks through the eyes of a killer, it is interesting to hear voices and see distorted things like him. He throws into the obligatory soft main nude snapshot, and the grotesque, soaked in the blood of the scene and turns everything up a notch. It fits nicely, and for a horrible fan like me, this is interesting. Kane's serial killer is terrifying, and he stalks them all with brutal intelligence and quiet horror. The film is being prepared and filmed, and I don’t blame anyone, because it’s pretty stupid, but isn’t that the point ?? This is a horror movie, and I thought that this is how it should be. It made me jump, made me cringe, even made me turn away into several parts ... impressive by any measure. This is interesting, with a decent history and a lot of serialization options for See No Evil before the 15th release, if they want, and I say, bring it !! It is true that the film is full of holes in the plot, ridiculous details, but the deadly blood and horror overwhelm it all. It all boils down to, do you like horror movies ?? Really love them ?? If yes, then you will think that this is a terrific slasher ... if not ... you will hate it ... clearly and simply. 8.5 / 10
