Cowboys and Indians - a great movie. Writing, acting, directing could not be better. This story was asked to tell, and this group of talented people and teams did an excellent job. Such stories are not pleasant, but they serve as reminders to people about the social injustices that exist throughout the world. I hope that when this film is seen, attitudes and prejudices will be changed. A film that can do this is a rare special thing. Andrew Berzins is a great writer, and his talents and experience in this field are revealed in this film. <br /> <br /> Thank you for telling this story !!! <br /> <br /> Ruby
