I just watched this short movie in PlanetOut Movies. <br /> <br /> Starcrossed was a very cute, sad, small film about two brothers in love. There are some wonderful, subtle actions from both men's leads. Often films with this theme seem to be too addicted to the controversial and shocking value of the plot, that they forget that there is a real story. Fortunately, director James Burkhammer does not do this, but instead allows the story to unfold with honesty. The sequences of the first two guys in love are very nice.
