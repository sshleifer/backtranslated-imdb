It is said that Batman starts in the first movie about Batman to “do it right”, but I think this is a terrible exaggeration, because I think that the new movie about Batman, although he is superior to Batman forever, Batman and Robin will fade away compared to Tim Burton's classics with this being the best of five. The darkness is as beautiful as the music and scenery, creating Gotham City hidden in secret, unlike Batman, where Gotham City is a normal looking city. The villains are awesome in this movie. You literally can't take your eyes off the penguin and the cat. I applaud Tim Burton for being original in that he used the penguin as a freak and not as an ordinary criminal or a clone of the old Batman TV show. In Batman Begins, we have a scarecrow whose image on the screen is not as demanding as that of a penguin or a cat. The film should not focus only on Batman, because we already know its history, and these are the villains we explore and try to figure out, and they are the ones who plot, with the penguin running after the mayor and seeking revenge for the desertion of their parents, killing the firstborn of Gotham, which he fails. Danny Devito gives the best game in the history of the villainous superhero in any film, surpassing even the joker Nicholson. The final scene, where the penguins drag the penguin's dead body into the water, is touching and powerful. This is a tragedy that Tim Burton was not allowed to complete his trilogy, since Warner Bros., interesting in marketing appeal, wanted to “light up” Batman movies. And they got their wish ... unfortunately. Tim Burton planned to shoot the third film, using Riddler as a villain, without Two Face and Robin to spoil him, and I’m sure Michael Keaton would have signed off. So this is the last great movie of Batman. Batman Begins - dark, but boring, tedious, ordinary, filled with evil villains and playboy Bruce Wayne. A worthy movie about Batman, but the best movie about Batman? Never. Batman returns holding this crown.
