Hercules the Avenger is by far the best entry in the muskulman genre that I can remember. Critics have accused that the two previous films of Hercules with the addition of new material, to give it a fresh look, do not take into account the fact that this approach allows to solve one of the central problems of films about swords and sandals. With most of these films, the middle third is terribly slack - usually with a rich love story or a mystical political intrigue or both (the queen falls in love with Hercules, her evil brother is plotting against them, etc.). Often it is difficult to keep watching the exciting finale . Hercules The Avenger cuts all this shit out of the original films and adds a rather lively narrative about the imitator Hercules breaking through in power. (It should be noted that this episode also functions as a distant, but unequivocally critical remark about the rise of fascism in Italy.) This also creates a subtle final match between the real Hercules and his imitator. <br /> <br /> In a narrower focus, I might also add that further editing improved some scenes borrowed from other films. For my money, the scene of the insurgency is much better here than it first appeared in Hercules and the captive women, because it was tightened due to the reduction of several characters and the complication of their plot. <br /> <br /> There are also monster diskettes, eerie atmospheric phenomena in the underworld, borrowed (literally) from Mario Bava, a ruined whole city and the usual number of cute babies in revealing dresses. Since no one expects any of these films to compete with Seven Samurai - or even the Magnificent Seven - it seems a little picky to assume that the film borrows other films against it.
