Burt Reynolds shot this action movie, and (amazingly!) He’s actually a pretty good director. This film begins well when an attempt to bankrupt Bert, who is associated with a drug dealer, fails, and he is demoted to a vice squad. The cast has some pretty funny scenes when Brian Keith always eats something, Bernie Casey has more class than all his colleagues put together, and Charles Durning loses control of his team. <br /> <br /> Vice cops stumble upon an expensive call girl who may be related to a series of murders. Sharkey spends his days exploring Domino’s apartment (Rachel Ward) and begins to really adore her from afar. <br /> <br /> Just as they approach the leader of crime, Dominoes are killed. I will not make surprises in the plot, but the first hour of this film is great. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after this scenario becomes very bright and incredible. <br /> <br /> Why is Burt Reynolds confronting the criminal boss with his big secret? Of course, this makes the guy sweat, but this leads to the fact that many more policemen will be killed. And it’s unbelievable that Domino and Sharqi will make love after they get to know each other for one day, much less often when their lives are in danger. And in the end, what happened to all the police who crashed into the building with our heroes? Is there no special forces? In addition, the film never tells how all the bad guys are connected and why they have to kill so many people. <br /> <br /> On the boat at the end of the film, which is probably the only nail-biting scene of the film. It's a shame that the climax is typical shooting. Nevertheless, this film is definitely interesting if you like crime and action movies. Do not think about the holes in the plot, and you have a good time.
