I just wanted to write a quick answer to all those people who give this film a bad review, because they think that it’s not funny or that it’s boring. <br /> <br /> This is a trick - the film should not be just a comedy. It has some depth to it. Like many films "Demme", it tells about people living in some strange corners of our society who are trying to figure out how to create a full life for themselves. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film industry and home videos do not do well with subtlety and leave it in the COMEDY basket. It's funny, but a lot of humor is not in itself. However, the essence of the film is not in humor, but in people. <br /> <br /> This may not be one of the greatest films in the world, but it is solid and interesting. <br /> <br /> And the cast is one of those that show why casting is an art in itself. Michelle Pfiffer is gorgeous, and it could be a film that showed that she has some acting chops to add to her beauty. Mercedes Rühl is a big cry and gets the opportunity to chew the landscape only as it can, in the role that requires it. Add Oliver Platt, Joan Cusack in smaller roles and talented Dean Stockwell ... and even Chris Isaac, and you will have a great cast, in which, as usual, there is a big difference. <br /> <br /> Matthew Modin is hilarious, but more importantly, he is the main handsome in this film. Hot, sweet and sexy. <br /> <br /> Sit down, expect the unexpected and let the film take you where it wants, and you should have a great time.
