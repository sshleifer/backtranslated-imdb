I usually do not comment on movies or TV shows, but I had to leave a comment about Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> Naturally, here in the UK, we have from 2/3 to the 3rd season, and although I managed to watch the last episode of season 3 (through other means), I am still glued together every Friday at 21:00 <br /> <br /> From the very first episode of season 1, I was a big fan of this show and all 3 seasons on DVD, yes, I canâ€™t wait for the start of season 4 in October. <br /> <br /> Why I love this show so much, I have to agree with the last poster .... James Caan, I know that one person cannot create a team, but Big Ed Delin was created for Caan, or maybe it was the other way around, I read that the producers were considering Martin Sheen for Ed Delin ... Really not! ! I also agree that the character of Kaan is becoming very soft, I also preferred the heavy double Big Bad Eddy D, which we saw in season 1 and 2, he seems to have relented. <br /> <br /> As I said, no one makes a team on their own, and, of course, other actors Josh Duhamel / Danny, James LeSour / Mike, Vanessa Marsil / Sam, Nikki Cox / Mary, Molly Sims / Delinda - everyone contributes, even outside actors such as Cheryl Ladd as Gillian Delin, Harry Gruner as Gunther, Dean Caine as Casey, Mitchell Longley as Mitch who can play 6 or 7 times per season, can match as if they were in every episode from day one. <br /> <br /> This show has it all: drama, action, suspense, laughter, romance, brilliance, glamor and celebrities who often play themselves. <br /> <br /> Many may disagree, but this is one of the best shows on digital television, and I hope that it can continue long after season 4.
