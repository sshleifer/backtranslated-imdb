Talk Radio sees a person accidentally stumbled upon life, even the American dream, with any standard and everyday work in the store; to come up with a local radio show, before going to the same job, only later — across the country. This is the role he takes because of his own aggression and natural manners, an amazing approach to freedom of speech, when he attacks everyone and everything, even those who often call for him or agree with him. His role as a person who is guided by all things of good, evil, right, wrong, political, religious, moral and immoral, is what people seem to take in one form; that "it is interesting and worth tune in," but additionally on the plane of rejection and antagonism ?? Two things were born from those things that seemed to be encouraged in professional work life in the Western world. This, in relation to a person, when he gets to the very top of his game through the American dream and deals with freedom of speech, when people relate to a person, but do everything they want, but do not accept what he says. <br /> <Talk Radio begins with the installation of tall, tall buildings in the business district of Dallas, Texas. Skyscrapers are shot from any angle and the tower above the viewer, as well as from everything else in the general vicinity, as this voice of one person breaks images, shouting out statements and information about objects, when these monolithic buildings dominate on the screen. They are a very physical representation of capitalism, while the voice of what we learn to be a radio DJ is the oral representation of the free west; personal speech and opinions about anything and everything. Stone will finish his film in the same way as he began it, although the film is not a circular journey, but how the characters undergo monumental changes both in what they see and in their common life. Rather, the images of the buildings act as an anchor, around which the study is observed. Ideologies and lifestyle ideas exist; people subscribe to them, but it does them more harm than good; until the restoration of the fact that this proud lifestyle still exists and will continue to exist, creating a multitude of people being shown in the film until someone or something radically changes the situation. <br /> <br /> DJ is Barry Champlain, a radio show person at a local Texan station, doing almost anything. Partly, Champlain’s carefree attitude towards some rather explosive content is manifested when he flies from one call with a fanatical person who recently visited the Holocaust Museum, a young drug addict whose friend allegedly overdosed, as well as curses and bullying pizza. For us, the content looks pretty shocking; Everything seems to these people to be commonplace, which inspires in us, new aliens, the serious seeds of both doubt and horror. <br /> <br /> What Barry is talking about, no one ever seems to really establish: everything and nothing. In fact, time is taken in the form of either jingles or dialogues that show the show immediately before and after Champlain's show on specific topics; gardening, for example, is conducted by calm and methodical people who, I am sure, do not move from one casual or extreme to another, constantly raising the stakes. Someone wondered what kind of ringing Barry was playing during lunch during someone else’s show: “Coming up later, Barry Champlain’s show! With the participation of village idiots and psychotic addicts! ”In fact, the intro part of his show carries a real tone, a cry to the audience, accompanied by a loud rock track. <br /> <br /> Barry’s success comes in a proposal for national syndication. He is born from confrontation and a relationship built on the contempt he feels for his listeners, and for what they feel for him. The promotion of the material and the increase in rates should call into question how far they think they can do it, and whether it really is worth it to go on the road for fun. It is when the show reaches this level of broadcast that Barry seems to have become unstuck for the first time in all of his broadcasting activities, when the alleged serial rapist calls and leaves most of them slightly dazed. At this point, the camera stops at Barry and, thanks to the depth of focus, covers the same towering, tall buildings from which the film began, and which stand outside the window, right behind Barry. They remain tall and proud. In particular, from the ideologies on which they were built, and because of this support for freedom of speech in Barry’s expansion of the show across the country, when one person climbs the ladder of his profession, he suddenly comes into conflict with the kind of content that is being offered. Everything goes too far, and this with freedom should at least give a sense of clarity, and not just revel. <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone did Talk Radio right in the middle of an exciting and explosive shooting period he had in the late 1980s. During this time, he released a series of really well-received films in a fairly short time; starting with one of my favorite films about the war in Platoon, then continuing to work on pretty brilliant Wall Street and ending with the 1991 JFK. You could even say that this race continued in the mid-nineties with Natural Born Killers. Talk Radio is like its main character in the sense that it is loud, loud, harsh and confrontational. This is not anti-capitalism, as it aims to draw the line between what is perceived as entertainment and what goes too far for popularity and wealth. Talk Radio is definitely a movie that is remembered.
