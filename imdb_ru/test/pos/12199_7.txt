Once again, there are despicable state institutions that stop at nothing to prevent the public from learning about some important events. In this case, the discovery of a new underwater species that may threaten the ecology of the planet. Although not E.T. it seems that he has made friends with one young man who protects him at all costs, not realizing that he is only a baby of this kind and is going to become much more ?? and even worse There were a lot of things in this 2005 series. This is a family drama, fantasy, thriller with a few comedic moments. The characters are believable, well-functioning and well-photographed. The show attracts attention. Of course, as in any science fiction show, it is necessary to achieve a suspension of unbelief. And I think it is here. Alas, the series collapsed after the first season, so we will never get permission. Furious .. There is a general comment that I feel is worth making here. Many television networks and / or companies involved in the distribution of films, quite arbitrarily cancel, seemingly excellent television series. especially smart sci-fi. Now there may be some very good reasons for this, although viewers are treated with the utmost contempt and rarely speak of reasons. This in itself is annoying. What really attracts my goat is that, by canceling the series, they release this thing on DVD, as much as possible, in an explicit attempt to milk the cash cow for as long as possible. For previous viewers of the series, this is normal, they know what they are for, but ?? many of these unfinished series end on a rock climber. The two that immediately come to mind are "Surface" and "Odyssey 5." If you heard something good about the series and didn’t see it, do you go and buy a blown-up DVD and end up with an unsolved plot problem ?? it makes me very angry !! I immensely enjoyed the "Surface" and did not understand that the poor characters would be in a situation that looked completely untenable? and we will never know what happened next. I believe that there should be a noticeable notice of all such DVD releases that the story is not over yet. I am currently checking the series purchases (IMDB is an obvious excellent starting point) to find out if the “completed” series is really completed or not. Caution for the buyer.
