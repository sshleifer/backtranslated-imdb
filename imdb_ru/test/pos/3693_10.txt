It seemed to me that this film is extremely delightful. I think I'm biased. I adore Kathy Bates. It seemed to me that she sings even more fun. She has a very good voice. <br /> <br /> Miss Bates plays Grace Beasley. The film takes you from her family life to Chicago to England, where her recently killed singing idol Victor Fox lives. There she meets her three surviving courageous sisters. She also discovers that Victor leaves behind Dirk Simpson's lover. br /> <br /> This story leads you to unexpected comedic and heartbreaking situations where Grace and Dirk develop true love for each other after a rather rough initial refusal on his part. They return to Chicago, where they team up with a pint-sized merry daughter-in-law to find the serial killer who killed Victor. <br /> <br /> Everything in the picture did a great job. Especially liked Julie Andrews, Lynn Redgrave and Barry Manilow. This movie was fun. He makes you cry. The music is simply enchanting. <br /> <br /> Other posters that have found problems with any parts of this film simply have no idea. <br /> <br />
