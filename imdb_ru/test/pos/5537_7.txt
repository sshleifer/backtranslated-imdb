The only problem with Married to the Mob is that it is not funny. He dresses just like a romantic comedy, but almost nothing is funny. But if you can look at it like a movie where almost nothing funny happens, then you will have a really good time. This is a brilliant film about the crowd, as in the title. Extremely brilliant. But the director, Jonathan Demme, is one of the few mainstream cult filmmakers who fully and fully accepted the 80s in his work of that decade, and for understandable reasons pretended that it was still the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Unification of the initial titles Animation of the 1980s, Italian-Americanism and the stage scenes immediately merged with each other. From there, despite the 1980s, this seems to be correct. The coverage of the frequent cinematographer Demme Taka Fujimoto and the jukebox soundtrack abounds in widely varying pop and alternative jams, it is tasteless, and it is really controlled and detailed as part of the atmosphere. Demme is good in vivid instantaneous characteristics in his visual and sometimes seemingly rampant composition of a funny combination of styles, plot that could go in any direction, where the smooth FBI agent, played by very polite Matthew Modine, tries to penetrate when the gun with the charm of Michelle Pfeiffer tries to leave the criminal lifestyle after her husband is a trigger man, as you had hoped in the play Alec Baldwin was amazed. <br /> <br /> The path works for a while, because Demme seems to hold his hand tight on the wheel. He knows how important it is to show us very subjective and life-related scenes at home with Pfeiffer, as well as her cares and desires as a morally contradictory mother, although her relationship with her son Joey is taken for granted. What kind of gangster son listens to the party mom when the father's boss, playing with the naturalness of Dean Stockwell's trademark and, of course, picking the scene from the cast, gives him such amazing gifts? However, on the whole, Demme's visual styles are easily perceived as a new story about a funny criminal thriller. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, we find that we are going the wrong way, because inevitably Modine and Pfeiffer should fall in love. This is not bad in its essence, and everyone here and there really feels tolerant, but as a romantic plot, he is not handled interestingly, well, well, hardly at all, because he goes through all the different clich√©s that meet the original expectations of raw 1980 The date is a flick, and for this audience, I think it has the right effect. But for those who are truly interested in history and an aesthetic approach, this is a disappointment in a tedious state. <br /> <br /> This is a decent movie with huge errors at certain points, but as a movie about a date or a nostalgic movie for those who grew up in the 80s, it may have seen a lot of dating films in the 80s, the value of entertainment not so great, except for the specified deficit in real laughter. There may be some ridicule, and this is very broadly mocking, but I would not leave the passage of comedy with high hopes, with which I would initially enter. Be that as it may, there are additional joys in roles involving great actors who have already begun to fade, such as Nancy Travis, Joan Cusack and Oliver Platt.
