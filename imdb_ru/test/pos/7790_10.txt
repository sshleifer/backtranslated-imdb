It would be nice to start with Rajkumar Santoshi, who is not a comedic director, and this is truly regrettable, because the only comedy film he has shot is a masterpiece. This movie is really funny. Loud in bits, overdone in several scenes, but still the dialogues really laugh, riots and characters are really full of fun. A simple storyline: the billionaire's daughter comes to India for the wedding, and behind her back are two young guys, the story has a turn with a connection with the Gangster. Amir, who plays the street smart guy, Amar played his role brilliantly, and Salman played the role of an innocent stupid to perfection. Rabbi did well, but in some episodes Karshima is really annoying. But the real show-stylers are Paresh Rawal and Shakti Kapoor, they enter the frame and automatically start laughing. In general, such a nice movie that you can watch it, no. just not boring.
