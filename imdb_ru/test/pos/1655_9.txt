Rififi is a great movie that is overlooked. This is a criminal drama when a person gets out of prison and plans another job. This is a very used story, but it is different from others. They round up the usual suspects to work. This movie tells how a family breaks down over time. The actual burglary scene is one of the best I've ever seen. Instead of an alarming soundtrack, the director decided to go in silence for about thirty minutes of silence. It perfectly matches the mood and is often copied these days. Of course, everything gets out of control, and people die, and it ends with a wonderful ending that accumulates in suspense. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for a great film noir, which few people say is a great choice
