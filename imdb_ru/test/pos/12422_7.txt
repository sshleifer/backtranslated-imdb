Two city guys drive through Hicksville, USA, when a rusty monster truck suddenly appears and repeatedly tries to knock them out of the way. Picking up a mysterious blonde hitchhiker, they stop at a truck stop full of amputated heads, one of which warns them of a “demon there.” But they do not listen. Big mistake! "Monster Man" by Michael Davis surprisingly mixes comedy with horror. The film borrows heavily from The Duel, The Blair Witch Project, Jeepers Creepers and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I especially liked the performance of Justin Urich, which offers comedic relief to the film. Yet the complete lack of expectation is hard to forgive. This is one chance if you have the time to waste. 7 out of 10. Did I mention that Amy Brooks is sexy?
