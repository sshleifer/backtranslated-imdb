I remember that this film was getting a lot of noise from reviewers when it was new. Letterman and Leno had objections. Letterman called it (paraphrasing) the biggest waste of the film he had ever seen, and Leno objected to a simple image of himself. But Letterman had John Michael Higgins as a guest on his show, so it looks like he didn't take anything too personally. Reprinting the DVD with opinions and the like from the participants might be interesting, although I suspect that the days when the late night wars of the talk shows captured the nation went and did not return anytime soon. <br /> <br /> I preferred Letterman to impersonate Leno, but I could never buy one for any. They never rose above the caricature, and I never accepted them simply as actors. For comparison: Paul Sorvino in the role of Kissinger in the Oliver Stone film "Nixon" comes to mind as an imitation that might have seemed ridiculous in the first few moments, but at least it seemed plausible after the first minutes of the fun had passed. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the show for me was Treat Williams as Michael Ovitz. Williams' speech to Letterman was not so great, but reminded of the entrance (and fast exit) of Alec Baldwin, like Blake at Glengenry Glen Ross. <br /> <br /> They could do more with the role of Johnny in all this. I know that he was mostly not involved in the events depicted in this film, and most viewers will be familiar with his reputation, so Johnny Carson needs no introduction. But more context about why Dave, Jay and all comedians worship Johnny, would give this film an essence that it lacks to be a film about gossip. <br /> <br /> I think I should read the book ... <br /> <Unfortunately, Rich Little, imitating Johnny Carson, is no more than Rich Little, imitating Johnny Carson. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you that after watching this movie, then watching the Letterman or Leno show, all I want to do is hack my DVDs to Johnny Carson and see the real thing.
