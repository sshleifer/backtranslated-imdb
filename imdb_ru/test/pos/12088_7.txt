First of all, I must point out that I really enjoyed watching this documentary. Not only was there great music in it, but the frames and the editing were wonderful. However, all these positive moments in the film do not change the fact that he plays, in the Orientalist’s cliché, “East Meets West”, which worries many Turks, like me. Well, this film tells the story of traditional and modern Turkish music in a very stylish manner, and this is good, which would show to ignorant Europeans and Americans that this country does not just kill Armenians and Kurds. However, the problem of the film is that it looks at what it defines as "east", through the eyes of "west." I mean, as one jazz musician in the film says, maybe there is no east and west, maybe this is just a myth, a lie created by the ruling leaders of “western” countries to maintain fear and hostility could continue to rule the world support the movement of money "? <br /> <br /> Why don't you think about it?
