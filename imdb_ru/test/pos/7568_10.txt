Zeke Rippi (Mick) is great, you completely believe his character. And it's damn scary, I spent half the film on my eyes, and the other on the edge of my chair. It's cool to see something so alarming and frightening that not only blood and courage - but it gave me bad dreams. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is a great movie - watch it as soon as possible.
