It seems that Hack was described as unrealistic ... but that is what television is. Television is designed to run away from everyday life, and I feel that Hack is doing an excellent job with this task. Add to this the slow process of uncovering your past and interesting / interesting stories; You just can't get enough. Plus, with such great actors as David Morse, Andre Brauger and even with little Matthew Borish, what else can you ask for? Therefore, if you are looking for an exciting experience and you like “weak” characters, I suggest giving Hack a chance, especially now that he is finally on his feet.
