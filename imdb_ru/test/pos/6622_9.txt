My skateboard career ended in 1974, when my two-by-four skateboard with steel wheels on rollers hit a stone, and I seemed to fall on the pavement near my parents' house in Boston for several days. By the time the actors left my hands, the summer was over. <br /> <br /> But I have always admired the types of X-games and surfers, especially. I think I spent the first month after I moved to Southern California to beaches and piers, watching the surfers, mourning the fact that I missed my calling. This is what you have to learn in your youth, before the terrible feelings of self-preservation and self-awareness permeate. Or, at best, you will be so worried that you will not be offended or laughed at, you will end up looking like a trained bear. <br /> <br /> I have always admired that a good surfer does not seem to care about anything except this moment, this wave, this experience. One with the forces of nature. A good surfer makes him look like there is nothing there but this wave and how you interact with it. For me, there is a lot of Zen in it. <br /> <br /> This documentary tells how several young people embraced the concept of surfing and expanded it to skateboarding. Ramps, lows, low wide bends when interacting with cement waves under their feet. At one time it was all new. radical. Before the Zephyr Skate team, apparently, the idea was to drive as fast as possible in a straight line on a skateboard, so my long Evel Knievel at Caesers Palace seemed to fall down the track. <br /> <br /> This film is a look back in time, to America, before EVERYTHING was tagged, tagged, sold on the market and caused by throats in our throat as Extreme. (Seriously, what is so “extreme" about Taco Bell's “Extreme Value Food”? Besides the fact that it is extremely dangerous for your colon ...) <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and see the birth " extreme sports ". Before the X-games, before the Boom-boom Huck-Jam, before the Crusty Demons, before the ASA ... there were these young street hedgehogs who created "extreme sports" without really trying. They just did it for the sake of cleanliness, pure pleasure - skateboarding in the sun with friends. <br /> <br /> I hope that they will receive part of the “extreme” money. God knows they do not get the credit they deserve. Maybe this movie can fix that. <br /> <br /> A great movie with a great soundtrack, a portrait of Southern California, really America, which no longer exists. <br /> <br /> I don’t know about taking care of Shaun Penn, but he does a decent job telling.
