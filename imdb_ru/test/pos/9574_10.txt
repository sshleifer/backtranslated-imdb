This is the funniest movie I've ever seen. However, I laughed more at more movies. This is because the brilliance of Best In Show is not in the farces or lines, but in sophisticated and multi-layered verbal wit. The improvised dialogue is so fast that in the end you are not laughing at every single joke, but only until a few jokes grow into each other, and each does not disarm your feelings until the jokes culminate and you cannot hold back. <br /> This is a well-made film, but what makes it unusual is acting. I was impressed with my first viewing, but when I watched it, having learned that almost every scene was improvised, I was amazed. It was very nice to see how comedians work with each other, make jokes out of nothing and completely immerse themselves in their characters. <br /> <br /> I think that the golden days of the Second City were like that.
