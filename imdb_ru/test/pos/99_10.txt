This film, with all its complexity and subtlety, makes it one of the most provocative short films I've ever seen. The topics he considers are ugly, cynical, and sometimes even gloomy, but the film remains beautiful in its language, cunning with its camera angles and magnificent in its style, skillfully recreating the story of the same name written by the short stories master Tobias Wolf. <br /> <br /> Not wanting to spoil anything from the film, I will not go into details, except to say that this film is great in itself. He is proud of what he does and does it well. It reveals the most important memories of life, all of which can be crowned with a single elusive feeling: unexpected bliss. This film, of its own accord, caused the same feelings in me as the main character (Tom Noonan), when the words changed his very existence, and this is one of the most impressive feats.
