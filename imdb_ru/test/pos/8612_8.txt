For a director it is especially difficult to capture the creation of a film without becoming precious, inbred, overly dramatic, or all three. Brailat skillfully demonstrates the instinctive working methods of a lizard woman in extracting from two “cattle” (as Hitchcock's actors were called) a love scene of burning proximity. naturally, it is the leading lady who will steal the show. I disagree with the fact that this is the first comedy of Breilat. “Romance” was fun at different times, but I admit that the French sense of humor can be elusive for foreigners; Indeed, dozens of IMDb reviewers did not find comedy in the novel. In contrast, Sex Is Comedy causes a lot of laughter, mainly due to the use of acting support, which dates back thousands of years to Plavt and the ancient Greeks. We thought, leaving the theater, was Roxana's “beard” a wig. The wonderful performance of Anna Paris when Breya fights with her own script looks ten years younger than her age.
