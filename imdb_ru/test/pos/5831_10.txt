OZ is an old television series released by HBO. It shows life in one security prison named Oswald, but the main plot focuses on the Emerald City, which is one of the prison levels. <br /> <br /> Oz has an amazing plot and outstanding cast! There are many characters, and almost all of them are very interesting. Mostly they are divided into groups (gangs), Sicilians, blacks, Aryans, gays, Latin Americans and many others who do not have any particular group, but they deal with many others, such as Ryan O'Reilly (Irish). ). <br /> <br /> The plot is very well built, there are a lot of conspiracies inside, a lot of struggle for power. But all this is not just abused, everything is very clever and clever, nothing happens without a reason, everything is connected and it is very interesting to guess! I really love this show, and who wants to see something clever, very well thought out with a very good cast and performances, MUST see OZ!
