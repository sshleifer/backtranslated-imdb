This is certainly one of the best Western films made in the new millennium. This is a tribute to all the stars of the great television of Western classics, and this is the final revival of Western cinema. The story of two brothers who met after the interstate war and found themselves on different sides of the law is not new, but it is nonetheless interesting, and the skirmishes and the atmosphere are magnificent. There is some graphic violence, for example, when bad guys are killed by an ax or coolly shot women, and Lee Majors does not participate in the action until the very end, so I gave her 9 out of 10, But this is still one of the best new western productions that ever seen. I had the honor and the pleasure of meeting Chris McIntyre at the Festival of the West and had a pleasant chat with him, and I had the opportunity to meet with Buck Taylor, who plays the role of a city doctor. In my opinion, we should be very grateful to Chris McIntyre for his efforts to collect so many stars of the classic television western and SASS around him to perform on a new western such as this one. Chris has an outstanding talent for choosing the right actors for the main characters. Both are young and promising, and I think we should see them more in future western productions. I sincerely enjoyed this western film - it was worth every minute. I hope that Chris McIntyre will continue to work on other Western films and give us some more great productions like this one. Great job, Chris! Jasper P. Morgan (Pete)
