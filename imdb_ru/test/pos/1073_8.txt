Mondovino is a touching and useful documentary. In the world of wine there is a huge difference between a big winery and a small one. this concerns not only the size of your vineyard, but also the amount of money and power that you have. If you have enough money to advertise with the viewer and hire the so-called “wine other than”, then the size of your property does not matter. In addition, in the modern business world, wine is often massively sold and tastes like people. which means wine many times, filtered from its origin. Mondovino shows the commercial side of the wine of mega-producer Robert Mondavi and Michael Rolland, a wine expert who shapes the wine to the taste of modern critics such as Robert Parker, who also participates in the film. Now these people are not evil or wrong, because they have done much good for wine. but they have power on a large scale. as we all know, power corrupts. Mondovino also features small winemakers such as Aime Gilbert from Languedoc and Hubert de Montil from Volnay in Burgundy. these winemakers are not hungry winemakers, but, like all great winemakers, they know that this is where the grapes come from. the best example of this is not a winemaker, but a Haitian who works for Neal Rosenthal, the importer of wine. The area in which the grapes are grown is the terroir, which matters that the leading hand that knows this makes real wine important.
