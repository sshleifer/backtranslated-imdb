Plunkett and MacLaine are a remarkable renewal of the fraud tradition that preceded Johnny Depp and his pirated friends. The tone is light, with light social commentary, but not too heavy. It was almost possible to see Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone. <br /> <br /> It all starts with the appearance of characters and the creation of themes of social inequality and rebellion; but he starts to gain momentum when the boys get on the highway. Robberies grand and stylish, with romantic touches that are bread and butter scam. The actors attract and help to lift the material a bit, which is rather empty. The figures do not have much depth, but they are played with such charm and skill that it does not matter. <br /> <br /> Much has been said about modern music. Period music tended to be more serene, which seemed out of place. A classical score with Celtic rhythms for the militants might work, but more modern, rebellious rock and techno music seemed to add to the urgency of the action. Since characters are more legend than reality, accuracy in music seems meaningless. The pieces tend to match the mood of the scenes transmitted, so it basically works well. I'm just wondering how they missed "Adam Ant" "Stop and deliver." Make no mistake, this is not a serious movie. This is a clean escape and a wonderful lark. Tony Scott demonstrates his father’s visual style, but I don’t think we’ll see a lot of Oscar nods in his career. It seems he understands the material here and makes a beautiful film. Over time, it may turn out to be a name to be reckoned with. It took his father time to grow up to visual styling and become a more rounded director. This is definitely one to watch an entertaining evening or a tangled film festival.
