Filmed in 1794, the second year of the French Republic, formed after the execution of Louis XVI, this film tells about the struggle for power between the revolutionary leaders Danton (Gerard Depardieu, at his best) and Robespierre (team play of the Polish actor Wojciech). Pszoniak). A moderate revolutionary, Danton returned to Paris from his country seat, where he was overthrown by Robespierre as leader of the Public Security Committee last year. He opposes the "Kingdom of Terror", which resulted in the execution of thousands of citizens, mostly with guillotines, who are believed to oppose the revolution. Danton is confident in the support of ordinary people and trying to convince Robespierre to curb the bloodshed. But Robespierre and the Committee are afraid that the popularity of Danton will lead to their overthrow, and will appear before Danton and his supporters for treason. It was the first French film filmed by Andrzej Wajda after he came to France from Poland. His Polish film company was closed by the government because of its support for the Solidarity trade union, which opposed the Polish government in the late seventies and early eighties. His previous film Iron Man (1981) dealt with the Solidarity trade union and its leader Lech Wales, and it is easy to make a comparison between the relations of Walesa and the Polish leader General Jaruselsky, as well as between Danton and Robespierre. Danton / Walesa is the voice of reason, opposed to Robespierre / Harouselski, who continue dictatorial rule, despite the fact that they have lost the support of the people they claim to represent. The film is based on the Polish play “The Case of Danton”, written by Stanislaw Przybyszewska in the 1930s, and after its release, some have criticized them for being static and theatrical. But what the film does is focus on the backstage meetings of the committees and the scenes in the National Assembly and the courtroom, and not on the events on the streets of Paris.
