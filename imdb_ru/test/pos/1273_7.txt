If Christopher Nolan had done Memento before Follow, then all the flaws in Follow would have been corrected. In "Memory" Nolan designed the switches on time. We were able to say when it was in the past, when it is current, and so on. However, Nolan experimented a bit with him, and he just does not work. Although he had a small budget and could not use color (this is one of the ways Memento works), it was too difficult to tell the time. The DVD has a feature that allows you to play scenes in chronological order. I was going to write my review after watching, so hopefully it would make more sense, but of course it did not work. <br /> <br /> Nolan cannot be blamed for the fact that he did not put forward original ideas. The young man, Bill (Jeremy Theobald), is bored, so he decides to follow random people on the street. He finds Cobb (Alex Howe), who is especially interested in him. Soon, Bill became friends with Cobb and went with him when he broke into houses and robbed them. Then a saucy young blond (Lucy Russell) enters, and from there the film becomes even stranger. <br /> <br /> The “Following” ending is one of the most shocking endings I've ever seen. Of course, Fight Club had a terrific finale, but the way the “Followers” ​​final ended was awesome. I felt that someone hit me on the head and gave me a concussion. Nolan can make good endings (well, maybe not, I can guess that Insomnia is a mile away), and he can really create a great story. Following may not be the easiest to follow or watch, but it’s so carefully thought out, an original story with a shocking ending that you probably want to see all 70 minutes again. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> R grade for language and some violence.
