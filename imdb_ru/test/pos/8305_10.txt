My father took me to see this film when it was released in 1976. I was just a kid, and it scared the hell out of me. So much so that I had to leave the theater during a particularly claustrophobic tunnel scene, since it was too intense for me !!! I went home in the safety of my family. I saw the movie completely when I got older and thoroughly enjoyed it. Shame on people in monster costumes. If you forget about low cost production and go deep, you will find excellent results from Cushing, a terrific introductory assessment, an excellent photo and reliable Mr. Douglas McClure, my childhood hero! British police guarding the White House to the end! Tits bang, bang, cave woman! Monsters with beaks! The actors in the monster costumes slide along the wires! It's all! Superb.
