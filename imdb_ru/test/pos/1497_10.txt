RATING STARS: ***** Saturday evening **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is in this world, but not this one world. It seems that his mind simply does not understand things as an ordinary person would have done, and his life is one long misfortune because of this, as a result of which he falls into constant failures and distant, insane situations that he is left to decide for himself . it seems that he does not communicate with anyone and rarely speaks. But he never gives up and, despite the fact that the simplest of tasks is a constant struggle for him, the use of his own methods of solving problems always pays off for him. <br /> <br /> Looking for regret The state of modern British humor, with all its focus on sex and general vulgarity, would you forgive you for forgetting what a show like Mr. Bean was done at one time . There is nothing inappropriate here, just good, clean U-humor like Tommy Cooper and the like, made in the 50s. And I find it the same loud laugh now, when I was 20 and over, like I did when I was a little boy in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> Although now I can look at it a little deeper and see there should be more for this character than it seems at first glance. There must be a reason why he does things the way he does, and it seems that things are going badly for him. As others have noted, it looks like he may have a type of autism. In fact, I am so convinced of this that, in my opinion, I was a professional psychologist to analyze it, I think that Mr. Bean may become the first known fictional character to be diagnosed with something like Asperger's syndrome. <br /> <br /> If you want to see truly funny British humor at its best, before it all becomes obsessed with sex and vulgarity, then it is highly recommended. The show, like “Little Britain”, works because it is well implemented, but in fact it’s just as good as everything else. Shows like this show, once we were more restrained and civilized, and hopefully we can start releasing this type of humor again soon. *****
