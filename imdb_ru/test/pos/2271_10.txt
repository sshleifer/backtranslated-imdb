If someone has doubts about the talent of Lie Shrieber, just take a look at his new film “Everything Is Illuminated,” which clearly shows a man who is not only one of the best American actors, but also a new director, whose first efforts are really inspiration. and a forerunner of what should follow. Mr. Schreiber adapted Jonathan Safran Foer's novel into a film that will live forever due to the way the director adapted the material. The film clearly exceeded our expectations, because we did not have preconceived ideas. <br /> <br /> For those who have not watched the movie, perhaps you should stop reading here. <br /> <br /> Jonathan is a collector, His love for grandparents is limitless. He watches his grandfather die and his grandmother lie on what seems to be her death bed. At a clear moment, this dying woman gives Jonathan a picture and an amber decoration for her collection. Looking at a photo taken a long time ago, a young couple is seen together. Observation makes Jonathan think that it depicts a grandfather and his girlfriend taken in happier times. Viewing this image seems to have prompted this intense young man to look for the past of his ancestors in Ukraine. <br /> <br /> Jonathan agreed with the Heritage Tours travel agency from Odessa about his trip. to Trohenbrod, the mythical place where his grandfather came from. The agency is run by an elderly man who claims to be blind, and his grandson Alex, a man who loves pop American culture, which captured his imagination, as well as his contemporaries in the country. Alex speaks some English, nobody speaks, and his conversations and translations, for the benefit of Jonathan, are very interesting for us because of the use of sometimes unheard of English terms. The old man insists on picking up his dog Sammy Davis Jr. against the wishes of Jonathan, who does not want to sit next to a growling and barking animal during the trip. <br /> <br /> When they enter the Trochenbrod Quest, it is clear that his comrades, especially the old man, have no idea where he is going. At this point, the film becomes a road film, as the three characters traveling along the country’s country roads become more familiar with each other. When the trio reaches the sunflower field with the house at the end, it indicates that they have indeed come to the right place. Some places are a clear reminder of past conflicts. <br /> <br /> An elderly woman who lives in an isolated place is the missing link in the story. She is able to put things in the right perspective. But here the story changes the focus from Jonathan, who clearly came to the land of his ancestors, to the old man. We observe how this elderly person begins to remember himself. This, in turn, changes the dynamics of the film when we discover how Jonathan and his guides were connected all the time. <br /> <br /> Some critics on these pages expressed an opinion about the accuracy of the story, which In the end, this work of fiction and freedom was taken. It would be impossible to make another film, including as much as is contained in the book. A great way to divide the film into several chapters is a smart way to let the viewer know that they will see it. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood, a great actor, does an excellent job with the role of Jonathan. Mr. Wood makes one of his best performances in any film with his interpretation of the main character. It seems that the successful casting of Eugene Hutz in the role of Alex, a Ukrainian assistant and translator, is an idea created in heaven. Mr. Hatz about the best thing in the film. His secret use of English gives the film an amusing angle that delights the viewer. Boris Leskin as Alex's grandfather and tourist car driver makes a valuable contribution to the film, as well as Larisa Loret, who can be seen in the last part of the film. <br /> <br /> Excellent cinematography Matthew Libatika brings the splendor of the countryside of the Czech Republic in all its glory. Paul Cantelon’s musical background sounds in the background, embellishing the film in such a way that it adds richness to the film. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a triumph for Liev Schreiber, the first director who will certainly go far in everything he decides to do next.
