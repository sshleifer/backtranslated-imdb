I have always liked Barbara Stanwick, who was perhaps the most hardworking lead actress of the 30s and 40s, although few of her movie roles are remembered. Today, she is best remembered on the Big Valley television show. Stanvik worked so hard because she was solid; it seems that she would take on almost any role and make the most of it for the success of the film, and therefore the directors loved her, and many of the usual paintings won the trust due to her presence. <br /> <br /> And so it was for “Christmas in Connecticut” - a very ordinary effort, the plot of which generates credulity and does not even concern Christmas. He, however, has Stanwick and Dennis Morgan, as well as some top actors, including Sydney Greenstreet and S.K. Sakall, so there are plot twists and funny moments that surely seemed more real in 1945 than today. To begin with, the story concerns a journalist (Stanwyck), who, according to the readers of the magazine, is a domestic goddess, married to a child and lives on a farm in Connecticut, but is not really married, lives in New York and knows nothing about cooking or home economics. . Can anyone avoid such fraud even then? Obviously, even the owner of the magazine (Greenstreet) was deceived, although one would think that he would have seen deception a long time ago, but the story continues, and Stanvik, Greenstreet, a sailor, recently survived from his wreck ship (Morgan) and the restaurateur Friend Stannick SZSakall) holds Christmas in Connecticut on a farm owned by boorish boy Stanvik (Reginald Gardiner). You can imagine all the possibilities for this, as the fraud unwinds, as it should be. Gardiner wants Stanwick to marry him to perpetuate the awakening, but everyone wonders how she can stand it at all. Morgan and Stanwick fall in love with each other, but he must be engaged and she must be married. Regardless, they start what seems to be a mock thing, they dance side by side and sneak in a sleigh pulled by horses. Meanwhile, the incredibly naive character Greenstreet, who saw Stanwick and Morgan leave together, but still doesn’t understand, sees one of the neighbors pick up a child who was borrowed during the fraud, and call the police to report the abduction. Stanwick and Morgan are arrested for stealing a sleigh, and the hoax begins to unfold. <br /> <br /> At this point, the movie is funny, funny or absurd, not funny, haha, and usually it ends up like worm comedies. made. A good guy gets a girl, and, apparently, they live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> I watch this film every year at Christmas to fully enjoy these characters in the story, reflecting how it was in 1945, and because of the long-time enthusiasm for Barbara Stanwick. Thank God, it was at Christmas or, like 95% of Stanvik's films, they had long forgotten about him, and we will not see him again every year.
