The Chris Morris TV series Brass Eye has always caused a large number of complaints from both viewers and people taking part. But nothing he did caused more controversy than that. Special offer "Brass eye" 2001. Before the highly overvalued Jerry Springer Opera arrived, the Brass Eye Special Edition kept the record for most complaints about any television program that has ever been on the air. <br /> <br /> Large volume of complaints filed by the general public on the Brass Eye. The special offer was incredible! Many complaints were voiced by people who did not even watch the program! The topic that the program was engaged in turned the head, but the message was misinterpreted. The message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program. It was not a show that mocked the topic of pedophilia. The show was devoted exclusively to the media and the presentation of the topic. Morris is and will always be a media satirist. The notion that the program “makes fun” of pedophiles and abused children is completely ridiculous! Morris never tries to do something like that. He simply draws our attention to the stunning and very often silly stir in the media around the subject. <br /> <br /> Using many of his famous characters of the Copper Eye, such as Ted Mol and others, Morris shows how the Mass Media deprives any information about the object that they themselves created and created, and the result is funny, if not funny, than everything Morris did before. Using his proven formula, Morris manages to fool several unsuspecting celebrities, forcing them to believe that they are working on a serious documentary. In fact, they are made to look exactly as they are. Retards. <br /> <br /> In general, you need to realize the feature of the wind eye. And with one introductory line, Morris manages to sum up the entire media situation as it was in 2001: “Welcome to Pedo-Gedden!”
