I am 58 years old. On a rainy day, my wife advised us to go see "Women." After reading the reviews, I thought that this could lead to daytime sleep. Wrong - this film interested me from beginning to end. It was great to finally see how Meg Ryan looks great again. Let's face it, Meg looks much better with long hair. Annette Benning looked different to me in every scene she was in. Candice Bergen shows his age, as does Carrie Fisher. The daughter, Molly, played solely because of young India. I managed to understand the dialogue, difficult in many modern films because of the quick speech. Cloris Lichman and a woman from Finland were awesome as housemaids who extend their normal duties. The scenes in New York were good to see. Oh, and Bette Midler played a short role, but, as usual, was awesome. So, I gave this girl 9 points. Guys, look at this even for eye candy, like Eva Mendes. It will not disappoint.
