Having seen this film many years ago, he never disappeared from my memory. I always thought it was the best Michelle Pfeiffer performance I have ever seen. But I am amazed at the number of negative reviews this film received. Seeing this again today, I still think that he is powerful, touching, and he doesn't care if he is “weakly based on King Lear.” <br /> <br /> Now I understand that this is the best Jessica Lange work I have ever seen - and she received praise for much smaller efforts. <br /> <br /> A thousand acres is a complex, lively, lively and extremely touching, but certainly not representing any of the mainstream woman leads with any touch of glamor or "sexuality." I do not think this is well perceived in our time. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the reasons for the unsatisfactory response of this film is that the writer (Jane Smiley (script (Laura Jones)) and director (Jocelyn Moorhouse) are all women. I know that in my youth I I wouldn’t read a book written by a woman. I didn’t focus on this fact until a few years later. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen this film or didn’t give it a chance in the past, try to watch it again. Perhaps you are ready to that.
