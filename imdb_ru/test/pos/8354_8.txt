Another good animation from Disney. Sequels are not always so good and tend to follow the same plot as the original. However, Trump's son is trying to enjoy the world outside the home and the family he knows, and find out where he actually belongs. The dog at the dump is not for everyone, but the dog, but Scamp overcomes the difficulties. The voices of the different characters were great and were provided by several well-known actors such as Scott Wolf, Alyssa Milano and Mickey Rooney. An entertaining and well-made family movie.
