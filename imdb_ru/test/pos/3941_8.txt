are you crazy or what? This film has a talent, who are you to criticize the film, shot by famous directors and producers? I mean, you must be watching some kind of crappy version, because if you had the right version, you would not think that this is a low-resolution game graphics. <br /> <br /> This film is for people who love movies in Hong Kong on the other hand that Asian people love to watch .. you are such a sale .. the Hong Kong cinema is completely different from Hollywood, hk cinema is in its class ... < br /> <br /> so if you don’t, enjoy watching movies from Hong Kong producers, don’t think about how to look at it is a waste of time ... just let other people enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> and I personally saw this film I love its history and how it was made ..
