I watched Asterix and Obelix in Cleopatra, which was my first demonstration of the classic live comic book version. As in the comic, the entire film is full of jokes based on puns, anachronistic jokes and gags, which are rarely unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> Asterix and Obelix are Gauls who use a potion of power to fight the Roman legions in their hometown. Gaul. Here they find themselves in Egypt, helping a friend build the Cesarian Palace (yes, it is tiny) in three months to prove that the Egyptians are as good as the Romans. <br /> <br /> The reason I picked it up was because Monica Belluci Cleopatra She is good, but the role is a little more than a cameo. However, although she is rarely in the film, I didnâ€™t care, because she is so smart, and the jokes are so funny that I fell into a tantrum. I like it. I liked it so much that I can't understand why films were never released in the United States. <br /> <br /> There is an English-language film on the import DVD, which is very good, especially considering that when you watch it in the longer French version, puns (and therefore jokes) are not always obvious, they sound aurally, so if you read the names incorrectly, the jokes will be lost. Most of the jokes between the full French version and the shorter English dub seem to be exactly the same, although some have changed for the better and sometimes for the worse. Personally, I will stick with the dub when I look at it again, as it is easier to pick jokes and enjoy the humor. <br /> <br /> You really want to see it if you like puns and low eyebrows, but clever humor is a great comedy.
