In this film, I was stuck in this endless cycle of thinking about it for a few days after that ... if I weren't a snob in the movie, as some people here seem, but I thought it was surprisingly good, and a powerful creature, if not enough subtlety in performance. I happen to admire films that can effectively recreate the feeling of watching a stage performance, it creates an inharmonious eerie atmosphere that works well with this film. I'm also a big fan of Alan Rickman, so this may be my prejudice. I personally found the lack of spatial landmarks a good thing - it could actually be anywhere, and probably is. I say that you can be calm with what has been a powerful experience for me, and probably for anyone involved in any political activity.
