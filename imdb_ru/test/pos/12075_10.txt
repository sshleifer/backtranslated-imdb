This film is based on the true story of a housewife from Iowa, Lucille Frey, who had breast cancer after the birth of her 10th child. Realizing that the state would take the children from her ineffective alcoholic husband, she spent the last year of her life traveling around the state to find new homes for each of the children. A terrific scenario - which still holds 20 years after it was first done. Adult children, many of whom have not seen each other since their mother died in the late 50s, were reunited with “It's Incredible” before the film was shown in 1983. Barbara Stanwick received an Emmy for Best Actress in a television movie or mini-series, but during her opening speech she tried her best to single Ann-Margret for her moving performance.
