I waited 30 years to watch this movie. I played a soundtrack album in my teens and after 20 years. I recently found a DVD player at a reasonable price and watched it this morning. It was in widescreen, probably even on a 70 mm print, stereo, the colors were pretty good, very faded, of course, not remastered, but I am very pleased with this clean copy. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie, This is very good. I would not say that it is great, although there are great scenes in it. Perhaps Premminger may not have been the right director for this, but I will say this. For me, the central part of the film was the scene of a hurricane. Amazingly staged Premminger. One of the great weather scenes of all time. <br /> <br /> In fact, I would even say that the acting scenes are better than the musical ones, and the musical sequences are bad. It's my pleasure. They really lacked ... something though. Perhaps the fact is that there are no close-ups and very few medium shots. It was almost like shooting a stage play. Perhaps it was the feeling that Premminger was pursuing. In the end, it was not the right choice, but it is. This is not a ruined movie. <br /> <br /> Having said that, not everyone loves singers on the soundtrack. I always have. They are perfect for this movie. I love singing voices. The actors drown perfectly for the most part. I just want the songs to be more creative. Two Sportin 'Life numbers are good, but intimate numbers don't even seem intimate. They just feel ... far away. Despite this, you cannot deny the power of music. And in the end, this is what sounds loud and clear. Once again, it is possible that Premminger tried to do so to stay away from the incredible music with which he worked. I believe he had the right idea, but maybe he went too far in that direction. <br /> <br /> The game is amazing. The highest mark belongs to the great Brock Peters, who sings and sings the part of the Crown. He is the final nervous. We just want him to leave poor Bess alone, but he is not. No matter how proud, arrogant and disgusting he is, Sammy Davis Jr.'s classic performance of the Sportin 'Life is a clever devil himself, and very charismatic. Perhaps the best cast of Davis. Poor Bess just can't cope with two bad people. I'm glad that Shepherd Hermes gave Davis a tap dance number. <br /> <br /> Dandridge and Poitiers are reportedly not impressed by the fact that they are in the film, in fact they are very sweet together. I don't know about chemistry ... there was more chemistry between Dandridge and Peters than between Dandridge and Poitiers. However, Dorothy and Sydney did it all. <br /> <br /> Despite this, I think they both should be proud of the work they have done on this film. They both managed to put more than one tear on my eye. Their characteristics where very 3D and believable. Porgy Sydney Poitier, however, seems almost out of place among the catfish. I could not help but think that he was Mr. Braithwaite in the film “Siru with Love”, very educated, well-bred and well-spoken, who lived through difficult times. He probably wouldn't have been my first choice for the role of Porgy, but hey, he was a huge star at the time, so why not? Bess Dorothy was as perfect as her Carmen Jones, in fact, even more vulnerable this time. Carmen was probably the brightest part for her. <br /> <br /> A really very good film, it is two parts smaller than I would call a classic. It simply does not make the final classic assessment. Nevertheless, on earth there is no reason why the Gershwin manor decided to keep this beautiful film, even with all its flaws, hidden from the public, like them. Premminger may have made some strange decisions as a director, but the film should not be ashamed and embarrassed by anyone associated with it. This is what is, and there are much worse films than this, which are confusing on DVDs and in movie theaters today. Porgy and Bess is not one of them.
