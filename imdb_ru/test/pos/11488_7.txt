“Devotee” is all about Graham as an irrepressible optimist who goes in search of his estranged husband, who went in search of himself, which leads to some strange, upbeat comedic odyssey that includes a bunch of side characters and problems. A fresh, cheerful and unpredictable little click, which the “Devotee” lacks in history, which he compensates for with good nature, subtle morals and principles. If you like this little tiptoe movie that has received slightly above average reviews from critics and the public, you might want to watch Lisa Krueger’s hit "Indie" Manny & Lo "(1996). (AT)
