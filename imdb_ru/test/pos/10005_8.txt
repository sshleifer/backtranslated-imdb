Maybe I read it too much, but I wonder how much Hongshen had a hand in developing the film. I mean, when they tell a story in which the main character plays himself, I think that he will be a heavy hand in writing, documenting, etc. And this will make him a bit biased. <br /> <br /> but ... his family and friends also may have had a hand in obtaining factual details about the life of Hongsheng. I think the best look would be considered from the point of view of Hongshen's family and friends. They saw how it transformed, and they were not so confused with drugs that everyone remembers. <br /> <br /> As for Hongshen, who was full of himself, because of the consistency of the pose of Jesus Christ, he seemed to be a martyr who sacrificed his life (metaphorically, of course, he was obviously still alive as he was on yourself) for the happiness of your family. BUT? <br /> <br /> The viewer sees him at the lowest points, while maintaining a complex of excellence. He lies on the grass, going down (during?) From himself and with his father, he examines life and sees dragons at his window, he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle all the time, stretching his arms, bowing his head to the side. <br /> <br /> It is incredible that he is not using drugs now, but he is not a hero. He rose from the top of his career in action to the most vulnerable position when taking drugs to return somewhere in the middle. <br /> <br /> This is the same device used in The Beat by Ted Demme, where viewers sympathize with the main character, who is shown as a flawed hero. <br /> <br /> However, “Exit” (“Zuotian”) is a film that is recommended mainly because of its haunting soundtrack, great game and landscapes. But the best part is the feeling that arises when what we call the house of Jia Hongsheng is actually a stage for the play. This makes the viewer feel as if Hongshen's life was just a game, told in many difficult parts.
