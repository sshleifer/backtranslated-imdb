This is a film that deserves another look - if you have not seen it for a long time, or at first glance - if you were too young when it came out (1983). Based on the play of the same name, this is a story about a senior actor who heads the touring Shakespearean repertoire in England during World War II. This is due to his stress from trying to perform Shakespeare every night, faced with such problems as the bombing of theaters and the company, consisting of older actors or people with disabilities - young, able-bodied. This also applies to his relations with various members of his company, especially with his dresser. So far this all sounds pretty boring, but nothing could be further from the truth. Despite the tragedy of the story, the story is told with a lot of humor and emotion. Two main characters received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and deservedly. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves drama, theater, especially Shakespeare, or has ever worked behind the scenes in any capacity. Behind the scenes is another aspect of the film, which will be exciting for most viewers.
