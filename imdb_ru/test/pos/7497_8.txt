As I said earlier this year, in my review of “Swordfish” (which was written by the writer / director / producer of the film Skip Woods), this is a good film. He ranks very high on my list of criminal scams among Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, Pulp Fiction and Snatch. In fact, I think that this film for me is what Reservoir Dogs was for many people - a cult classic - although I prefer to compare it with “Pulp Fiction.” I mean, I never liked Tarantino’s first attempts, but I’m sure that I liked the movie as much as Pulp Fiction, because it just has everything the classic needs. Great story and good actors. Well, the budget may not be as big as, for example, in Godzilla, Avengers of Mission to Mars, but it certainly surpasses the live shit from these films (and many others). <br /> <br /> History This film is about a man named Casey (Thomas Jane), who settled with his wife in Houston. Suddenly, his old friend ruins his life, reveals his secrets and makes his day a real hell (and bloody too). <br /> <br /> The film is very original and rather bloody / sexually colored, so based on this first and last quality, I can assure you that if you liked this movie, you will also like the swordfish, which, Of course, a much larger budget and more famous faces than this, but as good (though not very) as bloody and not quite so sexually tinted). I saw this film the second time last night, and I really liked it (again). I mean that all the characters and actors are good, although I have to give credit to Thomas Jane and Polina Porizkova, who were the best actors (and had the best characters) in the film. I would also have to thank Skip Woods for being so original and original. Cruel, sexy, insulting ??? Maybe, but, of course, damn pleasant and exciting tour to the end. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
