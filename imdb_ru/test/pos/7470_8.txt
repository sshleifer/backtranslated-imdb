Yesterday I watched a movie, and for me it was a terrific combination of films such as Pulp Fiction and Mad Dogs. The best of the best. It was never boring and always moving, every hour another character appears trying to (trying to kill) him. You never know what will happen next. In a word TERRIFIC !!!
