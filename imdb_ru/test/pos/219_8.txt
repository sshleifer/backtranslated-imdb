The creative team of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker was founded in the improvisational theater in Madison, Wisconsin, I think so. They had a band called "Kentucky Fried Theater" (or something like that). They put a whole series of their compositions on celluloid called “KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE” (1977), which was long, disrespectful, sophomore and really funny. <Br /> <br /> They developed a very popular aircraft! (1980), which really put them on the map. In it, they took some fairly well-known veteran actors in the film "Robert Stack" and (especially) Leslie Nielsen, and putting them into prominent roles, began parodying every cliche of every aviation film from the time of the production of John Wayne (Batjack) THE HIGH. AND MIGHTY (1954). * Pockets full of cash, and now that they were noticed, the trio made a deal with Pramount Television and the American Television and Radio Company to make a half-hour comedy film about the almost countless police drama of the crime drama that came and went on our television screens for many years . Recalling the excellent work that Mr. Leslie Nielsen passed on AIRPLANE !, he was in the lead role. <br /> <br /> As a sergeant / lieutenant / captain Frank Drebbin (the title switch was one of their comic books) bits, he led a large series of consecutive puns, sights, non-squitters, and bloated police / crime stamps. All this is connected with some seemingly standard scenarios. Added to this is too dramatic introductory narration, voiced because of information that is contrary to the visual printed information. They always used this to give the title titles of episodes where voices and typed headlines never matched. <br /> <br /> They had an excellent musical score, which, even being somewhat exaggerated, would have passed as a theme and an accident. music in direct drama. The musical score, introductory titles and format of the division of episodes into Act I, Act II, Epilogue, etc., were part of the obvious, but affectionate deception of QM. (Quinn Martin) Production. (They even had the same announcer as the real Q.M.). <br /> <br /> The only thing that was not in this series is the technically extended audience laughter. And, man, they definitely didn't need a fake path. The nature of the fake was such that it demanded close, almost undivided attention of the viewer, and this turned out to be the main reason for the fall of the POLICEMAN GROUP. <br /> <br /> Regarding the cancellation of the series, the ABC director explained that the episodes "... caused too much attention from the viewer." So, isn't that what you need? <br /> <br /> So, after only 6 wonderful and funny episodes, the POLICEMAN DEPARTMENT left the afterlife canceling the series! only to be reborn in THE NAKED GUN Trilogy made for the big screen in movie theaters. Once again, they did quite well at the box office. Well, the loss of TV is the prize of the Cinema, thanks to you, Mr. Idiot, the television director! <br /> <br /> * THE HIGH AND MIGHTY were created by their own dukes Batjac Productions and released by Warner Brothers. This was unavailable for a number of years, and finally, Mr. Wayne's family agreed to release it on television and on video.
