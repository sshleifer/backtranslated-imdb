This is a surprisingly excellent low-budget horror / comedy, it's funny and pretty well done, with good performances and a really cool ending! All the characters are pretty cool, and the story while the unoriginal is very good, plus Eric Yungman (Adam) and Justin Urich (Harley) had fantastic chemistry together. One of the funniest moments in the film for me is when Adam was trapped in the bathroom, and Harley wakes up to find that monstrous truck that sits there and decides to get on the truck, and Aimee Brooks is just sexy! In addition, it is one of the best low-cost horror films that I have seen in a long time. It's very creepy, but in the comic sense, and I thought it was also very well written, plus Michael Bailey Smith is fantastic, like the Monster Man, and he had some kind of evil makeup! It is similar to films such as Joy Ride, Duel, Jeepers Creepers, etc., etc., and so on. And there are moments of alarm, plus, for the most part, the effects of blood are really well done. This is an amazingly great low-budget horror / comedy movie, it's funny and pretty well done, with good performances and a really cool finale, I highly recommend this one! The direction is very good! Michael Davis is doing very well! work here, with excellent camera work, good viewing angles, good use of colors and great settings, plus it kept the movie funny and at a very fast pace. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of blood! , We have extremely bloody nasal bleeding, bloody pricks, bloody stab wounds, the guy cuts the truck with the monster in half, the person stays in the prepared stew, the guts are everywhere, the guts fall out, the pencil in the eyes, the bloody slit in the throat, a group of people walking without limbs , bloody dead squirrel, crushed heads, severed limbs, bloody and mutilated corpses, a decent amount of bloodshed, one very bloody scene at the very end, and much more !. <br /> <br /> The acting game is very good for a low-budget movie. Eric Jungmann is fantastic here, like Adam, he was a nerd, but very cute, he had fantastic chemistry with Justin Urich, he had great features, and I just loved his character, he also seemed to enjoy, and he was especially good in the end! Justin Urich is superb as the best friend's ass, however I just could not help loving him because he was very funny and often stole a lot of scenes, I really dug him out! Amy Brooks is great and did an excellent job with what she had to do, she had good chemistry with Jungman, and, like Jungmann, she was especially good at the end, since I loved her mysterious character. Michael Bailey Smith is great in the role of the Monster Man, he looked very creepy, had amazing makeup and is now one of my favorite slashers! With the rest of the actors everything is in order. <br /> <br /> In general, I highly recommend this one! *** 1/2 of 5
