The late transition was an interesting HBO film, which described in detail the power struggle between David Letterman and Jay Leno when Johnny Carson announced his retirement, and both wanted to replace him. This fight is now part of Hollywood folklore, but for those who don't know the story and know where Letterman is now, it would be interesting to know that David Letterman wanted to replace Johnny Carson as the lead TONIGHT SHOW more than anything in the world. but Letterman discovered that his dreams had collapsed, since Leno’s frequent guest had one of the most influential Hollywood agents, Helen Kushnik, in his corner, and he worked tirelessly to get his client’s work. We don’t often see behind the scenes Hollywood machinations recreated for entertainment value, but for fans of these two late-night superstars, this film provided a breathtaking view of a very turbulent period in late-night television. According to this film, Carson himself was actually promised a job to Letterman, while NBC promised Leno a job, and it was there that Helen Kushnik entered. The film presents Leno as a kind of cake that allowed Kushnik to manipulate his career and pretend to be fake. Helen’s ignorance of some strong-willed manipulations with some of NBC’s most influential players, and he presents Letterman as this intelligent and experienced businessman who, despite Carson’s support, was directed by NBC and Kushnik. John Michael Higgins and Daniel Robak reliably recreate Letterman and Leno, respectively, but it’s the sharp performance of Oscar-winning Katie Bates as Helen Kushnik that makes this movie boil. Bates manages the screen in one of his best, if not so well-known performances, like a poisonous Hollywood agent who eats television studio executives for breakfast. The impressionist Rich Little, like Johnny Carson, has a remarkable twist, but first and foremost is the exciting story and powerful work of Bates, which make this film worth seeing.
