Mark Blankfield (from the old Friday night television show) plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a soft-manded surgeon who invents powder that turns him into an insane party goer. This was not, of course, his intention, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. It's actually a pretty stupid movie, but it's also quite fun. Of course, as soon as a good doctor realizes what he did, he is ashamed, but he also does not mind doing it all again and running around Hollywood like a crazy sex machine with curled hair and golden chains. There are several scenes, such as the bride of Jekyll, who is the daughter of the main doctor of Our Lady of suffering and pain, the employer of Jekyll. And there is Tim Thomerson, as a plastic surgeon who has seemingly little “real” parts and a passion for men, and a rich old man whose parody of Howard Hughes, and who is going to make several people rich with including testes. Yes, humor is harsh and stupid, and on the whole it’s all pretty tasteless, but if you’re no better than a quick dip in a ditch, you’ll probably like it just fine. Now available on DVD for the first time! Woohoo! 7 out of 10.
