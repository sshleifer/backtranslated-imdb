Like most sports films, it is not surprising that people who know something about sports may find flaws in it. As a football referee, I have not yet seen a movie or TV show to get it right when depicting a match. Forever has good actors, but I found that Sean Astin is a little young to be an administrator in a juvenile prison. I was very grateful that the plot did not involve the protagonist turning his fellow prisoners into rugby players and taking Flagstaff as well as Highland. Which leads to gullibility: the police car just stops just at the time when Flagstaff's villains mock Rick Penning. Despite the fact that rugby is not a sanctioned sport in high school, the team is a club sport very similar to rodeo. However, I find it hard to believe that high school students would allow students to play with open wounds: on this day of AIDS and hepatitis, this is simply not done. I do not care what the tradition and the image of a macho. Despite this, it was a great movie in which teens had to behave like adults (and sometimes acted). Unfortunately, too many coaches look like flagpoles - or worse.
