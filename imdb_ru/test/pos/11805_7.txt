The story of a young boy Dexter (Joseph Mazsello) with AIDS, who befriended a rude and lethargic boy (played by Brad Renfro), his complete opposite: “The Cure” is sad if it is too soapy, pulls your emotions in the movie “message” with a heart in the right place. For this fact only, this is the recommended view. The main point may be just to observe how they find friendship and hang out with each other when nobody accepts them. <br /> <br /> However, since the real story is based on the boy’s AIDS - things take off when, once at a local supermarket, Dexter’s eye catches a tabloid magazine saying that a doctor from New Orleans discovered a medicine. Both of them, obviously, a little naive, plan to go to New Orleans in any way possible. Something like me pulled in two ways. It warms the heart of the tick, and I hate cavils, but I discovered that the plot wanders in a melodramatic, predictable sense, and in the case materials is glossy, like in movies. I could not escape the thought that I was watching a film about self-knowledge, illness and growing up. For example, I know that they are young, but I have found the real task of believing what these boys are doing. For example, boiling the leaves of trees, drinking hot tea or eating an experimental diet with chocolate bars, because they believe that this will help fight a devastating disease. Not to mention the fact that they travel over rough terrain, as they do without any legal or direct consequences. Nevertheless, leaving aside the fears, these cinematic agreements that you used to expect are a story that is worth seeing, especially with your family.
