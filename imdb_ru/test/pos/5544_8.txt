Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Modin enjoy watching this comedy with folly. Alec Baldwin, who was a rising star when the film was made, is a scream. Dean Stockwell, in John Gotti's squad, is hysterical. But Mercedes Ruehl, as paranoid and because of the horses, steals the film. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Demme, previously known for his stupid comedies like “Something Wild” and “Melvin and Howard,” proves once again that he is a genius. I was not at all surprised when he won an Oscar for staging Silence of the Lambs. The performances that he elicits from his actors in the film “Married” are inspired, and the audience is addicted to a wild and woolen ride. <br /> <br /> One of the nicest, most charming films of the 80s, he stands head and shoulders over many of the satire of his era.
