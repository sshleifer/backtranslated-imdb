When I watch this movie, I worry too when I see the bed scenes of Miss World. She has a beautiful and charming body. When a nice lady takes off her bed and shows her completely naked body ... I think it’s hard for a man to resist ... I think it’s time for pretty girls like hrishita bhatt to also do nude scenes. At least, no one wants to expose the body of ugly women, such as Sima Biswas, to the gangster queen. I agree with what mallicka.b said. The film is depicted in such a way that it looks like an insult to the original content. Emotions are not transmitted properly. I think that a few not very good speeches also contributed to his mediocrity. In my opinion, Taboo would be a much better choice for such a role than Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she looks a little lewd, which ultimately is not what the film should portray. I also noticed a bit of excessive play in some of her scenes. I am the bitter critic of Aishwarya Paradise :) There is nothing you can do; sorry for that "Cloak" was a good film Rituparno Gosh. And I saw Choker Bali, seeing the cloak; I was not impressed
