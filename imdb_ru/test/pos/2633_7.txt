For some reason, some shows just fail ... some deserved, some not ... Buddy Faro was a smart show with interesting characters and a dark sense of humor that was a pleasure to watch ... Maybe he was never going to be a big hit, but he had a “quirkiness” about it, which made him enjoyable ... despite the fact that, as they say, it seems I could have been the only one who watched ... Dennis Farina and Frank Wailey played well in their roles ... quality of production and writing it was great and Vegas was the perfect backdrop ... I hope the first and only season will be released on DVD, as I think it deserves fame ... maybe at least do it on TV Land .... cheers
