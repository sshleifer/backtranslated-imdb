I first saw this film in the late 60s and try to watch it every time it appears on TV, which, unfortunately, is not often. Now that I have TCM and FMC, I hope that this will happen at least once a year. Like Louis Gossett Jr. in the film The Officer and The Gentleman, Jack Webb demonstrates an incredibly great game as a sergeant instructor on Parris Island with a classic rookie, and the storyline in this is very good And the presence in the film of these dizzy heads definitely helped in the realism of the film. This is a great movie with first-class acting and a great story. See if you have a chance - it's worth it!
