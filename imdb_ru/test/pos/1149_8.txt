In Morocco, completely captured by Europeans and Americans, in the early twentieth century, the Moroccan leader Moulay Ahmed Mohammed el-Raisuli the Magnificent (Sean Connery) kidnaps American Eden Pedekaris (Candice Bergen), her son and her daughter. His intention is to get some money and rifles as a ransom to fight the corrupt Sultan of Morocco (Marc Zuber). During the election, US President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) agrees with this proposal. However, Raisuli is devoted, and Eden helps him out of prison with American soldiers. I do not like films about sheer colonialism and disrespect for the sovereignty of other countries, but “The Lion and the Wind” is really a great adventure. The scene is very realistic. Candace Bergen, the most beautiful American actress in the 70s, is wonderful, she plays a kidnapped woman, as in the wonderful film “Soldier Blue”. Sean Connery, as usual, is ideal as an honest and nationalistic religious leader. Brian Keith is great as an American president. I know little about the history of Morocco to analyze whether there is any truth in this story, but this film is worthwhile entertainment. In Brazil, it is available only on VHS. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): ʻO Vento e o Leão '(`The Lion and the Wind') <br /> <br />
