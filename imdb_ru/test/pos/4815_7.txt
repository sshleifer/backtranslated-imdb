*** SPOILERS *** A well-made and interesting film about the alienated youth of America back in the 1950s. In those days, many parents, accustomed to making big money and living high on a pig, forget that their children, especially teenagers, need much more than a car and huge benefits to feel part of the family. They also needed love and attention, their growing problems, that 16-year-old Hal Ditmar, James MacArthur never received from his successful producer, Mr. Tom Ditmar’s father, James Daley. <br /> <br /> Never. In fact, the relationship with his father, Hal, is becoming more and more distant from both him and his caring mother, Helen Ditmar, Kim Hunter, and also from society. After his father told Hale that he wanted to borrow his car, a luxury late-model sedan, he and his friend Jerry Jeffrey Silver go to beating Hal and in a barley lizard in the 1930s, asking the local handler to catch the last western movie. <br /> <br /> Feeling that he is hitting the world, Hal behaves like a real first-class jerk, sticking his smelly legs almost into the faces of the couple, Eddie Ryder and Jean Corbett, sitting in front of him, and Jerry trying to watch a movie. This leads Hal and his friend Jerry to the fact that he was expelled not only from the theater, but also with the way he beat the manager of the theater Mr. Grebbs, Whit Bissel. It turned out that at least Hal was ready to leave the theater, not even returning his money, but when Rowers tried to grab him, Hal turned around and fastened him straight into the kiss. <br /> <br /> Hal is now in real hot water, he is accused of attacking and attacking the battery, puts his "James Dean" act at the local police station, pretending that he is either too cool or just stupid to understand what he did; almost knocked out Mr. Grebs teeth. This is when Sergeant Shipley, James Gergori, tells Hal that his father is going to pick him up when he finally sobs up to the fact that he did. <br /> <br /> In the rest of the movie, Hal tries to straighten up, but he can't do it because his dad has a bad attitude towards him. Imploring his father to understand that he was degrading Mr. Grebbs in self-defense, Hal’s father behaves as if he were there in the theater, and saw the whole incident with his son Hal acting like a street gangster instead of a young man and pushed away without provocation. <br /> <br /> With the exception of what Hal did when putting out Mr. Grebbs, he was actually ready to admit his misbehavior, but he wanted Mr. Grabbs and his dad to at least treat him great attention; Goebbes in that he provoked Hal and Mr. Ditmas without even bothering to listen to him! Feeling like a wanted criminal without anyone, but his mom, to really turn too Hal slowly loses it only later to have both sergeants. Shipley and Mr. Grubbs agree to dismiss the charge. You might think that by now Hells had finally learned his lesson, but the real lesson, more than a cut, was that Hal so desperately needed a lesson that his father completely ignored! Being there when his son needed him the most, and in that Mr. Ditmar failed with fluttering paints. <br /> <br /> In fact, everything is clarified for everyone in the film only after Mr. Grebs gets the belt, ending with Beit Shiner, again Hal, who, returning to the Grebbs theater, tries to make him call his father and tell him that Hal defended himself only when he hit him first, and not the second time. After all, Hal learned a real lesson in how to get along with people and prevent his problems from becoming other people's problems. But most of all, Hal's father, Mr. Ditmar, learned the most valuable lesson in how to understand his upset and alienated son and behave like a father towards him, and not like a jailer and sugar dad. As the song says “All you need is love,” so that everything was on the right track, and it was love and understanding for his son Hal, that Mr. Ditmar lacked a majority until the very end of the film.
