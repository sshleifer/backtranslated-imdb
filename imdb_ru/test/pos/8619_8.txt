Another incredible film from Katherine Brailat, this time about the difficulties of shooting the sex scene in the film. Using comedy ?? A new genre for Breillat ?? we get a backstage idea of ​​filmmaking, but in documentary style. The character who plays the director in the film is based on Breilat, the sex scene in question is taken from her earlier film A Ma Soeur, as the main teen actress. But the film, like all the works of Brailat, is not only entertainment. She replete with philosophical observations about the nature of sexuality, and also demonstrates commitment ?? cleanliness ”(unlike pornography), which is the cornerstone of Breya’s work and devotion to real emotion. We see how the director makes the young lead actress and actor show them the best, hypnotize them in the role they need to play, reveal the part of themselves that the director can see in them, but they cannot see in themselves until they reach the heights of acting. the skills she demands from them. She makes meaningful films, not stunning, but shows the work that is necessary for its production, and therefore gives us an idea of ​​how (obviously French) the process of creating the film, and about the psychology of men ?? female sexuality.
