Last night we saw La Spettatrice at the Chicago International Film Festival, and we were both very touched by this. This is an obsessive story of loneliness and a missed connection, in which longing for intimacy conflicts with our fear of telling too much about ourselves. Three assignments (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Bridget Catilion as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all fine, and the dynamics between them are very surprising. <br /> <br /> After all the films that devalue older women, it is great to see Flavia (who is a law professor at the University of Rome), presented as beautiful and sensual, and also seductive and powerful. We have to believe that when a young woman enters into a “mix”, an elderly woman becomes jealous of a young woman, a man leaves an older woman for a young woman, etc. And so on. In this film, however, the emotional truth is much more complicated. Highly recommended.
