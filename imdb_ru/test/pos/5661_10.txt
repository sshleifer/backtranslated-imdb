How to summarize this movie? it's just impossible. Why should you see this? perhaps for history, very likely for actors (Giorgio, Catherine ...), primarily for the universe and poetry. This is a fairytale. Sad, sometimes dark, but a fairy tale. I love this film !!!! Just waiting for the DVD !! Thank you, Mr. Butonnat.
