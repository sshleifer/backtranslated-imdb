Seeing this routine of John Leguizamo, I finally understood why he had such a talent. I like great stage work, and this stage work is at its best. I can't call it a chore because the Leguizamo plays very intensely, playing different characters. The only time he breaks character is when he needs to fulfill his role in which he is so coolly that you can't help but appreciate his talents. I wasn't sure how I felt about him as an actor, but Frick strengthened my appreciation for him. For those who have not had the opportunity to see this show, I feel for you. Definitely check it out. This is one of the nest procedures I have ever seen. Engaged with Eddie Murphy, Bill Cosby and Chris Rock. Four stars or more.
