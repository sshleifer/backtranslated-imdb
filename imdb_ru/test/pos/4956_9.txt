Well, yes, this is bad, yes, it is full of fluff, yes, it makes Dobbin the mule look like Oscar, but look at it, as I did, I was 13 years old, the special effects were largely non-existent in 90% of the films, more in good Ole-days, when films needed a storyline ... Well, so even the storyline is a bit tricky ... but wow, I got into this film when I was a kid in the 80s. trashy rock, bad special effects, but planes are air battles, and the soundtrack had one royal vision ... look, even the worst things have a silver lining ... well, if you want a bad movie to show a 12-year-old he hates computer effects (if there is such a film) is the perfect choice
