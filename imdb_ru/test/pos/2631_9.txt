Some television programs continue to cause embarrassment (my favorite "X-Files" comes to mind). I have been a fan of Dennis Farina since “Criminal History,” another late show with complaints. "Buddy Faro" never had a chance. The show had a good premise and great actors. This is really, really a shame.
