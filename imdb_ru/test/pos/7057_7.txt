I only saw it for the first time in 10 or 15 years ... maybe about 20. In a sense, it was better than I remembered ... in others, it was MUCH worse. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is music. That's just terrible. There are only 5 songs in the film, most of which have been used more than once. The opening song is screamed in a chorus of annoying children, and the title track in the disco style is performed by Rick Dis. It doesn't get worse than that. Even the background music is terrible, much of which repeats themes of other disgusting melodies. We also have a really lame farce, mostly in the initial credits. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Bill Murray, as usual, shines flawlessly ... you should think about whether he advertised it all? or if the authors just gave him all the funny lines. Or maybe he is just great - turns a weak script into a comic genius. The best part is his surreal PA announcements. ("Lobsters ... get out of here ... you are a threat!") <br /> <br /> You also get much more character development than you would expect in such a movie. At least half the characters seem to be real people ... and mostly real people you would like to have around. Even Spaz gets more than any other Eddie Dizen character, and when he gets a girlfriend, it’s plausible. (It’s not absurd, but it doesn’t automatically connect with one of the nerds - see “Revenge of the nerds” for examples of both cinematographic phenomena.) <br /> <br /> And when the plot seems cliche ... well, you wonder Was it a cliche when they did it? Although it was not the first film about the summer camp, I must return, at least, to “Parent Trap” - this is definitely a film that made it its own genre. In fact, I was surprised by the lack of a talent show scene ... "Wet Hot American Summer" faked the summer camp genre so perfectly that I just assumed that everything in it comes directly from the meatball. (I also almost expected John Cryer to ride in a cabriolet with a chimpanzee, thanks to the epic song “Mr. Shaw,” dedicated to the Olympics in the camp “Academy of Monks”). <br /> <br /> In any case, it seems, Disappearing a bit before the comedies of the late 70s - early 80s - this is no longer the main product, and, of course, it has no cult following for Caddyshack or Animal House. I was glad to catch him today on Showtime - and in high resolution! Of course, it's pretty awful in some places, but you could have done a lot worse in the 70s / 80s teen comedy. And again, Murray is a genius.
