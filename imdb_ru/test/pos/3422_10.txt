I have not seen a movie for a long time that would have touched and embraced me; that i couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I longed for the toilet; and I didn't even want to pause, because I was sucked in. Emotional; powerful; very dramatic; terrifying and heartbreaking. It gives you an amazing insight into South Africa; their struggle and their lives. The lead was amazing and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events that unfold in this film, and how terrible the story is; I was captivated. I do not even want to try to explain the story; it's too complicated, and I wouldn't do it right. Please watch this; you will understand why when you do. Cheers, Hall
