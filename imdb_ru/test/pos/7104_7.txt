"House of Dracula" really can not offer anything new in the form of chills, thrills or new twists and turns in an already weary storyline. This film was made as a hasty continuation of the rather well-made "House of Frankenstein" a year earlier. In “House of Dracula” you can see a factory similar to the production values ​​of 1945, which bore fruit in a potentially potentially scary movie. The footage from the previous movies of the series, and then the ending of Frankenstein's Ghost, used as the ending here, simply makes for the movie El Chepo. This is the shame of the studio and the producer, who believe that they had a first-class talent and simply spent their time and energy on a quick money-back scheme. But it seems that this was a tendency in all of Hollywood at the end of World War II. This is what brought some of these mindless 1950s SciFi images with all their close-ups of harmless lizards to make them look like dinosaurs. The days of James Whale and Val Lewton, to mention two, ended up creating the true mood and atmosphere of this genre. Keep in mind also that the makeup genius, Jack Pierce, who actually did medical research to create all of our favorites, was fired right after the release of this film. A less capable make-up artist named Bad Westmore was then hired as the head of this department at Universal, which soon became Universal International. Not to downplay Mr. Westmore’s abilities, but horror movies were not his forte. OK, watch or not watch. Watch this movie, but only as part of the chronological order of the Frankenstein series, and you will see how it all ended up as a comic feed for Abbott & Costello.
