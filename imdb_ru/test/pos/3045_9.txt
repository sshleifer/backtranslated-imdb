I first saw this film when I was in 8th grade, and I remember that it had a deep influence on me. I saw about a year ago (I'm 29 years old now), and it still moved me in the same ways. This is an excellent film that personifies the struggle against the "principle against pragmism". The character Voigt is an idealistic teacher who does not succumb to any pseudo-racist beliefs of the superintendent Mr. Skeffington. This story also embodies the struggle of how older people often resist change, more precisely, cultural change. Often at the expense of children. When these battles finally boil, Pat Conroy loses, and the triumph of pragmatism triumphs. Or that? Children whom he must leave, it is better to know him, more familiar with the "real" world and classical music. Another school teacher won respect for him, and he learned a lot about himself. Great movie with a heartbreaking ending. I recommend everyone who likes the movie to read Pat Conroy's “Water is Wide”. It will stay with you!
