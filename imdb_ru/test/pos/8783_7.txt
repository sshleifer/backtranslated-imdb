Writers Peter Wietel, Joan Harrison and (of all people) Dorothy Parker give director Alfred Hitchcock an opportunity to clarify what may have been his favorite subject of the film: an innocent man who was wrongly deceived for crime takes him to flight. Hitchcock, who is credited with the story, designed a lot of the unknown in the story about the warehouse worker who is accused of the explosion that killed his best friend; He goes on a journey to find the real criminal. Great excitement on a large scale, with usually colorless actors (Priscilla Lane, Norman Lloyd, Alan Baxter) performing an amazingly good job. Even the ever-smug Robert Cummings gets into the right spirit! *** from ****
