In the Thriller In the Line of Fire Jacket Thriller, added to the old-timer Eastwood, Frank Horrigan, is concerned about the past failure at work. The chase becomes personal, as the reptile killer John Malkovich Leary scoffs at him about this neurosis - with a rather awkward exception out of love for a good woman (Lilly Raines Rousseau), nothing will calm Frank except to kill Leary personally. <Br /> <br /> Malkovich is a changeable presence - not just fuel on the screen, but often a changeable actor. This is one of his good films, focused and playing the game director Petersen. Eastwood is too old, but a) the audience doesnâ€™t care, because it is he and b) his age is recorded in the script not only in the narration, but also as a repeated joke. Almost the way you expect, but with good treatment. 7/10
