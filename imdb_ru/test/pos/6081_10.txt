Revolf Fiennes, Willem Defoe and Juliette Binoche. This is an exciting and deeply touching love story. It tells about a badly burned man (Ralph Fiennes) who was pulled out of the plane of the Second World War and tells his story to his nurse (Juliette Binoche). <br /> <br /> Shortly before the war, he fell in love with the beautiful Catherine Clifton (Kristen Scott Thomas), but she is married to Jeffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) and these two are starting a passionate and forbidden novel. <br /> <br /> A very obsessive and tragic story of love and desire on the background of absolutely magnificent places in the desert. It should be, especially if you are a fan of Anthony Minghella to work, but be prepared to shed a lot of tears, this is very touching, especially at the end.
