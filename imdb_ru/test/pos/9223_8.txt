I first saw this movie when I was very small. I was born in 1985, so it was about the age when the 80s cartoons were big. One day my mother recorded it on tape, thinking that I might like it. I never heard of the TV show Rainbow Bright before I was introduced to the film. When I saw this (on one of these old BETA tapes ...), I liked it. I became addicted to it. There are people who say that this is poorly written and all that, but this is a children's film, and such things are not important for children. I liked the story, and especially liked the songs and all the female characters. Of course, I pretended to be him, and in the scene where Rainbow first met Chris, and they were beaten off, they had to work with the opposite sex, I could fully communicate. The story was the main good against the evil that children enjoy, and there were enough happy moments to balance the scary ones. The world is a fantastic place that stimulates the imagination of any small child. I am very glad that I had the opportunity to watch this movie when I was little. This had a great impact, and viewing it now brings back happy memories of childhood. I would recommend any parent with young children to rent this movie. This will spark their imagination and provide a lot of fun. You're only a child once, so don't let them miss it!
