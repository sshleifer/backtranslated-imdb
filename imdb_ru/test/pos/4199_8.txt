After winning the championship, boxer John Garfield (like Johnny Bradfield) celebrates booze, which leads to the unintentional killing of an assertive reporter. Although his manager killed a man, Mr. Garfield is accused. When a manager dies in a car accident with a stolen Garfield watch, authorities believe the boxer is dead. A still wanted man, Garfield changes his identity to Jack Dorney and moves to a ranch in Arizona. There Garfield meets with "The Dead End Kids": Billy Helop (as Tommy), Bobby Jordan (as Angel), Leo Gorsy (as braid), Hunts Hall (as Dippy), Gabriel Dell (as TB) and Bernard Pansley (as Milt). <br /> <br /> Garfield contacts the young men from the “impasse” who were sent to live with cute “Grandma Rafferty” (Mei Robson) as an alternative to the school of reform, kindly provided by her brother, the deceased priest “Father Rafferty. Garfield falls in love with Helope's sister, the beautiful "Peggy" (Gloria Dixon), who is there to look after the children. Surely, Garfield's past is coming back to haunt him ?? <br /> <br /> “John Garfield and the Dead End Kids” compose great music (Max Steiner) thanks to effective directing and photography by Busby Berkeley and James Wong Howe. The story is predictably convenient, the Warner Brothers support team is in great shape. Garfield and kids "Dead End" - a winning combination; Although Garfield no longer starred in the East Side gang films, the studio almost immediately reorganized it with Billy Helop and Bobby Jordan into Dust Be My Destiny. <br /> <br /> Boxing scenes are well set. But the most exciting sequence - Garfield and the four New York Children (Halop, Jordan, Hall, and Punsly) climb into a gigantic water tank for swimming, which unexpectedly puts their lives at risk. Other, shorter, brighter events include the obscene Ann Sheridan (as Goldie), the drunken Barbara Pepper (as Buji) and the young Ronald Sinclair (as Douglas), the loser in strip poker. <br /> <br /> ****** ** They made me a criminal (01/21/99) Busby Berkeley ~ John Garfield, Billy Helop, Bobby Jordan
