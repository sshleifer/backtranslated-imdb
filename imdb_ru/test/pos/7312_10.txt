A rich old woman calls for a flirtatious divorce to entice Lothario from her stupid granddaughter, who will soon marry. <br /> <br /> LET'S TO BE A GUY - an interesting little home comedy with a bit of tart dialogue (provided by renowned screenwriter Francis Marion) and good performances. Although it may seem a bit odd at times, it can probably be explained by accusations of difficulties with early sound technology, which tended to limit action and movement. <br /> <br /> Norme Shearer can be credited with appearing in this short film, rather than using her undoubted influence as the spouse of Irving Talberg to insist only on A-class photos. She is particularly effective in her first few scenes, where the elegant flat makeup makes her almost unrecognizable. Her extreme transmogrification from goose to swan could only happen in Hollywood, but it is hardly profitable to spend a lot of time worrying about it. <br /> <br /> Rod Larok is not as good as Shearer's adulterous husband. Quite popular in silent days, the walkie-talkies were not particularly kind to him, and his career would suffer. Here his role is by no means sympathetic, and one has to wonder what kind of masochistic impulse makes women want it so much. <br /> <br /> Gorgeous Marie Dressler is at hand, like Long Island's eccentric widow. As the great girlfriend of Francis Marion, one can easily imagine that this role was written specifically for her. She is full of cranks and hooks, she is very funny. However, the tremendous warmth and substantial virtue, which will very soon make her the biggest Hollywood star, is mostly absent. <br /> <br /> Among the supporting actors, Hedda Hopper is considered a wicked society, as is Wilfred Noah, who plays the comic. the Butler. Filmmakers will see little Dickie Moore in the role of the little son Shearer and the elderly Mary Gordon as her housekeeper, and both are not credited.
