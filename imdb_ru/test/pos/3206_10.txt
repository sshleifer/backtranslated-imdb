Gilmore Girls is a fun show with endless sarcasm, wit and charm. At 16, Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. She left her parents' home and got a job. Now Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends. Girls have extensive knowledge of film and television shows and constantly cite them. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton (a very high rated school), so she is reluctant to contact her parents. They are happy to give them money, but Rory should come to dine with them every Friday night. I highly recommend this show. I like it!
