One Night at McCool's is one of those films that starts with a huge number of promises, but with the continuation of the movie it becomes stupid and loses its time. Liv Tyler plays a manipulative woman who is trying to get her way, exposing her body to every man she meets, and it all falls under her spell. There are a few funny moments in this, but they are becoming less and less as the film spoils the comedic farce. Michael Douglas, who plays the killer, is as good as Liv Tyler, although she looks as though she has gained weight after being armed. This is normal, but remembered only for the scene in which Liv Tyler washes his car, you will understand what I mean when you see that this guy! Shwing !!!!! 7 out of 10 (just).
