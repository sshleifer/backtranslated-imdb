Remove all parts of the film that were the "real" day, and stick to the memories. Then you would have a great story. The story of Faith and the Wolf and their relationship were the best part. Diaz and Eccleston were great. Brewster was hard to sit. Surprised to see Blythe Danner mom. She was gorgeous. Also look for Patrick Bergen as a father, always like him (Sleeping with the enemy). This is a very hippie, save the world, such a film. I don’t care, but I recommend watching it only for Diaz’s performance. It has an excellent range and should be used more. Eccleston, as always, is irresistible. He is wonderful!
