This is a very unusual film that starts with the fact that a rich dude gets a completely new sports car for the prom and decides to try it in a local city. A rich guy meets a poor girl in Mables Diner, who is a waitress, and the local guy is very upset, and the fight begins. There is a car chase, and there seem to be all sorts of problems, and a rich boy and a poor boy have to do community service on the orders of a city judge. A rich boy and a poor boy simply do not get along, and a rich boy conquers the heart and soul of a poor boyâ€™s girlfriend. There are many walks in the forest, poetry and very deep thoughts about life are cited. The poor thing says: "Some people go through life and never find Love, I can say that I have found love and hold on to it." You will need some fabrics if you are sensitive, there are a lot of romantic scenes, and I very much doubt if you guess how this picture will end. The producer and director came up with a good idea and finally put an end to the film. If you like believable stories with poetry and very sensitive topics, then this is your movie.
