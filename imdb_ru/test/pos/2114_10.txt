It was easy to get lost in the simplicity and frivolous humor of the best family film of this year ... Grand Champion. The story of a 12-year-old boy (Buddy), who with the help of his sister, mother and best friend intends to grow the helm of the Grand Champion. This is a fancy journey to great competition. After Hockey Pokey was crowned Grand Champion, he was auctioned off for $ 775,000. Pay for college kids. Buddy finds out that the next time he sees Hoki .... it will be on a bun! The children conspire to steal the prize steering wheel, and they vowed to save him from the barbecue. Here the fun begins ... Julia Roberts, Larry Mahan, George Strait, Nathalie Manes, Stephen Bland, Tommy Guy, Tuff Hedeman and many other stars create the background for all the antics. You will not believe who actually won the helm at the auction !!! (he looks good in his mustache) The soundtrack abounds with the melodies of George Strait, Natalie Manes, Willie Nelson and many others. Where else can you see movie stars, country and western and rodeo stars ... only in Texas ... only in the Grand Champion. <br /> <br /> This is a masterfully created “simple” small film that can be the best movie you see this year. The film opens in some cities on Friday, August 27th. 2004. <br /> <br /> Another great film from Rope the Moon and Michaelson Productions - In Whisper. Keep an eye on cable networks for this!
