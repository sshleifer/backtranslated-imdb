Luchino Visconti became famous all over the world after his amazing production “Leopard”. Cinema fans got acquainted with the style of the director, who introduced himself as one of the new realists after the war, an aristocrat who developed his individual free thinking and, therefore, expressed them as an artist. However, in relation to this film “The Death of Venezia” based on the novel by Thomas Mann, this is a slightly different story. <br /> <br /> The whole film, at first glance, is so unique, so psychological and so much influenced by the various thoughts of the artist (both the director and the main character Gustav von Ashenbach) that it seems “invisible” to many viewers. . Therefore, such opinions about the film grew as “too slow”, “intolerable” or “endless boredom”. What for? The reason, apparently, lies in the widespread representation that is widespread in our time: “A GOOD FILM IS PARALLELLY UNBEATABLE ACTION” Here it would be appropriate to say: “A GOOD FILM IS IN PARALLEL NO ACTION”. In fact, everyone could say one sentence about the content of the entire film, and that would be enough. Everything that we find in MORTE A VENEZIA has a sense of vague reality, filled with depth and superficiality, which seem important for every single moment. And this is so when we notice the psychedelic scenes in Venice, when we see Gustav at the train station, when we are supplied with his highly emotional memories. Understanding his decaying mind is sometimes so intense that the only way for a viewer to watch a movie is to do everything possible to feel and experience, not see and think. Everything is doomed to wither, wither like flowers in a meadow when their time comes. In other words, everyone has a sense of loss and death without many events or even dialogues. As a result, it is highly unlikely that you will get a glimpse of the film after one viewing. This should be seen more than twice with a constantly open mind. Whether you like it or not ... is another story, very personal. <br /> <br /> Artistic values ​​are a factor that is visible at first glance and remains with us throughout the entire time. Beauty as something very significant for the main character, who seems to come and go; rest, as that which he so strongly seeks, and which comes to him in unexpected ways; the feeling that he finds in a teenage boy, who appears as an example of all dreams and desires, as the forbidden fruit of homosexual lust, which disappears. Costume Designer Piero Tozi does a great job in this film. Through many wonderful wardrobes, he gives us a very realistic look at 1911, when the action takes place. Cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis provides us with a stunning visual experience that can be called a real feast for the eyes. And in the background - the music of Gustav Mahler, the composer, whose life inspired Thomas Mann to the presentation of the character. <br /> <br /> High-level performances, especially from Dirk Bogart as the main character, Gustav von Ashenbach, who wants to rest after hard art work and tries in vain to find her in crowded Venice. For most of the film, we perfectly understand his thoughts, feelings and acts of anger, exhaustion and despair. Although sometimes it is depressing, he keeps us on the right path to the end, without losing hope for a less tragic end ... Tadzio (Bjorn Andersen) portrays a model of decadent homosexual desire, but also a model of beauty and purity, which seems rather beautiful In short .. “Adieu Tadzio, it was too short,” says the main character. Mark Byrnes has done a great, albeit highly controversial work, as a kind of “super-ego” of Alfred, with whom Gustav controversies about ideals such as beauty, justice, hope, human dignity. For Alfred, beauty belongs to the senses. As a Freudian, but how dangerous this idea! Sylvanas Mangano, who has ever been present in Italian feature films of the time, is an elegant lady from Poland, Tadzio's mother. <br /> <br /> The memorable moments really make up the strengths of the film; yet not all viewers will find them unforgettable. They, like the whole strange film, require a lot of effort to get on the right path in the director's individual ego and in the four walls of his psyche. Among these scenes, I think the sequence of the beach is quite important, especially the way Gustav watches Tadzio. The physical distance accurately reflects the lack of courage to get closer ... I also appreciate the pictures when Gustav is sitting in the gondola, and the view of the city is moving in the background - how unforgettably this can cause existential thoughts about the transfer. Are we, people, not a kind of "passengers" in the world, on a journey that is life. <br /> <br /> At the end I have to tell you one important thing. I found MORTE A VENEZIA extremely strange, until I began to study more deeply what the director was trying to convey. Then each scene turned out to be meaningful in its interpretation, with which you do not have to agree (I hardly agree with what the main character does), but you should at least tolerate it as something the author really wanted to say. Listen to his voice, give him a few words on one reality page ... <br /> <br /> Thus, the understanding of the film is still far away, since not many such films were made in 1971 and are being made now. Paradoxically, it seems that we should all have the right feelings for this film in the long run, just as we all must one day experience the strange, inevitable, usually unexpected reality that death ... 7/10
