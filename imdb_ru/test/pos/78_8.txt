Robert McKimson's Acrobatty Bunny is one of the best director shorts. Although the circus setting can cause terrible memories of McCimson’s terrible Big Top Rabbit, the Acrobatic Rabbit is actually not nearly as boring as this parody. Acrobatty Bunny contrasts the Bugs Bunny to a ferocious lion, from the very beginning he is fresh and funny, not to mention that it is very pleasant to look at him. There is a classic scene in which Bugs flies out of his hole in a strangled elevator just to get right into the lion's mouth. In a brilliant Disney parody, he shouts “Pinocchio” over the lion's throat! This brilliant discovery is a sign of future events. In the beginning and around the cage with a lion there are several skillfully set antics, followed by a cheerful grotesque and annoying game “Laugh, clown, laugh,” which I, as a child, I regularly showed off as myself! All this ends with a short acrobatic sequence that gives the cartoon a name. I have never loved the circus like a cartoon scene, and I find that it usually makes a boring and predictable set of jokes, but Acrobatty Bunny breaks out of shape, and the result is an amazingly funny short film that stands among the best McKimson.
