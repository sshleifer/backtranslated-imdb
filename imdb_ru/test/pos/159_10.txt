If you love Chan-wook Park, you know what to expect. His films are brutal, poetic, tragic and artistic, with splashes of very dark humor. THIRST is obviously Park's style, and I liked every second, from cinematography (every frame is gorgeous and creative) to a story that combines Shakespeare's tragedy, deadly love, gothic horror and multi-level drama of characters. Heroes are complex, and they have a lot of moral uncertainty. Even the most sociopathic character causes sympathy. The direction is limited, and the performances are nuanced - like SYMPATHY FOR MR. Revenge, too many subtleties to deal with the first viewing. Chan-wook Park is a smart, brave, and always amazing director. This is unpredictable - the scenes are transformed from cruel and heartbreaking to funny in an instant. This is closer to LADY VENGEANCE than SYMPATHY FOR MR. Revenge, as it is excessive and ridiculous. But, like LADY VENGEANCE, it is incredibly rich, makes you think and is useful. <br /> <br /> If you like beautifully told vampire stories (LET RIGHT) or you are a fan of Chan-wook Park, you Thirst should be obvious. Easily one of the best films of 2009.
