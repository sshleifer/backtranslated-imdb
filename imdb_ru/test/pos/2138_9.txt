By the time it opened, Heaven's Gate had become, to the detriment, of a cultural phenomenon rather than a movie. At a time when concern about excessive budgets and director’s arrogance grew, this was a convenient goal, since the last author’s work was too budgetary to hit Hollywood, which had not yet established a track record that gave him the advantage of doubts among critics and industry in whole As someone pointed out at the time, no one was going to jump on the even more expensive and dark “red” Warren Beatty, because Beatty was “one of us”, while Michael Cimino did not attain that status. <br /> <But the “Heaven's Gate” was also influenced by the cultural changes that took place at that time, by the political movement to the right and in the direction of more unquestioning patriotism and consolidation of the myth about the West (and the West). A few years earlier, demitologization of the Cimino frontier might have seemed timely, fresh, and necessary correction. But by 1980, after the Reagan revolution, it was considered almost non-American. <br /> <br /> This is a shame, because the film, seen from the point of view of several decades, is an exciting and thought-provoking look at this particular time and place as a world where life was, according to Hobbes, “vile, rough and short. " Christofferson is played by James Averill, an eastern man of the upper class, who, in search of adventure, becomes a sheriff in Wyoming, where he has to resist the settlers and squatters against the attack of a hired death squad hired by wealthy landowners including Averill's best friend for life. In a more innocent time, Averill and his rag "army" of poor farmers will be triumphant; but this is nothing more than a traditional western, and when the US cavalry joins the battle here, it is not on the side of the "good guys." <br /> <br /> Very similar to the “Deer Hunter” Cimino. In the previous film, Heaven's Gate, much time was devoted to creating the details of the lives of its leaders, which gives the film a slow pace at times, which nevertheless leads to a fascinating conclusion. With an excellent acting game, excellent music and visual texture, which makes you believe that a person really sees “Old West” with new eyes, “Gate of Heaven” is a film that rewards you for re-viewing. I would just like MGM to release a new DVD with improved translations and commentary from Cimino. However, the current version is satisfactory enough to allow viewers to see that critics in 1980, perhaps blinded by the cultural overtones of the film, were able to miss ... that “Heaven's Gate” is a great movie.
