Helges is the best movie to date. Very funny, very surreal. If Bunuel had made a film starring Buster Keaton as Clown Krusty, he would have looked like this. <br /> <br /> Brilliant performances that we already know from other Schneider films, especially Helmut Korschgen as the 00Schneider assistant. (Andreas Kunze, who once again plays his wife in this, is a bit annoying). And, of course, Helge himself as Nihil Baxter is incredible. <br /> <br /> PS.: If there was a proper merchandising in this film, I would really like to buy a copy of this Holz ist picture.
