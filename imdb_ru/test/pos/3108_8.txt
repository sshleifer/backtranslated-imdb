Both Jackie and Candace are awesome in this movie. They are well suited for their roles and have several chances of success. In particular, the way Candice utters the words "Puerto Rican" is very funny, as she is as kind as she can be, but at the same time condescending. I saw the original of this film called “Old Friend” with Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins in the lead roles. They allegedly did not get along, as a film about female friendship can be a problem. Here, the actresses obviously admire and respect each other. Hart Bochner and Meg Ryan have supporting roles, and they are both excellent, in particular Bochner, who, as I understand, never received many decent movie roles. George Cukor did not make another film after that, so it was a good movie.
