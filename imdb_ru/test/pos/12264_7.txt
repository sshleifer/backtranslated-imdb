James L. Brooke is one of those directors who always seems to look at life strangely. He is not only the producer of The Simpsons, he has several classic comedies - Broadcast News is one of them. <br /> <br /> Although this is not in line with his latest efforts. No matter how good this is, Broadcast News is still a very clever, funny and witty film about a television radio station and all the problems they face. There is a wonderful comedy sequence of physical humor in which Joan Cusack runs around the building, trying to rush to the news feed a few minutes before it is broadcast live on television. <br /> <br /> This is not only very truthful in terms of how restless radio stations work, but also a skillful and honest portrayal of people. <br /> <br /> A modest, thin film with good acting (especially from Hurt, which I donâ€™t always like) and the right direction.
