At first, the film is not one of those that the leading characters like, is not easy at all, but, fortunately, the heart and soul of the film is the touching presentation of Paula Sage, which takes the film to unknown waters and goes beyond the rather awkward storyline. It gives the film a sense of real truth and makes you think that you saw something special. (7/10)
