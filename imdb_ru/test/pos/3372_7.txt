Creator Donnie Darko offers you a story about a strange fashion in the twilight zone. The film tells about an elderly young middle-aged couple, who in 1976 received a salary from the salary. Once there is a mysterious box with a red button. Later that day, an eerie gentleman appears and tells them that they have the choice to press a button and get a million dollars, but someone whom they do not know will die. This is an alarming and provocative question, strained in a trailer and television commercials. But let it be known that you simply do not know what you are doing until you see it. Sometimes a pretentious and slightly melodramatic film is ultimately effective because of its good characteristics and intriguing plot. It would be unfair to destroy any plot twists for you, but let's just say that the film will demonstrate the aspects you expect and do not fully fulfill the others that it will begin to outline. The film has a lot of explicit symbolism and subtext, which is both interesting and annoying, because it was not so obvious in his other excellent film Donny Darko. Not too much to say without destroying the film for you. This should inspire a lot of chatter cafes afterwards. However, I would also like to say that he shot well and looks appropriate, and is worth seeing. Check this.
