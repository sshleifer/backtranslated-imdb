Most of this film is alternately fun and brutal satire about Nazism and fascism, created in the midst of the success of these movements. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in the last moments of the film, Chaplin refuses all pretense of art (not to mention comedy) and completely switches to propaganda. And not anti-Nazi propaganda, but some of the most disgusting and idiotic "progressive" propaganda that ever existed in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> No matter that nothing of what we have seen so far indicates that the hairdresser is even able to make a speech that we see, which he says (ironically, with alarming fanaticism with wild eyes ); such trifles should not interfere with the Message.
