“Coupling” is a pleasant surprise: a romantic comedy, in which there really is romance and comedy. Most romantic comedies for me range from mediocre to terrible, because they are not funny or romantic. "Hitchhiker" invites such actors as Will Smith, Kevin James and Eva Mendez, in an exciting, light as a feather, a journey that actually made me laugh and, yes, a little "oooh, how cute!". <br /> <br /> Meet Alex Hitchens (Will Smith), aka Hitch. He is the self-proclaimed "doctor of the date"; he helps hopeless guys like Albert (Kevin James) defeat guys like Allegra (Amber Valletta). Unfortunately, Hitch deals with Sarah (Eva Mendes), a gossip columnist intending to crack the Doctor of Dates ... <br /> <br /> Hitch is actually quite funny, and it even makes standard farce scenes work . just because the cast is so energetic and obviously funny. I have to wonder why Will Smith didn’t make more such films. His harsh, rapid fire is perfect for this genre, and his chemistry with Mendez and James is wonderful. James is a real discovery; I have never seen his “King of Queens” show, but he is funny and hearty, and he proves once again that fat white men cannot dance hip-hop (Smith's responses to his attempts are funny). Mendez is hot and vigorous (not so damn it), like Smith’s perfect couple, and Amber Valletta is as sweet as Allegra. <br /> <br /> “Coupling” is not perfect; it is too long, and everything becomes too dramatic near the end (although it is redeemed with a happy ending filled with funny dances). But is this a great opportunity to refresh yourself from the romantic comedies that constantly litter the theaters.
