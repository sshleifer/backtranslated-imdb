It was a really tense and dark episode. Perfectly performed, great acting and atmospheric direction, “Ice” is one of my favorite episodes. Along with “Pusher”, “Grotesque”, “Wetwired” and “Home” (in my case they are pretty good in a dark atmosphere), it seems to me quite realistic that their paranoia, their suspicions and their ever-growing rage were perfectly performed by great actors . However, “Icy” had a problem that I overcame after a few hours: IT WAS SOON! I WANT MORE! <br /> <br /> In general, “ice” had 98% of all episodes of the X Files: great game, intense writing of stories, tough direction. All works. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
