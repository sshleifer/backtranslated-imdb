I'm afraid I will have to add my name to a long list of people who remain stunned by the fact that this film is NEVER (September 2007) released on DVD. This is one of those puzzles that is amazing, especially considering the number of DVDs available today that contain material that should have been put together a few years ago. However, I have a great digital VHS copy in English with subtitles and Nicam Stereo, so my concern is more of a principle than disappointment at not being able to watch the movie. As for the film itself, this is an excellent station wagon with good image quality, a more than satisfactory soundtrack, a lively plot that includes tension, emotions, sadness, disappointment, well-being and an exotic atmosphere (for a European). As far as this film is true in Burma, I have no idea, this is really less important, the main thing is that from the point of view of entertainment it is a success. Soon one of them becomes attached to each of the main characters, and I confess that my heart was in my mouth during the final scene of the river crossing. It is a pity that we hear so little about countries such as Burma, and this film, at least, gives some idea of ​​the country. Has the situation changed since 1995? Events that should happen later this month seem to answer this question with a decisive “No”, and the current regime, as before, looks just as cruel, even without sparing the lives of monks, not to mention women or children!
