When the new External Limits first began, the episodes were rather optimistic and complex. When the series began to turn off, most of the episodes became simply ugly and lacking any entertainment value. The six episodes here reflect the best and worst episodes. <br /> <br /> Because “External Limits” always preach morality. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the most entertaining flops. <br /> <br /> 1. The afterlife: as an institution, the US military-industrial complex is both evil and paranoid, not to mention stupidity. However, people with great honesty serve our country, and they will obey their conscience even at a stunning price! In the end, the aliens don't have to say a word. Those who have no conscience are fools to be despised! <br /> <br /> A truly disruptive episode! One that should be shown on television in prime time for public viewing! For some, this may be a revelation, but people without conscience are not allowed to serve in our armed forces! Goals don't justify the means! <br /> <br /> 2. The Theory of Relativity: A good person may be forced to take a split second for good or evil in order to save the lives of defenseless rational beings, and at great cost to himself. What makes this decision even more difficult is the absolute choice: to be alone with exotic alien strangers with whom you cannot even communicate, except with gestures, or to go along with a group of people who you think will protect you from unknown dangers, even if they are ruthless and devoid of compassion! <br /> <br /> This episode is just great! That which feeds this depravity is the good old greed. This episode is one of the worst accusations of capitalism, multinational corporations and the rape of the environment that I have ever seen in my entire life! Unlike in real life, justice is served here — and quickly! <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable lines is when a ruthless corporate thug said something like: "We did the same in the Amazon rain forest war." Referring to the killing of the Amazon Indians who were trying to protect their rainforests from mining, as an excuse to kill them again literally in the name of "survival of the fittest." What Darwin never wanted to take literally! <br /> <br /> 3. Alien Shop: Huge power can be used for good, even from an exotic alien. This power can be used for healing, not for destruction. Mere mortals can learn from their mistakes! Even a criminal can see the light if he is given enough opportunity to do so. <br /> <br /> Sometimes strong medicine is required, but we can all wake up and change our self-destructive way! <br /> <br /> 4. Grell: Alien can be like a Christ figure! In the distant future, slavery can be justified once again in the name of expediency! Mostly good people can be spoiled. Sometimes a person needs to experience great shame to see the evil he does. Children are closer to the truth than adults. Those who have political power bear a huge responsibility! Another great job! Like the view, "do people learn from history?" <br /> <br /> Flop number 1: The quality of mercy: loose lips, shells! When you fight, be kind, keep quiet about important military plans. Gee, I really needed to watch a watch soap opera to figure it out? !! Interestingly, the creators of the “Outer Borders” have run out of ideas, or has the corporate company stopped working? Dark and ugly, useless, but despair! <br /> <br /> Flop # 2: Beyond The Veil: So bad that there is no morality besides this: When you're locked up in a mental hospital, use common sense, please! This episode is so bad that it is disgusting. What a robbery of the X-Files! Do not waste your time on it! You will thank me later! <br /> <br /> This is a sad comment that the “Outer Limits” went down the pipes by the end of the run. Disruptive episodes, like the first four, could not last forever! It was a miracle that they were made at all! We hope that someday other brave souls will follow the subversive tradition of the Outer Borders into new territory! <br /> <br /> If you're lucky enough to be such a brave person, you should start with one unique book: Anatomy of Miracles: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction, edited by Neil Barron! As I understand it, the most complete book ever written on this topic.
