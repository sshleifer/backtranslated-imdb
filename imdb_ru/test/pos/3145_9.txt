Saw it last night at the 7th Annual Home Film Festival in New York - a rather noisy place that reassured this sweet and touching film with two women. <br /> <br /> Relations between the two: one, older than the blind, the other, twenty, who helps her with her mail - has been cleverly established, and its depth is obvious. <br /> <br /> There are no car chases, explosions or stunning special effects - only sometimes difficult, but useful task of people turning to each other to help and help. <br /> <br /> See if you can!
