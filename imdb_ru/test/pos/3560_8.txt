"Any weapon can play" (1967), directed by Enzo J. Castellari, is a very good batch of spaghetti westerns, especially those from Leone. The first half is gorgeous, which, apart from the discovery, which is a direct indication of "A few dollars more", when Monco, Colonel Douglas Mortimer and El-Indio look alike, go to a ghost town and then are quickly killed by a Bounty Hunter called " Stranger, "he is very serious, with excellent gunfights (especially with the scene of a train robbery), quick and furious action and good performances by Gilbert Roland, George Hilton and (who manages well, considering that he is greatly mistaken) Edda Byrnes, But When the film reaches the middle of the road, a humorous fight begins between Hilton and Byrnes. This is not very funny, and this is the weakest part of the film, but it throws everything that you saw earlier in a new light. You understand that all this is in fact a fake spaghetti-western convention, and, looking back, the first half is done so well that you completely miss this current fake. Now a more obvious parody follows, even with acrobatic leaps around Brün, which preceded all these seventies circus westerns. The final, full promise of the “Good, bad and ugly” climax, is very well done, as in other hands it could be very stupid. So, quite a funny spaghetti western that doesn't take itself too seriously. I would recommend it to anyone who loves spaghetti westerns.
