The main thing that I can do in a love story is whether I like characters and whether they click each other. Matt is rather unlikely: alienated, boastful, at first glance, lazy and misogynist. His dysfunctional mother suffered greatly, and this makes him a little easier to take. I think I liked the details of his dysfunction - it was believable. He overcompensates by boasting that he nailed Amy. He behaves so cool with Amy that he strikes twice. When they speak, he cannot show her who he really is. She empathizes, and then exposes him at the right moments. She seems so mature and strong that her characteristics that appear later do not seem to fit. (For me.) I found her incredibly sexy and beautiful. The girl next door is beautiful, I call it. So I’ll like this movie if it really doesn’t screw up. <br /> <br /> Funny things happen to the coach, but Matt’s relationship with another coach was inspiring. The football scenes at the end were puzzling. Matt does not carry the ball, but seems to be blocking his back. People, he is not the right size! He is fifty pounds too easy for this position. But I thought his game was skillful. I measure it with how I wanted to twist his neck several times during his scenes with Meredith Monroe. The film was all right. Meredith M was better than fine.
