I'm not a Disney fan at all, but I'm in Orlando at a friend's wedding. So my travel partner and I went to Disney for a few days. I have not seen a good 3-D effect, well ... never. Therefore, I usually try to stay away from these presentations. The three-dimensional effect in this was very good. I am an adult man of 38 years old, and even I wanted to try and touch. This is good! A word of advice. At the end, look at the back of the theater on the wall. Say so ... the first time I saw this, the effect did not work. So I told my friend ... "It would be nice if ..." My friend said: "That’s what happens. For some reason this does not work. ” This is a terrific show. You will not be disappointed !!!
