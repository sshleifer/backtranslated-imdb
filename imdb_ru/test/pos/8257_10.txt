I saw this movie about 4 times, and every time I am impressed with the work of the second camera assistant. It seems trivial, but there is something very professional, knowledgeable and talented. The film as a whole suffers from other problems as indicated in other comments. The significance of the issues under consideration today is just as relevant as it was 40 years ago. The game is a bit stressful, but the work of the Second Camera Assistant is stellar! This person needs to return to the business - perhaps to lead? What is this man waiting for? I will watch and wait and cheer from the side! - Bob
