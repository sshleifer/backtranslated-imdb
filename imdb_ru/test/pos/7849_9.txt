Seduced was one of Eastwood's few early films that I didn’t see until I ran the DVD today. And from its first shade of sepia to the terrible climax, I was absolutely delighted. Too many filmmakers today replace special effects, quick editing and dizzying camera work instead of plot plots, but director Don Siegel knew how to get the most out of this relatively simple plot, and the characters are believable and convincing. <br /> <br /> The story tells about a female school leaving school, which ended up on the verge of various skirmishes during the American Civil War. South-supporting ladies find a badly wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood); returning to health, he begins to manipulate sexually frustrated women for their own purposes. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page copes with the role of the headmistress with a secret, and her immersion into insanity is imperceptibly transmitted. For a film that actually happens in one place, it never loses visual interest. There is even a chance that the normal status quo, long abandoned, when Eastwood's frauds will be revealed, may return; but mistresses and students go down the dark road ... <br /> <br /> This is a completely different style of the movie from the film “Dirty Harry” by the same director, shot in the same year, but both are equally gorgeous. Eastwood plays superbly against his usual persistent image of an antihero, but some mysterious qualities are inherent in his character. We will never know much about him until his imprisonment, and the viewer can freely choose his shadowed personality. A villain or a victim? Whatever you think, all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed it.
