Edward Dmitrik made this dark film about the investigation into the killing of demobilized soldiers. Robert Young lectures us about hate, Robert Mitchum looks through most of this picture, and Gloria Graham returns to the courage she demonstrated in “It's a beautiful life.” The core of the case is Robert Ryan: anti-Semitism. He is so deeply immersed in his role as Monty Montgomery (imagine that parents named Lawrence call their son Larry!) That the drama sits right on his shoulders and he is more than ready to accept the challenge. Without it, the film would be commonplace. At one time, Ryan played several memorable villains ("Bad Day on Black Rock", "Billy Budd"), but this performance put him on the map. With Sam Leven as a murder victim.
