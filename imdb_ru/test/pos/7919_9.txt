I believe that anyone who likes Eisenstein’s “Ivan the Terrible” films will enjoy this well-made film. This film is played as "The Lord of the Ring: The Return of the King", but without much effect, but with good and better drama. <br /> <br /> We have a German who dressed as a KKK, conquered Novgorod Russia. The Russians called Nevsky to lead them to fight the Germans in order to save Russia. Nikolai Cherkasov, who played Ivan in films about Ivan the Terrible, was as charismatic as Nevsky. The first 10 minutes, as he coped with the passage of the Mongol, were exciting. <br /> <br /> Many scenes were beautiful even in black and white. The anticipation of war did not require any dialogue, for example, “how many enemies will we kill”, etc. With the exception of a few speeches, the film can basically be played as a silent film. The fight scene can stand the fight of the “Birth of a Nation” Civil War scene. <br /> <br /> Another strong point of the film is Sergey Prokofiev’s magnificent musical score. The music gave an epic feel to the film in those scenes without dialogue.
