All I can say is that I was expecting a wick film, and Blurry surprised me in a positive way. Very good teen movie. All such situations are the norm in school life, so all I can say is that it all reminded me of my school days, and sometimes itâ€™s good to watch such films because they entertain us and bring us back to those golden years when we were young. In addition, make us think better about how we should understand our children, because in the past we were what they wanted to be in real time. Try this movie and you will be very pleased. At the same time, you will have the guarantee that your time has not been wasted.
