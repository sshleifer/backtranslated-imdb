For a short period between Clint Eastwood's chain of spaghetti westerns and his Filthy Harry films, he and director Don Siegel teamed up to make this unusual picture. Eastwood plays the wounded Corporal of the Allied Army during the Civil War, which is hosted by the southern school for girls, until he recovers from his wounds. It has been a long time since young women (most of whom seem to be teenagers) had a man indoors, so they donâ€™t want to surrender him to local rebel soldiers. The resulting situations are often humorous, shocking, erotic, or even just grotesque, as Eastwood slowly regains her strength and begins to reflect on the creation. <br /> <br /> The main plot sounds almost like the makings of a porn movie. We have a male man, suddenly surrounded by young, Nubil women. Most of them sexually attract him. And he is more than willing to spread love among them. However, the material never falls to the level of "bad taste". Eastwood, Siegel and cinematographer Bruce Surtis are such skilled directors that the film always retains its dignity. <br /> <br /> Eastwood's John McBurney is not like the other characters he has ever played. McBurney is amoral, treacherous and lustful charlatan. He knows that most women, even the youngest, need his body, and he allows several of them to shoot him. McBurney often uses flattery to lubricate women, and then uses her coarse appearance to coil them. He looks like a drunk player at a cocktail party, often attacking different women even in the same scene! In the end, his lustful deeds cause him great torment and loss, which you must see for yourself. This author would not have dreamed of revealing the specific consequences of his actions, but there is no doubt that he expects them. <br /> <br /> Eastwood, as a rule, shows excellent results. He seems to be disgusted with the role until everything is truly ugly, then he becomes evil and ugly. Geraldine Paige is a treat, like a steel girlfriend who runs a school. We know that she wants McBurnie as well as other girls, but with her colorful past, shown to us in memories, we discover that this is not all she needs! May Mercer as a slave belonging to the school also gives excellent results. She obviously knows that McBurney is a skunk from the very beginning, and she never lets his feigned charm weaken her guard. This is a character you want to know more about after the movie ends. Looks like she knows the world better than anyone else in the film. <br /> <br /> The Beguiled played poorly in theatrical release. No one was quite sure what to do about it, and some of its content no doubt caused surprise in 1971. For example, in the early scene, we see Eastwood romantically kissing a 12-year-old girl. Is he just trying to calm her down when rebel soldiers approach, or does he really enjoy it? Probably both! The fantasy sequence later even shows that Clint supports her not only with Page, but also with his young assistant! Really some interesting developments in this. It is good that Eastwood became the star he made, or this one could have been long forgotten. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Dog.
