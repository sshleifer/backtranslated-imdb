College teacher Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) is a blocking writer, as his ex-wife Margaret (Kate Mulgrew) ruined him by stealing his novel, which became a bestseller. He does not hide his hatred for Margaret, frustrating his girlfriend Beth Ryan (Kim Greist), who is a teacher of anthropology at the same college. During his creative writing classes, he is being pursued by a student Owen (Danny DeVito) who wants to know his opinion on his criminal history. Larry says that he did not like it, and explains that in every mysterious story the killer must eliminate the motive and establish an alibi, otherwise he will be caught. Next, Larry invites Owen to watch Hitchcock's films in order to understand the structure of a tense story. Owen, who wants to kill his disgusting mother (Ann Ramsey), watches "Strangers on the Train" and misunderstands Larry's advice, believing that his teacher wants to exchange murders to eliminate the motive. Owen goes to Hawaii and, while on the ship, Margaret falls overboard, disappearing into the sea, and is considered dead. However, Larry does not have an alibi and becomes the prime suspect, while the insane Owen forces him to kill his mother, as part of their alleged deal. <br /> <br /> “Throw your mom out of the train” is one of the funniest 80s comedies and a great tribute to Alfred Hitchcock. Direct link - “Strangers on the train”, but there are jokes with “Vertigo” (with a rotating camera), “Family story” (with the machine without interruptions) and other films. The lines are excellent, and there is an interesting moment when Larry says that every great novel or mystery has a train. Ann Ramsey is gorgeous in the role of a disgusting and insulting dominant mother, and the viewer will surely feel sadness and understand Owen’s madness. Kim Greist is very beautiful, and Kate Mulgrew is the perfect bitch. Billy Crystal performs an obsessive character with many silly and unsubstantiated views, but necessary for conspiracy. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Jogue a Mamãe do Trem” (“Throw mom off the train”)
