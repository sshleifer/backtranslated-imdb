There I was on vacation when my host offered to take part in this B-Movie festival in Breda. I was persistent, since I did not go on a trip to sit in the cinema, but I must admit that I do not regret a second of this (especially with the contribution of Stephen Malkmus). It probably helped that I had no idea what to expect. <br /> <br /> SEA OF DUST begins as a typical costume drama. We have a young medical student who is going to help a doctor whose city is being destroyed by a crazy plague (which is somehow connected with exploding heads). On the way, he stops to visit his fiancé, and his father throws him out of the house. Traveling on, he finds the girl lying on the road, another victim of the plague, and takes her to the doctor with him. Yawn, I thought. It all seemed pretty predictable. <br /> <br /> And then everything went crazy, and suddenly it turned into a completely different film. Tom Savini appears, looking like Dracula, the characters begin to travel to the “other side” of reality, and the dialogue becomes more humorous. <br /> <br /> And as soon as I thought that it had turned into a recess, the picture changes again to become truly dark and strange. I will not spoil it for the first time for the audience, but there is an amazing sequence of empty people, a lot of talk about the abuse of religion by society, and some excessive bloody effects. And did I mention Stephen Malkmus? This is not a perfect movie (in case you didn’t understand it because of its appearance at the B-Movie festival), but it's worth it for adventure lovers. Gorgeous visual effects, cool soundtrack, lots of interesting ideas. At times acting is a little crazy, but I think that's the point. <br /> <br /> Funny, I had to go to Breda to find an American film that looked like a British horror movie. Do you understand this ...
