Whenever this film is mentioned, the discussion usually begins and ends with a wonderful collection of cars and drag scenes, which are often overlooked by the eclectic characters who inhabit the film around the three central characters. <br /> <br /> One character stands out Rebel, played by the great veteran Australian actor Max Cullen. The rebel is a blind rider who almost knocks down the hero and his group in the middle of the night because he does not use headlights. <br /> <br /> In prehistory, we find that the Rebel is a master builder of street racing cars, and he and his wife seem locked in the time warp of the 1950s. The rebel continues to play a small but key role in teaching Mike, played by Terri Serio, the almost spiritual truth about street racing. This is not the speed, reaction time, which make a great rider. This is the one who feels the car better than anyone else, who will become the greatest <br /> <br /> This best illustrates how the rebel explains to Mike after a test drive: “You have experienced all the agony just having missed the style” /> Graham Bond, another reputable actor, presenting his talents as a jaded policeman seeking to deal with some financial activities caused by street racing. The standoff between Bond and Fox by Richard Moira adds tension to the story. Bond is not only waiting for results, but also Fox to unleash the racing business. <br /> <br /> Fox’s most of the film shows a real manipulative and evil side, but at the climax he experiences a sense of honor that turns the last few people. minutes to an extremely tense and memorable finale. It is as if the film has reoriented itself to its true intention to show us the culture of street racing, and not the daily activities of people. <br /> <br /> One of the main complaints about the film is the script. Although there is nothing exciting about this, I believe that the complete absence of any chemistry between Mike's girlfriend, played by Deborah Conway, and his mechanic, played by Vangelis Murikis, has more to do with this problem. Any scene in which these two interact, just had to be cut off. <br /> <br /> Finally, from the point of view of the actors, one truly outstanding performance was delivered by Kristoffer Greaves, who plays the deaf and crippled member of Fox's inner circle. His back story is never explored, whether he was injured in a race that was born that way, what Fox sees the value to keep him close <br /> <br /> The reality of the film is simple, she tells about the race street, and the culture behind by this. When the machines fly and the sequences of movements are in motion, this is the only time that director John Clark and his writer Barry Tomblin seem really pleased with what they are doing. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking in depth for a study of human relationships, moments of life that define drama, then this film is not for you. If your pulse quickens at the thought of an exploding 57 Chev or the iconic GTO Phase 3, burning in the streets of Sydney, then you will not find much better than this movie
