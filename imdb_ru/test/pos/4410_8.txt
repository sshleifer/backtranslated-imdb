I was glad to see this gem of a film available on DVD. Although he was a “TV movie” and shot at 16 mm, he provided a great insight into the different types of people who wanted to become a “London taxi driver”, as well as their weaknesses and family responsibilities. Even the most unfortunate of the candidates, “Titanic” with his uncommunicative wife, was able to see how Jack Rosenthal could turn the often amusing and sometimes tragic fragment of London life into an entertaining 90 minutes. <br /> <br / Initially the premiere as a vehicle for Mick Ford (pun), the quality of the cast from the cast, including Michael Elf, Nigel Hawthorne, Jonathan Lynn, Leslie Joseph and Maureen Lipman (Mrs. Rosenthal) meant that Mika may have been the highest pay but he had to work in the face of such competing talents. <br /> <br /> Even 15 years after its 1991 release, it is still as fresh as ever!
