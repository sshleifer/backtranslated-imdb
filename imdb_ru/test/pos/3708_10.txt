Much about this movie was beautiful. Acting, scenery and, without doubt, Aaron's cinematic background shone through beautiful shots. Definitely worth a look, since your attention will be fascinated all the time, and it ends only on the right note. <br /> <br /> Newcomer Jonathan Ferratâ€™s game has been excellent, as you might think that he has been a professional actor since he was born. He continued to appear in other feature films, but this main role will always be remembered. <br /> <br /> An Academy Award is sometimes noted in a film when it is slow, scenic, and quiet, so this is not a film that children can add to the end. Nevertheless, the rustic atmosphere of East Bend and Yadkinville played well the role of the film of the 1940s.
