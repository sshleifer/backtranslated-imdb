The “storm” is interpreted differently: from more or less traditional views on art to more postmodern approaches, which like to play the play according to postcolonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist directions. The reason why German's version left me pretty cold is because I had no idea what he was talking about. What is the basis of the vision / idea / concept behind this Shakespeare translation? Previous reviewers do not go much further than the tragedy of revenge, punk shows, but of course, this is not all, is it? This does not mean that there is no vision here, it was just difficult for me to detect it. However, there is still something to enjoy. The taste of punk is refreshing and cheerful. Toya Wilcox as Miranda and Jack Birkett as Caliban are wonderful. I wasn’t very worried about Williams, like Prospero ... not enough magic, I suppose. Switching between the old monastery / castle and the (very English) outside world can sometimes be a bit disturbing, but I guess this is intentional. In general, interesting, but not quite the success that I had hoped for (especially after watching Caravaggio by German).
