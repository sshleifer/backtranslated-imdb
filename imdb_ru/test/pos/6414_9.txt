(the description of the mood of the film can be considered as a spoiler - because in reality there are not so many actions) <br /> <br /> Excellent ... <br /> <br /> This is for me A peculiar interest for dystopias and utopias? This is for the atmosphere of the film. Or is there more magic? If yes, then it is certainly the most human ... <br /> <br /> This film is, without a doubt, extremely artistic / artificial (depending on taste). I can imagine that most people who hate to watch slow films (and those that Cai Ming Liang (which I didn’t like at other times) are among the slowest ones I know) suffer during the film. Yes, people cannot slow down and miss the time - and look at it without feeling that they are wasting it. Can this work be accepted as torture or as therapy ... <br /> <br /> Is the topic on the surface? Lack of communication — even if we live in rabbit cages — one next to each other — but not quite together? People are tired, tired of something and unable to describe it - they just don’t want to meet, touch, speak, confront others ... as if they disappeared. The big house looks empty, and the rain constantly causes a strange melancholy inside. And sometimes it must be something abnormal, unexpected, some unwanted destruction in the form of a hole in the concrete floor - which allows us to reach each other. <br /> <br /> One of the possible ways to look at it this way: Do not consider the inner world of the characters - think that the entire space of the film is inside you. And ask - why is it there? Where could these depressive states and moods arise? Is there a place for them, they have no right to be here? And look for answers (if you need them) among the walls and halls of the quarter, and not inside the barely transparent mind of a person. <br /> <br /> The key to understanding is not to understand — to let the film borrow us — as an object of study — inside of us — and at the end safely bring us back to our more colorful and “normal” looking reality. <br /> <br /> Then maybe you will achieve - as I do - a feeling of real, possible, nonpathic hope that in essence we are still humans ... and this state of mind can greatly help a person to live in this world.
