On the highway leading to the wedding of his beloved Betty-Ann, Adam (Eric Jungmann) is surprised by his former classmate Harley (Justin Urich) in the backseat of his car. Adam broke with the uncomfortable and moron Harley because of Betty-Ann. During their trip, Harley ridicules some of the bushmen in the bar, and later their car is chased by a giant monster truck on the road. After some incidents, they bring up Sarah’s hitchhiker (Aimee Brooks), and soon the trio are terrorized by a scary monster driving a monster truck. <br /> <br /> Despite having one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in the horror movie annoying Harley, Monster Man is a surprisingly good horror comedy. The story is a collection of clichés starting as "Joy Ride" or "Duel"; then it turns into one of the countless robberies of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre; There is an unexpected twist that ends in a crochet to continue. There are funny scenes, Amy Brooks is very sexy, and this film is really entertaining. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Monster Man”.
