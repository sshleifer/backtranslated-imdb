When I first saw this film, I was just a little kid, and I fell in love with it, they really don’t make such films anymore, I just watch it again, now a bit older and still love it. <br /> <br /> “Humor” is perfect and fits perfectly into the film, all the jokes are a little childish, but they make adults laugh, and in a children's film this is really very rare. <br /> <br /> Animation is awesome, and watching hand-drawn animation is a real breath of fresh air for all of the computer animation we see today. The background is stunning, and the coloring is amazing. <br /> <br /> Characters are just the characters that you fall in love with from the moment you start watching girls who think that the chipmunks are adorable, and the guys - the chipsets are really very sexy. <br /> <br /> The songs are also fun to listen to, and some just make you cry or get up and dance, it’s also interesting to watch visual humor to accompany them. <br /> <br /> Voicing is great, no doubt, even if most of the voice acting is high, but an interesting thing has appeared, and this is one of the songs of this film, but slowed down to show real voices. behind them, and it's really fun to watch. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in a store or somewhere on lease, I say, look, is it really worth seeing, and this is the perfect family movie, it’s just amazing, the words cannot express this movie.
