A group of mostly disgusting and extremely unattractive teenagers go to an eerie, distant, exhausted old morgue, located next to the cemetery, to attend a comprehensive Halloween party held by the freaky obsessed occult eccentric Mimi Kincaid and her empty boy. hungry friend Bimbet Linnie Quigley. Stupid, desecrated, greedy for beer, sexually happy Dimwites hold a session as a joke (a very bad idea, because, naturally, they say that the desert old dive is haunted by the demonic spirit). Of course, this reckless session awakens those resolutely grumpy and hostile evil spirits who horribly kill and seize most of the children, turning them into ugly, fanging, clawed, boiling faces of murderous ghouls that cause the usual terrible chaos throughout Duration especially long, dark and a heartbreaking night of pure horror. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is, in fact, your tenth vibrant graphics and ruthless skewed shocking “Evil Dead” paraphrase, teeming with a closed one, there is no easy way out of a claustrophobic single self-limited setting, an excessively excessive amount of splashes, an inexorably roaring score with the hum'n'shiver synthesizer, the full feeling of a dark and gloomy nightmare - manic cinematic filming of your face (expected unrestrained, impulsive hyperactive manual work with the camera, smooth, winding tracking shots, umasshedshie chamber titers even camera on the trolley operate delicately sliding eight 180-degree). Fortunately, Kevin S. Tenney's sleek, confident, stylish direction holds extremely exhausting and derivative processes, rattling forward, in a quick clip; In addition, Tenney gives the film an attractive, sophisticated look and effectively creates some coarse, energetic and enthusiastic grotesque atmosphere of fun in the style of carnival in the style of oog-boogie. <br /> <br /> However, the amazingly bloody and creative effects of Steve Johnson's makeup are the real star of the show. The bloodthirsty moments include the disgusting, thick bibs of Hal Hevins (who at the same time played a similar to annoying obesity ** role of a hole in the immortal "Godfathers in a slimball-a-ram bowl"), bit his tongue, Quigley pushed a whole tube of lipstick lipstick in one of her breasts (yes!) and knocking out the guy's eyes while she makes love to him (twice yes!), a libidine teen couple who are offended, doing exactly what you think is in the coffin (the chick has her the neck broke while the dude's arm was chopped off), Kincaid In one of the most disgusting scenes of the film, the vile old man turned the tip of his throat inside out after he ate a piece of apple with razor blades. , Cheesy rock music also smokes. And then there is the incredibly wild, sexy, and unhindered dance of the Kincaid demons, a terrific number, accompanied by flickering strobe light and the amazing jumps that Kincaid set before herself. Okay, so overall, this is nothing but a completely meaningless and senseless, albeit rather beautifully mounted and pleasant vulgar piece of frivolous frightened frivolous junk, but if you are in the mood for an amusingly mind-blowing horror talk, this fun coarse and minor scale makes your own business is just fine.
