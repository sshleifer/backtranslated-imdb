If Western Union is not the real story of the construction of the Transcontinental Telegraph, it certainly reflects the spirit and dedication of the people involved in the project. <br /> <br /> Dean Jagger is in charge and one day he is thrown off a horse and his ribs are broken. The criminal on the run, Randolph Scott, finds Jagger and is ready to steal his horse, but changes his mind and makes Jagger help. He was later hired by Western Union and works for Jagger. <br /> <br /> Jagger also hires a young Oriental, played by Robert Young, as an engineer. Young shoots one of his few films made with MGM for the movie “20th Century Fox”. Young and Scott become friends, but vie for Jagger's sister, Virginia Gilmore. <br /> <br /> Western Union has enough action to satisfy any Western fans. The telegraph team has to deal with criminals, Indians and the labor problems of your garden. <br /> <br /> Thin Summerville as a timid chef and Victor Killian as the border character assigned to guard him have some of the funniest scenes. They both provide good comic relief. <br /> <br /> Fritz Lang received good results from his cast and continued to quickly promote the film. Western Union is a solid Western entertainment.
