I usually do not like romantic films, but I really love this film. The story is really touching, and the final is very appropriate. I feel really worried about the many characters in this film. I feel that I can feel their feelings. While most romantic films always make me feel detached and bored, this film makes me feel involved, starting from the Capshaw scene running along the beach with Scott and ending with the final scene. I want to rate this movie 11 out of 10, because I want to give an extra one point for the final. The cast is very strong. Kate Capshaw has a good opportunity to show their talent. Although I'm not impressed with Scott in The Dead on Campus, this film completely changes my perspective on it. He is so irresistibly charming here. Geraldine McEwan is awesome as ever. <br /> <br /> This film may not be as good, complex, deep or believable as other films that have a bit of a relationship like “L 'ecole de la chair or“ Post coitum, triste animals ” but the “Love Letter” can still be proud of itself, as it sheds very rare light on such relationships. And this difference makes this film extremely enjoyable. Being unusual and relying on the great charm of small stars, Dreamworks, this time you will really fulfill my dream.
