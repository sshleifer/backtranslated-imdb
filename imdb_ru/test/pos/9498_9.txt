This, apparently, is the first film featuring Gloria Swanson - the film that made her a breakthrough star. Although she was good at the film, I donâ€™t see how this performance, in particular, was so remarkable at that time - but, nevertheless, it was a very good movie. <br /> <br /> Gloria plays a rich slut wife who constantly takes her for granted. He cares little about his departure, eats a bow and forgets his anniversary! And, at the same time, Lothario enters their lives and begins to pay much attention to Gloria, and her deceiving husband does not even notice and does not give her any reason NOT to deceive him. In the end, she divorces her husband and marries evenly speaking Romeo. However, although the film could be just an excessive melodrama (they were quite common at the time), it takes several interesting turns and is a creative and fun movie. Although not the quietest movie I've ever seen, it stands out and deserves to be remembered. <br /> <br /> By the way, the release of DVD from Image Entertainment is surprisingly good - with decent printing and music. This is not always true for other issues of Image (especially, how carelessly they coped with issues of Chaplin).
