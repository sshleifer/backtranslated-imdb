- An amazingly nice movie. <br /> <br /> - A group of thieves led by Mark Wahlberg robbed a golden safe in Italy, and, fortunately, the robbery is successful, and they get away with it without any problems. However, before the group celebrates, Steve, who is played by Ed Norton, decides that he wants to get gold for himself, pulls Kut-de-Ta into the group and shoots one of the participants. He and his associates forget that the group is dead, but fortunately, the group is not dead. A year later, we return to the story in which the group tracked down Norton, and decided to steal the gold and spend the rest of the film, planning to steal their gold and settle the score. <br /> <br /> - It was a surprise for me, it was all that was needed to be a typical summer film that could be forgotten, but in fact it was unforgettable and very interesting to watch. What I like is how smart and well thought out the plans are in the film, and how the film looks realistic. Watching the trailer makes you think that it was some kind of pointless action movie, but in fact there are only two action movies in the film, and they are all really well done. The last scene of the action is very long 20 min. a scene that has one of the best car chases ever made. I like how real the chase is and how everything is done in the old school style without the help of CGI. Personally, I liked this pursuit of the car more than the pursuit of computer graphics in the "Matrix 2". I remember watching music videos by director F. Gray Gray and I always noticed how good they were and thought that he would be a great director, it turns out that I was right, as always, and he proves it here. Can't wait to see what he does with the sequel. <br /> <br /> Actors do a good job too, and Seth Green is my favorite in the band. Another thing that I really liked was the excellent account of John Powell, since I heard his account for “Robots” this year, I was his fan and paid close attention to his music, and this person is really good. He does a great job avoiding all the typical summer musical clichés in action movies, and gives a very good rating. I have not seen the original on which it is based, so I cannot say for sure how well it fits with it. <br /> <br /> So yes, this is a great movie about popcorn, which really has a brain, unlike most of the summer movie shit that comes out. He has great characters, is pretty damn funny, and has a terrific John Powell account. If you like movies with robberies, then you will like this <br /> <br /> - you know, if I were in a group, I would be called handsome Mike
