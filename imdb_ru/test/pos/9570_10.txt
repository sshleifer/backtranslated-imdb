This is the best of the films (at the moment) that Christopher Guest created using his very talented cast. Previously, they made an excellent WAIT FOR GUFFM and, following BEST IN SHOW, made a very pleasant A MIGHTY WIND. As for their last, FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION, the less said, the better. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a documentary about dog shows and a few contestants in particular. You follow these few selected dogs from show preparation to the biggest night, when one of them will be chosen as the best one at the show in the fictional "Mayflower Kennel Club". However, none of these people is a real dog show enthusiast, except for the actors of improvisational talent who parody many of the typical people you meet in the dog show world. It is surprising that, despite the fact that the characters are rather strange, there are a lot of truths in the personalities they parodied - since decades ago I had some experience in dog shows, and this is a VERY ruthless group of people! My favorite dog owners were an incredibly tense and tense yuppie pair that only exuded anger and volatility. I also loved a frankly gay couple, as they were terribly funny and clever. However, the best performance was probably not for any pair, but for Fred Willard, who played the world's most stupid and least talented broadcaster in the history of mankind. His comments were absolutely meaningless and often betrayed him as an incredibly stupid person - as he became a speaker for such a prestigious show, one can only guess. Other contestants were also quite funny — the expensive professional poodle and his wealthy owner, the country boy and his hound, and Winky “parents” who could hardly get together to get to the show. /> <br /> Despite the improvised style of making the film, all the parts are perfectly combined with each other and tell a very funny and compelling story that is NOT just for dog owners. An exceptional acting game made it one of the best comedies of the last decade. Clever and always funny. <br /> <br /> By the way, try to find it on DVD, since extras were really worth seeing. Although it was a bit painful to watch, I liked to see Harlan Pepper and his collection of beach balls in particular!
