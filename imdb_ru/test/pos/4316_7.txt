Indeed, Cynthia Watros is in this film when Elizabeth is talking to Desmond. Although I just wonder how she turned out to be a “rehabilitation patient” (?), Where Hurley is also trying to reduce her weight there (as can be seen from previous episodes). <br /> <br /> In any case, this last episode is really suspended. The ending is not so clear. I think the author really expected the audience that season 3 would come. <br /> <br /> I just hope that next season will clarify more obscure / hanging events that have happened. <br /> <br /> I just can't wait for season 3.
