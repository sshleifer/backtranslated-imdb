It was Gene Kelly’s breakthrough, and that alone makes it memorable. Add Rita Hayworth as his love interest and comedian Phil Silvers of all people as his partner, and you have the ingredients for a real viewer, that's exactly what happened. <br /> <br /> Kelly plays Danny McGwire, the owner of a nightclub in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is always the “wrong side of the tracks” in 40s films), whose star appeal and love interest is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth). Rita is beautiful, and even plays a double role as Grow and Granny Grow. Rusty has a chance at a big moment due to the machinations of John Kudair (Otto Kruger), who romantically lost Rusty's grandmother and lost her. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around how Danny frees Rusty to the detriment of his club because she has a chance for success, which he cannot give her. But, naturally, this is not what Rusty ultimately wants, because, as usual in the films of that time, the right guy is the only thing that the girl thinks. There are no surprises, but everyone does his job well. <br /> <br /> Kelly performs her first amazing stunt dances, this time with herself, as reflected in a glass window. He was a master of this kind of dance, and one still needs to wonder how they calculated everything so precisely that he really seemed to be in two places at the same time. The melodrama is getting a little thicker, and some unreasonable references to the war have been added to it, which give little but one or two songs, but Kelly takes this film to the next level. That was before he became a megastar and too smooth, perhaps for his own good. The underlying trait of his character gives him a believable and almost thoughtful look. <br /> <br /> The character Kelly in the movie “Xanadu” of 1980 was also named Danny McGwire. This film was the beginning, this film was the end of a terrific run for a dancing genius. Obviously, this film meant a lot to him. Highly recommended.
