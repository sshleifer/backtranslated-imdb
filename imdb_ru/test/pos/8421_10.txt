This is a film about a six-year-old child from a village in Maharashtra (the state in India) and his grandfather who comes to Pune (a city in Maharashtra) to treat a child's eyes. here the grandfather learns that the child has cancer in both eyes and that it needs to be removed in order to save the child’s life. The film tells about the main characters, their feelings and actions before the operation. <br /> <br /> This film is not a typical Indian cliché film, so do not expect to see songs, melodrama or melodrama. it is an extremely elaborate sensitive film that resorts to silent expressions and not to the upper dialog boxes in order to understand the essence. look at the scene where the grandfather talk about the need to remove the child's eyes. the game is gorgeous, heartbreaking dialogues. Your heart is drawn to the grandfather, whose unenviable task is to tell the child and his mother about the operation. <br /> <br /> Work with the subject went great. the film was shot under enormous difficulties by director Sandip Sawant, who had to knock on many doors to collect rupees. six million (about 130,000 dollars) budget. even then the final product looks polished and has a decent production cost. also witness the subtle contrast of the urban village shown by the director by including a few random snapshots of the boy's life in the village. Savant definitely prefers country life. <br /> <br /> Everything plays fine. Amruta Subhash as a social worker is competent, adding the necessary humane touch to her role. Sandip Kulkarni, as a doctor, is magnificent, demonstrates the perfect manners of the doctor. Ashwyn Chitale as a child is natural. he seems not to be acting. everything in it is natural and does not seem violent. <br /> <br /> But Arun Naladeh stands above all, like a grandfather. he is striking in his role. simple words cannot describe his work. This performance, which must be cherished forever. <br /> <br /> Schwaas is a sincere desire to create a good cinema. it should not be ignored only for the fact that it shows that if things are kept simple, the results can be really amazing. 10/10
