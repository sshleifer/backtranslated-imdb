I remember shooting this film on C4 screening a year ago, and it all just shook me. I thought the film was able to present such a variety of genres; supernatural, love story, crime intrigue and much more. <br /> <br /> I got involved in this after a minute or so and was really concerned about the characters. One second, I was scared for Jimmy, and then I laughed at the gangsters the next ... and all the time I crossed my fingers, everything worked out for Jimbo! <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger and Rose Brown are great, Brian Brown is an absolute quality, and I was embarrassed with David Field, who was a funny and mean guy. <br /> <br /> Since I saw this film I was able to order it on DVD, and as a result, every person I show it to was connected in about the same way. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for a Sunday or a lazy evening, and itâ€™s one that you can truly appreciate with your friends.
