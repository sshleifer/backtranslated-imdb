Consequences of love: this film does have something special, but it is very difficult to understand. It is a kind of love story, but in fact I have not seen it. There are several love themes in the film. The love of one man for a young woman, the love of a young man for his elder brother, the love of the mafia for money at any cost are just some that are intertwined in a story in which you guessed or rather do not know where and how it will end. All the actors are excellent - from the bartender who had teased Sofia to the frank face of Titta, the main character of the film. Simple but effective camera work has rebounded from the ever-changing soundtrack, which mixes trip-hop with low resolution and lush orchestral pieces. The style of the film is changing beautifully, using several styles without overloading them. Love has never looked so diverse and powerful as the stories that tell us, rumble to different conclusions. The director married the old and the new in rich Italian classics.
