Kevin Spacey's always-awesome makes us again question certain truths in our lives. After he made us believe, he is the muttering little trickster of time (only to uncover the true power of cinematic deception) in the classic “Ordinary Suspect”; this time he makes us believe that he is Prot, a handsome alien taking on a human form during a walk on Earth. <br /> <br /> Prot is a strange stranger who seemed to come out of nowhere, only to be hospitalized in a Manhattan psychiatric institution. Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) soon shows an extraordinary interest in him and even thinks about whether Prot is really the highest being from the planet K-PAX, or perhaps he is just a forgotten person with serious psychiatric problems. Although the ending can be seen and discussed in many ways, it remains a challenging, informative journey that leaves behind many intriguing / philosophical questions.
