Hello everyone, you, jaylera, stone foxes, you mean guys. Watch out because Slaughter is back in town! If you're looking for a bad funky movie to watch some evening, this is just what you need. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to relax and unwind after his adventures in Mexico. But if you are such a narrow-minded gangster like Duncan, you will definitely have to take revenge. Why i do not know. Was Hoffo first in the brother or how? Anyone Who. The film begins with an old "kill from an airplane" routine. We all know that this is the most effective way to bring one guy to a picnic full of people. It goes without saying that Slaughter is undergoing a test, but Cmndt. Eric Lassard, I'm sorry, George Gaines, I mean, isn't it lucky? CLAP!! Also kills Pratt's best friend. This is the beginning of a grand adventure, filled with the most fun and funny music that James Brown himself has to offer. That's right, "The Godfather of the Soul" put his trademark on this bad guy. In addition to starring Jim Brown, this film is filled with some of the loudest names the blasting scene offers. How about Scattman Crothers, Dick Anthony Williams, Gloria Hendry and Brock Peters. In other parts, we see none other than Judith M. Brown and, last but not least, the fantastic Don Stroud as an evil minion.
