Sorry to repeat again and again, but hereâ€™s another great episode from Colombo. That's probably why I'm such a fan - most of the episodes are really great! In the best episodes there is always some outstanding feature, in which case the killer and his accomplice, perhaps the youngest of all the Colombo villains. <br /> <br /> After watching a lot of episodes in which Colombo and his opponent behave like Close Friends, it's nice to see an episode when hot-tempered and bad feelings float to the surface. It only gives the episode a bit more drama and a bite. Colombo quickly realizes the fact that two students who claim to help him do not laugh at him very secretly and feed him with false clues. He happily plays along, deliberately throwing up awkward in front of them to make him underestimate him! But, of course, he immediately finds out when they talk about nonsense. <br /> <br /> Murder itself is another difficult event, similar to the episode of The Bye Sky High IQ. kill the intended target by providing the killers with a seemingly waterproof alibi. Over the past years, between 1978 and 1990, the technology has moved from recorders and fireworks to car remote control systems and hidden cameras. <br /> <br /> Stephen Caffrey does an excellent job with Justin Row, a nasty spoiled student. Gary Hershberger modest, but good, like his friend, "yes-man" Cooper Redman. And it's nice to see Robert Culp in the role of Mr. Row, Justin's father. <br /> <br /> A very pleasant episode in all respects.
