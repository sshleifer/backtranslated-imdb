I watched all those doctors who shot my local PBS radio station as they got older (I met the doctor through John Pertwee) and also the doctor’s “camera copies” that British fans sent to America to their US colleagues. I had a great time with the show, but he never took himself seriously - I mean as serious as a science fiction show about a time traveler. I went "against", did the costume a bit (Dr. No. 5,6 and Tegan were my heroes of the costume), I liked it. then everything stopped suddenly. The program policy and lack of interest and funding turned the doctor into a 25-year-old antiques, which penetrated the spirit. <br /> <br /> When I heard that the sci-fi channel picked up a new doctor, my first thought was “Cool, now my 11-year-old son can see what I have been talking about all these years, and know that, damn it, TARDIS "(I have several phone boxes and TARDIS of different sizes around the house), I do not Do not expect excellent quality of the plot, character development and f / x. I should have said at least - pleased. I first found a doctor who was not a cheat, clown, jester, scum, pussy or jerk. Christopher Eccleston is by far the most believable doctor to date. Now, calm Tom Baker's fans! don't get me wrong, I loved almost every doctor and his quirks, but Christopher gave the doctor what he had never had — real word likelihood. I just feel sad that he decided against another season. I will test David Tennant like any other doctor, but now the bar has risen ... <br /> <br /> bad wolf rules !!!!! <br /> <br /> 2008 update - I love David Tennant! his "fashionable" persona is what my generation remembers, which my son's generation can handle, and the fashionable Gestapo can relax! he is a little more human than Christopher, but not a man like other former doctors. I miss the rose, I dig March, and what do they think with Donna Noble!?!? it's still the best trip on tv
