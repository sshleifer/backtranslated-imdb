Wow, all I can say is, I really loved the film, and one thing I could say to Aaron Carter is that I really think you should be in a lot more films because you rock . Thank you very much for making this movie great. I really wish he could make a lot more films because he is a great dancer, actor and singer. I would like to sing as good as I could. and I was a fan of him as never before, and I will never stop loving him. I rented a movie, and I had it for two days, and I literally watched it like 10 times. laugh loudly, you can call me crazy, but this proves that I really liked it. If you want to talk, you can contact me at dvlbab300@aol.com, so contact me if you want. I LOVE YOU AARONA CARTER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
