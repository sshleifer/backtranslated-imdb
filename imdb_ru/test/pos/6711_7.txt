LIFEFORCE is an extremely schizophrenic film based on Colin Wilson’s novel Cosmic Vampires, the script ignores most of the concepts and structure of the novel (in fact, he owes more to the QUATERMASS series than to the novel), but the scenes he leaves in the novels are almost identical in film. And if we talk about the script, it should be one of the most uneven in the history of cinema, although it was written in chapters by several people. Take, for example, Carlson, he disappears after the early scenes of the shuttle, because of which I believed that he was dead, and then reappears halfway through the film to explain the plot to the besieged British, and this is the lack of attention from the writers. it spoils the movie. And there are many other awkward scenarios, such as heroes returning to London by helicopter and not realizing that the zombies had filled them up before they flew over him. <br /> <br /> I could continue the great length of these holes in the plot, but LIFEFORCE is really nice to watch until you use your brain. It's nice to see a sci-fi horror film of the era, when aliens were portrayed as cute creatures that the children hid in their bedrooms so that nasty adults could not reach them. The special effects and pyrotechnics are very, very good, they have a lot of action games and stunts, and in LIFEFORCE there is one of the most memorable aliens in the image of the cosmic girl. When talking to men about LIFEFORCE, they always say that they “saw an alien in LIFEFORCE? She can suck the life force out of me at any time. ” No wonder, if you look at the demographics of votes, that this film is more popular among men than women. <br /> <br /> “Don't worry. A naked girl can't escape from here.” Isn't she? Pity <br /> <br />
