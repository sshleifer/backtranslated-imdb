Because of the early release of this show, I never understood why until recently I read the story behind the series. I felt that this show never received contributions as one of the greatest shows, this show is iconic in nature and deserves a film that he always had to have, if not with the original team A, at least with the actors included in the storyline. line or a long cameo, perhaps at the end, commemorate the late Colonel Hanibal Smith (Preppard). This cast has given so much to bring happiness to us, growing up, that they deserve another breakthrough, although the fact that the show ended openly because they reduced the show is reason enough. This team and the cast made us understand, like children, to be one of the good guys, especially considering how the world is screwed up today, I think that a softer version should be launched, such as the original. I have already read the previews and I know that these are not plans, but if I have a direct DVD film, I’m sure I would have bought it. I really don’t understand how crazy shows get a series of finals, but this is a great show that still runs regularly today and will probably look more often than some of today's junk shows. And team A, because such shows take place in time, I’m almost sure that these detectives you know will not even remember after 10 years, so why not bring something back and not show people what resistant strength is and how these old shows are really everything.
