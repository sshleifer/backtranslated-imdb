Naturally, in the film, whose main themes are mortality, nostalgia and the loss of innocence, it is perhaps not surprising that it is rated by older viewers than younger ones. However, the film has the skill and fullness that anyone can enjoy. The pace is stable and constant, the characters are full and attractive, relationships and interactions are natural, showing that you don't need tears to show emotions, shouts to show fear, shouts to show argument or violence, to show anger. Naturally, the story of Joyce gives the film a finished structure, as perfect as a polished diamond, but small changes made by Houston, such as the inclusion of the poem, neatly fit. This is truly a masterpiece of tact, sophistication and stunning beauty.
