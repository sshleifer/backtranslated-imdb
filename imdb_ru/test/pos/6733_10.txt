I first saw this film in the night program of one of my favorite TV channels .... I was hooked from the first minute. Nothing is, as it seems at first glance, a lot of waiting, a great game from Mr. Van Diene, and I did not object to the "heat" in it ;-) ... and, best of all: a surprise ending awaits you !!!
