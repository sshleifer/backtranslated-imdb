Well, the show was a bit uneven, but I still loved it. It seemed to me that the two main bunnies were annoying, but Hamton and Pluki were always funny. <br /> <br /> I really want to release Baby Plusies episodes on DVD (or even VHS). Please let them go! <br /> <br /> In particular, the episode “Pot years”, aired on 11/22/91; episode "Going up", shown 09/17/92, and episode "Golf Minister" on 11/92. <br /> <br /> They are the funniest parts of the whole series, and even a decade later we still refer to these bits! <br /> <br /> (I have nothing more to say, please reduce to at least 5 lines and reward us for short!)
