This is an incredibly fun 80s action / exploitation rocker. Charles Bronson rules like Paul Kirsi. Villains are very bad. The soundtrack of Jimmy Page is ridiculously bad. Alex Winter (Bill of Bill & Ted) is great as one of the street punks that Bronson and his team lose. Crew? Oh, these are oppressed townspeople who team up with Bronson to retake the streets. The whole film is pleasant, the last half hour turn into a non-stop action and chaos. 9/10
