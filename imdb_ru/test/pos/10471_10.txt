French Babbette appears in the humble home of two Danish sisters, wet, cold and lonely. Fleeing from the revolution in Paris, she seeks refuge in a little-known religious community on the windy coast of Jutland. <br /> <br /> Without knowing those who accept it so generously, she is an excellent chef, a food artist. Babette gives herself to an accepted community through frugality, productivity and a common faith. She leaves only when the French lottery wins - 10,000 francs. She is returning, loaded with exotic goods, cooking one dish in honor of the birthday of her sister's father, the founder of the community. <br /> <br /> This food looms darkly in the minds of believers who deny pleasure, but its subtleties are translated by an aging military officer who, being a young man in Paris, learned to appreciate the sensual experience unfolding here. Food - the culmination of the film, the communication of love in the transient mastery of food - an indifferent exaltation about art, love and the meaning of life.
