I watched a longer version and could not take my eyes off the screen. 219 minutes passed, and yet it seemed that only an hour had passed. the characters were very believable and interesting, and the photo was excellent. the story caught me and held my attention. I will definitely watch it again and again. This true story is telling at its best ... not Hollywood's usual cheap thrill and deep skin glow. I have seen quite a few reviews of this film. most seem to pan the movie or give it a faint compliment. in fact, this is a great film that received unreasonably sharp reviews. look at yourself with an open mind. if you like westerns, historical historical plays, although historically inaccurate, you will love the movie. Superb !!! 10/10
