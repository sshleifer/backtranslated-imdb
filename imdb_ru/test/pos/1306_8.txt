Definitely worth renting! Good clean family fun. My 4 and 5 year old (and I) liked it. Kept them on the edge of their seats. I recommend that parents sit with their younger children to watch this, as this can be quite stressful for them. Often you can find movies that can be watched with children, and this is a rare find. Sometimes acting / realism is not exactly there, or maybe a little trite, but children seem to not notice or care, they love it. Parts are predictable, while others are not - as an attempt to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. The film has no really scary / creepy things, and therefore I doubt that it will bring nightmares to the children. It inspires children to dream, and this is what we need to encourage and encourage our children. Rent and be blessed!
