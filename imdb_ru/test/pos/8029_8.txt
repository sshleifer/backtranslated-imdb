As soon as I found out that Donald Sutherland (Jack Shaw / Henry Fields) appears in this film, he immediately told me that this would be a good picture to watch. Most of Sutherland's pictures are full of action and expectations, and he can play a rather cruel character, as well as be quite charming and kind. In this picture, Jack Shaw tried his best to be a good guy and a bad guy, teaching the naval office to become a spy who had to change his personality and become a different person overnight. There are many scenes of chasing a car and a lot of stunt situations that I wouldn't want to perform. This naval officer lived in fairly close contact with his wife and was a father, but you will never understand this fact until the film reveals his terrible secrets that he had to hide from his family and friends. A good spy movie and a great acting game of all the actors.
