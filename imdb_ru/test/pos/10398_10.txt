Here is another Antonioni, which will be opened again and again as soon as it comes out on tape or DVD. I saw it a few months ago when it was launched for the first time (even in the Los Angeles metropolitan film studio!) For several weeks and then disappeared (the art house audience seems to have chosen its own special territory, where older favorites like Antonioni ) and Resnais are only welcome as random curiosities. <br /> <br /> At first I was disappointed, I thought that the pace was unbearably boring, and that the person lost the chance (for many years Antonioni had difficulty finding funding) in his old age to add another masterpiece to his canon; but knowing Antonioni for who he was and how I initially responded to the explosion and the Passenger, I refused to judge until I watched the movie again. I came back the next day, and I shouldn’t have been surprised that the film continued to attract me, making me realize the things I was thinking about, and lost track of my life, driving home, in a modern setting, the items exposed to For the first time, about forty years ago, in “L'Aventurra”, creating an atmosphere with subtle moods, so characteristic and fascinatingly alienable by tone (and actually quite comedic) that I could not get enough. The scene with Malkovich sitting on a bizarre multi-colored swing on a windy beach, with beautiful silver weather and the Eno / U2 track in the background, proceeding at its own pace, was my favorite; it was still there, but now the whole movie was just as great! What a strange phenomenon, a complex simplicity or an invisible complex, which, it seems, only Antonioni's eye is able to catch and communicate. Strangely, although at first glance it looks like erotic porn of some kind, and it really shows a lot of sex and annoyingly gorgeous Sophie Marceau and plently other international stars to distract you, this film is clearly Antonioni to its core, but you will not feel to what depth, until you see it several times and get used to its rhythm. For example, this is a rather funny film with a deep sense of humor, which I did not notice at first, but another critic drew attention to him, and he looked at further views with great pleasure (4 before we made it and make it) we returned for more ) If this film were advanced correctly and people were to a certain extent focused on how to approach it, I have no doubt that he would have succeeded in the circles of the art house, like most of the films of Antonioni of the 60s. But the 60s are no more, and the film will have to find its audience on a small screen, where half of its beauty will be lost even in the DVD version with boxes (if and when it comes out). I urge all cinema fans, both general and esoteric, to watch "Behind the Clouds" and add some of the magic to the tragic.
