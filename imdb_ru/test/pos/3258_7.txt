"Two Hands" is a fun Australian gangster film, shot in a really hot Sydney. I bet the tourists never assume that Sydney and Bondi will look like in this movie: all sweaty bodies, oppressive night time and gangsters in nylon shorts and jandals. Heath Ledger plays an amateur boxer, seeking to become part of the local gang of the boss of Kings Cross. He looked quite gorgeous in his wife's green rim and blue patterned budgie. Sweaty tattooed body really becomes him. I always kept him as a boy "Home & Away", and he was in that soap, which sweats a little, than "Neighbors" with Weetbix. The film is really worth seeing, as it combines sardonic humor and vile violence. It is expected that the drowning scene will soon cause me nightmares. Totti rewards: the village girl adores the interest of the city brother and the tattooed streetkeeper.
