This superb movie starring Elizabeth Montgomery is long overdue as a DVD. The same can be said about her earlier, also an excellent film "The Case of Rape." I can only hope that my comments will encourage some kind of adventurous soul to put BOTH Elizabeth Montgomery on one DVD, which will be available to many fans. For example, I believe that the role of this beautiful actress, unfortunately, was stereotyped by her role in Bewitched, and, as a result, more serious acting roles were not granted to her. I am sure that if these two films, perhaps even the Legend of Lizzy Borden trilogy, were released as a DVD, her fans would set a record of how much they appreciate her serious acting skills.
